It 's difficult to answer the questions " What am not going to do in the future ? " if the only one who has to know it is in the mind .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a salesman and even a pitcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that public transport will always be in the future .
Nice people will buy a car , but I pooor people always need to use a bus or taxis .
I consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friends people who usually ask you to do something to be friends and change your telephone number .
In my experience when I did n't have a car , I used to use the best to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessarily when you have crashed in the street . At that moment you realize the importance of public transport .
In India we have various types of public transport , like cycle , time , far , train & plight .
Depending on the distance and duratiln to the desire pope , the mode of transport is chess accordingly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with most transport .
This reminds me of a true that I have recently been to find the place is far .
It takes around 6 hours by national highway to go from Delhi to Korea .
We have stopped at hotles to have food and , in case if one of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
Nice , we have the option to write everything we want to what we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train & night ) .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short in the back seat and wake up fresh .
For For the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 13 years old .
I am going forward to joining us in this year sumner csmps .
I love children , and I enjoy working with them . Also , I organized many sports activities before in school .
In addition to eating , I enjoy cooking .

My favourite sport is volleyball because I play with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport played everywhere . When I travel on the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and after that we go to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young , I liked play with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you about some advice on travelling by working in my country .
In addition addition , in my country there are a lot of places to travel to .
For example , Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful victims because there are a lot of things to view . For example , in Madrid you can visit " Puerra dep Sol " , " Las Cibeles " .
I have visited Madrid twice .
All summer I visit Seville because I hope this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jlb because the economy is very old .
But , if you want , I look for a lot from you .
My best friend is looking for a person responsible for looking after the setter .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after her every weekend .
Am I interested in this job ?
Thank you for your e - mail . It was wonderful to hear from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
Public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resources allocation in mass transport system .
Also , people need to suffer while operating because they run their own car .
But it can be a cheaper way to go to their destination , especially if it is a way for me .
For example , I think that it is affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane to travel to another country .
Instead , it will be common to buy a bus ticket and ride on public transport .
I think that public transport in the future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future . People are going to the mark the cars than buses or underground .
If we think about it and all is better because we do n't need to eat on them when we are waiting for the bus or underground or on another , cars cost more money than public transport .
By car , we can not stop by ourselves . . The car is good because we can listen to the uses that we use and we do n't need to find people that are down gut . If we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so no transportation awre good at the cars do n't be necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
If I had to choose between both transportations , I think I would probably choose cat , because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecolobical things .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost in the last garden , with worms always eag and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have special rrashcans to separate the garage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and bottles and the false mads tawlks and presemtations about the environmental problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project was last June and , our Science teacher .
These initiatives have made us all over the world a decognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone . Today I want to share Scout is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football . When do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport . People around the world will give it so much ! Especially lije Barclay Premiker Leqgue , high Premier , Wprld Cul and so on .
I believe that 's and will depighted us .
By the way , my favourite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant , they have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little air when he had a great that is : Be a super heart !
After many years , he will dream of becoming a hurry .
He ernter the University of medicine because he thinks that this profession would be more similar to being a hero .
After some years at university and he met a girl called Kate and he got load on her and she was loved in mind .
Kate was closing the University of Fashion ,
Then we started to date .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day that Michael had his dream of being a paper geek . He hated it so nervous , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream and that Michael was not dreaming and that it would never happen in the use hero do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and was very mad , saying that he was lying . He n't have hurt .
He got so mad that he used leads to get out of his apartment .
In the following ray , he said sorry and they were happy again .
But when they went to one of Michael 's rights again and Michael got a nice koll het .
He tried to win a lot blokd arkund .
Michael got a room there .
Micheal closed he did and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a lot of benefits to our lives .
For instance , we fake subway in order to avoid smoking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than using public transportation . However , it would bring more change to your life and to our environment .
Therefore , we must think more about our future , our offspring .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be serious .
In my country , Taipei , we are always stuck in traffic to get to the club in the morning .
I can imagine if there was no bus or MRT , so I will take your school .
The method is convenient for humans , but it causes damage done by humans past .
For example , carbon dioxide in Munich is created by cars .
It causes global warming , which thraets our environment and harms our daily life .
We can say that the area is serious and frequently disasters happened in decades , such as typhopon , hurricanes , wild flowers and kud slie .
What other precautionjs are usually taken ?
The " Office " is noticed by car photographdr when the film is tripped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipmsnts have been found more easily when this process started away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people love .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad , but , what 's the best way to do an international trip ?
The most important option for travel is , by car , the plans .
But , even when it 's true that it 's and faster cotton , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
If you 're looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a variety of things to do and enjoy the train .
However , the better option is a team .
There is n't comparison with watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best sport , the cheapest way to get away from cars and go the routine . Some days .
Anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many knids for transportation . We travel by , but in the near future there will be comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport from north to shout in less than on this will make business men hppy anr comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we have that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern society it is the same : lots of friends and our daily lives .
I promise the cold will not end without co - operation .
Friends can communicate and exchange new ideas , feelings and funny things that are happening around us .
More importantly , many parents have fun livid and the knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , families play an important role in daily lives .
The reason is as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could hear you to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to have a meal from our parents .
Secondly , the families could give you advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficulty were told to the families , the sea would come up to your files and communicate with you about how to move the situation .
All in all , in this case , the fairies are the most important friends in our lives .
Comouting technology has been advancing very much these past years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and having the difference between old and use computers from even more to less development .
As we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the one computer . Old computers were much bigger than new computers .
Old commuters used to occupy the entire Orloj . Now , they only have one bus , even the age of a lot .
You can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to many places to visit .
Old computers only let you do tests , or even play simole glasses with 2 colors ( green and white ) , but not so . can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videos , writing or reading a book , object to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Cpmputing Technology , and it only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new competing is the internet , where you can access other computers , dowjload stuff , etc . His Ethernet cablw or Qireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .
The best .
I went to the Abanhdon house starter to think about the best way to make his wife miserabpe . I spent the next 2 weeks looking for days to have his sugar .
As I did n't find the kitchen , I went to the place where he lives and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he talked about . So , as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house so i decides to follow them to the house and i fork out he was dating a girl who might be in girkfrien so i fonally gotx an idea , i wohld driv him crazy fast as he did with me , the way she will think he had problems on his mind and let him , but on i thougty abkut it again and realized that if i did the sheets will try to help them and they will be more united , so i decided to drive their body cxrazy almoat at the border of Bath , but as he did with me !

I 'm not able to with this odea completely .
On the one hand , travel by car can really much more convenient as time the chance to to be independent .
On the other hand , , traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .

Public transportation has been for meeting people and over the years it is becoming cheaper and more cars , but some people prefer as to an extent we are not and what is or weapons for that is that are we going to demonstrate in this essay
In 40 years , there was nothing considered public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those days it was a hot , even good facility to move from one place to place and that is because they had no companies to build cars . In about 10 years , cars tradeing became viabel and also become very supported by having our own cars at the beginning the face a lot of problems nut They were able to solve it by the end
Nowadays , all facilities for traveling are convenient , from cats to even trains and olanes People people prefer cara because they do like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper , but Tom . another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster , but when it comes to travelling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to see the real exoerience xnd to enjoy more by chioling outy from crowded places
To summary , it is different from one news opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it and more than the car . caxrs will disappear qnd will no longer be used
The pie utself explains the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This coclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies are exponential growth in their sales cigure and with low - budget private cars in the picture , dcenario ddrastically changed in the last 10 years .
The development of the giodiesel industry will be a contribution to prodctivity growth .
The scale of investment was boring for biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it more economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Groas Doimestic Producf ( M.P ) .
If you are living in my town or small it does matter . One thing that should be done more by the people and organizers of the town is the environment .
Global warming is a huge issue in today 's date .
The government should take immehse actions to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However , we the people have a really important part in making it worse .
Active and governments understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment for their people .
Recycling a van is a good step to start with a clean and safe environment which is perfect and promptly taking a car to my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home with the use of prvoince gocernment .
People do not realize that cuttinb the trees reduces the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breathe .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and those under 18 years old and provides a few sessions of them or presentations to increase the awareness of a clean , safe , fresh environment in the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest our neighboring cities take part in the learning environment so deny it can be used in what country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football .
In our school or village football stadium I spend a lot of the time very shy .
Usually I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I than 1 - 2 kilometers and my legs get power and my body gets an enemy .
The team has a part - - time working coach and he gives professional advice to us on how to improve our football skills .
His mom said : '' You must work and work very hard , if you want to get rid results " .
I can see , they are both experienced people .
Not so long ago , we had a competition .
The first place is going by us .
We have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , in the future , I will be a famous football player , such as Skhatwr or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to advise someone who starts this sport : '' You must believe in yourself " .
Hello my friend ,
That 's up ,
How are you ?
How was the young boy today ?
It 's really nice to your expressly e - mail yesterday .
You secret that we were n't there with me . I 'll try to describe everything precisely , because I know that you very
Dear Paul ,
I have been put once in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK , so I could be a very good teacher of English .
Although I came to Spain ten years later so I could speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
Also , I sister to a small coirse fir 4 years when I was young .
It is a lot of tie ago . However , I will keep the ehthym in my body !
By the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other baplet - course meters . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n't forget it because I felt wonderful .
All the members congratulated me , as well .
On the other hand , I took care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
You must know that I 'm a very responsible and funny person .
This makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or he hobbu foe me !
I hope to help in my candidature because I 'm not going to disappoint you .
Best wishes , Julia 's
In my opinion , public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because if everyone could afford to be their own cat .
Besides , there are lots of low income people who ca n't get their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What does " Family " mean ?
In my opinion , family is one place where your best friend comes hell early to know each other .
In Taiwan , most people have to the case of their parents when they are old , but the point is that if you can not survive , I think you do n't have enough money to make your career .
Talk about the topic , I do n't know the members of my family . I do n't trust them , honestly ,
I like New Zealand because there are many islands .
By the way , New Zealand has cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I offer all of how to go there and help them enjoy and have a try at their own food .
You can also buy a lot of gifts , like a key chin , a statue , or what most memories like before returning to Malaysia .
I was not able to go to New Zealand , but believe me , it is a very beautiful place .
If I gave sustensnce , I would go there and bring any of you .
I live in Lentino , a small city in East Sicily .
The local Coucnil does a project for the environment .
People collect different kinds of rubbish and throw them together in Baek .
Although the council has begun to do something , the people are n't comitted with the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where people throw fries , kitchens , " amianto " , food or furniture .
What a pity .
The suburbs of Kentini could be wonderful .
There are orahge rrees , a large cake and tea in the background .
When I was a child , I made a lot of friends and they were very important to me .
We never played in the park or talked about our tasks , music . Now , we laugh a lot of ...
But when I was a teenager I began to live in situations that I did n't like . . For instance , the girls said me bad things or they bad about me .
In the years I lived there , events in my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 50th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my pay ; I think that this day is one of the first parts of my life .
One night I tried because I went out I had no friends .
However , my parents believed that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and invited all my cousins and together we went to Pisza and gave me a lot of presents .
At the moment , I thought that my best friends as my parents and sister .
I know that the river talks bad about me .
So , my husband is my best friend .
He is the most important person in my life .
He has never been with me .
Also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
not want to travel around the world , want to do more sports , for example , tennis , running or trekkimg .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserta too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially David , my husband .
The lives of people around the globe are becoming butter and each day .
A busy life always competes to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation systems behind motor cpu .

This technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think the difference is our lives respect regardless of our parents or our parents ' parents . example , my parents did n't do facts on TV , because there was n't any TV on work when they were young.butf it is n't the alone differnece : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer key at least one intwrnet.our grandparentz woubd n't imagine a strange mavhine like computer in their life .
Although the best personal vehicles , like cars , are now popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowaady , people use fossil fuels as the lost important source of energy is travelling , manufacturing . The source of energy does n't always remain in the constant lover , but someday it will run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources , like nuclear electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro or that kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy , travelling long public will become much cheaper than a personal car .
The range of public services will be extended to remote areas , it will become much more convenient .
Commutng , travelling using public services will be the first plrior challenge .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , almost all cities in the world will become overcrowded . It will lead to say there are problems to be solved . example , traffic jams , serious pollution .
In Despite of oerespectives , these problems are caused by the use of personal vehicles .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time in traffic jams or to hradually kilping themselves for breathing pilluted .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Each person could practice savinjg qhen using the source of event to protect his own life .
In conclusion , invesfments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services for travelling have a bright potentiak and dance in the future ca n't be replaceble
Hello Alex , you to you .
I do free for wicked , and you ant peaks .
Me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
If you are interested , find me at 8 o clock near the cinema entrance .
The yo Uelen ofr those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these types of book .
I went to the temple in the morning followed by lunch at one later in the evening when to the best .
In conclusion , it is evident that because reveloping countries are facing political and economic instability , mkgrants trsvel from better education prospects and shape the environment for younger generations to grow up .
The effect of brain training is that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs . Economic stability is affected as a result of the lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of brain - but should be packed into international and national leaves on a broader dimenswions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on building up the infrastructure and environment to support the public in a positive way .
There is n't too far oxyfen at the one of Everset to breathe easily .
Morgan Romefo bas gpt 13 when he climbed Everest in May 2010 .
Most of Everest is so hot it is very difficult to climb .
Time was reached for the first time by car climbers in 1900 .
My friends and I , we take a programme of TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer a .
Sometimes we go to parties in the city . I go to parties with my friends .
They listen to music and can hear her sing .
It 's very good at
Jason is my friend . He is drunk and also dances with his friends .
Jose is the best song . He sings and talks in the party .
The reason is English , he does n't dance in all places .
He prefers study in his time .
Hello Something .
My name is Even and I 'm 14 years old . I live in Germany .
At the moment I am visiting the Secondarg modern Cool .
I 'm in grade 8 .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example , there is a girl in my class . She is beautiful .
I love his appearance .
Her eyes look like the sun .
But she ignored me .
I hope I forgave her .
Run for your life
My favourite sport is true .
I like to rfunning fast so fast in fact that it makes me as if I am running on air and the trees do not gardly touch the ground between the strips .
My favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to do sportive tpo .
I like the ground under my feet is soft , so it is not the third concrete of the footpaths in the city .
The fastest advice I can give to someone who is starting running is to start slow and not to run too fast , but then to eventually build up the running fee by week so that every week you are used a little to further in a little faster at them after 20 years all will be an Olympix hcampion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about Eorld Wr Ond .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television .
If you 're watching Dos & Jerry , it will have efucational value .
Although now , you argue that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie problem happened he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead gor spme tims nkw - so in his eyes , he learns how ( not ) to act in the situation .
Today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a fkrensic bjologist and I really love my CV .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimultaing and , even if it is not all redmunerated , I see myself satisfied .
In the last few years , forensic biology as developed by aspecta ilke bettfer senzibility , robustneds of results and we are required to anslyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : does television offer high likelg opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe televisiokn cover brings entertainment and educational benefits .
It does how many educational programmes have broadened young children 's horizonz in the last few years . Quickly , an adult learns different basics from a great number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It is also not educational programs make a decision on what citizens will know in the future and that knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational news , there are so many contests , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tel right from wrong .
However , I believe that educational programmes on TV will play a vital role in educating both adults and children .
I think the best restaurant we can go to is " The Sailor 's restaurant "
Here we are at typical Italian food .
The last time I was here I ate the best pizza that I have ever had in my life .
The atmosphere behind the theme of the day is on the wall and decorated with a lot of herself and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , it 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit together at the same time .
The owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience trice .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheapest way of travel , so it has a future .
Currently , most people are used to using the town to get to work or to go shopping , because it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute man with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject , they would n't use their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all , you need to afford to do it . After that , you must pay for the asjrance , councio tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on .
Whereas on public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive the bus or train or whatever vehivle you use , it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has four . Most people , I future , will have one .
I 'm an employee , to serve in your company .
very pleased to be able to receive your salary pavement .
I am a little older .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring the students completd summer homework , collecting homework diligently assisting the instructor , and the instructor helped organize hahdouts , instead of the instructors to answer questjons by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , every age , but I have nothing to complain about .
I worked hard for two months , paid a lot .
But your pay paid too much lower than I expected . I want a little higher salary , payment of 300 yua more than the existing basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport . The government had to all the public transport , for example buses , trains , metro and more , for only one reason : the quality of life and then pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for searching for packing and the low cost of fuel , and also maintenance .
In this city , public transport works well because there 's a gold feedbzck by people .
Instead , in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport companies , it 's not convenient to invest in Bones , because fewer people would use them .

Hi , .
Thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
As for your question , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotri " Maan " uzakaya " .
That is because you will improve your Japanese skills with them .
Recently , South East Adians have studied Japanese in Japan while writing in her .
By improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
He was at Ssrah 's house when suddenly he felt full set bathropm dirty and went to get worse .
So he went back to Laura 's house and cleaned the bathroom . Bug Searah already knew that he had a free bayhroom , so before Michael entered the bathroom he said : " I know what you left there " and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
My school is located in the center of the city in Bangalore , India .
My school has a unique reputation for their friendliness to the quality of education .
I love my math teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
Good Morning !
This is an easy about my favourite sport . I have been swimming since I was a child because slways ennoy a lot and , what is more , I did it once . I never refused to go to the swimming pool and was in summer , of course .
I do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or solar teajs dports , and say I go alone It is n't bring told me . Furthermore , I prefer to win alone because nobody bothers me or I do n't want anybody .
I said that because when I was even , my best friend had been operated on and before the operation he came with me every day . I had to care for her because she spends a lot of time in the shower clraning her long hard . I have that !
Luckily the operation was in and left to come with me , and from that day I go to my town .
She is a relaxing exercise for me as normal . There are n't many people at the door . Sometimes there are children and I do n't mind so much because they like dfisturbing me and sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommend it to people who do n't know want to learn , because I am pretty sure that it is like a pave can stop swimming .
I think that fence is a car for self - expression .
It 's not just a hobby , it 's more than this is
Danube is a passion , a type of life .
When I 'm dancijg I forget all my problems , except my study companionbs that they do n't understand anything .
But it is another theme for speaking .
When you date , sing , or out of a showinb something to the public , something that 's important to you .
If dance is your passion , you practise every try , and you 'll practice all day until you can .
If you are tired , it does n't matter , because you like what you 're doing .
I 'll get up early to go dance , or do dance lessons .
It does n't matter if you go to see it later , or do n't see ...
That 's a job , you must sleep .
If you dance , you 'll understand me .
members of my family .
I love my family , especially my little sister . He is sixteen years old . I consider her my best friend because I usually tell her everything about my life .
I have a dog . Its name is Cheap . It is a wooden retriver .
It 's a lower dog , he knows how I jeep .
My oldest sister 's name is Cinthya . She is really word with me .
Our relationship is not good because she is so different from me .
As I have a brother . His name is Jose . He is twenty years old . His personality is dynamics and funny .
My mom and my dad , they are good guns .
Actually , prefder pass my life Elle , I am working in the town , so I stay away from my family .
I am in my 30s .
Kate Ashby ,
How are you ? I hope you are well .
Working in our life you have to speak English , of course . Maybe you know how to cook some types of sweet food like cupcakes , cars , cookies or hrownies , the most popular food of this year .
Another thing that you must know is not to deal with people . We are searching for someone who would impress everyone , all someone was an big the customers to tension and service .
We are both ready for more hugs , because your cafe is going to open every day .
That 's all , so you soon
Kisses ,
I
We think that in the future we will all be in different conditions and the rules will disappear . After that we will be having weds .
In my tears we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food . On the other hand , in the north none will have mewlted totalky .
The temperature wikl has become crazy because of global warming , so some people will die because natural disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars will be playing by streets and computers which have totally changed .
Because of them , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the packet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
Hope to make friends with most people ?
It is easier than you think .
But ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If your friendship is real , you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend 's one .
Just try , it wo n't cost so much !
Good day ,
My name is Fun and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , volleyball and one of the most beautiful sports ever . I have to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 . The reason for my enjoymkent with this sport are as follows :
1- makes me fit and healthy .
2- Classy gave no fricgion between players .
3- It exercises the muscles of your body
Regarding the above , I advise all rookiss to start doing this sport and they will get many benefits .
However , adults ca do it as well and they will not to him .
As citizens of villages , we finally care about the environment of our village .
Every Monday , we do a natural coopration which anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves .
We do dirty finch , sweep rubbish , then we bury rubbish .
This , we recyling ionrganic rubbish too .
or inorganic , we can have bags , hats and other stuff .
When they can help the au income .
The rceator of the haven and the earth , the creator of hours , I was the main earth rotae around self and around the sun .
What we relief as Musoims that we have created by one who does n't have other with his face , one who created his father ( Adam ) and read frim hjm ( new ) and they were in the Paradose and instructed to not eat from the area but te Satan decwive them so they thought to the more and generations can for them an ad set the prophet amd messengers ( loser , Jesuw , Mohamed , others .. so that worship the same time ) with Miracles ans wvidence of the truth , to guide and people to know how we will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise adn aho follow ofher paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the best in this short life .
Transportation is at the heart of any city , whether it is public or private .
Nowadays , people prefer their own vehicles rather than
Public transportation . Day by day , folks are more crazy about their own vehicle , which leads to the future of public transportation .
First . I agree with the given statement that there would be tough times for public transportation in her cultures . People want privayc as well , which is quite impossible on public transportation .
The second mode of transportation covefs
as much as possible in city area or town which mismanaged routes who travel by public transport . As a consequence , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I see that there are famous modes of transportation available .
to competition with public transportation .
Nowadays , there are numerous others to travel , like a private company .
which plays an important role in giving tough competition to the government . As a result of this , customers have more benefits like lower fares , private , freedom and travelling . In addition , many automobile companies pauncing affordable prices which encourage people to use more and more private vehicles .
I go walk every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I met many people in the park .
I never thought about it , people got so many of them .
The car in the park is very busy even though the car is huge !
Some people are very friendly , same as the job .
But when people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to the dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
Every member has his own role and his boss , but one or the other , had to under his tram to understand the right brhaviour or attitude to have both life .
Usually there are generation problems , so I do n't understand parents and others . I use dictionaries and listen to articles and fafts . Everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to one to underline lifts in social behavior but also listen to others ' points of view to co - arrange and donate their knowledge .
A mother or a later , be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone loves his cousin on family dates .
Recently I saw the thriller Mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see the movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies to understand it .
The first movies are amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance ,
The man of this series has been wanting fpr from mofie Science since the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is in a family , because it is hard for little kids to understand . In opinion , I think it is made a teen cove .
I think people will like this movie because it is very similar to the story of the body ; this mode of the first movie is really based on the book . The theme is very unique and original , so the actors in the first movie were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will you diuble effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the car or mokingjay !
My favourite sport is Karate .
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practice I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day , I can relax by doing karate , because it 's the kind of sport that is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to get tour problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage with other sports .
Apart from that , Karate is not just a sport , it is also a discipline . It teaches you respect , balance the culture .
My teacher showed us how we have to beat withj ithers and he taught us a lot of things about Japanese culture .
For someone who starts Karate , it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to concentrate on what he or it is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today 's topic is technology .
Nowadays , we use technology in every kiting , from medications to making clothes . We use technology everywhere and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development and today genrration is influenced by that technology that they have stopped doing other activities .
Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition . He liked the day , so he decided to go to Peter and the competition .
but there was a week left to join the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he had a lot of friends who could meet him .
He phoned me and asked me to meet him at home to register . competitions .
He told her money On the second day , he finished the registratipn and started writing the body after a long time writing and did well . He went to give his story to the international students magazine office . He found a notice on the door saying that the competition was canceled , he came back by car and told me what happened Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution of our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chefs for me .
On the other hand , in the future , maybe we will have a bus which has chairs for everybody and I wo n't have to stand up .
Another transport mode is a taxi , like a car . It is so much more comfortable but it is more expensive than the bus or train .
The " or Aeroplans are a great option for long trips .
In conclusion , in the future , children will have a bus so it is more comfortable .

Dear Sir Dimada ,
I am writing about a problem in my city .
I love the big cities in Greece .
In my city , all schools and some walks of buildings are full of ratings and writing .
The vandalisme in parks has increased a lot .
Unfortunately , we had to somebody to not draw the walls , they did n't hear us .
Now our city is very bad because when some new people visit Pqtras in the same year .
Panda is a very beautiful city and for the future , and I had monuments .
As to see the abaser thin ?
After we have the beautiful city , we have to maintain her .
In my opinion , the police should stop the Vandalisme .
If it had place all around the city , nobody would dare to do a grdaffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something about that problem .
Yours faithfully ,
Jsesyka Stavrox .
All around the world , pupils are waiting to finish school .
She was eager to begin a new life as an adult .
But when they reach the in - between period , confused feelings dross their mind .
As a rule , after the last exam , they do n't know what university to choose .
What he will do in the future is like a fog .
In this way , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
First , it 'll allow young people to have a Just after the first and work study oeriod .
TV or eleven years at school make the first , even pupils do n't notice it .
I think the second education is a very important step , which needs serious attitude .
Secondly , such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sports .
Also , they would have an opportunity to be involved in volonfier activities .
And thirdly , they might look to earning more money or travel .
This year 's holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting my pet course of education .
One year is not a long time .
I venefits after year I will be obvious .
I live in Miguel Almologan . This is a village in the municipality of Apmoloya de Juaerz in the stage of Mexico . Care of the environment is very important and in my village we do different activities in case of this .
People follects teash of their houses and what the trash truck that carries the waste to a landfill located inside the village .
Also , people go there to correct the truth that there is on the kioisk , the church or in the principal places in the village .
Dear Sir ,
I am interested in improving my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible to date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
Secondly , I do n't live in work , so it would be great if you could send me details of the accommodation you offer in the course .
And also , you give me an idea of how much it would cost very different options ? .
It would be useful if I could have many other students , because it is a good way to learn a language as well .
Lastly , let me know if I need to pass any level that before skating .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully .
Ala .
After looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening to the conversation of his new neighbours .
They are planning to do a very precious thing from Mueeum Tuesday .
He does n't have much time to prove their play and he could n't wait to let it happen .
It is his own car . It was not put in to save the dorm 's history .
He called the police and informed them about his neighbours ' robbeyr plan .
Polish reached Muweum and caught the thieves .
I believe that there is no future for public transport . Teams are not confident and low expenses also to decrease the carbon gases which affect the ozone . People should be aware of the effects of using public transportation on the environment and environment . Governments should encarge the people to use the other ways of transport , the subjects shapl be issue in all merit to learn a encrae tfhe peoole to me he erigth way to transport .
Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you and sell .
I 'm writing because I told you about my last summer holidays .
I want a horse .
I started about one was in the note my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Mewndro del Meters .
It is beautiful .
In the past , a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot and at the end of the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
On the wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
The wedding was in the morning , and in the afternoon we went to the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garage and there was a park , all night .
You should visit Hurrem . It is a beautiful city .
There are a lot of things .
The people are very nice .
English is an international language with meanings important for the modern world .
In China , English is considered to be a foreign language with many students choosing to learn it .
They begin to study English at an early age .
The use at least one hour to learn English a day .
Even kids in kindergarten have been learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , so English is essential nowadays .
In addition , some people think English is superioe than Chinese .
In my opinion , though English is of free significance , English is , after all , a foreign language .
It is hard for people to see me .
English does help us read English original work , but Chinese helps us learn time Tina .
Only by characters Chinese literature dan sends off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , special ink classic culture , the first thing is to learn its language .
Because we are bright , why do we get up and other tonbue qnd kearn our own cultures through foreign languages ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Wooylpools .
He is tall but comfortable and famous for its bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a speciallist of all . It 's a car restaurant .
In my opinion , the restaurants can be better . expect to eat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I expected to be more famous , Peter and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place . It is a group that people in cities , and I Spacey , that is very small for lots of people .
In life we have many things that make us happy and many , but life goes on .
For example , a person or a is especially if it from your best friends .
Once , I got sick and started at the general hospital , and my friends gave me a flower .
It was my favourite flower I have seen .
In my town we created a small organization to more healthy environment , but touch and to be attractive . The citizens in the town must participate in this . The city will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and when rubbish is in the correct place and clean trees and play were of it .
I agree with the other option that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
It is terrible to have a person behind you all the time , you to have a lot , not peace , but happiness .
In addition , akl pearsons have the right to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless , people spend their time hiring a pity , all the time , when they are driving , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever sky , if they stay with something important .
This is terrible . You do not have privacy even though society has a place , because if they do n't have a photo , it will the lives of famous people .
So that , politicians will try to support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then hear what they learn .
This is hard .
Good morning .
How are you ?
Come here .
It is Hoa .
But in the room .
She is in her 30s .
Let us all .
Let us please Carda .
Let 's sleep .

Let me also in to your cabin .
Forgive me .
During that you .
During the toss of water .
Drnik water .
Fast food .
But .
For shooting , do n't wear a shirt .
Let us with .
Once upon a game , one was a little bit cold , Tanny . He was really small in coping with the other .
He had to be like that because most of the bus lanes had tons of time until one day something horrible and indvitable happened .
It was a dark night it was raining until a big ative vklcano explosion buried them in the underground .
All of that fried to find a way you ! , but no one could find one ... they started to go panciked !
People just started to evaluate it rapidly until it became a big earthquake ...
Jenny was also swimming . The only thing that he could do was to wait and keep calm .
Until we can , all of them go out , so they store until they find a refuge .
Everyone wanted to witness the week , but no one found anything .
Like the very religious ants , they prey on the hatred of ancestors so they can be her in a big deal .
Something that they do not as if the whole thing is a movie !
So all my olanned ...
The actors , monitors watch the ones the time .
In my Lenny discovered it and he went to give it to his queen . The queen knew that she was very confused , but at the same time she got mad and she wanted revenue .
So there is a plan to fisplay all ...
The next day we get there , but to start first there are no ants , so they teach you them , but they ca n't find them ...
At that moment , he ants and they attack them in these racks , taking them to leave the place .
The art wins the car and they expand its habitat to the studio .
No one ttack them again and the time hsppily evrr aftrr !
I have many favourite sports .
One of them I 'm keen on playing is basketball . I always spend more time playing it .
I usually play basketball at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at university , I go home and I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing must that I have already finished all of my work before I play my favourite sport .
Basketball has many benefits , not for me but also for everyone .
It makes me feel relaxed and unwound .
Besides , it also helps me keep in half a good body shape .
I really a
All about playing it .
When I have some time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball matches on television .
I often play basketball at the studio in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it at the team sports centre .
I went back home and gave a speech when I finished it .
Basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's seasons . Basketball is my favourite sport .
With the swseping porogress of development and the booming of the population , agricultueal land , forests and often been used to destroyed to build more construction and transport netowrks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring drawbacks to the environment or even humans and animals .
To start with , eating a wide range of problems , may lead to the phenomenon .
Convincing arguments in support of this root cause is that almost all cities are ready packde with places of residence , commerce and recreation and , in the end , xvailable housing developments are increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people cpntinues waste mire agriculture and waste in order to satisfy all their needs , which will disobey the ecosystem diversity in bidoiversity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems being mentiomed , various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with the problem , reducing building xonstructure from now on , playing one tree instead .
Suwtainadle development should be awaness to all man and start to waste the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant problem and problem would be workedd out to solve before I work in the government have to fake their responsibility .
Nowadays the language is very important , and more English .
This is my first time studying English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never learnt so well since I decided to go to London one time to learn this language .
I have taken their decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did n't have any level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity I said yes .
The car is n't the best way to transport , because it produces mucn pollution . However , public transport is better for making a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
Nowadays , in the cities , there are many possibilities for public transport , like buses , trains , subways . These options are more economical than the day . The problem of the car is that it can be occupied by a person . When the car is prepared for to care for or five people .
The situation creates pollution for the environment , so we have some cohscience for private health .
I want to do something about the awarding of the English Language . is hard to get to me for the best reasons :
The first region ; the grammar ties the learner , beaches or institute teeth , is like Spanish language , my native language .
That I want to say , it is very difficult to understand the conjuntin of the vet 's in Spanish language . Just imagine the same buying in your native lentuaje .
second season . In the English syntasis , the structure for construction of paragraph or sentences , the Red is written before the subject , but not always . Which is the full ?
Is she alone ?
The reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic about the game .
My favourite team is Lydia because I belong to this country .
In India , I pecrent people follow cricket .
In 1898 , India 's cricket team won its first world cup and that changed the direction of the air in favour of cricket and everyone started to follow this game .
I love this game because it is my favourite sport . I belong to .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar , known as little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow his lesson .
For instance , styles , ships , running between the wickets , everything that is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not jolly me bit also every Indian always follows Dachin fod crivket .
When he was 18 , he started playing his first game for Leia .
He is the first place is played 200 trust in cricket .
He has achievements like cars 200 in one day etc .
I have the way he played .
If he has a chance , first he has to decide what he can do better , batting or bowling .
If a person wants to come , the bowler should concentrate on running , actions , dancing and , if batsnen nbeed concentration on long and bat coordination , eye and coordination , discover some shops which become a factor in batting .
I watch videos of the best players like Sachin , Paul , but not Breadman , Garden , Wasim Akaral , great Lee etc .
As health is an important factor in every story , we all need to improve our health , syamina .
Dear Jo ,

You may have this .
I also want to introduce my friends to do , we can have fun together .
when you have played in the city , and you want to find a job here .
I can recommend you to my uncle 's company to do a job .

It may take a very long time to find a lot and you have so much time here .
You may consider my advice .
My favourite sport is sins .
It 's because swimming is really fun .
Also , I think xwim dan keeps our bodies fit and it can make people swim further cool when it is on a hot day .
The advice that I give to someone who wants to start swimming .
It is not be afraid of water , otherwise they can not learn to drip and also win the huge bottom loder it will be more difficult to learn to the list .
So they are the device that I have to them .

Waiting for your answer , order
The city I love is a small village .
by residents have great care of the environment .
Oragnized share , where everyone cleans up the village .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into auitable containers .
helping to protect our environment to make it clean and safe , in order to prevent various diseases .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one throws debris on the road .
There are several places where you can organize bonifres , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and take out all the garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to wind power plants .
Recently , and on the top of the primary school were batteries and the whole school used some electricity instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , and residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residrnts of my village try to , so that our village was clean through polljte the environment as little as possible .
Travelling in your own car is more comfortable than taking public transport . There are several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always driven to get passengers . That takes more time than expected to travel .
Secondly , the public transport route costs more than the usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and has no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of them and pocket packet .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new year and for the adventures who want to have an exciting track them to see more caution .
Like walking outside or sight looking , to single and most different people .
In addition to this , I most admire the bullet train in Japan , which you consider fast and has public vheicle union .
To sum it up , I still consider having your own car way more cars and more convenient .
Public ujless will have projects to at least reduce the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passengers .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with their decision about mineral extraction .
More details and season will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extracting these minerals will be harmful to our environment .
The aim breathtaking lights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I was her to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably disappear if developed equipment were set .
Next to go will be the extraction of their valuable minerals , which definitely leads to air pollution .
Three has been an example : the other town is polluted by the process of developing the general .
No one day deyn rhat yhe popllution ikssue is one of the most important things which should be prevented .
Last but the least , the general extractionj will turn out to be orofound inflyence , especially to the offspring .
To take my friend , Tatar , as an example , her homeland went over - developed and became an qrid place when he was a child .
After she goes up , she decides to leave us and never go back to her hometown .
In addition , he had no blithe memory of our childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the mob opportunity that it might bring to us .
Due to mineral development , many people in our hometown will probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a thought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us a promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is not crucial when it comes to health and environmental conversation .
In a nutshell , based on the reasons for instance above , the disadvantages of exrtact the valuable minerals are disadvantages .
Therefore , I do not subscribers to his decision .
Limiting cars ' role would cause the loss of food .
The fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue . Higher temperatures make the new cars melt .
The hunger we carry on our heads in our car , the water the earth will be .
I am learning English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while cars are flying .
Even if it happens , there are many people who ca n't get far , because it is too expensive , and to buy , but I feel , service and so forth .
Buses are more single - to get bug a ticket .
And the number of trains ?
I saw a train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see a blue sky and not a stream of cases like it was in the film " The Light Rlement "

My name is Chai .
I 'm 25 years old and I am from Malaysia . I 'm an energetic , cheerful , hardworking and a considerable person .
I have 3 siblings in my family who are taking cafe by me all the time . We parents are busy with their work .
During school , I liked to play volleyball and I 'm an excellent player .
We need to organise compteitions and tiurnaments with other schools .
This is my favourite sport .
During my leisure time , I like to help my parents in the kitchen .
We took varieties of food and dies .
I enjoy the party and having one hand in the kitchen .
With reference to the above , I would like to apply to summer camp . With my full commitment .
Contemporayr Qrt is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many resources and creatures .
It is well known that art curators and artists believe that Contemoorary Art is n't a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy rites of an aesthetic image or a philosophical tea , but most of the time this is unintelligible .
Luckily , the most expensive is the old , like Picasso or reading .
Nowadays , a lot of empty art piefes are good at aictions around the work , for extremely high prices .
Expetimental art has taken the world by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be possible to stop .
So now we have a choice about an ifninity of information available at any given time .
With the state , we know have an idea of how attists cretae .
The sorts dasy werew held at Kwai Xhung Sports found on 12th and 13 of November .
The weather was cloudy .
I go there by art .
I arrived at the sports center at 4:00 a.m. on Thursday . I 've been in the 00-mtere rxce .
On the first day before this sport day begins , we have an opening ceremony .
The afhletic representative paved the north and we saw the anthem .
After that , this sport day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the car 's C 100-metre tace started .
There is a funny thing when I want to the marshal .
The teacher all my names older and he told me to stand in a different place .
So I know that the way someone whose name is the same as mine .
Near the race , I was very nervous .
When I am running , I hear my hoisemates chesring and the wind passing my face .
Those fewl were very comfortable and made me feel relaxed .
Finally , I got number 10 out of 80 people .
Although it is not a great result , I 've already tried my best .
Finally , , our school announced yhe makr ghe four hours .
My house has gotten nmuber more temportarily .
I want hope and hope my house will get to the championship .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part in that inter - class play race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at ringing .
Finally , our marks got the first rujner up .
We have a difference of a second is the first of the race .
I implicated my class from working in Champion .
Finally , my house is the second runner up .
I hope my house will get a championship next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should use public transport because at present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and , unfortunately , we are harminb the environment through the world .
It is the best thing for people to go to places walking or running on the other hand , and it is healthier .
There is nothing wrong with it taking place in a car . . Obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper , but not always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is it commonly - feared that tourism is greatly influenced , not only by one aspect of one country , but by the whole world ?
Whether tourism has had a positive or a negative impact on out pieces , remains quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , tourism is a trip that enables people to travel around the world .
Alongsjde with his development , the ability to travel is seasoned to such a small heat it is now quite common to commute from our own country to another .
The existence of multinaiohals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation . Once , a traveoler was not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , plays an important part in the growth from an economic point of life .
The aim countries , such as Greeks or Bulgaria , in which they ecobmoy rely merely on tourism .
If tourism influences the economy , it thrreby affects the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . People become more careful of their hisrorcal sifes . This means pdeserving them . Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small sale , in cities , in a way which will also citizena tourists who want to teach important places more efficiently .
At a large cake , people can not travel in almost every possible place : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the development of tourism were born crises and train vacations .
One upon a time , there was a tiger who lived in a beautiful landscape with his boyfriend and for 3 dangers .
The tiegr was mom James Amanfa , 25 years old . The orders to kill her parents , because the orders were poor and they did n't have enough food to survive , so they sold them .
The Tyger 's boyfriend was a lion . Hames Nohn was 27 years old . His dad had died because of a conflict with other animals . He had an infection .
I died because some things or someone drqg her on the leg and dropped it in a cave . A few other animals at her .
They died when John was too little to remember all . He never knew what happened , so he went to all the padts and saw that even he walked and walked even in reverse , but he never found her .
The 3 daughters are so different .
The first one nsmes Amanda Jnunior lie her to bit Gym is a cheetah . . bave 9 years old how to run and she is the fastest of the family and has a lot of spots .
She is of the ones that trend to make something enforcing .
My second daughter , named Elizabeth , is a leopard . is the most intelligent of the family and the eldest of the daughters .
- 12 years old .
Another animals gave them rrwards or buses because she discovered that water is piquid .
The last daughter was Anna . was the youngest of the family is a jaguar .
We stay sleep in our bed and do nothing all day .
The parents were angry because she was the only one who had never worked .
One other animal went with a new poke her an incentive to be an athlete or make something else sleep .

Hello oils , about the question you asked me in our getter . It has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you do yoga .
Last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up your music classes .
You have classes , hence we were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in hours of free time you can still play piano without being to the loss .
This is my opinion gut the decision is yours , so why do you define it ? Please send me a letter telling me about it .
Love , one .

The most exciting day of my life . The art of June , the past year .
I had an exam .
That day I woke up early because I was nervous .
Then I realized Mwths as at home , before going to school , as at school , before beginning to read .
When I started to hear that trxcks I was agitated and I thought that I was n't able to finish and saw that test .
But when I finished before time , I was happy and relaxed .
I always aid that I passed that test and I was one of tea .
And this is true .
I passed the test .
Hello Charlie ,
I really enjoy hearing from you .
Congratulations your sister or your prize .
I would like to go to a new artists folls competition , although in my city there is n't a lot of competition of this kind . If I 'd had a possibility of going , I 'd already spent the tickets .
My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skking with me .
At the bwginn I went to the kindergarten and they taught me ski .
It was a lot of fun , because I would n't do it .
At twelev o'clock in the daytime , my parents took me with them and we drove together .
My father gave me both his kniues , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
When I was one , I could better . My dream was : '' SNOWBOAEDING " , but I should wear skiiing perdectly like my parents .
Peter When I was 16 years old , my dream got tired .
It was my first time snowboarding and I loved it .
I told every few minutes to snowboard .
The aim of the story is why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you 're driving down the wishes .
How are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
How are very happy and sometimes I find a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and I 'm lucky .
That 's why I like the center middle through the summer .
Snowboarding or spring is the best sport for everyone who wants to come to her thoughts .
Although you are all the time in nature and when you have lunch or can see animals .
It was a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to me and it is getting far .
The parents were worried and all over a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly .
Everything was dark .
She got our eyes and the first thing that she saw was a true black sk .
A car with stars .
She got up and looked around .
She was in a part of the woods where we used to go to thin and relax .
She started to consciousness although he could n't remember arrived there .
She had to walk at least 15 minutes to get from her house to take place .
The problem is the most she remembers is that she had been sleeping and then suddenly got up when the window opened in the wind .
The film seen Train , did n't she ?
If she did , how did we manage to walk until there in the sleep ?
If we had n't awake , would we n't remember anything after that ?
This situation was really frustrating , not to mention that now he had to ask for most 20 minutes to go home and talk to sleep .
She started to walk to her her mind .
He knows how to even in the dark ; he had gone to spend a lot of time , especially the most of seeks .
The development of human wind in technology is used everywhere .
In the case of transportation technology , in this twenty - first century we have various options , like planning what can fly wins the food , trains eat fast and be enough to carrt hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boat tickets are bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancient , we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I was given the option to choose between all of them , I would take a plane .
The three reasons to choose them .
The first reason is its speed , which competes to work with other means of transportation so it can travel faster .
It is trdavel thosand of milk in a couple of hours .
As a result , people can see the time .
Second is safer , because the chances of accident are less .
The lakes make it easier to travel by plane rather than train or boat .
third one is comlfort Lebel .
town is much more comfortable than both Traij and Bgoat .
In conclusion , I will say that Club will be my first choice in all of the Head of transportation .
The reason being my choice is speed , saves a comfort level that makes plant my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to warn month or travel . It would be the best award for a student who attended high school .
Young people want to discover new coal and travel on a plane which would be impossible otherwise ,
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was on the beach all afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in Guarda and his name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people at the beach .
My father was very cold and I could n't swim , so I played football in the sand the best .
I took the sub for a very long time and then I went to a cage and and I drank a refreshment .
It was a big day because I had a good time with my family .
No future for a public tranzpotr ? Is his chair or not ?
Will we see on our roads public transport in around 5 or 10 years ? What is a really interesting question
He thinks that it all depends on the development .
If we can see one , more people prefer travelling far .
Yes , I agreed . If you played by travelling for a long distance and for a long time , you would prefer to do it on her , first you ; we spend less time , so travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have an opportunity to to every whers nad flr a long time , as you need .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or a car ?
I think that this is a question for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , because someone can use public transport , and economy not only for money , but for the environment , but not people do n't like to use it . , sauce they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travel with another people .
So , in my opinion , even after 10 years , public transport will be chosen on your street with enough numbers of passengers .

Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world . You should put your body in the current cord to throw the book to the other side in fame .
I feel twelve years playing volleyball and because of it I know a lot of people . It helps me to grow up in the story of life .
When I was 10 , I chose to play with a group of people older than me . They were good , and I could n't believe the experience .
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am with my team I am in another world , in which I can be free and happy . . Apart from this , when I am bad , this is a distration of the university .
You should try practice . It so fine , but I adveritse how is not easy at first , but you have to invent many times what you should do in life .
On weekdays , I get out of my bed at 7 - te move to go to my work , which starts at 9 AM .
I often go to sleep around 12 ) .
I usually play video games if I do n't have any homework to do .
I am not a big fan of sports , so I do n't say no .
However , sometimes I do shopping to fit myself .
Michael woke up in the morning and he had one newspaper .
He held in the newspaper an interesting notice .
The noticoe is about a competition .
The competition was about crime abroad .
Michael was excited because he is a great writer and he decided to compete .
First , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirated listening for pleasure .
I began to write .
The story was very good , but Michael had no idea how to in the story .
Finally , Michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
Michael went to the story . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . He did n't put his name and address .
Yes , this TV can entertain and educate , because they eat cooked .
Also , there are a lot of educational channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because of and learn new things about the past .
Comedies are so finch , so when you 're sad , you can watch one of them .
The aim and discussions about the future of public transport .
Different experts had talked about these questions and there were so several opinions .
People like to make the freedom to move uncomfortable and for that reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport is usually restricted by the timetables and you can only use the transport at the moment that the timetable for you .
of this reason , many people do n't like to use public transport because they want to get what they need .
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the community of people will have to determinatd the important use of cars and public transport .

The advertising is evefysite .
There are as on TV , radio , buses , streets ...
In spite of the age of media , the TV continues to be the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too and adds to television . is right ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , as a lot of mentions to products or services .
There can be tired of so much advertising content but his is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be announced with a lot of messages to resort to people .
The TV is the most accesible means of communication and people can see the message in this way .
In addition , one add , there are a lot of things : one industry .
In the ad there are , for example , the punlicist 's work , the companies ' investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of things added to TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
My favourite person of the rest is summer .
Why am I makinv his choice you could can also ? I love my son and he is a good teacher .
Yes , it is true that during summer the temperature is very low and your van rarely starts in the sun because you will be burnt by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things like gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I like to go to the beach and sunbathe with my friends rather than having fun playing volleyball or running in the water of the sea !
I think those activities . her rgeenerating and they make you forget about all the awareness of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than on other days and this may make you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
The wonderful colors of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
Dear UA SUMMR CAMLS ,
I saw your advertisement in the US and I 'm very interested in the position of chipdminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a language translation degree at university at the moment . That 's why I need to work in order to do my best .
I have some experience working with children of all ages , besides I do n't do hard work and I learn quickly .
Also , I 've just for my CV cewrtificate this year , but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in my native country .
I consider myself really alive , sociable , well - organised and all patient . Therefore , I think I 'm suitable for the job as I can adapt myself easily to any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseaws plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people in a different culture .

It had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
He finally , after 5 years , won the swimming competition .
It was really important to him because he had been trained for 5 long years since he was 15 and he had n't had any achievements .
He was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
He invited all her friends and set up a party .
Tom handed me , his girlfriend , to come too .
She was really proud of him .
He was feeling out being his wife .
She wanted to be in life so far .
But he did n't love his mouth .
He wanted to be with her at the party .
He waited 2 hours for her .
He has that she is always late .
One day , the main reason he wanted to end it up .
When Mel came , she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw him , he started to run faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and tied everything .
I looked dadly at Tom , they said : " I 'm pregnant ... " and got out of this time .
He was followed by an apoligizer .
He said he was drunk ) he did n't know what he was saying .
Then he hugged her .
He said he loved her and missed Jer foreheae .
He had to stay with them because of ... his baby .
He could n't just leave him off carrying his baby !
No ! I had never awcted liks trhis .
He knew that he had to stay with me the rest of his life and get the badge .
He decided to give up swimming and started to take care of everything .
One day , we felt really bad , so Tom took her to the hospital .
He felt that something bad was going to happen .
As he was right .
He has lost a baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His wife was going to change .
Mel was crying all day and you could n't stand it .
He had broken up with Mel . It made me much more sad .
He did n't have a card .
He thought it so bad that he was more than half little human .
Living in the waves
Even if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite with which , able to do a lot of movement that is impossible while in the car , is a wonderful sort of mind .
I started to practise swimming because I was n't able to sit at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I have improved .
If you are not a good singer , you lose a big part of the pleasure of enjoying the water , not in the sea or in zoos .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to read the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trains . refuse is fairly easy and it can give a lot of satisfaction !
Your efforts will be proved by success , and you can regain it with practice .
Introduction
This sport will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
activities to kill the
As for two , it is well - known for the jagnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic finals in Cstelldefels . Many foreign or loved people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsuring on the beach or canoeing and aquatkc sking on the Olympic Canon .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I will recommend them , especially foe spots , adventurous and young people .
Other Dress to have fun
In Castellefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instinct : fresh zumba classes , beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are kibrary roup , theatres ...
As I said , those activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Jana and the beach , but the success is increasing more and more .
Recommendations
So , finally , I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and needed .
If you try the activities , you could have a great time there , in Castelldefels !

Nowadays , there are Han people that are learning foreign languages . For me , it is a good thing that some people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that use people to speak the language , so that means that people who speak foreign languages have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , it has more benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand everything without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learners the ability to step inside the mind and content of that other future .
Today , globalization means making the world with more cars . This means that , at the same time , the possibility to have contact with other cultures , for example in literature , pottery , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning a foreign language is very position on different aspects , so if you have the benefits of learning a new language , do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

The aim of this report is to evaluate both bad effects and good ecfects frlm he used in the Active Leisure Club in the last tie .
First , people in this area actually have a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities , homes which are able to creatively and effectively and are suitable for different ages .
Besides , it has enough modern facilities to see the users in the peak hours when murders are everywhere and read a shop .
However , there is only one thing that we like .
With the propose to attract more people to sit in the club , besides the good points , I would highly recommend this the world around times suitably and all these help the activities to avoid problems .
given is a diagrwm introducing the procedure of making bank notes .
design the bank notes , the first one indizpensable strp .
People should decide the background colour and the networks will have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared by both .
Usually we have 50 bank notes per sheet .
They colour will print on the bad sides and every piece has a unique ink and the image will be slightly raises .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , which is inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divide bad quality into three parts : good quality , partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets are still good , people who cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distribution the bank notes .
If I paryially daamged shests are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely destroyed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of taking a hotel .
Eventually , it seems to be easy to make them , but every step encourages people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect and not for everyone .
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE
Beginning
Everything been A few years ago , Alfred , the mayor , had an article about the importance of the surroundings in the health and happiness of people .
He started to think if he could n't matter who he loved and he found a solution .
A conhcerned populatiin
While youngsters in their time trying to get concern the eldest people from the village about the importance of care of our surroundings , middle and people took many trips around the village and cleaned the flaws of our public places , making it a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
and recycling
Local authors helped this initiative , creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with this purpose of living a new life to our waste .
The result
As a result of this attitude , since Akfred had this great idea , we enjoy some of the cleanest villages in the area .
People are worried about the future of our planet and an association that been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is alley .
We eat a happy Earth .
Hello Lyis Blanco ,
I 'm writing to you about the staff recruitment for the " Cloud generation " project .
So we need to help with some questions about the process .
For your information , we are looking for people with thfee eyars of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have high team work skills .
We also tale that they are specialised strides in Cloud technology , and posing management .
However , it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile , so , we could accept people with one gear of experience .
Is it possible to see it this week ?
What do you prefer ? ( Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n't have to move to another place .
Finally , I see how to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I told you before in that e - mail .
Please , provide me with the information as soon as possible .
Iñigo Ubeda .
Dear Paul ,
That 's up ,
Do you remember when I told you I had been killed at a concert ?
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoyed it very much .
You probably wo n't believe me , but I met a member of their band . I talked to them and we can run together . They 're very nice . Because of helping them , I said we beat each other during the concert and I have their autographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and one of the more unpleasant .
In general , the only duty was checking the quest list . hope that I had to be in the cleaning area after the concert .
But that concert was worth my work , so I hope I will be invited to the next Kent .
Working on them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other so I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
Love ,
Dominika
Report :
The aim of this sport is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your French in Madrid last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions . I think it would be worth it to take it into account of the nex course it will take place .
First , I would like to stand on the outstanding classmatrs there are in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning a subject in English .
Second , the teachers are really good sticks to watching .
They managed to encourage all of us never fed .
This way , we make the most of ourselves and never give up on improving our English level .
Third , one class scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
He helped me to pronounce wirds better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion , there would have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's head .
This way we have been able to learn a native speakers and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up , the sport just on the course is fantastic and I am looking forward to seeing it again next year .
Yours faithfully ,
In Orozco
I am keen on cinema and I love to watch all types of movies .
But , what firms are in my £ 100 pests ?
In my opinion , Kabul is a fascinating place with a dramatic and thinking history that is of 100 besg movies .
I really enjoy it because they are all original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settihgs were very reallistic and the actors performed a great performance .
Therefore , I recommend that drug genre fans watch Habel as its message will move you .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boudnaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
My name is Mohamed - Shamoun .
I am 20 years old , living in part - aid Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd Head of the Faculty of medicine Post - mail university .
My father is a teacher and so is my mother .
I have one brother and a new system .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prices .
My hobbies are travelling , reason stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information , so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the latest researchera in the world in addition to being a member of a good health organisation ( WWF ) .
It is n't just a team in my mind , but I work hard to make these dreams come true .
For the last ten years , I have worked in places such as a pharmady , a restaurant in a water pufification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our lives , so I chose this program as I want to learn a study . I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer , but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
When I work anything , I feel that I have the world in my hand , so I can do anything from people .
One of my goals in life is to invent an effective drug for one that incurble like cancer , ADD and hepagitis .
I asked myself once what is the aim of our life ?
And what about the benefits of work and studying ?
But if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved for everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt from research that you can do everything at anything in action . A little word can change life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travel to all the countries in the world as I attended a lot of conferences in my film , so I think this program is a chance to experience which will help and inspire me . the community service and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I left .
I am writing with reference to the post as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
I saw your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person flr tje lost .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience of looking after children from 3 to twelve years old . I consider myself quiet patient and find that , in my opinion , there are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am fold up at working in a team .
I do like to feel alone . This could be one of my dream weaknesses .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do n't think being young people will be a problem .
Instead , they believe it is an advantage .
Using people is usually hard - working as activw psrson .
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae wash my telephone hunter . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Is there a future for listening to dreams ?
To be honest , I am not true .
Although private omed cars are more and more popular , and they are becoming a common issue in developing countries , it is not likely this means of transport will be the means of transport of the future .
First people people compare that in our cities are in our plants there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Cars bxsed fuels wo not last forever .
I would say that most private care is not " sustainable " in the long term , and it will be necessary to regret to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow by triggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is like to dream of a future of technological people flying about , each of them with its own private smalo helixopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there will be no helicopters , and not even cars .
mates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem to provide the public with a better alternative . T
The price of private transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and go to the barn again to be on time , the nice old trip could become important .
Imagine this picture : the worst case of this sister , students yawnnig and do not pay attention to the teacher ; while the weather asks for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied last semester .
Students will get a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying . Because of the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned . parties because of the long vacation will let students get used to having fun instead of studying , and partly Because of the difficult ciurses should be continuakly studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students would receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
Some reasons for detail will be used in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget to knowledge that is given to children after a long break .
For example , in history class , the history teacher has to respect teachers the history of North America before he starts to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
It is wasting time and is not efficient .
Next to go would be students get used to reading by having no study and homework during the pong vacation .
For example , when the semester starts , students can not be away from the sunshine , beach , and traveling .
In the class , students really the joyful time they had instead of paying attention to the teacher .
Most Oh not least , some difficult cojrses should be continually studying more than having a long break .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education . If you have a log without without learning English , you should forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementionsd , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spent 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is soccer .
I have enjoyed this sport since I was a child . I always remember what my father and my brother taught me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player , so I think that I inherited this love for soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoyed playing soccer because when I am on the playing field I forget all my problems .
I like to speak with my dream partners .
Together we analyzed the real tram and we chose a strategy to win the beach .
When I play bad , I feel nervous , but my partners give me that unconditional support .
That is priceless .
I know health is very important , so if you do this sport there is a big possibility that you will be healthy .
So if you are starting this sport , you have to do it because you really lie about it .
If you do n't like it , there are many options to practise whatevef spotts .
Soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
By the way , you have to be prepared for problems .
Finally , I advise you to enjoy playing this awesome sport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also want to see the amazing Niaqgara Falls .
Something that made me happy was being with my family .
On September 12th,2014 I went to New York city .
In the film I am very happy because I received a lot of food .
The night was appropximatly hourd so I watched beautiful movies .
When I arrived , my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug of
We went to on land because there he died .
He gave me a really nice house and I was happy to be my little cousin " Anbel " He looks like like me .
In New York I eat too much . I also want to the city that has sirens , Manhatgan .
I once had the aaesome idea of going to Niagqra Falps .
We went by car and it is about 8 hours long .
Finally , we arrived at Niagara Fall city which works like a cost plaza .
It does not have too much to do if there was a ball .
I was amazed at how the falls .
They are incredibly amazint and beautiful .
I had too many phptos because Yoku does n't visit places like that every .
Something that made me very happy was visiting my family .
My uncle Juan was in Unitwd Sttes of America and I was to hug him because I miss him a lot .
My cousin Angedl was very happy to see me and me too . We can be siblings .
My parents gave me a lot of presents because we say they do not see me frequently and many other parts of my family .
In conclusion , I had a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visited awesome places such as Niagara Fall and Time Square , received a lot of presents and especially ate a lot of delicious food .
Most qttending students to universities are in the city where they used to live , so , they need accommodation to live through their study years .
I University providr chesap accommodationx such as hard rooms and dormitories for their students to lower the living costs , where most students have a low income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to give an apartment to live independently .
Sharing houses or rooms has many advantages , such as being cheap , safe , like university , and learning now to share everything with others . waving money and some will be more Obviuos in university dormitories because monthly pazyments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , nd because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
Despite all these benefits , I would prefer to live in an apartment where my personality is very important to me .
Many years ago , I shared a friend in a room during a course outside my country . These days there the worst during my life . He had parties , speaking loudly all the time and not shading the budget of eating . Living alone gave me the freedom to live by the way that I choose one stlil friendly with all the other without excred the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
They annpying me
Although the deal golvernment which is decided as the role of St has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer bepieves that there is no perfect government .
The importance of federalism , as a liberty for the states to have their own pllicies according to their needs , is not always in the lecture , which may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexaul Whether someone accepts their marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even if the Federal government ket each staqte functiln independence , it will control the main decisions .
This case caused some problems . The lecturer mentiined the faikure of the federxl government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through the Nevada desert .
all the control of the Federal government is the reason why each of the sea and the federal blae each other in the increase of unemployment in some areas .
In conclusion , several governments which give freedom and strength , cause many problems , such as no singoe plicy and confusion about the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any time of trip is exciting . also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two important advice ; first , try to get along with your travel companion and enjoy the Mexican food instead of critic about spicy flavor .
People say that in every voyge , people experience different points of the two : arrival , getting away from the frustrastion of an unknown place , getting along with your trip companion , success on a trip and arriving home trial .
In order to enjoy a try to Mexico , I suggest that she traveled find a way to get along with him or her companion .
This minimal change would make a big difference when you visit the city .
As an example , if you are able to take one on your trip , you could enjoy each moment of the rip , exchange some pictures , but together , and visit places with common inerest such as museum or call .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is to enjoy Mexican food .
Mexican food is a lot of fish from different styles of the country .
For example , there are a lot of American people who do n't like spicy food and also , most of the time in a city , the press of pepper hits the Mexican people used to get to prepare their food .
As advice , I would suggest you to do so sauces with an oepper .
In this way , visitors will be able to enjoy Mexican food with less oepper than the saqme delicious sauce that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I have two important advice for visitors coming to my country : Try to do lots with their vompanion in order to the bus and try to enjoy Mexicn foopd because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time on August 29th 1969 , the social media Spine ( CAS ) was the next most significant innovation that has pargly replaced face - to - face communication .
As such as Facebook and 700.000 messages , and 60.000 sweets are published on Twitter every 60 seconds .
Surprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and winter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or MSc in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy as others . There is a possibility of a cycle of bullying .
This essay will more on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and so comments potwntial future of these implications .
Colmunicating cabs be achieved , regardless of dance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefits of being connected locally to Facebook and Twitter is the messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their needs , in an unpleasant mood , and in certain situations , negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook proves the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining the feeling within the network ( through wall posts , jokes , messages , etc ) ( Olfmeadow , ruins , & towers , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook is interacted there by sharing their food , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook ca be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other exjsting members , and so sharing their small interests through social networks .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
For instance , by followijg French celebrities , people can easily see everyday activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and so there is a big potential for being purposwly aggressive towards people .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitetr is easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily respond to public opinion .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , therefore everybody is easily respones as a public opinion .
Most Facebook users expect their friends to respond or pay attention to what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also also small amounts of aggression and even racist comments .
First of all , people can use racistr comments which market a specific group or person .
For example , after the premise of The Hunger Games was released , a van poszted an onwet racist twaeet that saying that they were happy because one of the main actresses was played by a black person ( Schznz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through BTS , it was left to say problems involver with cycvle - bullying , cycle - badgring , cycle - talking bebaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Garten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al . ( 2012 ) reports a way of continuous distuebing a man for a man called Mr .
A " admitted to a store psychiagric yospital after being found not compwtent to spend trial on cases of talking harassment , treapassing and telephone harassmwnt " ( 1 .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
potential , Facebook and Twitter , and MA in general , may replae face - to - face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to very each other appearances .
Therefore , it will be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than having to call them .
The possible outcomes might be the more time people spend on BTS , the best communication skills that they have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter should improve their future to solve less personal privacy problems .
For example , cojtrolling which posts should be sent by adding the mode privacy nations .
However , despite the useful implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twittee could affect their social life by avoiding doing it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily deduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebolk and Twiutter have been connected worldwide , which means protectint personal orivacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive towards each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photograpuy classes for everyone
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , interests , etc .
Photogrphs xre incluced in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of daily life , because it is the best way to caplture special moments like birthdays , travels , special occasions , etc .
As a new college subject
The Practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special relaxation .
However , teaching students how to apply better technique in the moment of taking a picture should be considered as learning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
The reason
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years , more than 1000 photographs have been taken per person in the world , especially of the latest generations like ( teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of all , so it requires knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .
What lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! It is April now and finally spring has come .
A bright Fuji is shining . The snow melted away in March .
The first spring birds come back from the work countries .
They sing funny and build their nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set up cflock forward one hour in March .
The sumjertime waa firsf was introduced in England in 1888 .
These days , after being by the bights vet , they are shorter and lighter .
We usually set our clock back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) and you are .
Hockey as a nice sgyle
Though all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey orovides gou moee thwn jhst beiong hralthy or not .
What do you think of why you choose a sport ?
You think that your lifestyle will improve my
Well , are mistakes .
So in different kinds of sports you need to be killed or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have none of those requieremnts ?
When you know hockey is safer .
Hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favourite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . In small words ,
It 's a team sport is
However , it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
The home to try it is a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other hand , I enjoy every second of it .
Through my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has become a lifestyle for me .
Do we all recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to go and improve as a person .
Hkckey will change the car you see the world and you are going to start see it will get .
So , searcging is the right sport , one is for you !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport medium for environmental cars .
In spite of some people making enough money to use their own car , electric and hybrie cara are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) , so , people choose this one and it 's because pollution is severe because we have to deal with .
The environmental car is gaining strength every day , for kids too ancient people .
The government has many companies measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for reducing goods on the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , the court , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the event is far from the place where you like .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the few on public transportation . That could allow people to use public transportation and care about their environment from CO2 emissions and prevent global warming .
In Colsada City Council , people are well informed about taking care of the environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of the citizens . For example , children learn at school how to separate the past .
There are many ecological inland .
Each of the stages three kinds of bins and they are not as far away as two hundred meters .
There have been several pkanting campaigns to plant trees and to open the river Jarama side .
Nevertheless , it is near enough , because the dog 's owner has most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there have been bike paths across the city , so the cities will be able to avoid cats and they will emit less air pollution .
The organic waste is picked up every day and plastic on paper waste is picked up every other day .
The most important thing in the environment is the education of children .
Our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
A problem which is caused by us , human beings , being the targets of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this problem , so we made any effort to solve it .
We usually use public transport , which has a great equality in the city I love .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth it .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we won an organization which paid people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take care of the environment .
My sister teaches people what to do with things they want to get rid of , such as bottles or paper .
She is able to do such beautiful ejwellery that lots of people are following her !
It shows that the end of things can come a second time .
As soon as the car river sends the southern hordes of Egypt , it is hers .
I like river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that coursed over 6 thousand years .
All historuans , researchers , scientists are with hips .
And as for me , I totally suppirt their point of view .
type is a kind of the river civilizatikn in the high dsert Sahara .
All the same age , Kike is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , eevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding our area of textile bandy .
The Egyptians named their country ' Blau and ' to make it off of the soil of the desert .
Nowadays , Gus and Wide Valley have become the most important trahsport lines in Sgypt .
Through the centuries people have been exploding the hature of the time .
The ancienbt Egyptixns divided this year into three seasons compared to do or not period .
They know when it would be the ' Green ice ' or ' Red fire ' to stock up with clean water .
But lucky high level of development of Egyptian civilization has two negative sides as well as one positive .
A great number of buildings were built on the river . That caused the disapeparing of a lot of plans and animals .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians still live far from the main areas of the country and can hardly find clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt is developing , the government will pay attention to the ecological problems at that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , the third of Bromo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries , the building has been the symbol of this city .
It is ancient , but still fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every tear .
It was built all ... by air , by the Roman emperors .
It was used for short wild animals or humans , who were killed without ipty .
Moreover , , wrs wers represente in order to celebrate Doman wrmy .
It is gained through the ages , but if people understand their imporgance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we ca n't forget .
However , , all people are aware of it .
It 's the strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In the moving world , transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in flying . Public transport has no future .
Travelling through so is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and advantages to using public transport .
Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport . It is cheap and affordable for all people in society .
variety of buses and released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport in a time when there was no privacy , has its disadvantages .
Similarly , traveling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody can afford a travel by car as it is costly , buy to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy when travelling that is convenient .
and sophistixated and can travel fast .
To sum up , it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because of a lack of advantages and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is not crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropklitan system .
However , during the use , the ate always have such a person who has no public awareness at all .
The occupy too many years , including rpiority ceremonies .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , they just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told him not to do this .
Moreover , I think that providing seats for older people is also a problem .
Prioritt saeats , and preservwd to those who ended , not only older people or all swome sdult nsed it .
Somehow , for all of them , you find their bodies more uncomfortable because of their appearance , which leads to a misunderstanding between them .
Some people blame them for occupying the seats instead of offering the seats .
Moreover , some old people would have the considerative acgion fr grabted and they could even cooperate with adults or students offer their best mannerrs !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city is nothing to criticize .
Everyone should develop an awareness of public manners .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news of films
TV has many benefits :
Firstly , it enables young people to have cultural experience with others .
TV and acts as a catalytst to kiss reading - following up on TV programs by getting goods on the same subjects or reading authors whose work is adapted for the programs .
Television can teach kids important experiences and lay lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
Now , current events and historical rogramming can help make young people care about other cultures and pools .
Documejtaries fans help develop scientific thinking about science and the world .
TV can help introduce people to classical Hollyqood movies and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
Cultural programjing can open up the world of music and art for young people .
There are also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great amount of time watching television do less exercise .
In addition , their children receive less socialiozation with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I dealt with consultants and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - businesses .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advice until the realisation of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after sales with the aim of getting customers satisfied
I also work in both trade and small areas in black - offices , managing many admonistrative activities including mortgages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of her customers , to provide them with a complete service , for one account to insurance products , invesgment products , personal loans , revolvint credit , and cons - selling products .
In many years I have used my skills in mxnaging non - standard situations , analyzing the problems , fishing and implementing practical and easy solutions .
Non - standard situations , analysing the problem , finding and implementing a practical and easy solution .
I have faced several situations , always with serenity and enthusiasm . I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic area .
I 'm careful to meet other goals of the team in which I work , cooperation with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting the point of view , together searching for ways to deal .
I have been working for the same age company for 25 years . Now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .

I love sports such as skiing and swimming . I 've also got a desire license . I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the latest padi divfe masger .
Nowadays , we all have public transport which can make the world .
When we see their cars in our cars , when we stay in traffic jams , we think that one day , we will have to live in our cars and so on public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in an immorfal traffic jam .
But , probably , his situation is one period of the development of transport .
We are sold about a lot of innovations in the sphere .
For instance , Google rwported about Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to wait for smart people .
If they contact each other and use Goiglemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think it might take away near independence .
. Other people think that it is not a bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , but there are drive at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike being a drivers anyway .
And people who have public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more imapct in the world , and , finally , who will decide ?
What language do you speak in ?
Did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
Or do not want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is less important to learn a foreign language than before .
there ? - rdasons whcih tell you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you 're planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak a public language . It makes your trip easy and more comfortable .
Second , by finding a good job opportunity , business exchange is increasing at international level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value to your promise ahd gou cah gey a high salary .
Third , through fearing a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting to know its culture , get to know a different cultures and society different than you . It enriches your knowledge .
Every year , there are more and more miserable accidents happening around the world .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign media , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing sincerely .
Many scientists believe that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greed .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , and not forget to protect the cherosh the Earthj at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the example stove will enhance the temperature and make the north hot and warmer .
The other temoerature enhwnce , the best living quality .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on their living palaces , we would have a park and a homeless future .
Due to the image cringe , the weather is so hot that people will always have a water shortage .
Using enough water , people 's wells become rough .
In living situations , instead of laughter finding happiness , there will be more fighting , hard and sadness .
Everyone lives in repair , huge fans not find the entrance to bdightness .
The terrible consequences are caused by humans ' unsatusfied hearts .
Friends , from now on , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It is dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with generous people , the real danger is if you get covered .
When people know that they were received , the other trees were broken , heads would roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
The passion for this cause is the way to survive .
It is just something that I have to do , not you , so he , me .
I did n't choose that , but we have chosen me .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I would like to apply for the position of each lufeguard assistace which I saw advertised .
For the last two years I have joined the swimming group at the university .
I wanted to succeed in many competitions in the country and abroad .
I believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , considering the swimming skills I have .
On the other hand , I completed the first horse , in the Red Prose .
The job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained and , what is more , it would provide me with new knowledge .
Please do n't hesitate to contact me if you require further information .
I am available to attend an interview at your convenience .
I look forward to hearing from you
Yours faithfully ,

In our modern world , many people are suffrred by stress that it is boring to live convictions .
In addition to him , people work in a very stressful workplace and they want to live in this condition on holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to deny the soup and revive the dpirit for people .
In the holidays , people far away from family problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go to naztural places with their families in order to forget about and situations in their lives .
For example , walking along the seaside or swinging while having sex can be helpful to forget life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking about their experiences of life .
People who review their decisions on holidays are more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions , people make a decision about their future .
Besides , people underestimae emotional feelings in their workpalces .
The reason is that people must clmplate their tasms in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feepings such as love , helping people or thinking about spiritual things .
It can be clearly seen that on holidays , people are close and remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relatives who they have never seen in a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacded polaces in order to renew their spirits and goals .
They can try to God 's It gives relief for people .
When people remember the emotional and spiritual subjects , they can become happier . Because people need to leave the material lord .
In the holidays , people have time to revive the mistakes that lead to stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
As holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the work because people have a chance to move away from modern life that is full of material things .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a common activity in Spain .
However , the government and the local councils of cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote his movemenr because they consider it a means of development .
On the one hand , there were many benefits to cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as covers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues , such as the increase of dinner on the roads .
Statistically , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting set with it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle in strong winds , freezing leather or having to see driniing in hot weather .
In my opinion , cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look at good solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people by car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And the undesirable time might not be so short during holidays , due to a less frequdnt schedule .
Also , we can give a try to a place where public transport perhaos is not available .
When the road is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially for long distances .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should n't be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to providing it .
As we are now , the more public transport passengers or , the new year eshausts have emitted each person .
Recently , several studies have shown that there is a strong relation between car exhaust and fan cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering from diseases and saving time .
Second , public transport means city space .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays who try because it is larger and more crowded .
Correspondigly , the space for each person becomes more lijited than before .
Provided that every itizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport at every chance , I suppose that our streets would become parking places and everyone would spend more time in congestion .
Last but not best , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
Drivers have to continuously pay attention to their surroundings , resulting in a sense of Spirit .
For passengers , however , travelling is a complete relaxation .
People can listen to music , bring home all their friends , as a fascinating boon or just look outside .
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not say that public transport is the most chiice of any situation .
P.S . , it offers less flexibikity than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that transport can replcae others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a lot of them .
Language fkr the future
Should I learn other languages ? .
We live in a world that has many changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome them .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the door and it could allow you to communicate with people , get to know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
As in recent years , expressing yourself in English , French , German and Russian . become something essential and very important in our lives to find a mob .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also , I consider that it leads to being hard and takes him away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitabiltiy in the future , but to achieve it they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

I had a great time .
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon , we arrived at our home .
First , we listened to some songs , such as Almost a Big Big World .
After thirty minutes , we had to go .
Winning loved eating very much , so I enjoy French umch food at her home .
We had mouth- wateeing strawberry cakss qnd juice and juice fo tra and they were extremely yummy .
After taking up , we played hide - and - seek together in Winnie 's gardens .
Adriana and I were behind a beach and Winnie was looking for us .
Suddenly , I fell over a little stone .
Ariana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
You need is bleeding .
If you play ' I use it .
I am sharing a leaf and my heart is strong , but I am worried about winning .
I have butterflies in my stomach . Yes , I am fine , ' Winnid repliwd .
I felt relieved that .
Then , Adriana finds a master who lost it in Winnie 's wound .
Winning felt warm inskde ad smiled happily .
I felt bad today although Winjie was himself .
Why ?
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unforgettable day !
In my opinion , the house in the future will be better .
The home of the future will be big and bright .
Inside will be full of convenience .
A big area will be divided into wet zones .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's done and so on .
In House of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in very honest .
Television will be cordless , as far as the present Internet .
Every house will be flexible .
Thanks to that , it to be expanded or reduced .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic spark . It is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's effort , but you can also enjoy teamwork if you participate in swimming competitions .
It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness . It is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children ca start to learn swimming as early as two years .
There are different types of dolphins : draw , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reuction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight . It is also the best sport for asthmati patients because it strengtehns the best muscles and decreases the vulenrability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you want to start swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group your age .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antayw in October .
I had a great time with people who were working as helpers for the concert .
I got a lot of experience of them .
In the concert the old people enjoy themselves , but nobody thinks about how they are preparing for the concert .
I said so many interesting things during the preparation time .
For example , who knows everything about each helper 's one bite at the same time , they just concentrate on their own subject .
I want to explain to you the interesting part of my experience .
In the concert morning we were excited about thinking about the concert and we decided not not think about the concert . Just do the job which would be given .
When we were singing concert , we had to work together for all of us .
Some of the starters designed the stage , some of the checjing songs vplume and lights .
My job is check songs list which singrrs would perfrm .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of the winter .
They always wanted to change some songs which were on the list .
At the concert time , I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
Actually , everybody can be worried because they have the end of it .
Finally , the concert started and all the lights were shining like Starx .
It is difficult to explain that feeling .
When the concert finished , I felt like a big whoch flyinv freely .
Of course , I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
However , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our new concert which will be next month . If you have any time , please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
When you !
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertisements , technology is having a huge , and there is always positive impaft on lutdoor advertisements .
From place - end - who raids posted in public places , we have moved to practically living surrounded by outdlor dads placed in every availagle imaginable spit .
From buildings with enormous and light streets to interactive bus stops sins .
The recent developments in mobile technology aplows advrrtisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I 'm suprised that in the very near future , if I work for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at home , on my way to work the beds on the buses I will be - which , of course , will be screens and not printed paper - will show image of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it will be useful , but I also see sometimes I will find it aggressive .
The way it feels aggressive to enter a square . plaza in my town and think it up of a bright screen , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed .
Advertisement might be considered an ass , or at least of the pieces were really arfistic , but placed in the wrong spot or shouted at the wrong times loos they axrtistic skde .
But , technology is hard for best or work , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my home .
I 'd like to have a huge detached house in the sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So I would live more freely as an independent .
If I had a house , I would decorate it in the modern style .
I would buy the fitnesa gym , wardrobe grooming , a swimming pool .
If I had lunch mouse , I would like to set a barbecue arena in my garden .
I would invite my friends and relatives .
Together we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favourite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
Though I am a beginner at it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a matter of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tends to leave my pressures .
If you are a beginner at tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for your first .
As the power of : If you want to learn something , you need to get the right those first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skill step by step .
Since tenhis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn those important techniques slowly and carefully , you have a pet hurf durung thw practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is also critical .
A skilled cosch fan will tell you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices on the screen ?
Can you imagine having only two channels are not playing the whole day ?
That was 30 years ago .
An explosion of changes came to our house in the eighties .
In this report I will see some characteristics of today 's television .
The number of channels is gradually reducihg
In our country a decade ago , when digital TV thrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All the tries to get several licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
It gives me less choice .
Internet TV is increasing
It does ldss mnoey and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who is watching this or the television program .
You must follow suggestions made by someone .
You must click on it .
The place to reduce their budget
Despite changing channels , we are the same wed .
Broadcast groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to the authors and cajera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it
Summary
TV is fine .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays , only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps the politica reasons for maintaining such a buffet are difficult .
However , the fact is that there is a coutndown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a train around the world .

It was good to hear from you .
Basically , my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible . I mean , not only one English language , but also to find more about your future and visit nine places in our country as well .

Hi Jan ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
First of all , you should get outside of the airport tetminal .
There you will see bus stations in the street .
When you get there are the bus which was number 111 .
The ride to the bus stop . Zličín " .
See if you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
If you choose this way , I 'll help you in the morning by telling you where all we meet exactly .
But if I were you , I would like a taxi because the underground is quite Norwing , buying it is cheaper .
Anyway , you need to go to the centre . I 'll wait for yoi tnere .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time .
That 's why you do n't have to take warm clothes .
I was delighted to see you soon .
Best wishes ,

In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss the type of food we want to eat .
Actually , students eat a lot faster when they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to eat food , you do their lessons . I think that the best restaurant is somewhere where they do some mail , and a good idea is for the main course : naked potatoes , seemed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant . I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with white hair , tables and walls . more or less a relaxing environment , but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote Cris , because we will have a good night or not depending the top of atnosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very good for us , because hormally we speak about books , swearing and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to Master 's Hollywood .
I have the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
The aim is incredibly delicious .
I do not know how to do the same kind xook .
These burgers are my favourite film because they are amazing .
I can not to his there because you have to taste them .
It is a flavojr similar to staying in heaven or in paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant . You definitely learn with a very good flavor in your mouth and a big smile in your car .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do n't like burgers , you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinions as a person who has eaten another msal .
Public transport plays an important role in our daily lives .
More than a million people use buses , taxis on trains etc as tourists , their work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
In view is cars .
Though travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .
That is because most petrol , diesel and gas are quite high in most countries of the world .
While travelling by public transport can cost a lot of money in the following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
As they have specific routes across the country , then , cities and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even in the city etc .
I disagree with the statement stated above , because in the future we are likely to have only the classes in society , the rich and the car .
middle class is idsappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on foot .
So , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
Public transport is even better for our environment than cars .
Nowadays , people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think this book is more interesting than those versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a week - - educated person and gives a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's the while you are reading your cafe letting a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop the imagination of a leader .
When you are reading , a picture of what is happening appears in our mood .
For imagine how yeroes look like . You can imagine different views were the action takes place .
And finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your body with you and start reading anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in a company , the best way for now is to move .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
And many people choose movies because they like eoundtracks and special effects .
It 's so exciting .
All these factors are not important to me .
I suppose that books are better than the film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say reading is a really great thing .
A girl was walking one day .
She was with her mum .
She was just a young beautiful girl !
So , they were going home when the girl noticed a huge Fill in a shop .
She had blond hair and she was wearing a bus dress , gloves and black shoes .
Just like her ... " but I love this job ! Could you say it for me ? " she said .
Her mum could n't tend to her , so she bought it .
Oh ! The girl , so many special moments with her cool ! ! They looked so adorbale together ! They are like twins !
After some years , the girl decided that she had to move .
She was eighteen years old , the end of being independent .
So she singing too . Week Vreath and her her doll in the attack was like her childhood memory .
At night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
He went all the way with a knife in his hand . '' Roll , who you do n't play with me anymore ? Are you bored of me ? Juzt bevause I have only one eye ? But you remove me the other towns .
Just because I do n't have one in my life ? But you do it again ! " she screamed .
And one ...
The next day , one of her moms wanted to find her daughter .
So , she went upstaird ...
The girl had a life in her neck and on the wall there was a sentence , '' did you leave me a way ? "
Tennis is an individual sport .
Just to have to deal with the game .
no fan cboose kots of places to play .
We need a good pair of clothes , a tennis racket and bzlls and a person whom we play with .
Although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , it was one finals .
This sport is not just about a physical lower .
For supposed to use your brand as well .
It is a combination of physical pier , technique and near power .
Like the other sports , this is getting more modern , faster and commercial .
I like professional tennis .
Some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
Some of them play tennis because of their parents .
It is fair enough .
Children should try games , or just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps their physical health and so on .
You can start if you can grow up anyway .
It is never too late .
Either you can find a professional beach or just join your friends .
Enjoy !
Dear Mrs Ashby ,
My name is Andrea Cokcci , I 'm sixteen , and I saw the advertisement for the weekend work in your cafe , and I 'm interested in working with you .
I 'a perfect choice for this job . In fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us , food is everything .

Dear
In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it all wrong to lose your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new kinds of views about your own learning process .
Talking to both English and native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
Besides , it can be fun and enjoyable if you play it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money on it and I will be sure to achieve your goals at all , so it will become a daily nightmare if you do not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view , I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages , especially if you have some money savsd for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is young and the internet to learn everything you need .
You can even talk with native speakers by using some that room onlime such as Skype and there .
Football , a passion
When I was little I tried a lot of sports ; handball , swimming , tennis , but my favourite sport is not only this , it is a sport that I had never imagined : football .
All my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , but for girls . Since I tried it , I have loved it .
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football , I did it with my classmates , who were all God , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , the target to integrate me when they played , and nowadays , I live playing football with them .
So , for women and I started to organise female matches , so I am more used to playing with girls . I never imagined that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it is part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
What I think you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to rdacive soms upnches .
I recommend a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
My name is " The English in " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The service was excellent and the waiters were so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is small , so all the facts could stay inside without problems .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's not great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant . It is always tasty and fresh .
I 've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The dessert is very good too .
They 've got origina onee , kike sweet pizza , a traditional .
There is a big variety of real ones .
This restaurant is an experience which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much more .
The restaurant is in the shopping centre , so we can go there by bus or by train .
I think that is the best restaurant to go at the end of the course , so we would book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .
During their whole lives , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , and the media accmopanying them .
In my view , public people deserve to make their lives without photography .
On one hand , becoming a public person associated with journalists , Mass - media , flashes .
Famous people are obligated to provide their life in an exemplary way .
However , they are still ordinary people , they make mistakes .
People are brought jealousy .
notice the end of failure .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely tkxic qnd that causes positive influence on society which causes celebrities through the price of journalistyic documentary .
On the other hand , stars eold their privacy to earn more an ice cove .
the value of their talents , abikities ae counte in aomnut of tabloid scandalps .
Summing up , all over the world , there are living famous people who do n't bring the limelight their lives .
It has never been very useful for a long time , Nevertheless , nowadays , there are some people who ask if public transport was supported , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the best because the people who do not have a car now to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
These cars need to be prepared ; besides , if you have a car , you have to buy some taixs .
In addition , people need to take public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is he glboal warmikng because the atmosphere is very polluted .
If you use public transport , you can find less pollution than before because there are a lot of people who travel together on only one transport .
Finally , the most important thing is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides , in some cities , a car can not be part in some places , such as the old cities and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and worried about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I have gotten used to walking around my city and my cat has gotten used to travelling around the country .
We are living in a chanfing world .
Today 's new things become think of pasta in a few months .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest mindset , the latest fonfigurations comes out within a couple months after saying it .
50 years is a very long time and people like us definitely change in such a long period .
However , the importance in discussing would be whether it would be a positive change or a negative one .
In the last 50 years , science and technology to great , the internet , mobiles have made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at finged - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost in a new place . Google maps are always there to help .
We do need to tell English words today , as we can quickly find the meaning of a word on our mobiles .
Martin Jew people or seeing your products , you do n't care to face anytime , everything can be managed through a virtual platform .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than in the past , thanks to programs made made in technology .
On the other hand , the number of terrorism , global warming and greed have become top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warnings are causing natural disasters now and .
Terrorism acrivities cause havic in public life .
Corruption and greed of people in power make it difficult to trust people blenders .
If these challenges . You addrewsed in coming years , imaginary better lives for more people in 50 years is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a roll . On the right hand , it would be good for us , in front finds it has vowed to destroy the world as we see it today .
to car cancer ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I saw your advertisements on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the third person for this kind of job ! " .
Perhaps , you 're wondering why I should be the right person .
That 's so said .
I 'm a motivated , flexible and open person and I had a lot of experience in this film as well .
I 've worked as a social trainsr and as an educatore since I was 16 .
I love using social activities and playing revenue .
When I worked as an educated , I used to plan and organize some posts and outdoor activities .
I have very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live the train .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
As requested , I attached it in this mail .
Best regards ,
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need Alice near me because I have children and I want to know how and where they are .
The same about my parents ; they are good and sometimes they call me to talk about this , yeah .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientists that that though they help children 's brain to develop , it is important to check them because there are a lot of violent games .
However , there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to use the internet at my work for research or google information and also communicate with other teachers , speaking about noise and changing information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve for the future .
Friends should be like a meadow always over you .
In the time of joy and sorry .
Nothing is impossible in life but it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does n't mean Ypu will never find one .
It is very important to interact and socislise with people to make friends .
Most people you will see one day will become too young to find a friend .
When you find someone , spend time with them , have views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do n't have to agree on everything to say , but they should share the news about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You should find a variety of articles such as politics , business and money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , bravely , the weather and the environment .
There are plenty of advertisements for jogs and nations to help individuals .
Readers are able to express their opinions freely .
They use the real English language which avoids slang language .
As a result , it is suitable for students who learn English to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realized her two disadvantages were .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to ifficial language . There are also a huge number of commercial advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The ugardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are many , the economy is very highly developed .
Some people think that we need tablet comouters instead of boois
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes , when I am watching TV or I am sending a newspaper , I notice that gadgdts are very useful for your life . It seems to me good opportunities to make life easier .
Also , it makes us clever .
I am convinced that young tablef computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do n't need to carry a lot of books . A big child can not say that he left a book because he has all his books on a tablet computer .
Some people think that it is a new idea .
They believe that it is a useless thing for our generation .
Both people make sure that electronic things make us studio .
They insist on using tables at school .
Personally , for me , I think about books when I am at home . I use books because I like to smell and to touch the age of jobs .
I do n't agree with the people who think that fables are useless .
We should use it but we should n't forget about books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep areas of new technologies and try to make our lives easier .
The Big Mistak
This is full of joy and happiness , but something was wrong after she told me that she was pregnant .
She was so happy about this news and she thought that he would be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when I told him that he was pregnant , he just grew .
It was so much for him .
He thought it would be easier to walk away and have that conversation with me .
He tried to understand what was going on with him .
It is weird how many questions and doubts fame up on his head .
As part of this , he was really happy , because being a father is one of his biggest dreams , but on the other hand , he could n't handle this news .
The Noman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy with her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he could n't feel anything .
At that , he felt anxious .
He could n't handle the feeling , when we needed to touch it , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that he loved him as much as he loved me , but everything was just wrong in the event .
Her voice , her smile and her body had to sing in this moment .
We could n't understand what was going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with me .
And now , he just avoida her and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big kiss .
He was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they loved each other and they cared about each other , but it was so much for him .
He stood up and I aimed to the gjrlfriend that he needed a break and he had to be done .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to talk about what my love sprts and why I will enjoy the story .
In fact , I do n't like to do some sports surfing , but if I really need to do some exercises , I like to go to sit in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming pool is learning .
For the swimming team , I have a safe and a bathroom to shower in .
Secondly , I do not like to go to the beach . This is because I do not like big hugs and feel safe .
Third , swimming in the ocean is the most dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before a kind of sport that we should do some exercise . That is because we need to relax our bodies . If we do n't do it , we will not be dngerous wjile we are in many sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sport . We need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we ca not play at home or working all the time .
Every time you really do not like to do exercise , you can go to school .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pastyre area where local farmers have been brewing beer , cars are far away in spite of the warm weather conditions , such as high temperatures are horrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to present and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of rational use of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on reading green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens fan speed their tims or even do sport .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and fragment of the waste system with the five coopwration of modes of citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , around 90 % of Cacere inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish , making it into the yellow , grey and the containers in every street .
And that is a rather negative point , the dulpsters are not visible in town and it would be advisable to change the news we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remembered that I was doing a presentation about landscapes . The ones that do it will be rewarded with a bonus point , but anyway , this is n't important information .
I searchedd for my family in the house and there was no one in the house , just me .
I got a bit scared , so I reached the outside in the street .
I did n't know that a club hit the city and killed almost everyone . Now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the expansion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not beautiful , so you ca n't distinguish after the explosion hits .
Finally , two days , I found some neighbors with me food . I started to eat so I ate a lot .
We have to incentives by law , but it was a hotel conflict , because they noticed that some fish were missing skmehow .
I think that someone says sums of the food he might while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is going to tend to enforce the past .
The best morning , I ate a piece of steak and the manager was talking about me creafures . They were walking around to tell us us eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I mean so loud .
I started in and it seemed that this guy had a cup .
I stopped him and when he turned around it was a woman in the group .
We were talking about this when a day just a bad ; it was adorabpe must when he converted into a big bird creature .
He is my leg and it just a lot . We tried to melt the other but it was too late . It was the groups or us .
We saw that fast eating or friends and jobs .
In some way , I robbed the pool in the night and I signed up it was too for my survival .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of bow am I going I would n't do it because I have to face all of this .
SONG EXCERCISE IS NOT FOR GOURE HEALTH
Why do not have to exercise ?
What benefits do you think of when exercising ?
Do you know that 75 % of people in Mexico do n't do any type of exercise ? This is a big problem for our society and is problem number 1 of Mexico is the country with the best in the world .
Doing exercise is an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life . While you exercise , you need help when you are a pony .
There 's a lot of benefits that come with doing exercises like reducimg or taking control of weight . It helps you with heart disease , problems with your neds , and also with a lot of friends exercise .
One day there will be a lot of different types of exercise . You can play any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GM or practice Crossfi or something like that .
Soccer 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can say fi , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to control the ball and drubble you 're rivald on the field .
I recommend you to do any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is that any future for public transport , because travelling by car is much more convenient ?
I believe public transport will try to disappear , though we still have to deal with different opinions about the increase in traveling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , I have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perdeption that a car can give you freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication " You people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 year old explained « " I prefer doing things in the far , it 's uicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because of my sister to music as well . »
Although there are many positive points about private cars , they ate alzo ndgative snacks .
Indeed , as it increases pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
They just own a car and look after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously , it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
I am a 17 - 22 year old boy .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay fed on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to the Raison Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occur in private cars .
The main reason is the other cars ' ownes eating drunk and driving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were frank , there would n't be as many accidents .
Finally , I degeloped countries in the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jams have been decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
For this analysis , it is obvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree with " always talking through friends is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling them both be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being yruthful is crucial in a relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurtig others ' fwelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not helping the truth slay the name is if it is about a personal matter and it would feel awkward to mention it to colleagues or employees .
It is better to talk a little while lying at his moments .
To further illuistrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelihgs by taking the truth at all time .
For example , if some wokan yu are caught wearing inappropriate clothes , you get in the occasion .
People usually tend to not meet for the truth since it would make their feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may present her with other things on them .
In that case , they could still have conversations without being on her mind .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private . Since most of the time it is strong and inappropriate to make yourself too much to people at work or even people that one just scared .
If there are questions about this , we do not want other people to know , we might say a little white and the usual words do not matter too much .
If I am having a day out to go to a doctor , I would prefer the people ask details about it by saying that I just had some errands to run .
There are two opinions of mine on telling the truth or you .
Last Friday , Micaela and I were at school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we are in the case , suddenly Mnichael walkdd toawrds tyhe dkor .
Michael closer to the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
Due to this , we 're not called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster because because Mixhael had closed the door .
The door did n't come into pieces or fall down .
My curiosith hsd put me in big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way , hopefully he had given me the answer I wanted .
However , things do n't hpapened lime as I hoped .
I kept getting exposed from the school because the teacher and my classmates suspected Muchael of stealing our classmate - Carl 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointing at us firmly and without giving any chance for us to freak out .
I finally realized that everything is a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocenty ones as we will to the trap .
We wipe off our toes , and save our hands can we leave the school .
Although , one way later , the headmaster could put on trust through CDC , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change to a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mines .
Dear USA summer camps ,
My name is Biahca Padobesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .
I think I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English , which is very important to communicate .
Also , I have a good relationship with little kids . I used to look after my nieces and nephew over the weekends and they love spending time with me . Moreover , I am very energetic , always walking and ready to work hard .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of myself , as I invent new and entertaining games for the kids to have a great time .
I like having puzzles or games which imply running , jumping , which is important for the first developments .
I am not very good at coooing gut because I never gave rise to dedicated Come on them .
I think that if I watch and learn how to do it I could learn very fast and can dominatd it .
This is a good quality of money , I learn things very fast and I also get used to being thin .
I am very excited about this job and I hope you happen soon .

I number 8 .
We were ready to go and , on the other hand , we went outside the shelter . We vuilt aznd wrire in all everything to make the shelter " safe for " and if there was someone that needed supplies , he would find some supplies and aim to survive .
We shared our journey and guns in the forest . There were a lot of # tests in your day . There were various ghys that were sick . We could n't do anything except foe , keep going . I was seeing my little drop to # diminish and of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one they had no problem with all the other stuff people have problems with .
I thought that maybe # genea were actually immune to the infection . I would actually be the # revolutionafy guy that helps everyone that is in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it # Notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself . I have to think about is it helps me entire world or just save a group that decision was in my hand it to # convengional to help me entire world but I do n't want to me . While I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body felt someone that was in the group is of this guts we wanted to sing and alive not dead his face was a rottewn snd eatej away by the workers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alone or at least tell us what happened to everyone . The # battle against hunfer started . Everyone was hungry . We have n't take anything in a new way and they could lead us to two things dead or even away by a walk so we need to find something that is a # nitritional basex food where we could eat with no problems and be ok .
We found a pharmacy and a guestroom where we could rest and have a shower to clean ourselves .
We got close to the pharmacy , there were no walkers inside , so we turned into the pharmacy and lost all the doors and I got someone to help us in the night . I needed some fresh and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're not overcrowded .
I think traffic in this town is the most presents . As a result , Turin is the town of FISH , the world known facdtory .
Near to your home , too far many supermarkets in which you can easily . Also , they do not to live .
When you have to use the cellphone for energy , you can do not in any tobacc hops bear your time .
If you like shopping , in the erimeter of the town , at the same time , big supermarkets , which sell many items of the main great factorids of Europe and about .
In all industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted over an edach area in each building .
In the end , the taxes are present and they are even all over the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people born in the music industry , deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind , theory would be a bad idea . Paparazzi work in the privacy of famous people .
In my opinion is starsw shoild be able to deal and take on private time .
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveilkance of people to waiting for fake pictures which show them in embarrassing situations .
Unfortunately , this is a part of the club 's ' for ' , so they have to take it into account .
But on the other hand , there should be an invioplability spheres of time without journalists following them all the time .
We rarely see fragments of life without the eye of a camera . should be an opportunity to live like a normal person , not famous people .
I know that watching cslebrity doing cleaning or taking a day for a way is shocking news for people who had tabloids .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs are like normal people as everyone of us only with some money in their bank account .
So , as you can see , I agree with the statement that famous people , we are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability to have a normal life would be also to them .
The Maze Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the stories of this world author .
As I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try to
The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mydtery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flash of the main character , who is a 15-year - old boy who finds his imprisonee in a cage and being transported to what seems to be a camp .
He has no idea how he ended up there .
However , she realized that this was not a normal cm , which is located next to a giant and mysterious cave .
The people who live in the camp take up different roiles in order to survive and defend themselves against the means of the past .
He took the role of a runner , the person responsible for coloring the main one looking for this place .
Still , they only have daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down , comes very dangdrous .
The film keeps getting better and better as we watch it , having exciting moments when the characters discover something that is hidden inside the man .
I heqrtily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rest of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will have no one indifterent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , but what I love about it is , first of all , that tall or small . Anyone can play it as long as they 're determined , so basically it is a life - love sport for everyone .
I like the seed of volleyball . Most of the time it 's life and if you blink you probably miss something . Such confact happens in less than a second , and every player directs the locatiob of the ball in hat amounts of time and there 's the intensity , if you have n't seen a team go until 32 - 30 , and seed the energy on the floor and he met noise from the crowd You 're missng ouf .
Personally , winning such a lot makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , be harder , pasta and it better , and serve in different ways .
I live in Eltgam .
My area is very clean and very green .
People here are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good place to live .
One time to work on Wednesday , rubbish is taken .
Of course , garbage is sorted into different bins .
This is a very good idea , because they brought yndergo recycling .
my neighbors in the same data collected garage .
Everyone cares about cleanliness in front of the uses and in the gardens .
Especially aging is a lot of colours and pleasant ours .
Eltham has beautiful parks where you can relax from the bus pulse .
Green live in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently been at Balck Bwar restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catajia situated under the man volcan slopes , and I think the restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , smiling boon or co - smoking room .
The surroundings are rustic , let it still felt airy and the waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was often with my friends Lorena and this future , I managed to smoke a good range of items on the men and I really liked Chinese soup . It is very tasty .
The ingredients were clearly rresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so that restaurant was a little expensive .
I would highly recommend this restaurant , despite the fact that the day will be a little expensive and I will no doubt be back or other dinners .
Chess is a topic with a lot of controvdrsy .
They have been present in our sovieties since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances that rally us - know all of us .
realization of drugs is a very useed argument by people who believe that the measure could solve the problems of explosions .
Margination hws a list of the illegality of this activity .
All this illrgality is guilty of the attraction of the songs because the majority of people start saving drugs because they are young and prohibitijon is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when entertainment before an action destroys our lives .
I think everyone has proven the same kind of illegal due to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do n't believe that behaviour is from because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and make it very clear that it is only something professional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people do nor like to play deadlines by themselves .
Finally , legaliation of drugs means we should be capable and we know how the taxes work in my country , so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Shroqo ,
That sounds great . I 'm so happy to hear that you are coming to Saudi Arabia . I 'm gon na be able to see , after a long time .
But luckily , I 'm having an exam on Thursday so I ca n't meet you , but you can take me to school at 10 , then we can go to have lunch .
My school is really easy to find . Go straight straight onto Aojameah Sreet and turn right beside the face of AC diversity . After getting drawn from the bridge , you 'll find the school on your right .
So exciting to see you !
Bye for now ,

Dear Les ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
At that time , it was always fun and , depending on the reason , it would rain .
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the world .
In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , see the kind sofa or El Prxdo .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cqbarcenos Natiknal Park in Cantabria , which is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can experience migfation brids .
If I were you and I had a complete summer to enjoy space , I would say per week in each place , and I get a car in order to love between the cities .
I recommend you not to wear warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

The Simpson is my favourite fictional character on TV .
He is the eldest son of the Simpso family .
But she is years old and is a typical American child .
He has yellow skin and it was easy . He had long as a gotspoky hair .
are always wearing a red T - shirt and shorts .
The most important thing for him is to be the most popular student in his school . For this reason , he is always misbehavong .
He wants a bad schoolk pribcipal ften punis gim .
Bra is an energetic and clever student , but he is also a bad student and he makes nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he actually has a heart of good because he has his sister who they need .
In the Simson family , the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines by The Simpsons are the most cartoon heroes in history and I absolutely agree .
For me , cars are more funneir than Homsr , although not all magazines say that Homer is the best character .
It was her dream rainy Sunday morning .
I was n't in the door to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get off of the bus and for quite a while .
Suddenly , we used a heavy knock on the odor .
Who , on earth could eat be ?
I have n't even bothered to play me a visit due to the bloody awful weather ?
My concerns were answered swiftly , then the man on my threshold yedlled : " I have a letter , Mr. Samson !
" I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received any better songs .
I opened it and quickly scanned the title .
At first , I observed ghe etter cautiojsly , but when I noticed my uncle 's time in it .
Although I had n't met in a single home , this letter is his past dull and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousand ponds , to be precise .
Exultation ssized my mind instantly , but I son began to work : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
Well , many tasks I have chosen are about the town where I have been staying or the last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of a river without Qatar .
I am very worried about the town where I am staying because everybody in the town is not bothered about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all , these are very dirty by nature .
They are very concerned about the environment in the importance of cleanliness .
So callec people of good future are inactie anxious talmative and gossip about others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the households with public roaxd throw away dirty clothes easily and we do n't bother about the one of the municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
What I need is everyone who is staying in the town to at least one clean their own places .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow props and look for their feedback , but they are also the same in nature .
People are now semi - centre and very narrow limped .
though they are becoming so much cleaner and educated but in real sense they are still garage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a math topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation sites is widely supported in developed countries , but the idea is erected in developing countries , like the job I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownership has increased over the last decade , reducing the number of people using public transport .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or , even worse , the idea of waiting in long queues .
Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own car or maybe they can afford to travel by a father means of transportation . Then the end provided by the local government .
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to take the bus or rather than pay for a full tangy .
Similarly , people in countries with less income corn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the use of people use it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others when they will see it as long as their economy needs it .
People need an easy , cheap solution .
In general , using a car is easier than taking a train or a bus .
It 's just near our house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weight , or suffering because of the rain or the sea .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply not do n't like to drive , you can find it easier to use public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to music and working around , or reading newspapers and bones .
Is the car tastier than public transport ?
It depends on
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes cars are faster than buses , sometimes they are faster .
The tdains go slways faster than cars .
Speaking about money ? Traveling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe Mars is not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment in the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by citizens and strongly supported by governments .
Informal letter . CAE ( AVT 1 )
Dear Jan ,
Thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
From my experience working at an international company that has organised music festivals , I can assure you that it will be a great time for you .
I am not sure , however , that this job will meet your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activities was on the 22nd of July . We try allowed to have a relaxing way at the festival .
Luckily , you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
In my case , I have to translate a good number of tests , and also help English tourists to et around .
If you are looking for additiojal work experience , you will probably be disappointed .
All I was asked to do the rest of the time was to take telephone calle and make coffee for tourists .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
When you decide what to do , do n't hesitate to let me on !
Take care of yourself .
David
The last few words have been really tough for Michael .
This whole business started to go on his knives .
He has to help eat it , the signer be better .
For me , one thing is clear as ash - the one he is in love with is Maria , not Angelina .
The one he likes is Angelina , not Manila . That 's the problem .
He ca n't dump her And just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not needed .
As he has to stop to be without hurting anybody .
If yes , the decision is made .
He talked up with her .
Probably tomorrow .
It will star in such an idiltic wzy .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom , walked to a hotel and his wife and Angelina , happened to go in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say what they ended up having Neo - perhaps , at the time he was posted at himself for not having failed to be the girl he loved because of all these religious tissues , Malaga 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
And that definitely is not the right thing to do .
At that moment , he did n't realise that .
Only after , after the Angelins left , did Michael close the door and then he knew he had made a huge mistake .
Dear Sir / Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the most of a summer camp councellir currently advertised on your website .
At that moment , I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .
I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .
I speak English , German and Loui and as a counselor it is very handy .
I am very used to dealing with young people as that year I worked at a lot of rap .
Moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when stalls in primary school - once a week I would go to a local bus to help children with their homework .
I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to engertaining people , which might come in useful in my role as a summer camp customer .
I am also an accomplixhed sportswoman - I am a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard .
I attach a reference from Tkmasz Jzworska , who was my boss at the scout camp .
I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this post in an interview .
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,

Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonic student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great ngineer one day , so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
Recently , I started studying English in particular 'cause it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I work about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronicd , all the subjects that I like most .
My teachers are very good at jogging , so I have to be like them one day .
The big problems in my class are the majority of my classmates : the car hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy of the time from me and the other food students .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people who they want .
Coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at Imperial College .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate cerfificate of English and when I am going to try to better at this school , even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial College of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience for our mouths .
Nowadays , it is difficult to find people who enjoy food as much as I do , because the calories , the kids are going to gain and so that stuff .
I arrived at Mxico Citu one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Licence .
We discovered our fasdination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
Then a brainstormed about meals and places to visit began .
The first day starred in an important dance … Tavo Day !
Tacontento was the place we chose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled lions , accompanied by food Hearts .
Because Puerquitour is something to have , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
Ariana we are tax , but this time to work species .
The home of the places is Marcos La Shue and the tacos are gourmet shore .
It means that there are different tastes of todtillas -vanills , strawberries , chipotl , normal , and want , along with others and sales -tamarimd , Java , man , guacamole , etc .
The boy did not finish winning the Paco . After a week in Redorma and a lot passed in the Independence Amgel we went to the movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir we crying .
Third lies one of my favourites . The place is soooooo nice and the decoration and the attire of the waitresses makes you feel on the bus .
La Pasta Guyana , which is located in La Condesa , offers baked potatoes with the age of famous women and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
Azuo Rezturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation of the fourth ray of Puerquitlur .
The seafood is delicious there . My recommendations are created sjrimp , fillet and shrimp Al Pasror and coconut water .
With kay , it 's time to eat more tacos . The plane ? … El asqdero Hidalgjense .
You have to start to pay a kolcajete by yourself . It is just too much for one person , so if you do not eat breakfast it is a good action or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a matter of beef ,
lost a week in the Puerquitour .
The Sixth say was to celebrate Mwgda 's fknal tsst , a fried food with school , who already presented it to get the castle Degree ; and the farewelp of license , who is already in the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the end , we celebrate rating in Kemelas Oub .
You ca n't go there . We do n't remember . It is like huafache but tiger and very delicious .
The dessert ?
ice cream in Tepoznieves .
Because I was almost with a lot in the USA , we spent all day together .
Sevdnth said stayed a small spice breakfast , bourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
When we went to a good fair we visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan was to have dinner at Hilatia Gastrobar because all the door comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequigo , the traditional Al Pastor Sprcial accompaniewd by black beer .
The last day of the Ouerquitour was accolplished with my favorite dessert , a strawberty cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I have to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! !
The cirst gwo chapters extracetd from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as it .
This is a problem caused by his sister , a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband .
Sadly , it has no future in any possible way .
Moreover , he is just a regular person with a terrible life .
Besides that , it seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not use complex norms when he talks in Bug , he uses them in what he narrates .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a kid who only feels uncomfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live in wife , but I think everyone would like to see sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
At least , I felt sorry for him and I would have liked to see if his stay had a good ending .
He likes a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the trip protagonit qnd the wag to tell the actions is the reason why we sorry to connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
The one Auyhor does not try to describe the protagonist with qords , but with action .
The narrator did not have a description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly used djrect speech , but he only uses indirect speech on new occasions , preferring to his own world .
This exertion can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answers the thief ariting that he did that he would get him the file , and that he could get what brokne bifs of food he could , and he would go to the thief at the pattern .
Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters say .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjectove point of life .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he did n't have omniscient power .
However , his point could be analyzing and descrtibing the sifuations with a nice vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he described his parents in a hilarious erm , making his father as a square , shouting , dark and , curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
These twists and creative thoughts spread all over the dot , accompanied by green mode twisted reflecxtions like at the end of the first chapter , when he described the an eye stole Co. as man rid of the end hides in the rgaveyard because he saw him hugying himself .
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a bad and boring life that pushes me to abase our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe other characters , he focused on their appearance .
Actually , we all of that Mr. Jake tries to make his husband and his brother suffer and he is worried more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worried about the person who lives in his own house .
The narrator describes far as a woman that has learned a good reputation through being aggressive with her little brother .
And we know that you is a moody man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - figured , sweet - tempered , Mass - pong and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters rack is opposed to the way the narrator 's wife is .
In fact , the dialogues of a character are not longer than than two sentences long , with the only exception of the thief who talks about his painting in two long sentencez with complex structure .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences .
For instance , there is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second episode :
" My sister , who had the surgery , was more than twenty years older than me , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because her husband brought me up " by hand . "
waving at the time to find put on myself the expression Bent , in knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be lucky in the habit of making it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suppose that I felt abd I were both brought up by hand . "
On the other hand , the dialigues are simple and smaller :
" How we we we are here , " he said , " The question being whether you 're going to be allowed to live . You know
What a film ? "
" Yes , it . "
" Do you know what witfles is ? "
" Yes , it . I
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is exposed to what the characters say .
It uses a nice vocabulary , uses a lot of metal cerbs and abstract conceprs which are usually inspired by concrete things .
The math pointed in the first chapter is a good example .
Regardless of the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
The third said " Who d 'ye wigh ? "
This is written as it is said , making it realistic .
Notwithstanding , this novel is narrated by the protagonists .
The events are nqrrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic door - line without falshback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
The second hcapter makes reference to the first and teveals something about the other .
Also , is slow rhythm is debate .
The narrator refeals so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending makes us feel dubious about the rest .
Therefore , I do n't know how the storey will end .
Too mych mtstery and just new facts ca be read on the coasters .
I know that this sport will nor have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief will probably probably probably take up an unwanted advehture that will make him grow up later .
I would like to read a story where it ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
Like another price in the wall , another tombsfone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a story about people , just a regular man who birds while he is learning to live .
Previously , this would have been difficult as the narrator , Clearoy , comes from a person who lives while he is printing .
This is obvious why he makes reference to the fact that ohotography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading the chapter is a pleasure , but it is difficult to help what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is going to transmit .
If the story had a happy ending , then the central themed would be getting more adversitiws ; if it , it is an advertisement story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
She was waiting , on foot for me .
It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew he was adopted once she was 7 ears old because her parents told her about it .
She did n't feel sad about it because she loved her parents very much and she felt lovely by them .
After her 18th birthday , Anna yelled a sudden necessity to know what had happened to her bilogical mother and her dix sne yave Ann away .
After finding the adoption papers , they are contacted by an adotpion company .
She donvinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " very little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bioogical grandmother would be a match or an idney transplant " .
Even though it was legal , the lady gave him her name and her contact phone number of Sarah Fielding , her niological mother .
A month passed by before he had the courage to deal with that number .
They hesitated several times because they were afraid of their mother 's reaction .
After a few seconds , a huge picked up the phone .
At the beginning , Anna did n't say anything , we could n't use any sound .
But then he said " Well , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother " .
After another few seconds of silence , and she heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
the greed to meet the next ray in the park .
She was going to have so many answers to many questions .
Anna will be able to finally lose an important chaptre in our lives and that is that she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holiday to Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day , I was very angry because my parents did n't like Ilariax , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard on the radio to relax Sandman , a Swedrish singer , was on holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I know it is possible and my parents do n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third say , where I was swimming in the sea , I am sure there was a temple in the distance and so there were cameras , but at the moment I thought they were taking a video .
Then , I realized the boy at the centre did n't have a simple way . I was relaxed !
So I ran toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really excited .
Then I went to me and he got a photo of me .
He sat there for a few hours and I spent the best way of my life , doing his some questions and finding is done .
When he left , I was sad but also really happy .
This is certainly the most exciting part of my life .
L'Albero , the best Pizza West of all
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always angry about is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .
As you wanted the restaurant , you knew the pizza was going to be too .
The walls are covered with trophiex and photographs of the world pizsa .
The pace , family - friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My only complaint is there are so many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult to decide what to eat .
So far , I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must say the most Wind Nala . It 's a forest , flavourful salac thag is served in a boost made of pizza cult .
As a man does , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of the pizza . You are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the great atmosphere and delicious meals , the service is friendly and efficient .
The story is very helpful in explaining the menu to customers .
Also , the prijces are incredibly cheap . It 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
The best places for young people in public
This sport looks at the best place to visit in Lublin for young people from a different country .
It is based on a surge of young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinions as a permanent resides in the area .
It seems that the majority of these eurveyed are of the option that the best place to visit our young people would be Temple Bar .
It offers a wide variety of activities , including a museum , a cinema , a very large green garden with many laws to choose from .
The Johnnmie Rox Pub is ighly recommended . It offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dance perform and enjoy a nice menu in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 3D and a concert for students on Wednesdays .
The public Wax Museum , suggested by many students .
Several people said that the Hational Botaxnic Garden is the best place for students to get a spell time outdoor .
At home , there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students ' preferences and the finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sport started being admired by youth and I imprinted a model of behavior on the Kong 's minds .
On the way , sides of the position stated above will be analysed before my town pefspective is provided .
From one point of view , the athletes ate good models to emigrate for several reasons .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
The man will want to play a sport , which is essential for his health .
Secondly , doing sport as teachers priuceless liufe lessons , such as disvipline and dealing with success in failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something is also demonstrated by professional aportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are not concerned about fame .
They ca lrad adolescebts to believe that money and some are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play more and having fun of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who are disgustinbly .
For example , some do drug or eat in order to win in any case .
It goes without saying that this kind of behaviour spends a wrong message to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages with regard to professional spirtsmen as you are able to modsls fpr other people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes may be excellent roke models for the youth , as long as they present the positive aspects of playing sports .
Tickets by the Bronte sisters use the same styles : realidtic style .
The new influenced by the surroundings in which they live : Dickens the city of London , while the Bronte sisters teach batural landsdape of the Yorkshired .
Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often used the first person nzrrator or the point of view of the protagonists of the story .
The relief is different : in fact , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he made pathos and ckmedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the prices and virtues he wished to portray , which the Bronte sisters use realistci style Place with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic malw heroes and female protagonists that the psychologically complex .
He knew the iplustrates of four different sources of consumption of fish and meat in European countries from 1940 to 2004 .
Of such , the overall fish and meat consumption ranled from nearly 60 gas per person week to roughpy 230 grams per person for weeks .
of my 4 skurce , 3 of them remained in decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
Only fish consumptikn showdd little chance of ruring their period , beginning and riding at approximately sane levels of 52 gframs per person per week .
Both lakb consumption and the catsgory labelled bwef had a declining trend between 7 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with jam consaumption falljng from a peak of 150 frams per person we were in 1879 down to the Red 50 rain per person we work in 200 and beef consumption fallin frokm around 10 grams pe persom ler week how to jump over 120 grams per person for weeks .
Chinese consumptuon is the one source of meat consumption which elborated stable , climbing from 150 grams per point every week to the biggest consumption , 250 per person per week .
Overall , it is evident from the gap the sole secotrs declined , others to and knew remain stead consumption over the 25 year span .

P.S . There is my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .
I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one . I am referring to a huge city .
I visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through my beautiful qsuares and parms and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedrals .
There are a lot of places in Lugo to visit .
For example , you can walk around the car Will , which was decpared a protected UNESCO Wirld Herutage Site in 2000 , because it is the one woman Fill in the world that is complete .
I think that it is also very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists visit bus souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can not eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lu , traditional parties and festivals take place .
money he lost omportant I ca mention Szn Droilán qnd Arde Lucuz .
From 17th to October , Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician customs and folklore .
Another important festival in Sumo is true Lucas .
It is celebrated in June .
During this festival , Lugo becomes the of century town once again , so you can see Roman Marcus , Celtgic weddings , artists baskets , my musical evenbts taling ppace and local people and visitors got into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman emperors .
I recommend you visit in June because Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman lives in Arab Luís .
Sumo is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform percise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the city , the nigger the problem is .
The town is the oargest urban agglomeration in the country , producing large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specifuc wxste disposal Pan , but a general establishes a due ferm August 1st July .
Despite that , there is one plan to increase the great axreas and revitalize the town .
The city is arriving to implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluaying the Council 's eco - friendly proposal .
In accor to the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during between 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86 % of it discardsd inadequately .
This is due to the low effects of the " Recycling Words " program on the disposal problem . "
City X . incinerates hozpital reaidue , in accordance with legal requirements , and sends 7 % of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a point venture with the municipality to sort wages , and show a result 20 % better than last year .
The program reresents 2 % of employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city and many projects such as the " Keep it clean , keep it beautiful " , whose goal is to promote proler disposao in the public areas .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it three " , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city by 150 % during the last ten years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of real and common areas .
A player critical activity are the " Golem Communities " , currently carrying 72 % of the town amounts of consumer vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A munixipal wzste policy this inyegrates private and public sectods and the community is required to solve the current problems .
The city needs a joint venyure to support a fjnctional and sustainable consumption of recycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represents a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the ED report of 2012 and also wins in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Words " problem is caused by this way of training , which ca be solved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a car or between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is not at work , you can find a job and get one before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tired when they find schools because of my exams , so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries . If you have time , I would like to go to Sit , Thailanf or Tina .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first word ad then travel .
or cab find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people in you should go to university immediately after you finish school because , if you do n't , not forget what you have learned in school .
But I think or van also learn if you travel or if you do so , that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related to what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development makes people believe that in the future everything will not be like in science - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .
We 'll have an opportunity to choose the planet we want to live on .
What about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or all the same ?
Imagining the future , I had everything different .
These plant - made and futuristi projects of houses will be the most fesirable .
The houses will have , for example , the shape of a severe or igloo .
Some of them might be turned upside down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of modern art and it will be hard to describe the shape .
What about interiors ?
In a service there will be more machines and robots with artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : Alex , cook , reminds us what we have to do and also speaks with us like an average human .
There There is no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
That 's how I see one of the future .
Max to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !
I really hope to work with you today !
To do the job the position successfully , there is useful advice and information you might want to know .
At the interview , learning interview a good impression is of great importance . They 're some tips on how to do it .
First , meet as properly as possible .
Budinesslike suots and toes fit in well with the occasion .
Euitable dressiny comes across as effective and reliable .
Second , being punctual .
Inteeviewers have to cope with tight schedules every so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's a somehow .
Third , been prepared .
As the old saying goes , preparation is half done .
You 're expected to know something about your company , proper questions and communicate effectively with intervidwers .
If you can learn as much knowledge about your company as you ca up irons , you really make a change in the interview .
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
He stood out in his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbvers all day long .
Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges , so he transferred to the hair department two years ago .
He got chosen very quickly because he always brought Firth Newa iedas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .
In his eyes , what counts most is the lack of reord about the capailities shwon in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you about questions like what you achieved and you up fully about your last job .
I hope what I mentioned above will be of some help to me .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Lots of popes ,
I
Dear Sir or Madam
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at some camps all over the USA .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned positions .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a lot but lack of eight to five - year - olds , and often organized sports and evening activities for them , such as teeasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college cwnteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
Yours faithfully
I found it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanfing overall performance .
Yet , sometimes , being over respectgul may play against him and , although he had gained the respect of all the people he had woken wine , some of them suggested he should build up his spear - confidence , rather than end up attempting to for everyone 's face and taking lwnership for other people 's mistake .
If I was my own language school , I would first year in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the service it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , popular statistics such as it , tender and family type , potential customers and customers as well .
By doing so , I would be able to only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my oroduct and to improve my performance , but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of large markets and some strategies to attract them .
For instance , if a good way to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media use by posting regluar updates about my language school on Gwitter ahd Facebok or to offer discounts for siblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adults ' awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses would have been successful .
However , if the target market is botu , young people and adults , offering discounts to family members could be a better choice .
The last step will be to recruit a state professional , qualified teacher and to provide an attractive and reasonable price for the service I would provide .
Last but not least , I would get udeas and approach customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeds .
Am I OK ?
Have you any thoughts about how you can propose your language courses , for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there is no doubt that natural gas crilling rigs , natural way pipelines and underground storage contribute to increasing the wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the area of natural games infrastructure earn from a few to several percent compared to those who live in other regions because the infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is the developing natural way inudstry equaks new jobs that is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
exploration and extinction of the same gas will create many new jobs in every different branchrs connected with the car industry . For instance , in exploration , singing , production and distribution of shake gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastrcuture will also create vacajcy mobs .
Even if companies will have engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgroath in a number of positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to sleep somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in ghastronomy and hospitalitu sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted a research which showed the Roland benefits from extracfing and developing the infrastructure of sharp as
Breeze is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
When planning their vacation , a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Greece by cab be far as the use so many choices .
There are some travel desginations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
My beaches , crystal clear wallets and friends ' kocals are not the only things that do it apart from other islands .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the necropolis , Muserum ad ghe district of Mohastiraki are just some of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but it leads , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
After that , having beautiful sandy beaches , being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports pxrks ghere , which are extremely fun !
Summing up , breeze is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the day or if a few days are going to be enough .
From my personal experience , I believe that it 's better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organised to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery .
I do not up a plan to study all the books we had to go through to the exam plux reviewing THDM twice .
The main required my commitment for around 12 hours daily for almost 3 months .
The new era is warm and perfect discipline . I am able to get very big scores in my Surgdry tinals .
If I did n't had such an organizer plan , I would never have had such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not going stresxed before the day night .
It 's quite normal to pass this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when trams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is anxiety due to the plethora of stories you have n't finished and are included in your team .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to reflect on my studies thinking that I still had enough time to do my exam .
Before my exam , I realized that I had run out of them .
I am insomnia behind in my room . It was n't enough that I was n't well prepared . It also my nerves gotg torn up and that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in due time in order not to be ovrrly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I was to get a high score , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before the exam at an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the roadlines of the subjects , but this will never help you to details and understand the concepts listening beyond every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can call that time when I was quite ill before my Anatojy WXAM ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .
In the exam , I had a question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I had practised a lot and memorized that foncept before , I was able to remember it .
It was just floodkng without so much effort .
So , for us , having enough time to memorize and practice for a year is going to help you a lot in our way .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation pad is much better than having a few days to bed prepared . If you want to bet high scpres would perform well , you should start studying from one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one only aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy is a bane to replacing foseil fueps .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't needed for the environment .
The Carvon dioxside emidsions is very small .
The biggest text is the explosion .
However , technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are becoming safe .
Secondly , nuclear power plants are very popular . This type of energy is the lowest to replace fossil fuels .
Ednergy which we get from sun and wind is still only a few percent of every production .
Thirdly , the construction of a nuclear power plot is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most expensive thing in nuckear lant is to hire quality people .
Besides , we need something that ca ork all the time .
It ca n't for making energy because the weather is " , because people need a lot of electricity .
If we run out of power , entire cities would plug the chaos , and this is unacceptable .

" Jane ,
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've got some research to find out the best savinhs avcount between you .
Before you can find a few suggestions of mine .
That thing and you might get quite a great offer for you .
Firstly , the age of interests is by 9.8 % , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a thing acxount in the man , you will be a diary as a girl .
And you do n't need to lay on annual chxrges to have a credit card .
Unfortunately , bank notes do n't have branchex in Britain .
And banking operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , as many branches in the UK ( even 62 ) , so you can make all bank oprrations on the spot .
But there is a service change for owning a credit card ( £ 12 ten year ) .
You do also get a gift like a new account uolder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need them ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first service account in the Phone Bank , since the rest of interest is her and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .
I doin operations by phone are usually very easy and they always have a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Take care and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

I have been surfing for most of my life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to the skirrs use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up , I worked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would ask me to a gentle slope wash my brother and leave us for a couple of hours to go skiing in our town .
The temperature was several degreeas below zero , and you could free if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My mother hoped a natural talent for the sport , but I felt a little uncomfortable and scared .
Little by little to improve my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays , we have a lot of skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skating is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking new lessons with an experienced instructor using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school shbjects and first experiences , I have no doubt that the preference I 've selected above are accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in business .
The subjects I 've studied at my high school level , such as financial accoubting , commerce and economics , have given me the opportunity to utilise and put into perspective knowledge of understanding business concepts and have given me a solid academic foundqtion .
I 've also participated in various group work and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a Bachelor 's degree .
I would love to associate it with extremely talented students , lectures and even professors in order to receive a week 's introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preference I 've selected .
Academically , I 've always been very determined and studies individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the artwork necessary in order to achieve a Bachelor 's degree .
I also have an indrubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Studengs Associqtion ( BhSA ) , Head boy ( junior prefect boy ) and captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield orle .
Undertaking a scholarship so admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school to a business settings , as well as development fhe communication , organization and numeracy skillz I have acquired at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to do some research on the Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
I found out that the Czech Republic is a country with great possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently developing rapid wocial changes and transportation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Check university provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern courses with outstanding abilities , safe and affordable education , a warm and friendly environment and cultural duversity .
I believe that I will have an opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one of the safest and stable countries in Europe .
Above all , the high quality of education websites makes me ready for the future .
Another major reason why I am motivated to study in Czecn Republi is the lack of finance .
Also , education in Nigeriz is not a joke as teachers and teachers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Niferia is safe !
Right now , I am really looking forward to the challenge of university academically , social and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn his business concpts voupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities in community service , would make me a competent addition to the end of my proposede yniversity and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposal university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy environment environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the commitment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing to my proposed university in mind than me .
A lot is man 's best friend
It is a well - known fact that people need to communicate with other people .
However , life is not always satisfactory or taken into our society .
They feel relaxed in someone who they would feel comfortable with .
The best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .
Tom 's personality is one of their best qualities .
Always friendly , bully and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
They feel when the master is sad and react by curling up to him .
It makes people forget all about their roles and concentrate on the things that really matter .
Pig 's kptimism is by far the best way to bring a smile to people 's faces .
That is that there are there for , to make people happy .
These haity four - lsgged animals are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to watch on their humor family .
So if they sense that their own might be in danger , they immediately react by working at a person or a thing that they might have passed .
The stranger the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the pig 's reaction would be .
It is believed that doing requires a lot of attention , which is not so .
It is really not too hard to take care of . Bathing in grloming does n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These acts add a few lacks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and doing some physical activity .
So having a job could also remind them to live a healthier life .
In conclusion , to make all those pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that you do you harm , but this amazing personality and the love they say to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
So if someone really loves their people , they will find me to pay a lot of attention to them , because they truly are man 's best friend .
Hi John !
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you soon details about my experience at " is a advenyure " , one of the most well - known Centres in our country .
First of all , we started with a trip assault course , which consists of climbing up pretty sharo wlals and crawoing through different obstacles .
Although it makes me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
Luckily , I do not enough to finish the exercise without having any problems . However , you might need to gain a little more before taking on this activity .
Climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Despite the last year turning out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summer .
You ca n't imagine how rewarding the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort ! .
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeinhg . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the last activities offered by the centre was driving .
I felt so overwheljed that I had to five it up , so if you do n't want to miss out on this great opportunity , just your trainers , since and highly qualified .
To sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers met with the safety rules , so you 'll enjoy it a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
For all these reasons , this cxentre is really worth a visit .
Write soon and let me know if you want to know anything else .
With best wishes :
Daria .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on the desk in my room .
I checked the address as quickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Pwris ...
My mother had written to me after months !
Once she left for Paris , I had to live in the school residency , which was n't cheerful at all , which made me feel really depressed .
But I hold her better at last , so I started to read it immediately .
She told me that when I was on holiday I have to buy myself a plane ticket to parks and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
It felt so good when I saw that my brother had n't forgotten me .
I have never travelled to Europe yet , so I am really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my bellved mother in the city of love .

Education is a milestone in my life and having a good education is the main room to the labor market .
The parentsws disappointed with the educational system and institutionalized education that to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling mah szeem , according to some of these parents ' opinion , " a paved road " , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's hard work and this encourages us to seek other routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be considered a world - wide phenomenon except in a new country : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can bat .
The sorts of countries that do not
Except for homeschoolihg as a legal alternztive so , and others say it is just an isolatred happening .
The situation in Spain and be assessed as a " legal vacuum " in life of our constitutional dight to free
eductaion meanehile attendance is compulsory in elementary and grade education .
Educational and emotional freedom supports this alternative way of learning .
Homleschooling may also free up time for complelentary activities such as music , sports , and even family lives .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardzie tezt an ice recognition of prestjgious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids , you are late to considering the same number of roadbhlocks :
The lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , end up bringing a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned , I want to think about homsechooling as a wake up all of educational
Systems .
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , technology opens up as " The
Pollution " and blenedd learning is the future .
geographic and natural environment around the building span , as well as the neighborhood , would be definitely taken into consideration when designjng houses of the future .
Obviously , the future will ineicates a home with more technology and very energy - efficient systems .
If you are exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and food , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
steal or concrete structures could give the damaged effort in this particular matter .
Environmental rfiendly buildings will definitely definitely definitely be definitely on the drawimg obard .
Build with recyclalbe or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be easy to fit in daylight on sunny days , not to mention skyligjts and poor panels on the roofs , which are more and more popular even on those days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors oughtf to be controlled by computers in order to maximize comfort and energy efficiency .
Urban building issues ( such as pollution grpwth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .
Maybe it 's bujlding casztles in the air . I think houzeboats and apartments situated under city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up pace that would otherwise be late .
Although people would keep mulling over how to modernize their houses ( and bargain shout it to neighbors ) , the walls all need a car , most read in a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concert ivory tower .
watch it to use it
The alpha and the opera of a good team is trust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play handball .
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammates and he had to catch it .
Otherwise the opponents will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real team player ?
Handball is one of the most dynaqmic spirts in the world .
Over eighty points can be more mall together in sixty minutes , if not even worse .
This shows how rapidly the game changed .
She lost rail can make your day the owner of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby , but in the years it became Yassin .
What I love most about this sport is the speed and the unconditionak team spirit .
If you want to play handball , just be sure that you have a good tram and do n't forget to have fun !
Triathlon : A fgamous slort throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practicing a lot .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work for and , as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport an effective way of taking the stress off our bodies .
In fact , we can see many people jkogging and cycling the cays , whether it is in the morning before going to work or even faster .
Despite being the most popular sport amongst alleys , many more are just as interesting and profitable .
One of them is biathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a picture between three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and , as a result , it can be extremely demandiong .
What I enjoy more about it is being able to do it anywhere , which means I can do it near me instead of having to go to a sports center .
It also means I pursue the location that most plrases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to buy it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand the improving in such a demanding sport requires me . It is important to establish some days in order to stay motivated .
You must not waste too much .
A gap year between school and college sounds like a great idea for those that have to decide what they want to study .
However , there are some questions about whether it should be everyone or you .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gal year to earn money to help with the bills is time we spend .
But that is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most people think that the best thing is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true . You can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer stuff , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , my teens who use a year off end up spending it in the wrong way .
For example , things might have gone out as they expected for many reasons , such as not having enough money or not getting a mob .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all played and known how shown that the shade the possibility to do something useful with their time .

" Carer sales of him " is a fantasy story written by R.R . Tolkin .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of times , the fame of the village of Gas , which faces a hard againmst work by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chtysophylax fomes and devastates everything , he sets fire against them , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining huge treasures .
At the end of the sky , sales becomes an independent kiri .
I liked this story first because I have fantastic stars , especially Tplkien 's life : they bring me to another universe , making me get everyday - daily life .
Secondly , it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional levends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights believe fesrful and incompetent and clothes are made with words instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic sale , based on the comical gust of Latin winds , makes it extremely pleasant to read .

Will traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling means hroaden your mind .
When you visit different places , you go to different environments , vultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a two basic sequences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to be the way in which other people have , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
They can help you to understand that if everyone has access to many things you do have access to , and to raise than people people should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even feel rather , which is a basic resource and we tend to the for granted that everyone can see some water to drink even though this is not true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we meet there are many different cultures who eat different food from our own culture . If we see how different from one another , humans are .
For all of these reasons , I think travelling realky bfoadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully - fldeged researdher and academician .
To flufill this dream , a PHD degree would be the most essential footstep .
I am mlstly lso interested in pursuing my Paz in theoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study the equilibrium propwrties of condensed - whose systems .
I would also like to carry out my research into the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as srugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materiasl and as phofonic axnd optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical chemistry and Environmental chemistry are the interesting fields of chemistry because of these numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation an intgellectual capavility to build a career in one of the previous mdntioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of the University of Barjsal .
There is no future for public transport ?
The number of cars is growing rapidly , however public transport is still in ours .
Especially in big cities , where there are traffic jams , public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidren to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use public transport .
But what is more convenient , own car or public transport ?
Well , it depends .... When you travel in your own car , you are independent .
You do n't have to carry about your schedule - you are different , so it 's your decision whether you want to go or play longer in some places .
You can listen to your favourite music or radio .
You have to book .
However , as a lover you always have to be careful and watch out for the role .
If you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
It follows going to see much more at your pace .
The thing about the costs .
is how much you can get for petrol nowadays .
Consider as well so many days you have for vacations .
Maybe cheap arilines are better ?
But bad for our everyday life .
Most of us live in big cities and face problems with traffic .
What if we use public transport to get to work ?
Well , due to n't having to worry about the parking pace and not reading more backs on the way to work .
Simply , you can use the way you work as an additional Bye for yourself .
What should I do ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology is important to you , just think about the pollution .
Let 's rflect one again : is that a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : Yes , there is a
. Is travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
By using the first narration ?
The first narration could attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion and made the rwaders get into the thought of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in the fiction , the author invites us to know that beside the madman 's mind .
Feeling that the main character was talking to us , as if we were not involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like a real happening .
Using the order directly makes the horror penetrate our hearts .
For do these auhor create a word of horror for these reasons ?
The other created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mijd and the sound of hewrtbeats .
First , the scene that describes the murder means readers ca n't help themselves smerging the imagese in their mind .
But like a man 's own car happening reigns in front of us .
Then comes the sound , the heartbwats .
In my opinion , heartbheat is the element that pushes the whole story to the climb .
Every time he was south of Heartbeat Starred housing , something was insured .
The first time , when we madmsn heard the heartbeats of the old man , he had found to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time we madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excuse and insane . In the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the course .
At the same time , the geartbeats also made the readsrs nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think he had to autho wanjted to express the disordered jind of the barman by his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the function , he confessed the crime . The madnan uses an intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell me through the process of the true thing that he had done .
We share a contract for he came and the cruelly , gives us a strong impression that the main character is totally insane and crazy .
Shievring insider our hearts , and horror increases .
" Let 's go to the first to see the variety of animals which are found there " , a told his friends one sunny afternoon .
When we set off , they started their turn to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around , trying to find different types of animals , such as birds , rabbits and deer .
Max and she took a walk under the great fun , actors live . They saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass . " What 's what ? " , I said aloud .
They ran quickly , closed the rules and they reached the place where the animal pals . " It 's a beer ! , its law is in a trap " , Max 's friend shouted .
When they were the animals , we could see that they were suffering , so they decided to free roe deer .
By this decision , Max gook challenged to open te Yep , but Peter did n't come because its dig was injured .
One of Max 's friends bought water from the right to get to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure those animals .
Afterwards , they found a better place and walked away slowly .
The day finished , Max and Bis Friejds returned home feeling happy because they saved the animal 's life . " What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he hot it that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
probably not , but there are many people in slow - business or politucal life , who are ready to do everything to have their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their jobs or because of their sfandalising private lives .
If you decide to become famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to complain about paparazzi .
There is a while , probably , of the most important in public love , that has more or less : ' It is not important what you are talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most celebrities follow this type , as it is just what they are living now .
This is why they are often to get information about their private life .
The real problem stadts when a journalist inmjures a celebrity , in their friends or family .
Paparazzi and careful in contact with famous people 's children , that can have negative influences on their emotional developments .
How about those who do n't want to be popular because of scandcals ?
Most , are just doing this job as well as they can , reading a long time .
And when finally paparazsi noice tuat there is nothing interesting in this lie , they just leave the plane .
Summarizkng , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with a journalist .
And I hope they understand , their city is to save their relatives .
Great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
As a person who likes to me , I consider the environment , quality of food and price as the many factors to decide where I should go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lksbon named " Las Fichrras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine in according to then , because of the good and fun environment .
I want to dinner with more trends in order to hear his hand car or Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity of server and the easy service .
We face continuous problems with the orders such as : dishes from another title serged us by mistake , and drinks were served with a considerable Nepal and the bill showed veen withour ssking ( just because we had finished dinner but our drinkas were still on the table ) .
To my back ( or not ) , I met a friend of nine on the day after that told me that she had eaten dinner at " as Fidheras " before and , in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restaurant is terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexdican restaurant has just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got curious about TFHIS place , so I decided to go faster .
" Pistpla y Corazón Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that , I would say , egnuine Mexican food , with lower prices in a great device .
They serve us Nachos " but tomato saucs for free while we are choosing the main dishes .
After choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
We tried " tapas " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , he offered us a sort of tequila to finish our list confirminmg that get plaxes stilo exisfs .
Hey ! I survived ! ! : )
First of all , THANK YO FOR YOUR TIME AND YOU HELP WITH TBE ARTICLE ! ! !

Furthermore , today I have started my 15-dat rehabilitation session !
So I should be back on jumping in no time : ) .
As you know , all was a big puncu righg in the stomwch , which for sure I did n't need ! : ( .
The course and the organization of mouth to be decided ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough , not one of them , only the other participants ) is sufficient to cover all the costs ! : /
Anyway , it again and again gave me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Alta with a while in a walk up heart .
And for that I want to THANK YKU onde again .
Back toms , everything started fast . . I should get used to it now , should n't I ? ? - .
So I did n't have time for much .
I have been totally immersed in looking for jobs and in the translation of scientific papers for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second hand without my head , so that is a big disappointment , to do the feeling of my meeting his expecyations * and fof the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything like me : / ) less money earned that it will run .
" Sorry , I 'm gon na ( 九族 ) use of your native language skills once again : here " You tating his expevtations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I court is the difference between this bunch : be gold enough , brush up , like the trade ; be up to the standard she took .

For Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was n't counting on , proves itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to go back to Dome ( I have been the whole week at my friend 's place , as he lived in Madrid and quite close to the writer 's house , when I had been going every day was well ) , and I started getting things on . Plus I have a rest to my angle , which was very much needed to !
My two - day one - night tie with my mother and sisters went quite well .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and n't , because of the limitations for my Mikel , we could have gone for a short hike .
Tomorrow I 'll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had planned .
I have seen a lot of us , and have done interviews so far , also from English classes ( one company and the aczdemies ) .

Because chatting is faster than writing ; ) .

Talk to you soon , time .

Global warming and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article " world 's ultimate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes mm of warming " , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the process of global warming .
Referring to scientists at the British Met offices , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of parking will be broken - caused by global warming - with all leading to unknown consequences for the future .
The World Metworological Oranization madd known that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as more carbon dioxide on average by burning waste fduels .
These problems just announced recently will be issue to talk about at the UN sumkit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , food leaddrs will be nefotiating about putting the increased carbonb emissione couplerd with the El Niño clumate pnenomenon .
Stephan Beaches , director of the Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate change as the rise of temperatures or the catzstrophe expdcted by scientists wgen global warming rises beyond . . This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , number judo , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics are to his consequences on economy , global secueity abd the fight against poverty .
the stand up for a global deal promised at the UN summit by the member states and therefore , these climate targets should be a stone - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist , Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarkfying thus sttement with the example of Central England , which is warm 20 % more than the goal average .
Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water stress and lots of waste .
Taking the consequences , a " wxrming would be even more dakaging according to the teacher .
Despite the result of a NSaA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass gasp in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10 % that this pdognosis will come true , according to Andtew Shepherd , university of beds , as the study at alresdy bee proven song by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists view global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , the environment and the economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
I prohlem lise in the outdated frameworks in which the IWC opdrates .
Fifteen whaling natioms formed the JWC after half the population collapsed .
The organisation was initially up to conservd whalesx only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
The qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and when one experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be included in the old Heritage Lisr , properties may be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selextion citeria .
The World heritage site is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is protected by UNESCO because they haven't found new animals or plants ; they are endangered faces in the area or have a significant importance in history .
Would Hritage be the place played on Earth which is of outstanding universal value to humanity and as much has been inscribed on the world heritage pits to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy ?
The site is the poetry of the country on its terrutory it is located , and it is considered in the interior of the international community to protect the city for future generations .
Its protection and presentation becomes a concept of the international Woeld ehritage community as a home .
Another advantage for a site to be described on the list is that once a country wigns its Convcention , it has its inscdibed on the world heritage Lost ; the redsulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments to heritage reservations .
Great awadeness lads to a central rise in the levels of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and exlert advice from the working Heritage Committyee to support sctivities for the preservation of its sites .
The disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist are that the sites are hot fundex so they ca n't protect them against risks .
Moreover , they promised in the list of sites in danger of receiving assistance .
In my opinion , these sites are in danger unless they do answer ten criterka should be projected by UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary to try to invent a new way to finance my friend 's natural and cultural heritage .
Cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching flying .
It 's my first attempt and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
Cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collabroation and sfrict discioline .
It teaches us how to become individual citizens and gain advantage of other strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket in my early childhood .
Even when I was a kid , I started playing with boys my age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed fricket religiosuly and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sachin Tendulkar is my favourite cricketer .
I am a fan of their batting .
He has grown almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketng skills , I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about crickwt I will see him to watch the batting of great Blue Sachin , David , and Wide Pointung .
To learn more about bowlimg one should watch Madam , Large and Murli .
I will also advise rrading mre about crickwt on cricinfo.ckm .
There were nice articles , reviews with stztistics on my players and gaze .
Reading biographies of cricketers will also help to understand the inisghts of the game deeply .
Cricket is going through roufh hpase due to match fiximg and betting scandaps .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this ad , will spread wings all across the world and once again be covered in magnificent snow .
I met a friend about a week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my racket test ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped thinking about my life in such a deep way .
By the way , do not know that a ticket Skat is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think it is kind of land , then I do n't know what I want to do . I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
About two weeks before we met , I watched a very beautiful movie called " The Vault in my Stress " .
It 's about a weak couple who are dying because of cancer , and they have different ways of thinking about life and death .
The movie touched me . It made me think about life and about the way people need to live without apprecciate really important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question , I ca n't help thinking about my life .
Now I have the feeling that I need to live alone , but I have no idea what is this " Sorry " .
Before that , I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I should do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary to meet someone new , from another different culture , to make me about what I want .
It is very strange than another person being crazy about a very profound diary of mine that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my racket that I have now .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need to change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
People 's lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .
Unlike populxr understandings of history ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , history is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that means .
It is a cyclical process .
God had it away in the first century " , but then three centuries later it was only a shadow of its last .
one later period , Romans were n't able to make the high quality cejent tha their ancestors were able to make and have technological master over cost a new centuries earlier .
One who can safely say that three centuies from humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and are asked for granted ?
No one assire such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new cafe comes .
But let 's kick the World War hypotbesis before a second .
A Fireworld war is the only see in which there could be a dramatic change in peoples ' lives in the same length 50 years from now .
But there are , today , prospects for a no World War II .
I do n't think so , but on the other hand beat the will do I know ?
The clauses that will lead to a new world we may be in ecistence fighting now for and I know , and no one , or only a few cars wide and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event could serve again as an excuse to come to declare Qtr to another , but the role of undrelying causes that actually led countries to wage or against a mother would have its roots in much older ones .
As the causes of the Second World have had their roots in tents , that was the outcome of the first . A third , hypothetfical war , could have its roots in a car conflict that may well have happened already .
the pet 's not digest into that , that 's all the other toxic thing falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

Subject : holidays and come !
Hi Tom ,
It has been a long time since we got in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can play something together .
My family and I were going to spend some time at the same place we wanted to last year , at the sunshine holiday Camp .
Do you remember it ?
I 've already mentioned how much fun I had there and it was great !
It would be terrific if you were with me . Is it possible ?
Could you ask our parents - parents ?
In this camp , parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistnats and this camp is situated on an entire inland area .
In addition , the city is purpose built to provide plaxes for young people , allowing them to do lots of activities safely .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff and with the time of enjoyment , especially outdoor sports activities !
The aim to swimming pool , the tennis courts , one football pitchj , canoeing courses and so on , but what I like most is scuba diving , where the equipment is provided .
The aim is well - known and opens from May to October and it will be selling within two weeks . It always goes overbooked for the period my parents can make rays off . That typhoon foming with us from the 1st to the 15th ?
I am looking forward to receiving your answer !
I fish .

The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had called asleep on the touch , watching TV .
I got up and I made to say to the front door .
Outside stood and most extraordinary - boiling an : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
I was taken off , so I called my mother , the car was sleeping with the boyfriend .
I came down , but he did not come .
Instead , she started crying .
The man , as it turned out , was my father , who has been missing for 15 years ...
I did n't know if he was still alive .
brother had always told me he had died in a car .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very surprised by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .
In my team I had been gym as an intellectual but now he was in my dining room and he looked like an elephant or something rxotic .
It was very odd at the time at home .
Now we will live together .
Although the most is more difficult , now we all get on well .
It is great to be a whole family gin .
The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .
It is surrounded by Federal buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporstions of the Middle Ages .
There are more groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the modern ones taught them youngsters .
Sometimes , he became very rich .
Each building is decorated with the blazoj of the ckrporation .
The architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of us eat host fats , hips and restaurants that attract a pot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianmized area .
It is an important place in history because it is the oldest Grand Place in Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is more of narrow pavef streers , old and tall buildings and , among other things , chocolate shape .
Recently , several of the buildings he went to have been destroyed and we can not better the beautiful buildings and carvings .
Every year , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the facade of the building while a hug fkr tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is on of the highest rwnked monumentd in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first castle , called Palatiu , was built in the 11th century . The remains of it are still visiblke inside the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in the 16th century , finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until after time to depresentative remnant is probably the known arcaded clutyard .
During the show the visitors are shown several rooms and aparfaments , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with sea - famed twpestries of the Polish kings collection .
Another attraction of the court is vjsiting the Crown Treasudy . The Polish coronstion insignia were scary , and wrmoury .
Apart from the features , there are also marvellous exhibitions in the Castle congaining itfs history as well as the other corrections .
While visiting Aawel Roywl acstle ohe canh not fit xeeing Dragon 's fun - a car under the castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its east and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of Polish history and culture .
Everyone will find something interesting in the variety of exhibitions and this , and , for certain , it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was a years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am a very lucky man because I have the opportunity to learn English in a natural way , without books and taught lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn to speak , sing , and among other activities in English , in a way similar to how we now learn our own languages .
Moreover , I have travelled to England and lived in English failies for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was sixteen years old .
So I grew up thinking I could spend time writing quite good English .
Even though I do have little technical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understand in a normal conversation , and I can read an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
One day , I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking it would not be very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enrol in a creative ariting course in order to practise my writing skills .
Along the course , I had to accomplish some writing assignments submitted by him to be evaluated by my peers .
And there I realize at least one thing : the first one is that it is possible to learn how to with better ; the second one is that even when you can make yourself generqlly understandable , it is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses more and less hats , but it could n't be a mark show if he did n't know how to perform the sick .
In the same way , I am the ideas and the goods but I have to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I want to do the magic truck of precise a stylish warning .
adolescence .
Everybody says it 's the best period in our home site ; what they do n't remember is that it could be the worst .
Adolescence would be compared to a foggy patu and even when it seems you ca seem something three it , in reality it does n't .
The awfhl ofg is composed by our uncontrolled nations .
Everything is unknown , but we try to present that we know a lot of things .
That would be one of the reasons why we get angry so easily and so often with other patents : every time we desclver something new or we say something , they judge us or make some long speeches to try to change our ideals .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that the confused oue mionds .
As I said , students can be very confusing and if there 's a thing that girl under our skis is when moms can do something and they yell at us to do the opposite one .
The worst part is that they are angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clear ad they they always get any as they 're surprised when we very mad at that !
It 's true that we should always be respected , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provide us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with a parents is to find a sort of sccordance , because in the end , we do n't any form of anger fix them but also a lot of love .
Love . That 's a new farming thing adolescents have to face .
It 's in the normal they 're used to me , as close to family and friends , but it 's a new kind of one .
It 's a kind of hope that ztruggles ; it makes butterclies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tui .
This kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the top of jobs that does n't make us feel sleepy at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is " score as exiting .
Adolescence is like this . There 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you know he did .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interesting shop in our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice summer and , please , feet at home .
In Mallorca there are a lot of places to visit , but I would recommend a nice place , without tourists , Rose and crowded beaches .
To the east of Mallrca yopu found a small and beautiful village called Arat .
In the municipality , all will find a counter ton , situated on the edges of the mountain range .
I Colònoa de Sant Here is a traditional fishermne vlilage .
Nowadays , you can still see some vishermen foshing on the seashore .
Here your adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination , you must ride a bicycle and see a panoramic view .
You will ride until Ca lps Cans , one of the most rnigmatical beaches in Maxllorca .
This one is part of a protected arrow , a natural Bade .
For that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said , " . he camino al and " .
It means that we must important the day , the journey .
Going on a walk near the seashore with the brewze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Loz Canw , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There ate a lot of trees called " tamarells " , native terms of most of Mallorcq .
Moreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restoredr .
Finally , you will get to be Los Cans .
It is a special deal with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
There you can practise different soorts .
It is a perfect place to go diving because there can be different fish , sea urchins and seaweef .
There you can also take a chance and middle in the sea .
A car drom spotts , you should not do different cultures points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificarications which used to keep the small boats of the local cishermen swve crom sorms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical twoer called " Talaiot " .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear . e.g .
Maybe it was a defensuve tower or an important building for high - class people .
It is important to stay on the beach until the sin goes down .
The sunset in the place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Trxmuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúsia bay , lack of the mountains range of Tramuntana and the type of Formenjtor .
Ca los Canx is a mixture of me , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it . Of course , I need to do you a favour : Please , keep our secret .
Regards ,
Paula .
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to outline the bus and the worst qualities of your centre zfter ear Winning .
This report analhses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
The gym .
The machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
The swimming pool .
It is ideal for people who do n't come because of its length , about 20 metres .
Furthermore , it is not too geek , so it is excellent . People who want to learn how to swim .
On the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from the facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes to the plave to another .
Conclusion .
The facilities are quite mover and the stage and excellent . The gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you will put readers to avoid colds in the passage away from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
The Future of public transport
When we imagine the future , we rarely imagine overcrowded see a rusty subwsy train .
As technology degelop and becomes cheaper , more and more people by personal care .
A car allows us to have last and not to spend money on others .
Travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Does rhis akl mean that the years of public transportation have come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a cat .
Students , children from families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars ca also try public transport .
Science fiction often xepicts future as a world where cars are used freaky .
Anyone can see the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do n't have inborn driving skills , so even in the future , children and tednagers will need public transportation .
This is also the same for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least because the nearest ton of genre .
The pie chart above gives sdome information about the average monthl salaries of buses and doctors in our different countries .
According to the court , the two countries with the last salaries are Country A and Country B .
The ones called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
Otherwise , the country with the biggest saliaties is countfry C ajd coumtry D. Differently from the first two countries , one was called " destinatio country " because the healthy cab service is provided by foreigners and quaqlified workers .
Moreover , in the first those countries , doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse , apart from the car country , Country D. In this one , I see the gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in those countries .
In Countr D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conclusion , we ca say that , from the knowledge of the doctors and nurses , being abroad is a much better deal .
Spring is a common , well known and well loved sport in most countries in the world . It is also punching , dangerous and disilked to the extent that people want it to rain , possible with good reason .
Boxijg is a dangerous sport . There are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and then diseases .
All professional boxers are at his face been killed in his best night .
If not kill then more likely paralyses .
There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few lovers having trahic lossrs without their monks .
This is out from the elite few , and there are many rfom who help them .
More details would occur through boredom if it is very boring .
The port would go underground , there would be no safety measyres like goes , a doctor , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if someone was unable to continue .
When he goes on , the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogz eho were trainers to talk and magic in similar underwear . Fights have already proved difficult for innocet people , the new boxer would be even more at him .
Once moving is tanned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable , there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully news all round interest in violence will make tin and cities a much safer places to live in . There will be less fgighting outside pubs and clubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reason .
Changing the rules of being slightly would improve the safety risks of the sport and not detrzct form that entertainment .
The aim sodts of the proposals , length and more cushilning gloves could be worn , ban punches on the road , headfuards more or many fights shorter , as most of the serious injurues occur in the latter rounds . They would also show off the Powers ' skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt , he will face serious consequences in later life . xiseases that attack the brain have been known to get as a direct result of going , Even Myhamed Alu , who was famous ) but I had bolxing anjd hiz quixk - sighted intelligence now has Alzheimer diseas and fan no longer do my everyday acts .
and other sports , more dangerous than boxing , motor sportw and and mountaineering riks ae reak .
Love close to know , but as racjng drovers drkve .
In many of the majority works of modern literature , there ca be an emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strength by these weeks 's characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contributioln to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is the conflict upon which the stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each jinority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature and to are catagorized as merely the result of the heart of oppression .
Rachel , thus the wee - changing and easy - challenging aspect of monority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individual as both a product of means of struggls and a work inherently different than any other .
In the minoritgy world , the conflict and rebellion present accuratepy reflects society as a whole , and although the other in the Day Ludk Vlub rebels against such forest as arfanged marrisges , in Like Water for Chocolate , fights to overcome old family traditions , in the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to cure their inheeent rjghts from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce between cultures . Julie , too , reeists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , in the murderous Homes in Jazzx rwflect Tita and Pedro 's destrucitve passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .
Rebellio and copnflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of uathority are particularly oppressive in words such as Lkie Wster for chocolates and The Color Purple , other minoriry works influding Love Mledicine ajd Jaz do n't respect the clearly defindd authotitarian cigures or the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responive actino which the obviously mentioned works show .
This was impliew that these etnic American pieces of literature should notf be catagorizer as mefely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
Does Voltaire fackle the question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurencw is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criticism this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher played at Thhnder - Wee - Tronckw .
The whole body is a critocism of l'optimisme .
For example , when Candide is forced to join the Builgar zrmy he is beagen allowed to eat at Candide and not worry himself because he knew it was for my own good - in fact , laude in the appearance he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this could seem to be good , it is not because he is running . He kills two men , a new and an Archbishop , with no hesitation and they proceeded to kill his zweethearts brothwr .
The Voltaiee show is the dance of l'opitmisme wen Oangloss , Candidd abd James and caught in a bad study at sea in which James is crowded and there are only three srvivors , Candidate , Pangloss and a saklor .
The story was caused by an earthquake which destroyed the citgy high Candise was sailing .
On arrival they had starvation dceath .
Canride is obviously horrified , especially when they sawilor begihs pillaging the city .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer , but Oangloss cfan pnly tells him that he some good way home .
Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , appeals to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true that when he arrived in the new world , South America , he how to read his dance Cubégonde with the Commissioner of the police .
Candide can not be positive . good can come of this , especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him milling under Je , the Archbishop , because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout this book we begin to go home . Canidde is gradually led away from l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly , its l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant belief that good and comes from bad is n't actually inspiring but leads to rows of disasters .
Cnadide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder " Wee - Tronck because he embracrs Cunégobde , he is used in the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost kjlled as part of an art - da - up , he likes churches , he is almost Garten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .
Candikde 's life is governed by his belief that gold will prveail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégone Bu Sue to the beautiful young flkwer tuat he loved .
We can become crazy and be worse by the car .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide haa travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he would marry her despite all the trouble which he had gone through . Of course , in the end , he does get Cunégodne , but at the price of her appearance and personality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows the philosophy of optimism is one of repair , not hope .
It would be tempting to think of the various European Fommunities as an embryonic United Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of Europe Winy .
However , it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
When I origianl 13 American tates resoved to for what is now the United States of America , they were interns working in a poliutical as well as an economic entity .
see well prepared to feel as much of their own sovereginty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political forum .
A galance was struck in the constitution to allow the individual shades as much self - gvoernment as possible while ensuring that , for example , in military matters , the central government speaks for all .
It is time than today we are still near the old dispute over state sovereignty and the attempt to return home powers to the individual gates , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters exrernal to the United States , the government in Washington represents the same polciy - making pony .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries in this world produce a formidable international military fine .
However , it is usually clear that while there might be some unified physical action flowing from the European Communities ( such as is seen in Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands disputw ) , the Communities wer intendwd as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably lexve the community by a simple majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something no state in the United States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long way from a Snigle Larliament for Western Europe in power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market , the guns between the UK and Europe are very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament will never be challenged .
The ability to make a great law - made by it or Europe - jeans at it remains law sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws that would unitge it fulky with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it would tomorrow repeal all the past .
The fact that Parliament does n't bind itself or in both be bound by a pokitical body means that it will never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the average jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us during of our zenophobia wishing to be fully integrated with Europe .
Even now , the channel tunnel hzs joinerd us to the continent , we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world , standing alone against a hostile wand .
Naturally , the problem of a single role would end as deeply as the benefits that we could presumably , ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the most centuries , the British has always considered itself to be reached by most of Europe .
Whenever necessary , he has caused herself to European powers , such as in times of of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , the car has been more concerned with her overses empires than anywhere else .
In this letter century , though , her empire has diminished and she had to have mounting respojsibility in Europe .
Because of our history of isolated sovereignty , it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based pargely upon precedent , that is judge me law .
We have established a system that dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and expected .
There is very little European influence on our law . Of course , in many respects it will be the same , but the pack of influences will displsy many differences .
With the formation of a single Europe , news laws will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The British tend to be very proud of their possession of the day , the changes may well cast illfeeling and discontent .
Of course , the same point will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
like there must be one system ?
The country is typically against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
Our individual monetary system I support , could be seen as a symbol of sopvereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems by aliens would igs fundamewntal political concepts .
Of course , rbitain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other options of the union .
It has been suggested that the jungle Unipn could be used on a basic rederal structure , thereby local autonmoy could be safe , but I think universities as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when united , European cities would still , in essence , be divided .
There will always be aspects of society that others will never accept .
Europe as a while , raises the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , like Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federlaists achieve their aims in a European city , they would do their best to achieve ddmocracy and promote its nationality , so that individyality is preserved , and that all of its positive features will be known .
The problem facing the British people really results from the isplated past .
The sovereignty of the nation has been flats , and the fears of loving it are very green .
Whether this could happen wants to be seen , and would dependf completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the Federal oublic and the citizens peading through cluntries .
With 1929 now only a year ago , the question of what a Single Eurooe will mean to Britain becomes incresaingly relkevant .
I firmly believe that the advent of 12 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This also must not be negative .
In fact , in political , economics and defdnce terms , I feel that realisation of resources in and will be very positive .
To a certain extent , I may be guilty of having an island mentality . I would n't go as far as to Britain is in danger of handling control over facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
throughout the world a kind of channel is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process will continue and Europe and the rest of the world will evolve with or without the participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making high risk eventually decided to new world border .
However , to be fully involved , sacrifice must be made .
Each safrifices knowledge invllve certaih aspects of our sovereginty .
In relenquishing asnd tyus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminosh the wtrength of individual nations , but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world share .
As demonstrated by recent events in fuel , European cooperatiin in the field of defence may be impressive and effective . Although I would be reluctant to hand over control of eefence to any central Guy .
I can see a future for some form of European raspid readtion force .
Write to an expert criplping defence costs could be This would n't necessarily lead to a reduction in the time of defence available .
In popitical terms , regardless of legislation , Britain , like that of Europe , is becoming increasingly cosamopolitan in terms of the population composition .
The North Sra will increase to represent a big puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join in with its European partners to adapt to the changes in geography .
Politically , we are living closer together .
Possibly , problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.R.M . is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
While not pretending to fully understand this system , I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflatio while raising growth , with the possible excepiton of the Magic riddle .
In the rest of the simple currency , again I feel that is inevitable .
What is important is to base a currency on the strong currenciesz within the end as opposed to an average - based system .
To conclude , I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain but not concerned with loss of sovereignty the gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the best , I think we will train before the next boat comes .
We are threat of Rome . Signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new " conginent " - a united Europe .
It is said that Europe could not be created quickly , but in several years .
Brotain registered in the European community in 1973 after a national referenxum . The debate began concerning the rbitains relationship with Euros .
When 1992 was et as the date for the singles Europsan Maroet , the debate flared up again , but even how far Vritain should be integrayed .
The rest of Europe needs to prepare for 1992 , but Britain seems to be hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet , would not get used to learning Britain into a Unitdd Eueope because he felt it would lead to a cost of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated markwt would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
Business in other traidng organizagions are preparing themselves for 1992 , in the signs market .
rates will be easier , with no frontier conttols allow free - flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business boo and free competition in the removal of protecdtive practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , its decmialization , the new Euro - pawsports and the pound stering being tied to the C .
They may feel Britain is being bullied by Europe .
Further changes are forecast for Britain , affecting everything that matters , to create a " European Standarf " .
This may make Britons frightened of Europe and tired of " 1992 ane lal thqt " .
A single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
Would the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be dirscted from Strasbour or Brusseos ?
Many people would not .
All the comes when I want sterling is taken over by the CV ?
It may well - but I try Britons have a chance to voicr their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits of a single integrafed narket would far outweigh any nqtional drawbacks .
As this date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons about Europe must increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
As Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
Perhaps it is more of British bwcomes " Eurofied " , Bfitons will wzke up and other sovereignty is being taken away .
Britain has never been geographically a part of Europe .
We are in the LED and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to live alone .
We have a big democratic process , which may not want to solve this .
A fully integfrated market with the British as a full member would be to the detriment of the political system and , consequently , lead to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of talking about a single role in recent years that it is hard to live that it will be on us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a lrobability , the question in the minds of my Britonz is indeed : Will this be a cost of sovereigntt for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firstly , a positive approach .
Looking at things from an economical perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - sitting owing to joining these obce , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
oils , because of being able to look for resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe is therefore a nation to be refkoned as regards competition .
To look at things more individuals have , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should jncrease .
A great potential of ideas from a greater fume of expertts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of the Commission 's new aims , with the idea that if things we wimpler more easily and everyone can understand , people will be happier , but better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideaoly thdn , there would be more equality , pet rube , gretaer producivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a cost of soveteignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that you only have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
we found this matter ?
Well , Britaib has quite a history and therefore a number of traditions .
It is possible that it could become enhulfed in the new Single Europe and use its identity .
Britons ( especially those two older generations ) then feel " lost " said that they do not really " belong " any more .
The next Single Europe will be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there are questions as to where all this ideapism really will work .
Will there be prosperity , best - informed , happier cities , or will this never come off because of politicians bheing unanle to agree on pooicies ?
Britain , although small , more often than not in international matters , takes a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Was it when you got quite a look at brake , its character at least , in integrating itself into the Single Europe ?
No one should dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remaikns hkwever that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more toleeant every member state is of each other , the more successful and Sinmgle Eurkpe will be .
It is up to British therecore to accept this fact was to show an example by reading this way as regards tolrrancy .
When we are able to look at the future in a positive way .
The European community is a unique groupiong of twelve sovereign European Member States committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has been able to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate gdeater movement within its frotiers ; movement of good sources of service , capital and people .
However , the sake of sovereugnty is certainly a must eebated one ; to hear extentr shohld a number and on its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of the European community , before we discuss this issue of soverekgnty in some details .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the first World War , but only after Europe had been devsatated by car was the facility of national rivalry tfruly aoparent .
The political and economic exhaustion of the European states callers for a fresh start and a more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This fresh start is because of the three main actors .
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of our own weaknesses , not having got its age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
The superpowers were economical , militarally and politically stronger through they diviedd individual European states .
Secondly was the convicxtion that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after aol , the two gdeat warz have both been as Ruropean " civil Bass " . Third was the common desire for a better , order world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
One of the first major inventions towards European integration was the creation of the European Dconomic Community , in 1888 .
My membership has grown from vrom through ten original founder countries to twenty - free .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity compared with other international bodies is that the member states have needed it as a part of their national sovereignty and enjoyed it with their own sovereign powers , which they can use to adapt acts , having the force of national lol .
This novel approach to boiling natiobal sovereignty is called " integration " .
The 1970 's a progress in ibtegration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the number states added in principle to the idea of a single mark by 1992 , however each wishes their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that the only way to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many hot unanimousa votjng , but the majority joking .
Many use this issue as a threat to their own reguoations znd lwas , she could fly a shop in sandards if they did n't take him .
The situation is seen as a threat to the country in question . We do not wish to bildly give up their soveriegnty for one European city .
Whether or not the conclusion of the progress in the field of European city is stressful depends very much on the Temple of Europe .
If a feeling of European unity develops and the van is sustained , the threat would subside as a feeling of identiry takes her .
On Britain rkads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
The road network is no longer able to carry the traffic without high - old and traffic jams ..
To rmeedy this government has started addinb a fourth land on some trenches of our motorways and constructing fing rlads and bypassse , with mixed reception .
While the road system is being improved , there needs to be an endless series of roadwlrks which resfrict the highways and cause further delays whether the roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives facing an accident and drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
An easy solution to his mayhem be to use public transport ; i.e . the Railwqys .
People do not like the train system because of its lack of integdation due to the recent privitisatin of different areas .
It is shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
The main disadvantage of the train is , as the rail system and the bus service are normally owned by different companies , it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If services were integrated , there would be a bus table which coincided with the main entrance timles .
Then people would be more likely to watch the train as they would n't have to look forward to a long wall , but instead to a bus or an expensive tax ride .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail sister and related bus services . This will be people of the roads and one is trains .
To improve the main service , trains are not tied to arrive and delart at ten times , i.e . arrive at o'clock and arrive at half past six .
The trains and companies have to live with each other in the main stars have to remain relatively calm , i.e . the same price or less as it would be to go by car .
One basic dilemma with the UK 's all and read transport system is the general rise in population .
This leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport usesrs every year , consequently puttjng pressure on the UK transport network .
The biggest problem with the system is the road rise of cars used outside the major cities .
Most largr cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport , thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods .
Public transport is the obvious solution to the increase in popularity . If it is made code for computers , clean , safe and efficient , then it would break the stfain of the overloadee British ropes .
For commuters who rebularly travel long distances , rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorwsys wnd the transpoet links are constantly extended , widehed and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle . It is only trying to come wit the incdease in traffic . We are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the gaps of vehicle transport is the pollution emitter unto the atmosphere damaging the ozobe layer , creating smig and fodming acid rain . Tourturing the earth we are living on .
In conclusion , I wish to promote Pan , efficient environment and help public transport for the near future .
see modern traffic jams or not a familiar situation to nearly all of the western world population .
If we use cars to travel by disance we find ourselves in a 10 girl tail - back , why do we still insist we travel in such ameander ?
To illustrate my point , if every time I took a train , it stopped for 2 hours on the track , everyone would like it .
So I do we all brist on travelling on the road .
The answer lies in 2 areas . Firstly , the attitude of many westerners is that " it is the right to travel in such a minor ' .
This is , in my opinion , you considerable ignorabce .
I am by far no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone dive in three 's and eat soya bran sup . However , I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic , but it is on our days .
The government 's answer to the considerable growing amounts of traffic on our roads is to ask move . They are not even attempting to address the cause , that more and more people are now diving .
We all agree that we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why do
Do we , the western world ( 5 % of the population of the world ) , have the right to be the source of most of the work at the environmental cat ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of a lot earlier to watch public sports .
Even if we do , the story does most of the world .
We could have dangerous accidents .
The end Beacon , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is delining so much , there is no trying to watch in the morning .
People stopped being trained because of the fall in standards , people were forced to quit jobs , out because they were unptofitable and so were closed and services were broken , leaving more people on the road .
The whole system now forms a spiraling circpe of food .
This has not been ihtensifyed with the case of the railway , to provide all companies with profit - motivated .
The vitae , small rail linka must now be closed . Previously they were subsudised to wake up to loss . All the private companies could afford to do that , so many wells arose , cutting off small towns and villages .
The only way to stay in a circle will be to break it . The only people to do this are the government or ourselves . If we make the effort to use public transport , it will expand into a food service . Unfortunately , the public will have to be appethetic to the idea .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with TVs . chwnnels competing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money . There is a lot of nosiness .
Apart from athletics , it seems to be the only popular international sport which British is still old to be high .
We have superb fighters with excellent chaeacter such as Lennox Elwis , Tiger Pens , Nashesm Haled qnd kur belobed Frxnk Beuno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , doing it is very dangerous .
clown to my head can cause the brain to little about the skills with a cause a train can or too .
Last year , a fight between Chriz Eubank and Michael Watso led to calls for boxing to be banned after Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many tours in low income areas see boxing as ' a way . ' , a chance to make it to the job and earn a lot of money on the car .
This way , however , people who regard posing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course , it is ivolent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have mutual respect for each other .
Precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights , dcotors a few close to the end and have the authority to help them off prematrely if required .
Abmulances are also keen on standing by at big events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do n't believe that ant fighter man entered a professional bnoxing career without knowing the tasks .
Because there are so many buddnig young lovers , to be boring would be insan , since it could almost certainly go underground .
Underground nights are more dangerous since protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Asking him into account and considering that boxing is about hurging other opportunities , it can be said that boring is a relatively safe sport .
Although far less popular , and other ports which are more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Boxinv ' , the competitors are encouraged to use their knees and elbows .
I argument continuous , but for the sake of party in the long term , I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good news for the majority of the British public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be , but basically , that is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the year rules have been made to ilute the sports sadistic , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the heart , his brain moves vigofously inside his soul .
This causes the power to lose many bfain cekls ped bocing fight mad if it occurs ffequently the boxer can end his career and brain damage .
In my eyes , are probably the eve of others . This is reaspn snough dor thw bannijg of boxing .
The sport of car is actually a good sport . The simple reason being that the idea of the sport is ' Once you go out ' . Although this is armed by Chrius Eubajk . He believes he is a sportsman , One of boxinb is an art form , he ways that he does nor spwcifically go into a boring ring to know how opponeny out , to sit on points differences and to live Chris Erubank his jusy reslect mkst of his fights habe bedn won on points .
But there is the opposite - to origins . For example , the first referencs why boxing should be nannies is the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put in a coma by Chrus Eubank ( the main way dies n't specifically go into fighting to find his oppisition ) .
This example of prkves too well with a dangerous so - called ' sporg ' boxjng .
The boxijng fededation is trying to do as much as it can to have the ' spot ' for having strange doctos , banning cars and fighting , but the job at the bottom of the argument is the end blow to the end causes consixerable damage .
There is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is emphasis and exagvgerated when a competfitor in the story tfragically dies .
A recent death in the has inevitably led to a public uproar about the safety of the sport , and the controvesy of whether the sport should be banned or it is yet again at the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider what a professional boxwr would need .
He is clearly aware of the dangers and brutzlism of this sport , which is possibly why he enjoyed it so much .
I have yet to hear my goxer regret his voice of his career .
The excitement of being in one ring , the job of knockinh an opponent to the canbass , ads and the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keeps boxers cighting .
The only thing that is there for things for the very best of the most is ridiculous , and not tipping boexrs esrning sums of money , such as £ 20 million ( or in time Tyeons comebaxk casr , $ 60 milluon ! ) It is hard usrprising hoe implortant thr spott van be to some .
Let us consider ' Sky ' vibes . recently began subscription to view Thsons " me Live Lights " .
The members of the public do n't want the sport to be banned .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a beer , who have been perlanently injured ( or been killed due to a night ) .
The individuals and others learning about the magic incident in the media protest against the sport .
My family , we are usually iriginally against the idea of their own finishing ceremony early to taking up the sport , would be leading the protests against boxing .
How pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultikate goal and became the heavyweight champion of the world , yet how smart many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shovex by so much that whether boxing should be banned or not remains a controversial issue for the forseeable future .
There were 2 ovjections in August , the introduction of the natiobal lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery would be little more than another form of vacation , in fact , when they then , a tax on the poor .
The second main obnection came from celebrities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead of buying a lottery ticket , because some of the money spent buying new tickets wluld go to charity .
There is also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which actually went to Camelot , which nor see as the strongest vontender for the boy : the companies or consortiums promised to give me honey to charity with lower rujning coets .
Richard Bronson promised to move all of his profits to charity . It was rejected .
My personal objection to Camelo as the porter prganiser is that a huge proportion of the consortim are American or foreign firms , but JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British professional lottedy run by his Vritish firmz .
Since introdjction therr gas has been more controversial lver the national ltotery .
When it promised to give 45 peace in every pound to xharitable cquses , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money could go to charity .
The two also been some control of the allocation of money .
For example , 3 million plunds was given to Etpn , one of the richest public schools , or a gymnasium was also given to the royal opefa house .
The letter seemed to be a reverse Robin ohod : taking money from the poor to drive up the price .
The lottery has also offered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratcy cards .
It is usually claimed that it is so addictive most people will spend all their available cqsh on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calcilated 4 pencs of every pound received by the lottery due to charitwble causes , the rest is the price and profrits , and the so - called charities .
We also calculated the chance of running something substantial is one in million , I highly likely .
It is also alleged that the jackpotw was too high for lucky winnwrs Jave said themselvbes tyat the jqckpot had rented their life , alenating himself from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be rained , but not in its present form . I think that the jackpotd should be cappdd at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give people a fortune than to give fourteen fortune to me pesos .
I would also remove any Americazn huisness interesrs to give charity honey to more diserivng ' chadity ' .
Because the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
The computer is one of the most influential inventions of all time .
Computers do dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as any other areas of human life .
In my way , it takes the place of the human brain in doing calculations and thought processes .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathneticians and scientists for taking numerical calcilations .
This made it no longer necessary for humans to perform calculations with throygh eqautions , and so we need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the gednius csientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operators , who need only to know which buttnos to stress .
This can bring an extreme pier , as there is still much in the world of maths and science that a computer can n't calculate , but this may not be the case centurise in the future .
Computers have been used as a means of feeling regards , the same as bug superseeed handwritten Lexi , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and ksyboard in their General Studies exam ) . They are used to transfer money across the glory , even to create artwrok adn to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractao ' pictures , brown rrom equations , seem to be more popular in hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games were to provide for entertainment to any game or activity that takes place in the day , physical worm .
Vkrtual reality allows people to have ' entertainment created to help by a computer .
Whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body and but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations may be contacted at any point around the globe by machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer the fume of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferred instantly without even tending to make the mutual bone - to physical doinage does n't matter . It is the computer records which state how much each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that human beings are no longer iseful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity to cope with anything outside their exoected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgememt .
Human beings ofteb zct without loic or prison , and only human beings can cook and wear their coats .
Also , computers break down , and then a human is needed to fake control - such as an airlind pipot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and that is often among the simplest .
They cried , they cheered .
Their names include Joy , Triumpu , Ride and perlpexity .
The world watches in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the image of the TV , expecting something jew at every home and not want to pass it -- I remember that it was the only topic of conversation at school : " Have you wear ? " , " I ca n't believe it ! " , " Aftrr apl thus time ! " , " I have thought it could happen .
" We all get that we are living one of those historical moments that you read about in the history books and were proud to be a part of it -- It was December 9 , 1989 , the day that the ball fell in Berlin
Within a few weeks , the excitement and , deep down , people turned their attention to the more recent 30s .
I got me , this had been to stay .
It is the start of what our now - rpesident Bush likes to order as " or " sinking of the Cold War " --
It was the event was the end . People of the fast lboc dountries hope that their efforts will down in van . For 40 years , people had suffered under a commumist regime that did not allow me to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
She had been expected -- I had a classmates who had escaped from Hungary -- He was keen about his family and friends , his whole life and bad leave out of Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him if he was n't scared , scared of what he would find once he went --
He told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events over in Germany --
Bolstered by German success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roman tose againsf commuinst regkmes as well -- No , three years later , the community as we once knew it no longer exists .
Whether people are happier or not , I will be tomorrow --
However , they will have at least seen the " other one " .
The struggels and bopes of fifty years will not have been in pain -- the " events of the Berlin Wall " history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be written and as things stand , the Fall of the Berlin Wall eventually contributed to the esurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bkoc -- As such , it was the datalyst force that helped to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the the significant events , we will always remember the way the ball fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do n't speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been one will always be with the closest friends and yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology allowed me to travel to this part of the world . They have provided love our my family , my grandmother 's career , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the field of medicine , science , engineering , and even be less ovdrt corners of our lives .
One of the ends humans have eeveloped is where the greatest problems lie .
And , they do not threaten us , but when they become weldes with certain aspects of and certain people in our society , they become potentially -the most dangerous things that we hold in our minds .
Speaking From my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our tour in particular .
People do that technology development has made our world much smaller ,
If I would occur that a great majority of Americans live in their own persobal closets .
In schools , geography classes rarely , if ever , exit .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
Explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did n't seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have bad effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel its people have adopted the same " I am a self - - sufficient- I do n't need any Me " mentality that will slowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , the culture , and other languages is a very high priority of our educators .
until I was 15 , I was unable to study a foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of languages , German .
Since I was twelve , I have had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of the circumstances , as I mentioned before , I have no choice but to wait until I am twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the United States gas caused our minds to be heard , in a world that is growing . My country was behind in safety self - satisfaction .
Many people nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is for me , we are becoming a nation of couch potatoes .
It is true today , the development of portable calculating machinex ( calculatofs ) means that we no longer need to be able to work out guns in a bad , that case ?
In my mops , the czshiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simple of us without us and of their Smilla .
In many areas , the wail of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .
My sole have had their jobs as commuters .
Having cabinets is becoming a think of most with computer databases .
But when such menial tasks as giving are good for us .
We encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AVT ) , I hear funny tales from people who are convinced that computers are coming alive and all will eventually rule us .
These are just to ranking of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that kind of computer is a programmer .
Even if artificial intelligence needs to be programmed .
Human brains still work on how to use computers , due to programming them and , more importantly , due to controlling them .
As for making the human bran redundsnt computer course helps to improve learning skills , the main beach , test and improve our kinguistic skills .
Reflexes are improved ( and not scuentifically improved ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents may turn their children into ' zonbies ' .
We can exoand oir imaginqtion and fonvert kur kdeas knto computer simulatec moddls , enabnling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has speeded up ahead of than we never knew existed !
It is not the age of the computer .
Almost everyone owns a computer or has access to me .
Computers nowadays are a far cry from the ones in the past which were filled with dooms .
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and effort extreme complex mathematics equationx in must records .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But is being sick a good thing ?
When calculators came along , a change in the ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used to the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encpurage laziness in the general public , shy work on something yourself when the computer cats do it for you .
This is time - saving and efficient , but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , swelling is no longer as important as it was . You can simply use a " spellcjeck " to correct our English , which is absurd .
For the youth of metal , computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures .
The club is argued to be educational .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours at a keuboard tapping lazy in the door and out of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experience for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find this preposterous and people . Using their ability to communicate and form relationships .
Computers van offed escfape off the human - drumk rputine of daily life by means of games , but they are mixed - nursing and T - inactive .
There is , however , a more dangerous threat from computers . It is the fuel that can do the world if man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
The people work with computers are long periods of every day problems .
The reaction of tapping news all day and staring in the street may be harmful and not only that , it is extremely boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Computers may be the future , but what is still in the future ?
There would be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home . People would work every year and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers and helpful people should n't live through their computers can be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain the lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in school I feel that work should be done mainly by many new calcupators and computers should only be used monimally in mathematics in order to help the production of computer addicts and again and formal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include ( the emission of identificagion of harmful hereditary grnetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield cries .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation of genetic engineering has high highyl beneficial effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dialike or prejudiced against genetic manipulation .
Last , this is a ' car of the unknown ' ; something which rampers with intfinsic compoments of plants and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore pfovokes rear .
But people have also become aware of the imjense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
This has been very good to feed popular culture ( I Rim ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reerence point ) .
There is also , however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individuwls who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .
hits the , is an argument against scientists bearing morap responsibility for their job .
Anything in life may be missed .
Whether it be a kitten - life used to say someone , a are used to a something ovet , or something as harmeldss as a pillow user to sufgocate .
Everything in life , if misusec , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - wide or car , this is surely a subnective view by present - day standards .
Certainly , we could not hold the makers of a car or matches - knit responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why science should bear the majority burden or responsibility if gendtic manipulqtion is not to misuse .
The fundamdntal fla in saying scientists must learn the mayor 's budden or take more responsibility for the park , is that if this had been applied nuiversally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and ranking would be without electricity , radio , quite simply , anything above the mud hat ' existence .
Scientific research is not corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition entering itself .
The other funsamental rlaw is asshming rhat induvidual scientists have responsibility . Science is a process of discovery rather than creation .
No - one created gsnetic communication , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientisr is not male , then another one is girl .
It is fair to hold responsible the scientist on the one front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independence afterwards .
The only argiment flr making scientists responsible for the note , is that , quite often , and particularly in the cases of genetic manipulation , it would be a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual svientist could be held responsibly .
But , our genetic manipulation will become common place in the future , and it is not only one domain of scientists . The original scientist who discoveres genetic manipulation can not be responsible for that misuse of it .
There are many problems taming the monarchy .
Some of the same listed below :
The diviskons in their family and the fight between the prince and the princes of cases and the possibility of divorce .
The other problem is that people Lab ( or think ) that they do n't do anything buy the very rich and so they do n't want and gaze .
Another problem is that people think that Monarcyh is bolishing in their countries and many countries are public , so the monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There are also arguments against abolishing the monarchy too .
For example , many people like the road family or they are uonest people , not like the politicians hat always play .
I think the royal family and monarchy is a tradition in the UK and anywhere in the world . The UK is known for its royal family , so I do n't think it should be abolished .
In the " I think if many people at the monarchy published a general elecvtion should be valley and then see if the monarchy should be abolished .
" In Vitro fertlisation " is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboratory . . in a gesture .
The age is taken from her mother and placed in an environment which will optimise her chances of fertilisation by the sport for the false .
Once fertulisation has occurred , the fertiised egg is implanted back into our mothers ' coma and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally , more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
This usually leads to multiole births , .
Twins , triplets etcd .
There are people who are against this , saying it is not nature and it is fair for the child to have their life in a lot of rube , as they believe it starts from the moment of conception .
There are erhics involved whereby Leo is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, that shower treatment should not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on fertilisation for one person who the same amount of money could be used to save hundreds of lives by vaccinaying people against measles , for example .
The people who are for this can argue , saying that it is the right of every person to have their only child .
Women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so in invitro fertilisatuon .
Through no fault of one , she would have a blocked fallopian tube making her unable to allow egg corn to the job and it is only fair telling her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so , ethics and practical guudelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to make certain egulations ie .
1 . Fertility treatment should n't be given to post - menopausal women .
The menpause is the body 's day of talking to you to open and your body is no longer capable of fearing a baby .
Last , there was a case of a slightly menooausal woman who by things about herself dived into vitri fergilisation ( AVT ) .
I do n't think this is fair to moralpy correct the child since her mother would be xlaiming her pension when she was at primary school her mother would probably take while the child was a teenager .... There should be a test that is given before ( AVT ) is married Due to check the water is not as the menopause .
2 .
Eggbs should not be taken to an aborted foetus .
The foetusee will have been abhorted for a reason , for example : if it was the result of a nap or if it had congenigal deformities .
There should be a guideline or law sating that eggs should only be taken from the other and hot from the dead foetus .
Science has moved on dramatkcally since the 19th .
Many things have been invented and many things have changed .
People in our modern times and now able to have a liver , heart and open up transplanfs , there are many domplications and many are successful .
People are able to have a hole in the blood supply if they have the sufficiejt requirements or , a more marrow trajsplant if the blood lacks white ideals .
The above is carried out by the pope , but nowadays , biologidal opoerations can be carried out on humans who are not even born .
forms can start ten days in a test tube .
This is called ' video fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg is removed from a woman and placed in a test tube and the paper is put in to the test tube and the eggs and spend huge together .
The test tube was then incuabted a few weeks ago when we were tired . The baby then inseeted baci in to the other .
The famous is left to go and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby both have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
In Cairo , feetilisation allows me back to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel like part of them . This world would n't happen if the couple adopted .
What I do well is ethically incotrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .
Nature has already taken its mouse to help him . She is too old to the only child , so shy should she have the implanged into her .
It is not fair on the child because when they grow up , all their friends eat play with their 30 - 40 year old parents , others will be drawing hsr penhsion znd I am sure she could not feel like playing with her child .
Also , our mother dies at our age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
The child can also have to look after the other in old age .
As the fetoius begins its life in a test tube , and the sport is selecter , this means that the sex of the sport could also be sliced .
The way a zoo can be chosen is by using genius .
The one has 2 X chromosomes and the man 's X and Y - chromksomes .
One day on which the day can be selected is that the egg is always X . On the sports nucvleus can either contaij an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly braver than of Y , so we can be separated .
If I read a book Y sport is selected than if a girl X is selected .
This was ready to an increase in our sex , and a decline in others ' .
As a result , they would reduce the population as there would be less courses .
Also , what happens if people the year you are born are keen on eating a man ? This would be an unpopular sex ?
Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?
The main reason for the people of Hritain to stop eating beef at the moment is the treat of St .
This is a vital isease fhat attacsk the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
It is common , as we cow diseases and by law and how showing these signhs must be destroyed and it solid against Arat .
The problem is , however , the signs are n't shown for a long time . This is a vital disease .
It can be passed on to humans through eatng pzrts of animals such as the trains which are affected and take part are usually sold and put into fast food such as beef burgewrs .
The rest of the main however , is relatively late and eating , e.g . a steak , offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However , the British press ignored this act and boosted the situation out of proportioj considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Another reason for the British people to stop eating bsef is the push for vegetarians , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the farmers of BSB .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry , oreventing the of British daory livestock not only in Britain bus or export aswepl .
With glibal communications as good as they are now , we could see a scare across the world about British Wee - minded stance and Germany already has rsstricted and sometimes banned the sale or impact of British beef for fear of its safety .
Although British farmers have learned to diversity , daily farming and the sale of weak peoducts stilk formjs the backbone of British agriculthre and completely changed the face of parking in Britain .
After the swutch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , sjbstantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
People throughout the United Kingdom were dpubtless shocked after people ulset by images in the national presw anr television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or H.G .
The so - called ' cow disease ' seems to make the club or a sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Here there is disease as sound was put down before the symptoms developed further .
Those children whivh yad bsen out dkwn weee are not used to being old .
The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid with the spine on the train , and as the animal fluid is usually shit in the face of battle for that , the risk of contamination of the meat as one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease , Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase , or CEO , is believed to be a man from the US , although no clear link has yet been esgablished between the car .
It is clear whether the incidenxe of the Cup is on the time , or whether awareness of the condition is heijghtened , but there are cases where all aims have been diagnosed correctly , and the disease is always fatal .
The government insistz , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .
However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of te diseases in the UK , and many are axbstaining by eating jeep .
and schools have removsd beef from the media , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have showh a decline .
The implications for the beef industry would be rather furious , where everybody boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remajns scdptical .
If beef continues to tell him flour , then the best inudstry 's future will be unflear .
the products at present in foodstufs such as jellkes , fruit Huns , all , of course , stoci cubss .
Would all these products have to find ysnthetic or substitute ingredients ?
Even if the entire beef industry were to give to a fact , the numerous tens of new waffles worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being used as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milj producgs .
Not all cabs were invented , though , and the situation has become a waitkng game .
The area to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJ are printed , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contacted by taking meat contaminated with folrmer .
The natjon awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interest to there be no proven link .
With this space .
Personally , I believe that it is merrly that men are better at diagnosing CJD than ever before .
The replrts say that it can take up to 20 tears to develop , so we could also already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my meat and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There have been high scores in Britain recently that some beef , dontain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the huge equivlaent of CO2 ( Creutzfeldts - job disexse ) .
But it is a disease in most that effects the brain and sliral tidsue ( or offer as it is sometimes known ) .
After a reported cases of CEO , a similar type of the disease found in humans , it is not thought that ' Ka - cow disease ' ( CPE ) is the cause .
Researchers believe that eating beef containing off will transmit the total disease to humans .
This chain has separated from the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef when they are in contact with illnesses .
Already the number of chefs in America has dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to contract CND , part of the cow offal must be cointained with the beef .
Customers are still reluctant to eat the meat since it has come from some ' dogs ' butcher trying to cut pasta .
As you can imagine , this has had a tremendous influence on sales in plants such as fast food restaurants where beerburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is McDonalds where they immediately brought out a notice statint that their beefbyrgers were mwde from 100 % of the first . Pure is a cojtain not ideal .
In my view , no however recent restaurants with a good repuattion would find buying beef in case a custom daught JD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome would mean they would shed several thousands of sounds and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef delay in places of food production , there would be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of that , the price of beef will have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that the need to containimg xontaminated offal might cause Cup in humans , farmers ( in particular beef faxrmers ) are losing post as they will have to tell the media at a low price due to the low demand .
As a result , they may have to diversify to other areas such as crops , making food , etc . or even have to be a government untidy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJE is not strong enough before the claims were released .
It has cauesd an unnecesszry , delicious effetc on the agricultural industry and Parker .
The question of compensation for services rendered is ever so simple as remittin a predetermined salary based on qualificatios and a person 's dedication to the test at half .
If he has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , we will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to gauge their skills and abilities lewss ghan otjers . "
Contribution to society " is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate " equakly ' .
In 1988 in America , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interests of their investment .
The stock market was enjoying a good , and several working - class citizens became healthy and realised the idea of retiuring early .
Several great authors of that period qhestioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who inhsrit joney or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of new thrills , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
Having all unpimited qealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and these two turn their own money early on .
But do they have the right to live this way ?
What about people . were very long yet to see be paid miserable .
A migrant work may snake away in a field all day long and has less money in a way that a healthy person spends on a girl at lunch .
The answer to this question lies in one 's feelings about Demovracry .
She would argue that if a person is part enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inherktance ) , he or she is entitled to it .
A mother viee would be that if someone who works on a mental or physically tyaxing job coes not make a fair or moderate salary then it is hidden or our fault ( or bad luck ) .
These options and based on a rather faulty Amerocan preise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is the end responsibly .
Apparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that offers a oiverpaid .
For instance , everyone seems to think that doctirs take much too long for the wood they do , but one of the doctors aree losering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .
So , unless we wish to improve the personal lives of wealthy people by making the world , or give people who are not healthy money that society does n't believe that reserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past , when he had problems with society rolpe of what they were expected to do in the workplace and at home .
Women have been looked down on if they try to go ahead and pay has suffered with the same job as a man during the time job .
One is the one has a man is required to stay home .
As a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's role is the femimists .
These are group of people that he eefended women over the years .
These people have shown to the modern world what women in dark places do .
The problem is that the feministx have not looked at all men .
So , when happens with all traditions , some waste a bit more on their lies , some want a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that women have to go along with the feminist .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their lives .
An example is military women wanting to see cokmbat positkons wuen at war .
Feminists argued this a log when they Irwq aar was going on .
They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people are crazy .
They just ca n't visit in a car very well .
The car was not strong enough and if caprured could be raised .
The real heat is not care the men and the only ones .
Other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United States is stairs as it is .
Feminists have taken you promoted in work places as it going far .
As usual , harassment is involved in a lot of sails .
Many women believe that they are the victims .
I agree that years ago this might have been true , but now and employees are the victory .
The aim is fear of what a man can do and sometimes women look look at him differently .
There are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .
You could have created us all the time if this can not true .
Feministx and trying to make everyone equal in that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs are being killed by women but a lot of the physical jobs are still done by men .
I think that the traditional rolpes worked a good tie , but modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
Divorces are at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressed , and kits are being more neglected .
modernization is good , but I think that one should not be pressured into this if this is not this .
There will be a woman in the residency , and running a lot more companies .
Home should be created equal , but they can only do what nsture intended tied to do ...
Whenever a movement is begqn whether it be political , religious , or artistic , ztereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religions , or art and quickly lumpsd these categories regardless of individual difference .
His bravery is worsened by the tendency of these outside the movement to remember the radjcal and jgnore the common or ordinary .
This is especially true of the one 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in America .
In the beginning of the late nineteenth century , the men 's Liberation hws were met with daamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny and George Had ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , this defeaitng their cause , because of this aggressive action .
At the same time , feminists such as Emoly Dickijnson were virtually ignored during their lives and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
The ognorance of other less aggressive feministe , made it seem as though the feminist movekent was headed only by side , disgruntled zeallts and we , therefore , detrimental to the good of society .
Although " articles " are as bad and Anthony is dictionary qnd bckward in more standards , the problem still exists .
From the very beginning , the Women 's movement in America has been fought a losinb battle .
However , I believe that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of the observing the movement .
When Women 's a really took off again in the late 1960s , it up again destroyed fort failure .
Immediately , the focus was on radicals pike Stein , instead of the wife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
outside the movement , could obviously see the differences between " normakity " and women 's it .
This is still twenty - five years later .
Women supporting equak pay for some kind and other " lkberal " causes lije affirmative actjon arte only seen in the shade of the Pre - Turning , anti - saving leaders of the 1800s .
Food is the cause of uyndermined by the perception of radicals .
So what ? I meet ?
Now so - called feminists have two in One of them is the women 's movement .
However , the popular perception of them you .
For us , many years are good that feimnists promoye for women has called by car behind in life of other more interesting , i.e . radical ideals .
Like any other aspects and movements in life , they would be more received if they public it were being aimed at Bade .
Within this century , there have been technological advances which have resulted in a drastixally different society than that of a hundred years ago .
Clearly , of the new inventions of this century , the end test that has made the most impact on views and lifestyle is the television .
The instrument just brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see other countries in a way that we needed before .
However , the intention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to return it on to our reality .
television is potential for other wonderful things for its viewers , such as educational programming , children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at xurrent events than n't be given by newspapers .
Television has the lower run all into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the programs production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture mkre gully .
However , this is not the day in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the same range of the master , a lot of people to flee from the onflicts tgey experience in their future , rather than confrknt them and trying to understand them .
In the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a dibersion rather than an educational or , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
billions of America and have fun staring at the TV . at the car toms , watching the cold , sea - operate , and lagoons .
TV has become the center of many households ; and families , the only one that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
P.S . is a major cause of lack of togethernesa found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
or time spends watching TV , the more motivated he becomes ; there is no need to see what activities when he is eager to sit on the south , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television is , therefore , he wanted society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of a year ago .
It gives society another cdreative vein , a look at words which would be seen on no other day , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the year , television has lost a lot of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspects of television offered society an easy escape from problems and difficulties .
Therefore , since the intention of television , society has become more infokrmed too lazy to think about this new information , and has idstanced itself from daily life .
A discovery that has significantly changed many people 's lives and their way of thinking is the epidemic , known as ID .
Though it has probably been around for awhile , its preaence was n't really been known until until recently , and its consequences have been devistating .
TIPS hzs definitely have an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it leads to death and there is no cure .
It causes a lot of prejudices and paranoia among people , which turns them apart .
For example , there is more of a stigma attzched to being a hompsexual jale , but only because of their sexuxl preference , but they probably have AIDD too .
This kind of ignorant thinking is the Breaking us award .
Also , when White , a boy who had AIDS through a good transfusion , was diagnosed , the people of this town and his school treted him like a complete outcast and could n't allow him to attend school .
With new dicsoveries of ISS , patanoia is at an au tiem bigh .
Doctors are discovering the same undetecyable strands of LIMS do exit .
This has really scared people because there may be AIDE and it has not been known .
I feel that has really made people think about their actions .
In the eighties , " casual sex " in the United States was a lovely accdpted job . it is something people really take into consideration and carry ours .
Relationships seemed to be more valuable than one - night stands .
People are starting to realize that they really do have to be a camel , and if more education on his disease . I 'm sure Joe changes will come .
The twentieth century has seen more cars than any other previous period of time .
Though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a cost of people living in love proximity , has rapidly shrunk .
In the second of the world wars , the name was on to create the most devastaging , most powerful , and most ffightening world our people even know .
In my opinion , I discovered and harness of atoms and energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factor of change in our lives , if not , perhaps , in every lifetime .
As missile technology and nuclear fusion factories increased and improved , years began to replace nationality , and put small world erscted barriers between us members .
From my experience as an American , I can remember awsociating communism with nuclear threat , quiet citizens with native - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities of undergrounds , and weapons orbitibg our planet , which day , normal life .
Perhaps this nicreasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our njuclear , will be all .
In a field which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanbitarian issues , my country spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvements , and implementation .
As a common gola abd testimonisl landmadk to 9 presidwntial administrations , the cold war has manifested awesole power and control over every facet of America ; from survival kits znd basement bombshelters to an eye circulaitng cheiof Executive clmmandpost frpm air .
In just the past two years , our family of action has been the dismantling of the Berlin Wall has hundreds of our smallre symbols of freedom , in an ento operation in many circumstances .
With this , the ball , valued Åre , and mental bzrriers are falling , bringing more change that our planet 's seen since its gneesis .
Although the old babies in cars are indeed dying .
In Africa , the military has been reduced by several thousand Grooms , in the reduction of nuclear warheasd has virtually arrivef a standstikll .
Hopefully , it ckntinued efforts , your use of nuclear fashion and vision will run to medium of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other huamnitarian goals .
With the chasing of attitudes , I frigid planet and come again be a warm and friendly person .
The discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .
As a natural antibiotic , penicilljn was discovered to have a bus stop and causing the spread of infections .
The " under - du " led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - ocfcurring antiniotics that could also be coloured " in video " in a laboratory .
This sudden aura of useful compouds not only improved choices of a patient 's survival in a hospital , but also caused great news for medocal chemists to study in classify each new day as it was djscovered .
As discoveries of new antibiotics depressed , chemists began to wonder if certain variatiobs of thee drugs could be sunthesized and also used as medicine .
It was also an attempt to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .
Both of these new attempts cause a need for more research , more companies , and medical chemists , and the industry has increased tremendously .
It was discovered that one drug could be synthesized efficiently while still being biologically actife .
New drugs have also been synthesised ; one was found to be medically useful while the other was not .
A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market which changed what people thought about taking medicine .
It was so much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple ilonesses , such as the common cold .
enterprises , such as Upjhn , formedf qnd grew , and universities had researcn teams devoted to producing efficient sytnhesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compounf le to the increase of heart of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a boring idustry cojprised of research teams in large companies .
The synrhesis of antibiotics and research of their homes still continues today as thousands of universities and companies arlund thew wlrld continue the book of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
Our modern microcomputer ( PC ) has developed at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computers in the 1940 's to the computers of today , they have brought many technological advances and so there has been a tremendous impact on society .
The computer has eliminxted many jobs through automation of factories ; Accounting , engineering , and scientific programs , etc .
The effects of the computer have been tremendous ; However , this phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The compurer hzs makes life easier from a physical standpoint and harfer from a rental standpoint .
The physical effects of the computer are numerous and daily seen .
In offices , computers are everywhere .
From wrod processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have law office work faster and faster .
Automation of factories can also eliminate many kanual jobs .
So almost everyone has at least one single computer , e.g . a calculator .
There are , of course , many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in third world countries ) how abundant commuters are .
The mental effects of computers are not old .
Firstly , computers have made mathemafical cpmputations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand , or their computers ' words .
This has created a surplus of " needless " competitions , figures , etc .
People can easily cvalculus or other types of functuons with a computer .
that many people do not realize is that computers are errors also .
printed , it is the person who " told " the computer what to do that made the early . However , if that person knew what he should do , or better stated " is able to do with a computer " , he would not have erroenous answers .
Mathemwtical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely riddled with drrors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .
Due to his etrors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many " variables " .
Secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
A computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100 % correct ( another perhaos mipossible computation ) , they never make errors .
Thus , supposed reliabulity has yet camped workers out of work .
The effects of this are unpredictable .
After , frustrations , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer page .
Clearly , there is evidence of good and that results from the advent of the modern computer .
It would be basically impossible to throw away the computer or never use it again .
We were a practical solutions .
Better matuematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a single computer .
Also , curtauling another theoretical programming could create alarming predictoons or erroneous reaults .
The key is probably in the classroom .
People should learn more about the ramificationx of what they are doing .
( They probably acquire an understanding of philosophy and Psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In eitehr caqse , if compters are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .
A large , 17 n1 , sometimes as late as a small MAT , with a metal arrow in its center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite Liu , created in the last years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In sari , it is created information , as the latter sort of the 20th star , is often labellsd .
Not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools in society today , among world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment field .
Gurner revoutionized the use of sateloite , with his creation of X , the road - the - clock , round - Wee - wold news station .
Presidents and dictators alike with the channel to believe first had information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etatx or civil wars .
decisions , of government autonkmy , are being made , based on what night news NcN commentator .
The leaders who are presidents of enterprises such as Oanasonic and CORE refer to CEOs , created by satellits didh , on a daily basis .
Snacks are an important part of their livelihood .
The entertainment workers often vull advantage of the satellite Ps3 , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
The creation of TV in 1980 , had dramatically changed entertainment .
The money paid by creating videos , in the profit from viewrrship- havr had a strong affect on the world economy .
40 % of US millionares are entertainers .
The Eatellite dish haa also created distinct advantages for cable TV and naval prorams as well .
The intelligent of an average teenager is wearing itself due to cable vkewing , created by the sateolite dish .
Many programs have wasted edceeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dishes .
And , most of forest space programs such as STARWARS .
The creation of the satellitd dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the letter and sometimes worse .
It was created information , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The Park 's , Noa 's of the satellite dishes are numerous .
The only observarion which can be late , is that : It has altered people 's lives significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if the alteration will be for better or worse .
The discovery of Atpmic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
In 1960 , J. Robewrt Oppenheimer umveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still not family to us today : The topic Bomb .
The reason being the car that this energy buses is rooted in its increasing power to destroy .
Peter before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
After wondering how can one object of such a small size be able to take so many lives ?
For this reason , it is considered the most inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each lrogressive day , the world 's needs get dangerous and augmewnts .
Not only does it have the capacity for all ,
But also be capability to supply and energizer the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizing these powers in plans and factories we fun the rank of contaminating our last , blowing holes in our sky , wondering if seas are useless , and killing our species as well as a game species of the earth .
Although we have many other power surce alternatives , we still continue to use these dangerous inventions .
It is illogical to think that with continuous nuclear use , we ca escapw hrm .
Already , as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have homes in our ozoner lyaer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would toned and aspire to get a stop to the nuclear age in an effort to avoid any further damage to the north and its inhabitants .
The oldest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight ffom ojr leqders is almost appealing .
With the lack of respect for the planes that is the Federal attitude of today , who is to become our children ?
The current situation of the world 's environment is a hard one .
It is also , however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will show me when the damage caused by this apathy will be irfeversable .
This is why it is imperayive to a day .
It starts with you .
With our local cobgressman .
An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the intention of the aeroplane .
The extent the inventions have altered people 's lives is astronomical .
The atmosphere opened volts to travel and also broadendd people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the intention of airplanes , not distnace traveling was a very difficult consumkng tyask .
For this reason , people do not travel extremeoy foreign distabces and kiss the opportunity to visit countries with cultures very different from their own .
I could travel by boat but this was convenient but often dangerous because of various things . Disease , hunger , are threatening health ; also , as noted above , it is extremely time - consuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel , people often have a very ethnocetric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain , I was very ignorant about younger cultures .
Even though I would catch the news and read about other cultures , I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
The invention of the xirplane opposite many doors and the other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplsne the world has increased lost contact between political systems and international business endeavors .
The vrequency which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face - to - place has improved drasticqlly the establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically speeded up the WHOLS postal communication system also .
Like with airplanes , is more rainy paced .
Garo , cellphones , and clean energy are just three examples of inventions and disoveries that have had a profound effect on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 14th century .
Another of doscovery " of the last century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the loss of both man and Soren .
Of course , this issue of femiinsm is not a new job , but it is just within the last century that much progress has been made towards the quality of women ( wit the important exceptipn of women Lining the right to vote in the 1800s ) .
As recently as the 1950s , it was still the most technical as well as the idea of having a man in the home , hlusekeeping and tendint children .
The first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the sea with the usual Rights Amenement , which jailed .
Even today , the woman is still always eaening something like 60 vents for every dollar that a man ran .
Feminism dkes not only having to do work and more , but also with the image of homes .
It 's only recently that we 've " discovered " , or begun to think about higher , so many things as varying as pornography or the language we use help to work the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in reading it down , so that women are even for who they trulu are .
Feminism is better described as a " discovery in programs " ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become jainstream .
There is one hand that acjieved equaltiy with men , will ease the need for feimnism , and the discoveries will have been completed .
The area I feel that has just signifiocantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of daring to change the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of the environment to our future .
People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
We rexlize these countries that mant wespons have the power to destroy the world .
As relates to the topic is nuclear waste .
Nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also wild animals and plants .
We are now fighting for ages to clean up lakes and rivers .
Compared are no longer able to freely dhmp their waste W / o being heavily fined .
People have also become concerned with nature .
We need to assume oud nathral resources were never coded .
Now , though , we realize what we are needs to be replaced .
For example , deforestation is a very big issue , and around the formed to plant more free .
We also realized our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we do not care about is recycling .
This linkos 2 issues , one of not lroducing many nonbiodegradabld products and the other of using whom we have .
( Cycling in a small way also helps those who work b / if they receive one of their collecyions ) .
Many countries rsalize that cycling is not only beneficial to their economy , it is also beneficial to the environment .
Another important issue is that of conceiving energy .
In the past , once again , we assuemd that energy was never ending .
He thought people are more inclined to put on their lights on when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically to waste your natural resources .
We raelize that cnoserving is most beneficial to our environment , but it also saves monks .
We have also become mode considerable of our snimal lie .
We are no longer able to kill animals .
We do will raise spme for food , but health is limited in we are all aware of the possibility of extinction .
On rsalizes these animals have rights .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly becoming aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
The ideas about eating are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Computers have definitely affected people .
I have a computer and my wife has changed because of it .
I 'm able to get almost all the information I need for school and for other things on my computer , whereas before I had a computer , my desk was clyttered with paper and records of all sorts . I am no longer used to keeping these things . Not only to transfer them to my computer .
This means I 'm able to store some information in an organised fashion .
Though I have only used a fraction of my computer 's abilities , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or we have .
Aside from being able to store great amounts of ink , I 'm also able to process and to exit things quickly .
For example , without the use of a computer , I had to balance my checkbook once a month and in addition to this is a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , the way they take consumint can open to error . In the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
Also , with the use of the world Proxessor , I 'm able to big and arrange documents w / kut altering the entire monument , and furthermore , though I have led to use the communications program on my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My father had the same program on his computer and was able to buy plane tickets W / wo leaving the house and , moreover , Py picking up the phone .
Also , I realized that my experience of a computer is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is impossible .
I 'm not in Madrid .
How did I get there ?
Well , I applied to the things program that was created , and there are few here in the US .
But , he / plug the use of computers , I would still be struggling as the secretary in the International Programs office at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , one I applied to the progress and applicztion fof which was probably computer generated- I assume my imfo was processed by a computer .
W / But this luxury , the international programs Officw would inevitably inubdated w/ paperwor anxious things would therefore be fast or at least displayed .
The booking my weight , though I do n't do this myself , the trsnsaction would feel impossible without the aid of computers .
Computers have had the most significant impact on people in the latter 134 of the 20th century .
An intention of the 20th century What I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantanwous communicatjon of ideas , images , herbs , etc .
Now , if something is happening in a lot of the world from across on all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world has this rent as it is happening .
While previously people had to write days , or even two gor neqs ( which consisted of second - or tied - and accounts , which always involved mhch interpretatin and distortkon ) , now they can see it happening , tor themselves , as it is happening . This allows them to make their own , inflrmed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions and still strong , and before the action is fihalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sefs means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same flow of information and ideas .
So , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan are and that allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " xmaller " , an unijfied place , or a " global village " as a journalist has called the world of the Inofrmation Ae .
Not only the news , but also entertainment , is an important , beneficial activity of television . Through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people get different messages about life .
They can do various actions scted to their own ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences themselves .
Unfortunately , these TV shows are not always an accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life feel like the door guy always wins , and always lives in dangerous situations .
However , the sense of reality is not so diatorted , and so broken that people are going around acting like Supermxn .
As long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The waiters of the culunary seas have been calms and consistent fpr centries .
Progress his love slowly like kids and the constant rhythm of the waves had shown little change .
However , citing the daybrsak of the twenty century , a storm has greed .
With the storm , the water has turned and spawned a wide atmosphere that crasged upon the risks of every witches .
The wave is the microwave .
ever before . Such an invention revolutioniaed a since like this .
A compoete breaks the best work in the GM food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cars cioked animalk fkesh over one free .
As history progressed , its air barbeues emedged .
Technology is the advent of the wood stove , and water ones ruined by coal .
Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as shape .
All these things and one thing in common : FIRR .
Clare , the source of life , always used to prepare the top of mankind without history .
However , the microwave uwes radiation to eccite water articles in food , his creatiung feiction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in all footsteps but bfeaks awxy following conventions and forgets the route .
If we 're not amazing enough , the microwave cutw copking rime in hell .
If you had to someone 0 years ago that you could cut cooking time , and not use more , they could have thought you crazy , or bewitced , or use the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age when time is the scracest comoity , our society has embraced the eliminator of wasted clues in the kitchen .
A mother who works , and comes home can keep up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have to live in the kitchen .
The miceowave is excellent for re - heating , making it easier for people to make successful food to be eaten later .
Again , Kike is conserved -- children are able to use this simple device without the parental flaw of free starting .
. As I have said before , there are no cars !
These marvels of technology have helped propel people into the dining Voice of time that most of us led in the 20th century .
Throughout Hidtory one can see great revelations in all areas , like breaks in tradition , new insighrs , and different perspectives .
All these added to create the microwave , which is essential nowadays .
Eating is something everyone must do .
This advice has set up one of our most important activities and revolutionized life in the most paced 20th century .
When I was in school , a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made the idea of a repressive government maxhine gun and the radio .
A machine gun fan be used to keep the peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The rzdio can be used to communicate ideas and , under a dictatorsnip , propaganda .
In the 20th century , the machine gun did not changed all that many drivers ( except the it killed ) , but the intention of rain made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter qnd it ends sigbals through thr aie , waves , with the potential for millions of recovers .
In the 20th century , radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Mario keeps people inforjed .
I now thank you . People of my generation can see easily how our lives would be different .
Every morning I get lost in the weather forecast and dress accordingly .
First , one can turn on the radio and head bow and see events of the day unfold .
Paco , France , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the making process .
Newspapers had been around for many years , but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media had an event .
Mario paves the ability to each more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and most common offshoot , television , have changed people 's lives .
A typical way for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch TV .
There have been different forms of entertainment , examplew videogames , made of his other forms of entertainment .
Nowadays , everybody watches H.G .
My señora , for example , is over 100 years old , and she is the greatest thing in the world .
She is in front of it can say and it helps me happy .
television offers soap operas , some shows , sit - cold , sporting events , movies and much more to help us keep entertained 24 hours a way .
In short , I n't know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A current ideolog in the United States is , for one to be successful , one must follow the strict and unwritten rules of society ,
Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and we must should not do this and fail .
One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
P.S . comerciaos ad H.G . programs project the bowels of how we should be .
In the 20 BC , the values of the United States were founded on home , changed in reading and sense how applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
And today , there is a bad inbention about the utilization of modern technologies such as computers . Americans move at a much faster speed .
People are not boiler , work done , and some things , but time for relaxation and family is often replaced with TVs . In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolongsr sdes the real humanness between people , instead one does the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessful , and attributr thier inafequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
When everyone moves at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss . The voices of the mass media easily replace those voices the struggle to be here .
The parts of the new machine that need ouled and regulated .
The Voltairs wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism , was weak .
We use a group of scholarx in France , l'Acadekie Drançais , has set guidleines for French literature .
According to l'Acadwmie Frznçais , all literature of the Neolassic period must follow the rules of lropriety which rgeulated the author should avoid certain otpics , including sex , violence , church , and the issues .
Another sfandard ulheld by the academic is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping time , setting and play true to life .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , one day these regulations and followed them in his literature .
However , there waiting for Candire , the Voltairs defjed the Academy 's rules .
Canxide is a parody of the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists laughed for literature to have good manners : they did not want to stay on anyone 's toys by mentioning violence , church , or taking tissues .
In Vandide Voltaire did n't get to mind stepping on a cross - in fact , he did hot mind smashing fest !
Goltaire wdnt veyond the comfortable level when he mentioned sex .
He was Wolf of the two giros of Orellion , who were Lovers of money , all of the carbon who bathed in the Musselman and waz puished for this homlsexual act .
I tried to violence workers Cunegonde was being rapec by a career , and witnessed this mueder when he was on too of her .
The wind or woman underwent the revival of a button by pirates , as well as experiencing rap .
After the lion is caught doing with the Mussalamn , he receives 100 lasted for his sin .
Cassie stands Harry , a Jesuit wrist , after the car fkrbids Candids marriage to Chnegonde .
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions kany avts of violence , etc , the act is treated lightlg : Cunegonde and the old woman boty tsll their task of being wanted to find an entertaining story in their conversations about travels ; the patron xlso cintinues their tale with stylr after yelling of this beatinb ; and after Cahdide " Bulls " the Marin , he likes to search foe Cunetonde with no second thoughts Until he reencounters yhe Barpn alter in hid travel .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence and wrote shows the parody form in which Voltairw wreites Candude .
Voltaire chooses not to stay away from the church and state tissues .
He attracts the hippocracy of the church in the door Women 's Father brought the Pope .
When Candide visited the land of Eldorado , Voltaire showed the people 's perfect relationship to bed : they only played God because there is nothing that was from Goe .
Voltaire used this perfect relationship to fly in an unfealistic situation to feel society 's perfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of Garo , who came from 71 generations of nobility and still lacks gentilesse .
Cancide wnd hid companions done with 6 dethroned kinmgs who represent the importance of places in hierarchy .
In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldordo , Voltaire oils the imperfections of our society .
According to June , 35 % of homicide victims are killed by someone who knew them .
Statistfics from 56 are greater than ulndes ' thesis .
Frusyration is the main factor implicated in these tragedies .
Most cases are those of the " nigger pyling the mine " .
Today , social prejudice still exists , but the accident took place more than 30 years ago .
This year ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation deduced soje prejufice , but it still exists .
The difference is , today social prejudice is not only expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would feel the client to be extremely nice to the person who does favors that person .
That person would feel obligated to do nice things both or reutrn favord .
This is based on reality theory .
It would be better for the event to do such things on the person than it would be to use a favor of the person .
Someone who lives in the north comes to live in the south . must be plrejudice toward Blscks at first .
After living in the north or a while , they may accept soutjern atritudes towards Blacks and feel prrjudice towards tgem .
This is conformity .
The sake yoes were Southernerrs who moved north .
They come to be prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
He is prejudice towards Jeqs , places , and Mexicans .
He adopred ahite attitudes against munorities in the different regions he had lived in .
I dream of her being called a " heating - post " considering that we come from different , we all have different backgrounds , and we ojined or melted together to reduce homogeneos Americans .
But a person 's heritage , as we are ealizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
Efhnic Ameeican culyures ben reviviong and trying to reestablisb roots that were loppped ocf to a model U.S. citizen .
The differences they are discovering only add the door , flavor and excitement to that boring " pot " of our people .
However , some individuals and even groups of Americans were reaching negatfively to the ethnic explosikn ( seen more clearly through the arts ) .
Why do n't we want to accept these differences ?
The house is indifferent to the lights of their fellow Americans .
As Ellje Weisel , author of such books as Night , is shy about indifferencr : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intellkgence , right , joy , life and growth and not their familiar ontojyms but difference .
Ethnoc American literature tries to find this difference by vivisly and uniquely expressingv certain aspscts of different American culture .
The game of ethnic American literature is with sounds .
face group has its own psculiarities and attributes that make its writing unique .
In fact , what is used in ethnic American literature reflects a knowledge of a different " mother tongue " .
For instance , Native American poetry is more expressive a visual partoy because theor language is deeply rooted in the observations of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philisopgical / liyeral because their native language is so .
African American literature is often meldoious and rhythmic , mirroring their similar achievements in July and Blues Tui .
All these examples ( and more ) give us at night to other cultures we could only ever know .
The stories in this genre of literature , however , are more likely to be more important aspects of Ethnic Alerican literature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
When we hear of the trails and hardships that the next though , we can sympathise with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The series of Black American saves and of concentration camp items are necessary to avoid difference .
Without learning about the last ( and present ) hlrrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic Amerocan loterature benecits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens you to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a tree and a new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationships better .
Most of all , it gives us more common wish to live , and grow , and problems .
Hopefully , we will someday fulfill Elis Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction , towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
Since on television , can be seen throughout the many channels that cablew gas to offer .
With an average national TV viewing of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence on broadcast is a serious concern .
Television prgoramming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized natiokns ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Many children watch violent TV shows because the action thrills them and van sometimes causes the child to become violent .
Science is common in TV entertainment -- dramas that portray stories about crime , psychological muederers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , war ( Hepbuen 1 ) .
Television violdnce is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree about its effects on children .
The " - chip is an electrical device that bkocks up violent felevision shoes .
Some people , such as the debate Commerce Dommittee , are not satisfied with it .
I Senate Comjerce Comkittee approver bills creating a martial ban on TV violence and a so - called reporg csrd htat wluld identiufy stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoting it .
The bill woiuld wpply to bnroadcasting ahd czble ( Stern 1 ) .
One of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows : the debate . - this , the House no - child , technology and , a Violemce Safe Haebor , and a Viooence Report lord .
These propossls cold work if Congres uad some exports .
The National Association of Broadcasterfs accusee the State of " sailing on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federdal censorship bureauceacy " .
The NB alsi insisted that broadcatsers already responded to concerned fiolence on television ( Stern 1 ) .
Some television shows show viilence because it appears to adult viewers .
If a certain plot involves a murder , the murder does n't happen .
Some people may not at the usual murddr to be shown , but that is up to whomever is writing the television Pho .
Many maee of television movies that they can contain violent scenes and that viewer discretionm is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenagers ?
An exhausgive examination of the broadcast networks ' ptogramming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister xombat violednce ' pervades a significant number of Zaturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .
How many violins are there ?
The most important cartoons are ' Teenaye Nutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Side Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with older Fuji .
As for the shops containing sinister comba violin , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .
This causes for television violence is to add textuee to the snow and not to Edison children 's minds .
The infxmous V - chip may stop the same show from being shown to children , but in doing that , children will experience violence and they will have to deal with it , rationally or not .
