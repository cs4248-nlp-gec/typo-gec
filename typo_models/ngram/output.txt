It 's difficult answer at the questions `` What ate not going to do in the future ? `` if the only one who has to know it is in the minds .
When I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a salesman and even a pitcher .. I do n't know shy .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology Office and help people .
It 's difficult because I 'll have to study hard in a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier .
Maybe I 'll change my mind , maybe it .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
The nice people will buy a car but I pooor pelple alwats need to use a bus or taxis .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
Also , you 'll meet friends poeple waho usuall ask to do something to be friends and change your telephnoe numger .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to use the best to go to the school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , the car is n't necessarily when you have crashed in the street , in that moment yo realized that Importance of a public transport .
In India we have various types of public transport , like Cycle , time , Far , Train & plight .
Depending on the distance and duratiln to the desire pope , mode of transport is chess accordingly .
But Generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with the most of transport .
This reminds me of a true that I have recently been to find the place is far .
It waves around 6 hours by National highwag to go for Delhi to Korea .
We have stopped at hotles fir having food and put in case if one of us feel hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
nice , we have the option to write anytims we want to what we travel by car ( which is impossible wehn travellign by train & night ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short and on the back seat and wake up fresh .
Due to the above mentionwd reazons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
My name is Sarah .
I am 13 years old .

My favourite sport is volleyball because I have plays with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
It is very funny .
When I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
Dear Jo ,
How are you ? I 'm writing to inform you that some advice on travelling by working in my country .
On the on him , in my country there is a lot of place to travel .
For example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
There are wonderful victims because there are a lot of things to view for example in Madrid you can visit `` Puerra dep Sol `` , `` Las Cibeles `` .
I visit Madrid Twice a car .
all summer I visit Seville because I hope this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
On the other hand , in my country there are a few jlb becwuse thw economy is very old .
But , if you want I look for a lot from you .
My best friend looking for a people responsigle foe look after he setter .
Her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
I will be interesting in this job ?
Thank you do you e - mail , it was wonderful to her from you .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you .
Take care , Laura .
The public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
Because public transport is a cost effective and better resoudce allocation in mass transport system .
Also People need no to suffer with operating cos running their own car .
But it can be a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is a way for me .
For example , I think that it is hot affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
Instead it will be common to by an bus ticket an rode on public plane .
In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used becaude ghere are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future , people are going to the mark the cars than buses or underground .
If we think about it and all is better because we do n't need to eat on them has we are waiting for the bus or underground or in another , cart cus mofe money than the public transport .
By car we can not stop with ourselves ahich caj be good because we can listen to the use that we live and we do n't need to be found people that are unkwoend gut if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so no rtasnportations awre good at the cars do n't be necessarialy to end up with the public transport .
If I had it to choose between both transportatioln I think I probably choose cat because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested at environnent nad ecolobical thikngs .
We have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms aho eag and degrade all the organic waste of the school .
In some strategic points of the building we have special rrashcans to separate the garage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and the bottles and the false mads tawlks aznd presemtations abuot the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
The manager of all this project is last June and , our Science teacher .
I thi initiatives has mad us all over the yard a decognised ecological community .
Good morning everyone , today I want to share Scout is my favorite sport .
My favorite sport is football , when I choose it ? Well , football is a international sport , people around the world will give it so much ! Ecample lije Barclay Premiker Leqgue , high Premier , if Wprld Cul and so on .
I believe that 's and will depighted us .
By the way , my favourite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , he gave an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little air when he had a great that is : Be a super heart !
After many years he will dream to become a per hurry .
He ernter thd university of medicine because he thinks that this profession and be more similar to be a use hero .

Kate was closing the university of fashion ,
Then the we started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael was to him dream to be a paper geek , hate it so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was not dreaming buy that would never happen in the use hero do n't exist .
When she said that , Michael started to cry and very mad saying that he was lying . do n't have hurt .
He got so mad that he used led to get out of his apartment .
In following ray , he said sorry and them was happy again .
But when they go to the one of Michael the right again and Michael get a nice nd koll het .
He tried win a lot blokd arkund .
Michael got a room there .
Micheal closed he did and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amounts of benefits in our life .
For instance , we fake subway in order to avoid smoking in traffic .
It is true that moving by car is more convenient than tale public transportation , however , it would cause more palate to your life and have our environment .
Therefore , we heed to think more about your future , our offspring .
Giving then a safe , clean and comfortable poach to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be serious tha beforr .
In my country , Taipei , we always stuck in traffic for about the club in the morning .
I can to imagine if there is no bus or MRT , so long I will take your school .
Way is convenient for humans , but it brings damage done human ago .
For example , carbon dioxide Munich is created by car .
It cause global warming which thraets ur enivronment nd harms our daily life .
we can say that the area is of serious nd frequently weater djsaster gappened in decades , such as typhopon , hurricanes , wild fjre wnd kud slie .
what other precautionjs , is usually take ?
The `` Office is noticed by car photographdr when the film is tripped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Lost shipmsnts have been found more easily when this process will be started get away
The pleasure of traveling
People go , people love .
Every day lots of people are Travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international travel ?
The most important option to travel is , by car , the plans .
But , even when it 's true that it 's and faster cotton , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
If you 're looking for comfort and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There are a more variety of things to do and enjoy the train .
Although , the better option , is much out a team .
There is n't comparation on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best sport , the cheapest way to get away more cars and tae the routine . Some days .
Anyway , no matter how to go , no matter where you go .
The pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
Transportation None of the most important things on life so we have any of knids for transportation , we travel by ca but in the near future it will be over comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport is from north to shout in less than on this will make business men hppy anr comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we have that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
In modern societies is the same lots of friends and our daily lives .
I promect cold not be finished without co - operation .
friends could be communicate and exchange new ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
More importantly , many parents have fun livid and the to us knowledcge ans skills or abilities to live in this world .
In this case , the families play important role in daily lives .
The reason is as follows .
First of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
For example , we could hear you to communicate with other in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to take a meal from parents .
Secondly , the families cluld giver you are advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
If difficutlies was told to the families , the sea would come up to your files and communicate with you about how to move the situation .
All in all , in this case , the fairies are the most important friends in our lives .

public transportation has been to meet by people and over the years it is one of becoming cheaper nd look more cars but some people prefer as to extent do we are not and what is or weapons for at that is that are we going to demonstrate in this essay
become our 40 years there was nothing callsd puhlic transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those days are a hot even good facility to move from place to them and that is because they had no companids to build cars in about 10 years cars tradeing brcame viabel and also become very supported by having our own cars at the beginning the face a lot of problems nut They were able to solve it by the end
Nowadays all facilities of traveling are mode convenient from cats to be even trains an olanes .xome peopls prefer cara becfause the do like crowded place or because the find it sometimes cheaper but Tom Another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to travelling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to see the real exoerience xnd to enjoy more by chioling outy from crowded places
to summaries it is different from some news opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it mode and more than by the car caxrs qill disappedar qnd wjll wipl no longer be used
The pie utself explaininh the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This coclusion becomw more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies are exponential growth in their sales cigure an with low budget private cars in picture , dcenario ddrastically changed in last 10 years
Development of giodiesel industry an be a contributions to prodctivity growth .
A car scale of investment was boring for biofuel devepopment .
Meanwhile , it more economic growth and job opportunity , thereby enhance Groas Doimestic Producf ( M.P ) .
If you are living in my town or small It does matte buf one thing would be taking more by the people and organizers of the town , is environments .
Global warming is huge issue in today 's date .
Government should take immehse actio to stop it or at least make it slow down .
However we the people have really important part of making it worse .
Active and a of government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
Recycling is van be a good step to start wit clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking car by my city .
everyone have to plant a tree in front of their time with the use of prvoince gocernment .
People do not realizing tuat cuttinb thd tree as reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
Eventually Humans will have no more fresh air to breaths .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and under 18 years old and provides a few session of them or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to taking part of learning environment so on deny it can be used in what country .
Everybody has his favourite sport .
My favourite sport is football game .
On our school or village football stadium i spends a lot of the very shy .
Usually I play football with my classmates .
Before training i than 1 - 2 kipometres snd my legs get a power and my body gets an enemy .
The team has a part - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
His mom words : '' Do must work and work very hard , if you want to get rid results `` .
I can see , they both is experienfed persln .
Not so long ago , we are a competition .
The first place is going by us .
We have achieve this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , but in the future I will be a famous football player in means such as Skhatwr or Dynamo .
Football is my life .
I want to have advised to someone who starts thus sports : '' You must belive in yourself `` .

In my opinion Public transport wo n't be suffered by the shortage in demand .
Because if everyone afford to be their own cat .
Besides there are lots of low income People who ca n't get their own car .
So I think public transport 's future is bright .
What is he `` Family is meanung ?
In my opinion , Family is one place that way you best friend came hell eacy otyer ajd kniw each .
In the Taiwan , most of people have to the case of the parent when they are old , buy the point is that if you can not sutvival , I man you do n't have enough money to ride you career .
Talk to the topic , I do n't know well and of members of in my family , I do n't trust them , honestly ,
I like NewZezland becauss there are many islands .
By the way , HewZealand have a cool weather .
In Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
That 's why I offer all of how to go there and help them pleasure and have a try their own food .
You can also bought a lot of gifts ljke key chin , statue , or what most memories to be like before returning to Malaysia .
I did not able to go to NewZeland vut believe me it is very beautiful place .
If I gave sustensnce , I will go there and bring any of you .
I live in Lentino , a small city in East Sicily .
The local Coucnil hasnm't a project for the environment .
People collected and kind of rubbish and throws akl togethewr in place Baek .
Although the council began to a something , the people are n't comitted with the problem .
Around the city , you can find many places where the people throw fries , kitchen , `` amianto `` , food thing or furniture .
What a pity .
The suburbs of Kentini ckuld be wonderful .
There are orahge rrees , a large cake and tea in background .
When I was a child , I am a lot friends and they were very important for me .
We never played in the park or we talk about our tasks , music , now , we laugh a lot of ...
But then I was a teenager I began to life situations that I did n't like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they take bad about me .
In the years I lived there wodst mokents in my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 50th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my pay ; I think that this day is one of the first part of my life .
One night I tried because I went out I have no got my friends .
However , my parents true that my party was the most and they prepare for me a special birthday and the invited all my cousins and together went to be pisza ane gav me a lot of presents .
In the moment , I thought that my best friends as my parents and sister .
I know that the river talk bad about me .
So , my husband is my best friends .
He is the most important people of my life .
He has never been with me .
Also , he is very funny ad I laugh a lot with him .
not like to travel around the world want to practise more sport , and example , tennis , running or trekkimg .
We like watching TV series and cooking several desserta too .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially in David , my husband .
Life of people around the globe is becoming butter and is a by day .
A busy life always compete to use the fastest and most convenient and of transportation , which had made public transportation system lwg behond motor cpu .

This technology has changed the people 's were very much.in fact we can think you difefrent is our life respect eithwr to our parents or the grandlarents pife.for exampld my parents di n't facts on tv , because there is n't any tv on the work when they were young.butf it is n't the alone differnece : we can think at the mobilefone , the computer key at least one intwrnet.our grandparentz woubd n't imagine a strange mavhine like computer in their life .
Although the best test personal vehicles like car now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
Nowaady , people the fossil fuel as the lost important sources of energy is travelling , manufacturing , the source of energy does n't always aintain at the constant lover , but someday it will be run out .
people must find ways to the other energy sources lime nucleqr electricity , wine power , public transportation such as electric metro or the kind of energy .
As a result , governments wipl invest more in researching rhe usate of these new types of energy , travelling long pubic traxnsport will become much cheaper than personal car .
The range of public service will be extended to remote areas , it becomes much more convenient .
Commutng , travelling using public services will be the first plrior chlice .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to say there problems to be solved , I Example , traffic jams , sir pollution .
In spite oerespectives , these problems are held by the tv - using of personal vehicle .
People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to hradually kilping themselves for breathing pilluted aor .
So the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
Each person could pracgice savinjg qhen using an source of event to protect his own lived .
In conclusion , invesfments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a bright potentiak and it 's dance in the future ca n't be replaceble

In conclusion it is evident that because reveloping countriex sre facing political an economic instability , mkgrants trsvel fof better education prospects and shape environment for younger generations to grow up .
The effect of brain Trains are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional Jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of brain - but should be packed at international and national leaves on a broader dimenswions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boostijg up the infrastructure and a enfotcement to support public in a positive dancer .

Hello Something .
My name is even aand I 'm 14 years old . I 'm living in Germany .
In the moment I visit the Secondarg modern cool .
I 'm in grade 8 .
My Life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
For example there a girl she is in my class she is beautiful .
I love him look .
Her eyes looks as the sun .
But she is ignored me .
I hope I and forgave her .
Run for your life
My favourite sport is true .
I like to rfunning fast so fast in fact that it from me as if I run on air and the trees do not gardly touch the ground between the strips .
My favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to do sportive tpo .
I am liking to be the ground under my feet is soft so got not the third concreted of the footpaths in the city of the streets .
The fastest advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slow and not to get to run too fast But then to eventjally build up the running fee by week so that every week you are using a little to further in a little work faster at them after 20 years all will be an Olympix hcampion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about Eorld Wr Ond .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television should .
If you 're watching Dos & Jerry , it early will have a efucational value .
Although now coudl argue that you can always learn something .
A friend of mine recentky explained that if a zombie apokqlyspe should hgappen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead gor spme tims nkw - so in his eyes , he learns how ( not ) to act in the case .
today I want to write about my job .
I 'm a fkrensic bjologist ajd I deeplly love my CV .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
It is dynamic , stimultaing ajd , even if it is not all redmunerated , I see myself satisfied .
In the last few years forensic biology as developed by aspecta ilke bettfer senzibility , robustneds of results and we are required for anslyze a sample , buy what struck me most is how fast to change happens .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : do television offer hihgly likelg oppodtunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience knowledge , I believe televisiokn cover bkth enyertaining ajd educational functional .
It does how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizonz in the last few years , I quickly an adult learn didferent basics From a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also not educational programs made a decision on what citiozens shouls kbow in the future and that knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from eduational contentw , the ash so many could contests , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tel right from wrong .
However , I believe that educational programmes on TV syill plqys a vital role in educating both adults and you children .
I think who the best restaurant where we can go is `` The sailor 's restaurant ``
Here we are at typical Italian food .
The last time . I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever ear in my life .
The atmosphere behind the theme of the day in at the wall and Decorating with a lot of self and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Also , It 's perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit and together at the same tale .
the owner is a very kind person and I 'm sure who he makes us a convenience trice .
No future for public transport ?
Public transport is the cheapest way of travel , so it has future .
Currently , most people is used to use the town is to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
But cars pollute the man with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to the climate change .
So , if people were aware of this subject could n't use so much their own car .
In addition , having a car is very expensive .
First of all you need can afford to do it , after that , you must pay for the asjrance , councio tax , ad mechanic bulls , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to drive as if the bus or train or whatever vehivle you use , breacks dlwn it is n't your responsibility .
Besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
In conclusion , I think public transport has four , in the most people , it , I 've futur wiol have .
I 'm for employee , to serve on your company .
very pleased to be able to receive your salary pavement .
I pay a little old .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring thdee styudents completd summer homework , correcging homework diligently assist the instructor , and insttuctor helped organize hahdouts , instead of the instructors to answer questjons raisdd by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , every age , but I have nothing to complain about .
I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
But you wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yua mpre than the existing the basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport has the government had to all the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life again then pollution .
Traveling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search packing and low cost of fuel , and also maintenacne dost .
In this citjes pubvlic transporg works well because there 's a gold feedbzck by people .
Instead in the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for the transport cokmpanies it 's nor convneient invest Bones , because fewer people would use it .

In my tears we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north none will have mewlted totalky .
The temperature wikl ave gecome crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because they natural disasters will be more aggressive .
The Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be playing by streets and computers whom have totally changed .
Because of them , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the packet .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n't imagine my lifetime without friends .
Hope to make friends and most of people ?
It is easier than you think it
But ... start talking !
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
You have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
They just have to calm talk about it .
If you Friendship is real , you will always find point betwern yiur opinion and your friend 's one .
Just try , it wo n't cost so much !

Transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
Nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
Public transportation . Day by day folk are more crazy about own vehicle which leads dafk future of public transportation
first . i agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in her cuture.becauss people want privayc as well as from which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondyl tuese mode of transportation covefs
as much as possible of city area or town which mismanaged routin who travelled by public transportation.as a consequence generally people avoid Travelling by public transportation finally i cah sqy that there are famous mode of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people are numerous ootion tro travelling like an privatd cimpany
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this cknsumer geta more benefits luke lower fares , private , freedom and she travelling.in addution many automobile company pauncing nes var sith affordable price which ionsiost people to use more and more private vechil .
I go to a walk to a car every day with my lovely two Corgi dogs .
I met many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many let .
In the car to in the park is very busy even thought the car is huge !
Some people are very friendly , same as the job .
But when people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to the dogs .
Family is the most important institution of social life .
every member have hi own role and he boss , but water or the other , had to under his tram to understand the right brhaviour or Attitude to have both life .
usually there a generation problems , so do n't understand parent and vicefersa , I dfialoging and listening emltions qnd fafts , everyone can have another point of view .
Parents must give rules to one to underline lifts in social behavior but also mist lsiten others point of view to co - arrange and donate his knowledge .
A mother or a later an be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone loves his contrkbute in family dates .
Recently I saw the thriller of mokinfjay part 2 .
If you want to see the movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies shore to understand it .
The first movies , are amazing ! !
A lot of action , drama and romance ,
The man of this series , has been wanting fpr fhis mofie science thw thd first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n't think that this movie is in a time family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in ppinion I think is made a teen cove .
I think people will like this movie because , it very similar to the story of the body ; this mode of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , so that actors in the first moves were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will you diuble effort .
Hope you guys choose this movie ! !
It will be very cool to see the car or mokingjay !
my favourite sport is Karate ,
First of all , I enjoy it because when I practice I feel I can hold on for hours .
When I 've had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
Training Karate is a way to get tour problems , to forget your tiring routine .
In my opinion , it 's very difficult to find this advantage eith otherd sports .
Apart from that , Karate it 's not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance evne culture .
my teacher show us how we have to beat withj ithers and he teach us a lot of things about the Japanese culture .
For someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just go to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or it is doing .
Technology , is something that is very important , something withouy whicn we can not live .
Today topic is technology .
Nowadays we use technology in every kiting , from medications to making clothes , we use technology everydsy and everywhere .
Technology is always upgrading an it is very helpful , useful in important for development bur todays genrration is influenced that technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
Last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition , he likes the day so he decided to Peter and competition .
but there was a week in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can meet him .
he phoned me and asked me to meet him home money to register . competitions .
he told her money the second day , he finished the registratipn anjd started in writing the body after long time spending in writing and did goodr mob he went to give his story to the international students magazije office , he found out the more a notice on the door say that the competition was canceled , he came back by car and told me what happened Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the contamination in our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any chef for me .
On the other hand , in the future mxybe wojld hasve a bus which hwving chair for everybody and I do n't have to stand up .
Other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable to but it is more expensive than bus or train .
The `` or aeroplans ars a god options for long trip .
In conclusion , in the future child he a bus so more comfortable .

I crossing the second Education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in New profeszional sphears .
Also they would have an opportunity in involved in volonfier activity .
And thirdly they might look for earning oqn moeny or travel .

Hello Estela !
How are you ? I hope you and sell .
I 'm writing because I told you about my last summer holidays .
I want to a Horses .
I started about one was in the note my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
While I was there , I did a lot of things .
One day , I visited Mewndro del meters .
It is beautiful .
On the past a wonderful view .
The other day , I walked a lot ad and end the way , we found a waterfall .
The name of waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
the wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
the wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we te in the restaurant with other people .
However , in the night , we had dinner in a garage and there was a park , all night .
You should visit , Hurrem , It is a beautiful city .
In these are a lot of things .
On the people are very nice .
English is an international language with becones ipmortant for the modern world .
In China , English is took to be a foreign language with many students choose to learn .
They begin to study English at an early age .
The use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
Even kids in kindergartens have been learning simpld word .
That 's a good phenomenon , so English is essential nowadays .
In addition to , some people think English is superioe thyan Chinsse .
In my opinion , though English is for free significance , but English is after all a foreign languages .
it is hard for people to see me to me .
English do help us read Englih original work , but Chinese helps us learnt a time Tina .
Only by characters Chinese lirerature dan send off its brilliance .
Learning a country 's culture , special ink classic culture , the first thing is near its language .
Because of we are shines , why do we got up and other tonbue qnd kearn kur owned culturr theough a foreign languages ?
I am , last month , in a fantastic restaurants , Wooylpools .
It is tall but comfortable and famous for his way bugruers .
Woolypoosl is a speciallist of all , it 's a car restaurant .
In my opinion the restaurants can be better , expect to eat , but it is perfect to have dinner with you friends .
I have expected to be more famous , Peter and biggest .
The problem of the restaurant is the place , it is a team that people in cities , and I Spacey , that is very small for lots of people .
In the life we have any thungs thxt make us happy and many but lived go on .
for example , a person or a is especially if it from your best friends .
Once , I got sick and stared at general hospital , and my friends give me a flower .
It was my favourite flower I saw it ever .
In my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , but touch and to be attractive . The citizens in the town must participate in this , the cities will take the responsibility to specific day to clean the town and it when rubbish into correct place and clean trees and play were of it .
I 'm agree with other option that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to gave a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is terrible have a person behind mow all the time , you to have a lot , not peace , hot a happy .
In addition akl pearsons hae thd rught to privacy and to be free .
Nevertheless yhe journaliste stay as he time hiring a pity , all the time , when they are , driving , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever sky , if stay with something important our what buy .
This is terrible , you do not have privacy authouvht the society have a place , because if they do n't have a photo our folloes thw life of the famous when people more .
So that , politicians and will try all have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then he had heard it what they learn .
This is hard .

I have many favourite sport .
One of them I 'm keen on playing basketball to bet . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday aroudn at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at university I go home and when I go to the stadium to play it .
One thing mzkes suer thxt I already finished all of my work before I play my favourite sport .

I often play basketball at the studio in the morning .
Sometimes , I play it Team sports centre .

basketball is in outdoor activity .
That 's seasons . Basketball is my favourite sport .
With the swseping porogress of development and the booming of population , many agricultueal land , forests and often had been used to destroyed to build more constructufe anbd tranzport netowrks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring a drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
To start with , the ate a wide range of troublespme it maybe leading to the phenomenon .
Convincing arguments in support this the root cause is that almost all the person day Cities are ready packde wit places of residence , commerce and recreation and the end xvailable fror nea housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people to cpntinues destroysd mire agricultures amd foeest in order to satisfy all their heed , which will disobey the ecosystems diversity in bidoiversity especially the endangered species .
According to the problems aboive mentiomed , various approaches that governmentshould be adopted to deal with his prpblem.fidst of all , reducing buildikng xonstructure from now on , playing one trees instead .
Suwtainadle dveelopment sbould be awaness to all man and start to porteat the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phehmenon and problem would be workedd outg to solve before that I work in the government have to fake thue respnosibility fod thar .
Nowadays the language are very important , and more English .
This is to my first time that I study English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never spsak znd learn so well since I decided to go to London one comes to learn this language .
I have taken their decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did n't have any level that I want , so when I heard about that opportunity I said yes .
The car is n't the best way for for the transport , because it produces mucn pollhtion , however , public transport is better to do a journey .
It can carry many people without problems .
nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subways , that etc.these options it 's more economical than the day , the problem of the car is that nromally thr cae is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to care for or five people .
The situation to create many pollution for environment so we have some cohscience fot yhe panet health
I want to do something about the awarding of the English Language , is hard to get to me to the best reasons :
First region ; the grammar tie the learner , beaches or institutes teeth , is like to Spanish language , my native language .
That I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conjuntin of the vet 's in Spanish language , just Imagine you the same buy not in your native lentuaje .
second season . in the English syntasis , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the Red is written before the subject , but no always , Which is the full ?
Is she alone ?
The this reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards the game .
My favourite team is Lydia Becase I belongs to this country .
In India , I pecrent people follow cricket .
In 1898 , India cricket team won his first world cup and that 's dhange hte direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sport I belong to this game .
His name is Mr. Sachin Ramwsh Tendulakar know as little master .
Whenever I play this game , I always follow his lesson .
His instance , styles , ships , running betweem tge wicket , everything with is most required in this game is up to the mark .
Not jolly me bit also every Indian always follow Dachin fod crivket .
When he was 18 , he started first game for Leia .
He is the first place is played 200 trust in cricket .
He has an achievement likes cars 200 in one day etc .
I have the way he had played .
If a chance first he have to decide what they can do better , batting or bowling .
If the person want to come bowler thrn concentrate on running , actions , dance and if batsnen nbeed concentration on long and bat coordination , eye and at coordination , discover some shops which become my factor in batting .
I watch videos of sole best player like Sachin , Paul , but not breadman , garden , Wasim Akaral , great Lee etc .
As health is important factor in every story so all need to improve health , syamina .

Dear Camp director ,
My name is enter an I am 21 years old . I had read your advertisement in the newspaper !
And I am really sure that I am the person that you are finding .
I am monster in the idea will , and I am looking for a temppral job to improve my English .
Other I have problems of working in a kitchen , will be cheap if I told you that my parents have a car .
According to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I played many sports During my life , such as soccer , volleyball , ...
Waiting for your answer , order
The city where I love is a small village .
by residents have great care of the environment .
Oragnized share , where everyone clean up the village .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into auitable containers .
The helping to protect our environment to make it clear , safe , in order to nt jeopardize oir variojs disease .
In my village there are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the road .
There are socejalne place where you can organize bonifres , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and how out all garbage .
We have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plants .
Recently , and on the top of the primary school were et he batteries and the whole school used some very instead of electricity .
They organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
Wszysycy residrnts of my village , they try to , so that our village was clea thyat polljte thw environmrnt as little as possible .
Travelling in their own car is a more comfortable than taking a rise in public transportation.thwre arw several reasons to consider .
Firstly , the bus is always drive by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
Secondly , the public vehicles route ate more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
Finally , there is a chance to become a victim of them and pocket packet .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new year and foe the adventures who want to have an exciting track for them to see more caution .
Like wztching outside or sight seeikng , to single and most diffeernt pekple .
In addition to this I most admire the bullet train in japan whicj u consider fast and have public vheicle Ive 'd union .
To sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more cars and convenient .
Public future ujless fhey bave project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize and safety of their passengers .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with their decision of mineral extraction .
More details and season will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extract them mineral ill be harmful to our environment .
The aim breathtaking lights on the outskirts of my hometown .
In my childhood , I was her to spend my summer every year .
However , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
Next to go will be , the extraction of their valuable mineral eill deginitely leads to air pollution .
Three has been an example hit the other town is polluted by the process of developing the general .
No one day deyn rhat yhe popllution ikssue is one of the most important thing which should be prevented .
Last but it the least , the general extractionj will turn out to be orofound inflyence , especially , to the offspring .
To take my friends , Tatar , as an example , her homeland went over - developed and become an qrid place when he was a child .
After she goes up , she decides to leave us never go back to her hometown .
In addition , he had no blithe memory in our childhood .
One problem is that some people will consider the mob opportuhity that it might bring to us .
Due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown ca probably earn much more money than before .
It seems like a thought - after chance .
Nevertheless , they do not give us a promise of the vacancy .
In addition , money is no one crucial when it comes to health and environmental conversation .
In a nutshell , based on the reasons for instance above , the disadvantage of exrtact the valuable mineral are outwsigh thew advfantage .
Therefore , I do not subscribers to his decision .
Limiting cars on the role would cause te disappearing of food .
the fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
Global warming is a serious issue , higher temperaturs make the new cars melt .
the hunger we carry our heads in car , the water the earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n't believe in it , especially while Cars are of flying .
Even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a far , because it is too expensive , it and to buying but I feel , service and so forth .
Buses are more single - to get bug a ticket .
And the amount trains ?
I saw a aboug train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of cases like it was in te film `` The light Rlement ``

Contemporayr Qrt is a very controversial issue nowadays .
There are many resources and creature , as well as there .
It is well known that can Art curators and Artists believes that Contemoorary Art is nt a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy rites of an aesthetic image or a philosophical tea , but most of the times This is unintelligible .
Luckily the most expensive . till Along the old , like Picasso or read .
Nowadays a lot of empty art piefes are being good at aictions aeound tne worpd , for extfaordinary hugh prices .
Expetimental Art has taken the worlds of her by surprise .
humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be no possible to stop .
So now we have a chiices abd an ifninity of information available at any given me .
With the state , we know have an idea of how attists cretae .
the sorts dasy werew held on Kwai Xhung Sports found in 12th and 13 . November .
That weather was at cloudy .
I go there by Art .
I arrived at sports found at 4:00 a.m. Thius ywar I 've Mix the 00-mtere rxce .
On the first day before this sport day begun , we have to opening ceremony .
The afhletic representative paved the north and we saw the anthem .
After that , this sport day began formally .
At 10:45 a.m. , the car 's face C 100-metre tace started .
There is a funny things when I want to the marshal .
The teacher all my name for old and he told me to stand different place .
So I know that the way somenoe whose name pronouncer same as me .
Near the race , I was very nervous .

I implicated my class from working in Champion .
At last , my house at the second runner up .
I hope my house will get a champion in the next year .
`` There is no future . Public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient `` .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should use of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are harminb ths envifonment qnd tge wirld .
It is the best thing will people go to the plave walking o running on the other and it is more healthy .
There is nothing wrong with it go to take place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
Is it commonly - feared that tourism is greatly influenced , not only one aspect of one country , both of the whole world aloud .
Whether tourism haz hqd a positive or a negative impact over out pieces , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorajts .
First of all , tourism is a trip that enables people to travel and around the world .
Alongsjde with his Development , the ability of travelling is seasoned to such a small heat it is now quige common to commute from own country to another .
The existence of multinaiohals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , once a traveoler is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizens .
Secondly , tourism is especially in developed countries , a play an important part in the growing from an economic point of life .
The aim countries , such as Greek or Bulgaria , in which they ecobmoy relies merely on tourism .
If tourism influence the economy , it thrreby influnces the environment , and if it influences the environment it influence the transport . Ho ? perople becoms omre cfareful at their hisrorcal sifes , this way pdeserving them ; Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
At a small sale , in cities , in a way which will also citizena abd touriwts wlike to teach important places more efficiently .
At a large cake , people can not travel in almost only possible win : on land , on sea or aid .
Through the development of tourism were born crises and train vacations .

My favourite sport
When I was three years old , my parents went skking aith me .
At the bwginn I want to the childgarden ad they taught me skiing .
It was a lot of fun , because I would n't it .
At twelev o'clock in the daytime my parents took me with the end we drive together .
My father to me bhetween hs kniues , because I could drive witnout falling and it was fun .
When I was one , I could et better my dream was : '' SNOWBOAEDING `` , but I should wear skiiing perdectly like my parents .
Peter when I am 16 years old , my dream get tired .
I was my first snowbkardlesson und I love it .
I told every few minutes to live snowboard .
The aim of story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you 're driving down the wishes .
How are like a bird .
It is the best feeling in the world .
How are very happy and sometimes I find a song and the world is perfect .
That is everything I want to have and i 'm lucky .
That 's why I like the center mroe thzn tyhe summer .
Snowboarding or spring is the best sport is everyone who want to come to her thoughts .
Although you are all the time in the nature and when you have lunch or can see animals .
It was when a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
Yesterday , he was on his way to me and it is getting far .
The parents were worried and all he a couple of times .
He started walking very quickly
Everything was dark .
She make our eye and the first thing that she saw a true blaxck sk .
A car smy withouit stars .
She got up and look around .
She was in a part of the woods when we use to go to thin and relax .
She started to the consciousness although he could n't remember to the arrived there .
She had to walk at last 15 minutes to go from her house to take place .
The problem is the most thus she remember is that she has been sleeping and then sudfenly woe up when the window opened it the wind .
The film seen Train , did n't she ?
If she did , how we managed to walk until there in the sleep ?
If we had n't awake , we are could n't remember anything after that ?
This situation it was really frustrating not to mention that now he had to ask for most 20 minutes to go home and talk to sleep .
She started to walk to her her mind .
he knows how way even in the dark ; the had gone to the cost a lot of time , specially the most of seeks .
The development of human wind in technology is used everywhere .
In case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various options like Plan What can fly wins the food , train eat fast and be enough at carrt hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat tgat mjch bigger and faster than ancient time .
Although compared to ancietn tome we are lucky enough that we have all these options .
However , if I hav given option to choose between all of them , I will a plane .
The aim three reasons to choose them .
First reason is its speed , compete to work other means of transportation it can travel faster .
It is trdavel thosand of milk in a couple of hours .
As a result People can see the time .
Second is safer , compared to be the chances of accident is less .
the lakes it easier to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
third one is comlfort lebel .
town is much more or comfortable than both traij ahd bgoat .
In conclusion , I will say that Club will be my first choice in all of the Head of transportation .
The reason being my choice is speed , saves an comfort level that make plant as my first choice .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to warn month or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
The young people want to discover new coal and travelling to hear plane which would be jnreachable otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterdy becaues I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
The beach is located in a Guarda and his name is O Muiño .
There are a lot of people in the beach .
The father was very cold and I would n't swim , then I play football in the sand of the best .
I took the sub a very long time and then I go to a cage ajd anr I drank a refreshment .
It was a big day because I spent a good time with my family .
No future for a public tranzpotr ? is his chair or no ?
Will we see on our roads the public transport aefr 5 or eve 10 years we ? What is really so interesting question
He thinks that it all depends from the development .
If we can see the one and more people prefer travelling by far .
yes , i agreed , if you played by travelling for a long distation aqnd for a long time to you prefer to do it on her , come firstly you ; we spend less time , so travelling will be comfortable , you 'll have a possibility to to every whers nad flr a long time , as you need .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the questions for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by him not only money , but in the environment , but not people do n't like to use it . , sauce they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travel with another people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be choosing on your street with enough amounts of passengers

The aim and discussions about the future of the public transport .
Different experts had talked about this questions and there are so sevearl opinons .
People like to make the freedom for moving domfortably anf for the reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport usually is restricted cite the timetables and you only may us the transport in the moment that the timetable for you .
For this way , many people do n't like to use the public transport because they want to move thenselves wben they need .
By the other hand , public transport is better foe and environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
Finally , in the future , the community of people make is going to determinatd rhe msot use of the cars that the public transport .

The advertising is evefysite .
There are as in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
In spite of the age of media , the TV continue being he most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too and adds to television off , is kike this ?
On one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , as a lot of mentions to products or services .
They can be people tired of so much advertising contents but his is completely necessary .
here are a lot of products which have to be announced yard a lot of message to resort to people .
The TV is the most accesible qay of communication and people can see the message on this way .
In addition , being one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
In the ad There are , for example , the punlicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there is a lot of added in TV but they are necessary and benefucial fore evwryone .
My favourite person of the rest is summer .
Why am I makinv ghis choice you clearlg can also , I love sun and good teacher .
Yes it is true that during summer for temperature is very hit and you van rarely start Over the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
In spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things like gives us and have fun with them .
During summer I like to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with the playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities . Her rgeenerating and they make you forget about all the awareness of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the wear an this may you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore natrue duting summer too .
The eonderful colors of flowers witn yhe sunshine and fabulous .

The Mel came she looked gorgeous .
And when he saw him , his he started to being faster and faster .
But time 's up .
He got closer to her and tied the eveerything .

living in the waves
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
the sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite with which , able to do a lot of movement there are impossibke while in the car , is a wonderful sort of mind .
I started to practised swimming in good because I do n't able to sit at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
If you are not a good singer , you lose the big part of pleasure of enjoying the water , not in the sea or in zoos .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to read the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trains , refuse is fairly simpler and it can give a lot of satisfaction !
your efforts will be proved by sicceeding , and you can regain it with practices .

In Castellefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instinct : fresh zumba mastedclass , you beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are kibrary roup , theatres ...
As I said , those activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Jana and the beach , but the success is increasing more and more .
Recommendations
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the needs .
If you tried as the activities , it could spend a great time there , in Castelldefels !

Nowadays there ate Han people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that some people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that the people to speak the language , so that means that the people . nor to speak roreign labguage ave mors opportunities to get a job in impoftant colpanies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , ate more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Finally , learning another language gives the learners the ability to step Inside the mind and content of that other future .
Today globalization is ringing the world more cars , this means that the same time possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , pottery , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign language is very position on different aspect , so if you hav the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

given is a diagrwm introduckng the procedure of making bank notes .
design the bank notes , the first one indizpensable strp .
People should decide te background colour and the networks will they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists woulf prepars tue metal plates in order to go to the next step .
The third section is to print the prepared by both .
Usually we will be 50 bank notes per sheet .
They colour will print on the bad sides and every none has the unique ink and the image will be slightly raises .
After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
People usually divided bad quality and three parts : Good quality , partially damaged , and bad sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets buy still good , people who cut the separately nd pack the together in order to dispacting and distribution the bank notes .
If I paryially daamged shests are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distorhed .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of taking an hotel .
Eventhouhg it seems to be easy to make them , but every step neds people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect and not for everyone .

You probably wo n't believe me but I met a member of them band , I talked to them and we can run together , they 're very nice menu . Because of helping them I said he beat each during the concert and I have their autographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and one of the more unpleasant .
In general , bad only one duty Way is checking quest list , hope that I had to be in cleaning area after the concert .
But that concert was worth of my work , so I hope I will be invited to the next Kent .
Working on them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we 'll see each other for so I 'll be capable of walking to you about this experience .

Report :
The aim of this sport is to give you my personal None of view of the course I did in your French in Madrid Last month .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account fro th nex coures it will take place not be .
First , I would like to stand on the outstanding classmatrs there are in class .
They were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning a subject wven English .
Second , the teachers are really good sticks to watch .
They managed to encourage all of us never fed .
This way we make the most of us had never give up improving our English level .
Third , one classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
He helped me to pronounce wirds better than before starting the course .
However , in my opinion there would have been at least one native teacher in the teacher 's head .
This way we have been able to learn a native speakers and I think it would have been worth practising .
To wrap up the sport juyst way that on the while he course as fantasgic amd I am looking forward to sigbning it again next year .
Yours sincerely ,

Is there a future for Lrivately owndd dars ?
To be honest , I am not true .
Although privtaely omed cars are more and the popular , an thet ae incfeasingly becoming a common issue in in developing countries , it is not likely to this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
First peope tocay rsalize that in our cities are in our plant there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
Cars bxsed fuels we not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care are not `` sustainables `` in te pong term , and it will be necessary to regret to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a triggering 3 billions Human beings .
I know that it is like to dream a future of technological peolle flying about , each of them with its own private smalo helixopter .
But it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there is no helicopter , and not even cars .
mates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem for provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independence transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habit of the public .
Even though we will have to read the timetable and to barn again to be on time , the nice old trip could become important tail .
Imagine this picture : the worst case of this sister , students and yawnnig and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the weather ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
Students xould receie a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 month a year studying party because of water the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , party because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly Because of the difficult ciurses should be continuakly studying .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that students would receive a better , so efficient deucation if they spend 11 months a year studying .
some reasons for detail will be used lights on in the following paragraphs .
To begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget to knowledge that gave lwarned afte a long break in .
For example , on history class , history teacher have to respect teadhing ths histpry of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
It is very Wasting time is not efficient .
Next to go would be , students get use to read by having no study and homswork in the pong vocation .
For example , in the semester start , students can not be away from the sunshine , beach , and traveling .
In the class , students with real the joygful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .
Most Oh no least , some difficult cojrses should be continually wtudying raqther than having long a break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily Education , if you have a log tome aithout learning English , yo should forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on aforementionsd , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they and 11 months a year studying .
My favourite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember what my father and my brother teach me to play it .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love to the soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoyed playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forgot all problems .
I like to speak with my dream partners .
Together we analyzed the real tram and we chose a strategy to win the beach .
when I play bad I feel nervous nut my partners give me that unconditional support .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport where is a big peobability that I am healthy .
So if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really lie it .
if you do n't like it here are many options to practise whatevef spotts .
The soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
In the way you have to be prepared for anything problems .
Finally I advise thyat yoh enjoy playing this awezome aport .
On my vacation I went to New York .
I also want to the amazing Niaqgara Falls .

Most qttending studwnts to Universities are our of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
I univerfsities providr chesap accommodationx suvh as , hard rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .
other students who may have Family financial support prefer to give an apartments to live independently
Sharing houses or rooms haved mahy advabtages sjch as , cheap , safe , like to the university , ad learn now to share everything with others . waving money and some will be more Obviuos in university dormitories because monthly pazyments iwll be less than four time than hiring an apartment , nd because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite All these benefits , I prefer if I in - to live in an apartment where our personality is very important for me .
Many years ago , I share a friend in a room 's fee monbths during a course outside my country , these days there I worst During my life , he had Party , speaking loudly all time and do nor shade the budget of eating . living alone aill gran me the freedom to live by the way that I choose one stlil friendly with all the other without excred the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .

Although the deal golvernment which is decided as a role of St has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer bepieves thst there is no perfect Government .
The powerfuk of the federalism whichy as one liberty for the states to have their own pllicies according to their needs , is not always go on the lecture whom it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of what is the marfiage of homosexaul whewre sime stwte acmit thi marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the Federal gobernment ket each staqte functiln indedpendently , it will control on the main decisions .
this case casues some problems were te lecturer mentiined tne faikure of federxl government to stop illegal immigration to USA thruogh Nevada desert .
all the control of the Federal government is the reason why each of the sea and he federal blae each other in the increase of the unemployment in some atates
In conclusion , several govwrnment wihch give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no singoe plicy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any time of trip is exciting . also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advixe ; first try to get along wit teavel companion and enjoy Mexican fold instead to critic about spicy flavor .
people say that in every voyge rhe peolle euffer to different points of the two : arrived , get away to the frustrastion of an unknown place , get along with your trip companion , success as a travel and arrived home triupmhal .
In order to enjoy a try to Mexico , suggest that she traveled find a matter to get along with him or her companion .
This minimal change would have a big difference when you visit the city .
As an example , if you are able to the one with your travel cmpanion could enjoy each moments of the rip , exchange some pictures , but Together , and visit places with cojmon inerest such as Museum or call .
Other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is the enjoh for Mexican food .
Mexican food is a lot of tasting fishes from different styles of the country .
or Example , there are a lot of American people who does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get a city the press of pepper hit the Mexican people used to get to prepare thdir foox .
As advice I would suggest you to do so sauces wifh lowr oepper .
In this way to visitors will be able to enjoy Mexican food with less oepper znd rhe saqme delicious save that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I After two important advice for visitors at coming to my country : Try to do lots with their vompanion in order to the bus and try to enjoy Mexicn foopd because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , social media Spine ( CAS ) is the next most significant innovation that had pargly replaced for face to face communication .
As such as Facebook and I 700.000 messages , and 60.000 sweets are puboicized on Twitter esach 60 seconds .
Surprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and winter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or MSc in general , are not likely to make their own persobal privacy than others is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will more on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and so comments potwntial future of these implications .
Colmunicating cab be achieved , regardless of dance , though Facebook and Twitter .
The benefits of being 're being connected locally to Facebook and Twitter is the messages ca be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their needs , in an unpleasant mood , and in her tueir negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook proves the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationship , maintaining the 's an feeling within the network ( through wall posts , jokes , messages , etc ) ( Olfmeadow , ruins , & towers , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we will there by sharing their food , and receiving response .
Thirdly , Facebook ca be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge abouy tue members incerases continually , an moreover , maintaining relations with other exjsting mekbers , and so sharing their small interrsts by the social networks .
( Emerald Griup Oublishing , 2013 ) .
Finally , people are allowed to follow Anyone who they find enjoyable Through Twitter .
For instance , by followijg fzmous celebritie , people an easily see every day activities which are posted by them .
However , due to thus , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and so there is a big potential of being purposwly aggressie tpward somekne .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitetr ard easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter zre essily accessible , therefore everybocy cam easily respones as a public opinion .
Most Facebook userw expecy their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
In fact , along with agreeable ajd pleasanr comments , thee afe apso small amounts of aggression and even racist comments .
First of all , people can use a racistr comments which market a specific groups or person .
For example , after the premise of The Hunger Games was released , a van poszted an onwet racist twaeet that saying that they were happy because one of the main actresses was performed by black person ( such an Schznz , 2013 ) .
Because of the accessible information through BTS , it was left to say pfoblems involver wth cycvle - bullying , cycle - badgring , cycle - talking bebaviour ( Krishha , as cited in Williams & Garten , 2008 ) .
I Example , Krishna et al . ( 2012 ) reports a way of continuous distuebing a man for a man called Mr .
A `` admitted to a store psychiagric yospital qfter being foumd noit compwtent to spend trial on cases of talking harassment , treapassing anf telephone harassmwnt `` ( 1 .
576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .
potential , Facebook and Twitter , and MA in general , may replae face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter withouy have to very each other appearances .
Therefore , it will be easier to be connected all keep in touch with friends within a second , rather they have to call them .
The possible outcomes might be the more time people spend on BTS , the best communicate skmills tgat thy have .
In addition , to decrease the risk of negative comment or posts , Facebook an Twitter would improve their future to solve the less personal privacy problems .
For example , cojtrolling whay posts should be sent by adding mode privacy nations .
However , despite the useful of the implications , people should pay attention that Facebook nd Twittee could affect their social life by avoid doing it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily deduce thedir njegative mood by sharing and expressing his they feel .
In contrast , because Facebolk qnd Twiutter havr bewn connected worldwide , which means protectint pefsonal orivacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive towzrd each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photograpuy classes for everyone

Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , interests , it .
Photogrphs xre incluced in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photography is part of a daily life , because it is the best way to caplture special moments like birthday , travels , special ocassilns , it .
As a new college subjevt
The Practice is considered Those activities that anyone can do without ant kinds of special relaxation .
However , teaching students how to apply better technique in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as leaning to draw .
Both skills are required in today 's world and the necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
The reason
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 1000 photographs and taken per person in the world , especially in te latest generations like ( teenager and kids ) .
This increase is related but he overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of all , so it requires you knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .
What a lovely weather today !
What a wonderful day ! There is an April now and finally spring came .
A bright Fuji is shining , the snow melted away in March .
The first spring birds come back from the work countries .
There are singing funny and building their nests .
People look happier .
They are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
We set up cflock forward one hour in March .
The sumjertime waa firsf introducede in England in 1888 .
These days ecome loinger znd tye bights vet shorter and lighter .
We usually set our clock back an hour in October .
A lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) and you are .
Hockey as a nice sgyle
though all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey orovides gou moee thwn jhst beiong hralthy or not .
What are you thinking of whatever you choose a sport ?
You Thing that your life style will improve my
Well , are mistake .
So in different kind of sports you need to be killed or willing to try new things .
What if you do n't have non of those requieremnts ?
When you know hockey is the safer .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favourite .
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in zimple words ,
it 's a team sport is
However it 's not always as simple as it sounds .
The home to try it is a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
On the other and I enjoy every second of it .
Through a my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
We all I recommend this to you ?
It would definitely help you to go and improve as a person .
Hkckey will change the car you see the world and you are going to start seen it will they get .
So , searcging flr th right sport , the one is for yo !
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental cars .
In spite of some people make enough money to use their own car , elextric xnd hybrie cara are more expensive than traditional ones ( the one who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this one and it 's because pollution is severe isaue thar we have to deal with .
The environmental car is taking strenbth ervery day , for kids too ancient people .
The government has many companies ate measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industtial or service processes that are necessary for reducing goods on the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , the court was , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the xestiny is far from the place where you like .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slows down the few in public transportation , that could have people to the public transportation nd caring thd envirohment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
In Colsada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
The city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of the citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the past .
There are many ecological inland .
Each of the stage three or you kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
They have been several pkanting campaigns to plant trees and to open the river Jarama side .
nevertheless it is near enough , because dog 's owner that they have most of the blame .
Since 2008 , there are my bike paths across the city , so the cities will be able to avoid the cat and they will emit less air pollution .
the organic waste is picked up every day a plastic on paper Waste is picked up very other day .
The most important thing in the environment more is the education of children .
Our Planet is in such a difficult situations that we have to take over the problem .
A trouble which was caused by us , human beings , it the targets of making money without thinking of the effects .
My family is very conscious of this troubls so we had any effort to solve it .
We usually use of public transport , which has a great equality in the city I love .
It works perfectky : it is always on time and the price is worth .
We live in a cottage nd we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we won an organization whikch payd peopke who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations wgich takd of care of the environment .
My sister geaches peoppe ahat to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottled or papers .
She is able to do such beautiful ejwellery thaty lots of people are following her !

As soon as the car river sends the southern hordes of Egypt is hers .
I like river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that course over 6 thousand years .
All historuans , researchers , scientists are wit hips .
And as for me , I totally suppirt rheir point of view .
type is a kind of the river civilizatikn among the high dsert Sahara .
All over the same age Kike is the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , eevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding our area of textile bandy .
The Egyptians callsd thbeir country ' Blau and ' to make it off of the the soil of desert .
Nowadays , Gus and wide Valley of the time became the most important trahsport lines flr Sgypt .
Through the centuries peolle hwve been exploding hte hature of the time .
The ancienbt Egyptixns divided This year - three seasons compared to do or not period .
they knew when it will be the ' Green ice ' or ' Red fire ' to stock up with clean water .
But luck high level of development of Egyptian civilization has te negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of teams were built on the river that caused the disapeparing of a lot of plans and animal .
Anyway , a lot of Ebyptians stil living far from the main area arteey of te country and hardly can find the clean water to drink .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomr developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
when most people think about an important historical place in Italy , the third of Bromo , in Milano .
But the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you 'll agree that it 's the Colosseum .
For centuries the building had been the symbols of this city .
It quote ancient , but still fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every tear .
It was built in all ... by air , who was the Roman emperors .
It was used for short wild animals or humans , who were killed witnout ipty .
Moreover nvay wrs wers represente in order to celebrate Doman wrmy .
It is gained through the ages , but if people undedrstand hjs imporgance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remember our past and our traditions , which we could n't forget .
However mow all people are aware of it .
It 's the strength and every time I go beyond i realized how many people succeeded in building it .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow my dreams .
In the fats moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
There is no point in flying public transport has no future .
Travelling through so is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and advantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all chaos of people in society .
variety of buses and released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time was nd no privacy wre wome of the disadvantages .
Similarly Traveling by car as my own advantages and disadvantages .
Everybody has not afford a travel through car as it is costly , buy to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy dring travek ahd is convenient
and sophistixated and can travel fast .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because of a equzl advxntage and disadvantages .
Sometimes I think that Taipei is not crowded .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropklitan system .
However , during the use more , the ate always have such a room person who has no public awareness at all .
The occupy too many years , including rpiority seate .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told him not to do this .
Moreover , I think that provides the seat to older is also a problem .
Prioritt saeats , and preservwd to those who ended , not only older or all swome sdult nsed it .
Somehow , for all of them : yo identify further their bodies fee uncomfortable merley fro their appearance , which lead to me misunderstanding between them .
Some people who blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
Moreover , some old people would have the considerative acgion fr grabted ad they could even commamd goung adults or students offer their best wihtout mannerrs !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city 's nothing to criticize expect that .
Everyone should develop the awareness of public manner .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television can entertainment , education , news of films
TV has much benefits :
Firstly , enables Young people to have cultural experience with others .
TV and act as a catalytst to be kiss readihg - following up on TV programs by getting goods on the same subjects or reading authors whkse work is adapted for the programs .

is television are also negative effect : First of all , children who spends a great idea of time watching television for less exercise .
In addition , their children receive less socialiozation with other children .
Television apso takes away from family time .
This is also true for family who eat in front of the television .

Nowadays we all have , the public transport can make the world .
When we see in their cars in our cars , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one , we will have to live our cars and so public transport .
If we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immorfal traffc jam .
But , probably , his situation is one period of development of transport .
We are sold about a lot of innovations in the sphere .
For instance , Google rwported abiut Googlemobile .
Maybe , robots will be able to wait for smart then people .
If they will contacted each other and use Goiglemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
So people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away near independence .
. Another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , but there are drive at the moment .
However , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
And people who have public transport , there will always be .
The question is , which sort of people have more imapct in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
How my language do you speak in
Did you ever think of learning another foeeign languave ?
Or do not want to be a polyglot ?
Today it is mild tie important to learn a foreign languages than before .
there ? - rdasons whcih shoa you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
First , if you 're planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak pocal lsnguage , it makes your trip for ezsy ane comfortable .
Second , by finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in he intrnational levek , if you speak a foreign languages , certainly it adds some valued on your promise ahd gou cah gey a high salary .
Third , through fearing a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different cultures and society dicferent tyan yours 's , it enrich your knowledge .
Every thess yeafs , there are more and more miserable accidents happened arfound thr world .
For newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily figured out that out environment is changing severelky .
Many scientists inbfer thwt people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greed .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , not forget to protect the cherosh th Earthj at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
Various factories emir excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
All the example stove will enhance the temperature ad make the north hottrr amd hotrer .
The other temoerature enhwnce , the most the living quality is .
If people around the world could n't put more emphasis on your living palaces , we must have a park and homeless future .
Due to the image cringe , the weather is so hot that people would ever have a water shortage .
Using enough water supply , people 's very well become well as rough .
In the living situations , instead of laughter find happiness , there will be more fight , hard and sadness .
Everyone lives in repair , huge fan not find the entrance to bdightness .
The Terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatusfied heart .
Friends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
It is dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with generous people , the real danger is if you get covered .
When people know that they were received , the other trees were broken , heads wilol roll .
You have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
the passion for this cause of the way to survive .
It is just sometying tnat I has to do , not you , so he , me .
I do n't choose that , this we have chosen me .

In our modern world , many people are suffrred frlm stress that boring to live convictions .
In addition to him , people are working in very stressful workplace and they want to live for this condition in holidays .
Therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to deny the soup and revive te dpirit fod people .
In Holidays , people Far away from family problems and also can take more time with their friends nd family .
In this respect , many people prefer to go naztural palces with their families in order to forget about and situatyions on their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swing in has sex can be helpful to forget had life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking cleqrly their experiences about life .
People Tian review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
For instance , in stressful life conditions pdople cab make a decision for their future .
Besides , people underestimae emotional feelings in their workpalces .
The reason is that people must clmplate theie tasms in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feepings auch as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
It can be clearly see that in hokidays people are betting closwer nad the remember their feelings .
For example , people meet their relative rhat newver see in a long time .
At the same time , people have a chance to go sacded polaces in order to renew their spirits and goals .
They can try to God 's it gives a relief for people .
When people remember the emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material lord .
In Holidays , people have time to revive the mistakes that leads to stressful life .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal thwir problsms and stressful life conditions .
As holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the work because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subject .
Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common heat in Spain .
However , the government and the local council of a citids sudh as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote his movemenr becxuse they consider it a say of development .
On the one hand , were re many benefits of cycling .
Firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it covers CO2 emissions .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
On the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of dinner on the roads .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by ca .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
Getting set with it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle in a strong winds , freezing leather or having to see driniing whben hot weather .
In my point of view , cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look good solutions to face the disadvantage of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
And the undesirable yime might be not so short during Holidays , due to less frequdnt scfhedule .
Also , we can give a try to a place where the public transport perhaos is not able no Beach .
When the bow is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distances .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should n't be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to provide ca .
As we are now , the more public transport passengers or , the new year eshausts ae emitted perr peron .
Recently , several studies have shown evidenxes thay there is a strong relation between car exhaust and fun cancers .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving time .
Second , public transport have city space .
As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays who tries becole larger and more crowded .
Correspondigly , the space for each person becomes more lijited thah before .
Provided that every itizen ownw a car and use it Rather than public transport for every travelilng chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congestion .
Last but not the best , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a sense Spirit .
For a passengers , however , travelling is a complete relax .
People can listen to music , take a home all work a friend , as a fascinating boon or just look at outside .
though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not say that public transport is the most chiice fr everh situation .
P.S . , it offers less flexibikity than cars , he is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that the transport can replcae others .
It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a lot of .
Language fkr ths future
Should learn other languages ? .
We lie in a world that day to many changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
On the door and it could know you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word Without the language barrier .
As in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian . bscame something essential and very important in our lives to find a mob .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
Also I consider that it leads to be hard and take him away from doing any other things .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitabiltiy in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children ca stall to learn swimming as early as two years of all .
Swimming has different types of dolphins , draw , backstroke anf breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reuction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight , it is also the vest sport for the asthmati oatients bexause it strengtehns the best muscles and decrease the vulenrability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to her swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of our age .

Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertisements , technology is having a huge , and it always possitive impaft on lutdoor advertisemnt .
From place - End - who raids posted in public places we have moved to practically luve surroundec by outdlor dads placed in every availagle nad imaginable spit .
From building with enormous and right streets to interactive bus stop sins .
The recent developments in mobile techgnology aplows advrrtisers to offer personalized publicity to face of us .
I ' m surde thxt in the very near future , if I have been working for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the beds on the buses i will be - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show image of Mallorca , or an dad from treipadvisor with Malorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it down will be useful , but I 'm also see Sometimes I will find it aggressive .
The way it feels aggressive to enter a square . plaza in my town and think it up of bright screen , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed ate .
Advertisement might be considered an ass , or at least of pieces were really arfistic , but placed on the wrong spot or shouted at the wrong timr yhey loos they axrtistic skde .
But , technology is hard for best or work , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
If I would change one thing in my life , I would like to change my home .
I 'd like to have a huge detached house in sugubs of Arteml or Vlsdivostok .
So what I would live more freely as independent .
If I had the house , I would decorate it in modern tail .
I would buils therr fitnesa gym , wardrobe Grooms , swimming pool .
If I had lunch mouse , I would like to equip a barbecue arena in my garden .
I would invited my friends and relatives .
Together we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
When it comes to my favourite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
though I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a matter of it , which sounds very challenging .
When I feel stressed off , I always play tends to leave my pressures .
If you are a beginner , tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for your first .
As the power of : If you want to learn something will , you would need to get the right those first to work on it .
Next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
Since tenhis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn those important technucal slowly and stewdily , you a pet hurf durung thw practice .
Finally , finding a good teacher is is also critics .
A skilled cosch fan tell you the best skills of tennis .
Do we have better televosion than a few decades ago ?
Do we have enough choices in the screen ?
Can you imagine havint only two channels are not playing the whole day ?
That is in 30 years ago .
An explosion of changes arrived to our house in the eighties .
In this report I will see some characteristics of today 's television .
Number of channels are gradually reducihg
In our country or decade ago when digital TV thrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All the tries to get seveeal licences to distribute their shows .
In order to resolve dome deficits budgets , today where are mainly two TV groups .
It cbannels meabs less choice .
Internet TV is increasing
It does ldss mnoey ans yoy cwn choose esactly thw mokent , where an with who watching this or the television program .
You must follow a suggestions made by someone .
You must click on it .
The place to reduce their budget
Despite it changing channels we are the same weds .
I Broadcast groups are used by full of them .
It is expensive to the journalidts anx cajera all around the world .
It is cheaper to buy it is
Summary
TV is fine .
It is hard to compete with the Internet .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
Perhaps politica reasons heed to maintain such a buffet deficikt .
However the fact is that there is a coutndown on them .
Dear Mrs Hopkins ,

In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Firstly , we can discuss type of food we want to sat .
Actually , students eat a lot fasat foor wbile they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , you there lessons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere whsn they do some - mail for , and a good idea is for main course : naked potatoes , seemed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable resztaurant wjth a lot of windows , with a white hair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote Cris , because we will have a good night or not depending the top of atnosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very at us , because hormally we had spoke about book , swore and studies , while With this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to master 's Hollywood .
I have the food here and I think my classmates too .
You can it the best burgers , have never eaten .
The aim incredible delicious .
I do not know how do the same kind xook thel .
These burgers sew my favourite film because they are amazing .
I can not to his there are because you have to taste the .
It is a flavojr similar to stay in the heaven or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant , you definitely leavw witn a very good flavor in your mouth and a big smile in our cars .
You will want to come another time .
However , if you do n't like burgers you can eat whatever yo want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinions as a person who have eaten anothwr msal .
Public transport plays an important role in our money as life .
More than a million people are buses , taxi 's on trains etc as tourists , you work , meetings relatives , going to school etc .
In view is cars .
Though Travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
That is that because the most of petrol , Diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
while travelling by public transport can be a lot of money in following ways :
1 . People can save the money they spend on petrol .

As they have specific routes across the country , then , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even beside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement state above because in future we are likely to have only the classes in society , the rich and the car .
middle class is idsappearing abd becoming scarce day by day .
It is because of high taxes on foot .
So , I believe eiyher we will have public transport or people are going to be as they are in the stone age .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
Some of them think this book are more interesting than them from versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
Firstly , reading helps to become a week Educated Person aqnd give a chance to develop knowledge .
That 's the while you are reading your cafe letting a pieces of information .
Furthermore , books develop imagination of leader .
When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in our mood .
For all imagine how yeroes lpok Like , you can imagine different views , were the action takes place .
An Finally , I think it 's very important that you can easily take your body with you and start readong anytime you want .
On the other hand , if you like being in company who best way for now is moving .
Because you can watch it with your friends .
And many people choose movies because they like eoundtracks amd speciql effect .
It 's so exciting .
It all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books and better than the film version .
To sum up , I 'd like to say Reading is really great things .

Dear
In today 's essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
Is it all wrong losing your own country for a period of time to study English ?
It is true that going abroad can open new kind of views about your own learning process .
Talking both English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly How are doing .
Besides , it can be funny ad enjoyable if you play it properly .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and I will hot be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a day nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of time I think the advantages overcoke rhe disadvantagea especially if you have some money savsd for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution Which is young and internet to learn everything you need .
You can even take with native speakers by using some that room onlime sucy as Skype and there .
Football , a passion
When I was little I had tried a lot of sport , handball , swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not only of this , it is a sport that I have never imagine : football .
All my life I thought that football is a sport which was for men , but for girls , it since I tried it , I love it .
Have you ever think about playing football ?
At first , when I started to play football I do it with my classmates , who were all God , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , the target to integrate me when they play , and nowadays , I live playing football with them .
So , for women and I started to organise female matches , so I am more user to play with girls . I never imagined that I am going to be so keen on football , but now it take part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world would try it at least once in his or her life .
I think you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to rdacive soms upnches .
I recommend you a great restaurajt whihc is in the shopping center .
I have been the twice , and I like it .
My name is `` The English in `` , and it 's a fantastic tradigional ajd modern resgaurant woth Britisb food .
The service is excellent an the waiters ate so pleasant and gentle .
The interior is bit , so all the fact could stay inside withoug problms .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's not come great traditilnal Briish objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
I 've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
The dessert is very good too .
They 've got origina onee , kike sweet pizza , a traditional .
There is a big variety of the real .
This restaurant is a tio expdnsive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much more .
The restaurant is in the shopping enter , so we can go there by bus or by train .
I think that is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we would book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually does there .
During whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accmopanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to make their on life , without photographijg .
In one hand , becoming a public person associate it journalist , Mass - media , flashes .
Famous people . obligated to provide their life in exemplary wat .
However , they still being ordinary people , they have mistake .
People are brought being jealousy .
notice an end of failure .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely tkxic qnd thet yave efective inflence on society which causes celebritss through the price of journalistyic documentary .
In the other hand and of stars eold their privacy to earn more an ice cove .
the value of their talents , abikities ae counte in aomnut of tabloids scandalps .
Summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring inro tge limelight their life .
It had never been very useful for a long time go , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people . asks if the public transport was supptessed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and you for the environment .
Firstly , the main reason is the best because the people who do no have a car than now to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
These cars need to be prepared ; besides , if you have a car , you have to buy some taixs .
In addition , the people need to take public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is he glboal warmikng because they atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating the befofe bcause rhere are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Finally , the most Jason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
Besides , some cities , car can not be part in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
Summing up , people are aware of global warming and thin about the high cost of having a car .
From my point of view , I get used to walking around my city in my cat is get used if I travel around the country .
We are living in a need chanfing worlr .
Today 's new things become think of pasta in few months .
Take An example of mobile technology , your latest mindset , the latest fonfigurations becomee ohtdated wthin fewq months after saying it .
50 years is a very long time and people like we definitely change in such a long period .
However , the importance in to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
Last 50 years science and technology to great dears , internet , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at finged - tips .
Today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost a new place , Google maps are always there to help .
We need not to tell Engljsh words today , as we can quickly fine meaning of a word on our mobiles .
Martin jew peopole or seeing your products , you do nt heed to face anytime , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progrrss mabkind ha made in technology .
On the other hand , number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
Climate changes due to global warning causing natural disasters now and her .
Terrorism acrivities causjng havic in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power liking it difficult to trust people blenders .
If these challenges . You addrewsed in coming years , imaginary better lives more people in 50 years fence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a roll , in right hand it would be good for us , in front finds it has vowed to destroy the world as we see it today .
to the car cancer ,
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I have you advertisements on your website and I immediately thought `` That 's for me , I 'm the eight person for this kind of job ! `` .
perhaps , you 're Wondering what I should be the right person .
That 's so said .
I 'm motivated , flexible and openminded person and I had a lot of experience in this film as well .
I 've worked as social trainsr amd as educatore since I am 16 .
I love using social activities and playing revenue .
When I worked as educated , I used to plan and range some posts and outdoor activities .
I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live the train .
If you are interested , please have a good at my CV .
As a requested , I attach it in this mail .
Best regards ,
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need , Alice near me because I have the children an I want to know how and where there are .
The same about my parents ; they are good and sometimes they call me to talk about this yeah .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientists that that though its help children 's brain to develops , it is important controlker tyem because there are a lot violent games .
However there are brilliant games for children .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in curremt societyh .
It is very common to be the internet in my work for research or google infotmation abd alsk cinnect qhit othert teachers , speak about noises and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
Friends should be like a meadow always bewide you .
In the time of joy and sorry .
Nothing is impossible in life but not count it is not easy to find sincere friends .
It does n't mean ypu wikl never find one .
It is very important to interact nad socislise with people to make a friend .
The most people you will see the one day it will become your young to find a friend .
When you find one spend time with them , have views , ideas and go out with them .
Friends do n't have to agree on everything to say but they should share the news about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You should find a variety of articles such as politics , business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , bravely , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jogs and nations to help individuals .
readers an able to express their opinion freely .
they use a really Englis lznguage wjich avoids slang languwge .
As result , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
On the other hand , I realized where her two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to ifficial Language . there are also a huge number of commercial advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The ugardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are many are economy very highly developed .
Some people think that we need in tablet comouters instead boois
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am sending newspaper I notice that gadgdts becone very useful for your life . seem to me good opportunities to make the life more easily .
Also it makes us - clever .
I am convinced that young tablef computers in our everyday life is rather good .
People do n't need to carry a lot of books in a big .Pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in a tablet computers
Some people think that it is a new idea .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
Both psople wre sure that electronic things make us studio .
They insist on to using table at school .
Personally For me , I kike books were much when I at home I use books Becase I like to smell and to touch the age of jobs .
I do n't agree with the people who think that fables are useless .
We should use it but we have n't nor flrget sbout books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep areas of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
The Big Mistak
This is a full of joy and happiness , but something in wromg after what she told me that she is pregnant .
She was so happy about this new and she though that he will be happy as well , but ...
At the moment when I told him that he is pregnant , he just grown .
It was so much for him .
He thought it 's easier to walk away and food that conversation with me .
He tried to understand it 's going on with him .
It is weird how many questions and doubt fame up on his head .
As part of this was really happy , because to be a father is his one of the biggest dream , buy on the other hand he could n't handle this news .
The Noman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He should be happy and by her and celebrate this good news .
But somehow he rid n't feel anything .
At that he felt and anxiety .
He could n't handle the feeling , when we need to touch it , to kiss and hug him .
He knew that he loves him as much as he loves me , but everything was just the wrong on the event .
Her voice , her smile and when her body had to sing on this moment .
We could n't understand what 's going on , because it is just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he sad that he would like to have kids with me .
And now , he just avoida her and he is not happy about the news .
It was a big kiss .
He was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .
They both knew that they love each other an they care about each other , but it was so much for him .
He stood up I aim to the gjrlfriend that he needs a break and he had to be done .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To the beginning I am going to take about what is my love sprts an why I will enjoy the story .
In fact , I do n't like to do some sport Surfing the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to sit in the swimming pool .
Firstly , I think , swimming pool is learning .
Such as often swimming team I have a safe and a bathroom to the shower .
Secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big hug and safe .
Third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
However , I like to stay in the swimming pool During the summer .
Actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
Moreover , I think before a kind of sport that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax out bodies fist . If we do n't do it that we will not dngerous wjile we are in many sports .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sport , we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not play at home or working all the time .
Every you really do not like to do exercise at you can go to school .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pastyre srea where local farmers ve been brewing beer , cars are pros far centres in spite of the warm weather conditions such as high temperatures are horrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to be present and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational fume of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on reading green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens fan sped teir frer tims or even do sport .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational area .
Finally , the town is also improved the management and fragment of waste system with the five coopwration of modes of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
In fact , around 90 % of Caceres inhabitants ate said to sort and recycle their rubbish making it is to the yellow , grey and the container in every street .
And that is rather negative point , the dulpsters are not visible in town and it would be advisable to change the news we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , in the ones that do it ill reward a bonus point but anyway This is n't important information .
I searchedd my family in the house and there wax no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I reach the outside in the street .
I did n't know that a club hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the expansion is because this part where I have is a very poor area and it 's not the beautiful so you ca n't distinguish aere dos thr explosion hit .
Finally , sole days I found some neighors with me food , I was starting to eat so I was a lot .
We have to incentives about laws , but it was a hotel conflicts , because they grow noticed that some fish was missing skmehow .
I think that someone says sums of the food on he might while everybody is sleeping .
So everybody is gon na tend to enforce the past .
In the best morning I ate a piece of steak adn tue grojp was talking about me creafures thar were walking around to tell na eat us .
In the night I was thinking about many things just when I mean so noises .
I started in and it seemed that this guy has a cup .
I stop him and when he turned around it is a woman of the group .
We were talking about this when a day just a bad ; it was adorabpe must when he converted into a big bird creature .
He is my leg and it just a lot , we tried to melt the other but it is too late , it was the groups or us .
We saw that fast eating or friends and the job .
In some way that I robbed the pool in the night and I sake up it was too oh my survival .
But if I am te opportunity to reverse the trend of bow am I going I would n't do it because I have to face all of this .
SONG EXCERCISE IS NOT FOR GOURE HEALTH
Why do not have to exercise .
What benefits do you obtqin whlie exercixing ?
Do you know that 75 % of people in Mexico , does n't practise any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of my Mexico is the country with your best in the world .
Doing eccercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you exercise you need help when you re sent an you re pony .
There 's a lot of benefits that come in and with doing exercises like reducimg or take control of the re weight , it helps you sick heart disease , problems with you re neds , and also to an lake a lot of friends whjle foing aby rxercise .
One day there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practise any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GM or prsctise Crossfi or something kike that .
Soccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lo of friends , you can say fi , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to control the ball and drubble tou 're rivald on the field .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second to spend exercising .
thanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .
Is that any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
I disagrse about the public transport will try to be disappwaring , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in traveling .
This composition wiol expkain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , I have much more comfort and speedy .
There is a perdeption thaf a car can give you are freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottisy Government ( publication `` You people and transport `` ) , a 12 - 14 years old to explain « - I prefer doing in the far , it 's uicker ...
There 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because of a sister to music as well . »
Although they are many positive points about private cars , they ate alzo ndgative knes .
Indeed , as increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons , expensive .
They just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
Obviously , would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .
I szys a 17 - 22 years old boy .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay an fed on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
According to the raison Times , there ate a lot of traffic accidents which lccurred to private cars .
The main reason is the other cars ' ownes ate drunk whem drving .
It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were frank , it would n't have as much accidents .
Finally , I degeloped ckuntries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan an so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam jave bedn decreased .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
For this analysis , it isobvious thqt trvaelling by public transport is very important .
Topic :
Do you agree or disagree `` Always tellimg thr fruth is considered the most important thing in a relationship `` ?
Disagreement on always telling them both be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being yruthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurtig otherz ' fwelings ahd is unwise .
Another reason for not helping the truth slay the name is if it is about psrsonal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employee .
It is better to talk a little while lie at his moments .
To further illuistrate thr fidst point above , could hurt one 's feelihgs by taking the truth at all time .
For example , if some wokan yu are wcquainted weating inappropriate clothes you getting in the occasion .
People usually tend not meeting for the truth since it would make her feelings .
Instead of doing so , people may praiee her with other things on them .
In that case , they could still have conversations wothout boiing her mind .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private Since most of the time it is strong and inappropriate to make onwself too much to people at work or even people that one just go scquainted .
If there are questions about this we do not want otjer peopl to know , the might say a little white and each usully xoes nof matter too much .
If I am having a day out to go to a doctor , I would prefer the people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
There are the two opinion of mine on tells the truth or you .
Last Friday , Micaela and I am in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
When we are in the case , suddenly Mnichael walkdd toawrds tyhe dkor .
Michael closer to door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
Due to this , we 're not called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster ujst hecause Mixhael had closed the door .
The door was n't comes into pieces or fell down .
My curiosith hsd put me in a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way , hopefully he had gave me to answer I wanted .
However , things do n't hpapened lime wha I hoped .
I keep getting expwlled frol the school because teacher and I clasemates suspected Muchael wnd I steal our classmates - Carl 's wallet .
I could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly And without give any chance for us to freak out .
I finally realized that everything is a trap and we 're the unlucky xnd innocenty ones as we will to the trap .
We wiped off your toes , and saves our hand can we left the school .
Although , one way later , headmaster could put on trust through CDC , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
This is because the teacher has a biased mines .

In my area there are many railway lines and they 're ofteb overcrowded .
I pivate traffic in this town is the most presents , as the result the Turin is the town of FISH , the world knoen facdtory .
Near to your home , too far many supermarkets in which you can easily . Also they do not to live .
When you have to play the cellphone an energy will , you can do not in any tobacc hops bear to your time .
If you like shopping , in the erimeter of the town , the same time big supermarkets , which hold Many items of the main gresat factorids of Europe and about .
We all the industrialised countriesx , a connection to the Internet is granted apmost fo edach area in each building .
At the end , the tax are present and they even all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politician or people . Born in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
To my mind theory would be a bad betwedn paparazzi work as a privacy of famous people .
In my opinion is starsw shoild be able to deal and take on private time .
As far as I 'm concerned three is no one who feel comfortable when is under surveilkance of people to wait to fake lictures which show them in embarrassinv sitjation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of club 's ' for ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be a invioplability spheres of time without journalists following them all the time .
we rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that watching cslebrity doing cleaning or taking a day for a way is a shocking new for people who had tabloids .
To my mind , they do not believe celebs qre sucn a normal people as everyone of us only with some money in their bank account
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , we are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability of have normal life would be also been to them .
The Maze Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the roofs of this worldwide knoqn author .
As I gave an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try to
I poster of the film alreday offered a sense of intrigue nd mydtery whuch made me takes the decision to watch this film .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flash of the main character , which is a 15-year - old boy who find himxelf imprisonee in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
He has no idea , he ended up there .
However , he she realized that this is not a normal cm , which is located next to a giant and mysterious cave .
The people who lives in the camp take up diffdrent roiles in order to survive and defend themselves to the means of the past .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for coloring the main one look for an it of this place .
Still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down . comes verry dangdrous .
The film keep getting better and better as his watch it , having to exciting moments when the characters discovers something that hidden inside the man .
I heqrtily recommend it to anyone who want to have a rest of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will have no one indifterent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , but I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life love sport for everyone .
I like the seed of volleyball , most of the time it 's life and if you blink of probably missed something , such confact happens in less than a second , and stop evrey player directs ghe locatiob of the ball in hat amounts of time and the there 's the intensity , if you have n't seen a team go until 32 - 30 , and seed the energy on the floor and he met noise from the crowd You 're missng ouf .
Personally winning such a lot makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , be harder , pasta and it better , and serve in more different ways .
I live in the Eltgam .
My area is very clean and very green .
People here are very friendly and helpful .
It is a good plave to live .
One time to work on Wednesday , rubbish are taken .
Of course garbage is sorted into different bins .
This is very good idea , because they robhbish yndergo a recycling .
In my neighbors in the same data collected garage .
Every body care about cleanliness in the front of the use and in the gardens .
Especially aging is a lot of colours and pleasant ours .
I Eltham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the bus pulse .
Green live in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently often at Balck Bwar restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurants in Trecastagni , a little town near Catajia loczted ujder the man volcan slopes , and I round fhat reetaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
There were two rooms , smiling boon or co - smoking room .
The surroundings are rustic , let it still felt airy and you , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
As I was often with my friends Lorena and this future , I managed to smoke a good range of items on the men and I really liked Chianina besf , it is very tasty .
I te ingredsients were clearly rresh anc of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal cane to about forty euros per person , so that restgaurant it 's a little expensive .
If I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the day wax a little expensive and I will no doubt be back or other dinners .
chess is a topic with a lot of controvdrsy .
They have been present in our sovieties since ever .
Cannabis , hdroin , speed are some examples of substances that re rally wel - know foe all of us .
realization of drugs is a very useed adgument by people who believe that the measure coyld sklve ths problek of the explosion .
Margination hws a list with the illegality of this activity .
All this illrgality is he guilty for the attraction of the songs because the majority of people start saving drugs because they are young and it prohibitijon is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when they entertainment before in an action at a destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proven same kind of illegal due to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do n't believe that behaviour is from cause everyone needs to experiment and the new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something excepfional snd not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are nor as to play deadline to themselves .
Finally , legaliation of drugs mesns thst theu xould be capable nd we know how the taxes work in my country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .

Dear Les ,
Firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
In that time , it is always funny and , depending on the reason , it would rain .
If you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona wherr yiu will be able to a La Sagrada Familia , which is built by Antoni Gaudi , or La Alambra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Wonders of the world .
In Madrid you can go to visit some museums , kike the kind sofa or El Prxdo .
On the others had , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cqbarcenos Natiknal Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can wee somer migfation brids .
If I were you and I have a completely summer to enjoy Space , I would say per week in each place , and I met a car in order to love between the cities .
I recommend you not to the warm cloths .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

He wants a bad schoolk pribcipal ften punis gim .
Bra is energetic and clever students but he is also a bad Student and he makes nerds .
Although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of good because he has his sister who they need them .

A lot of magazines by The Simpsons is the most cartoon heroes in history ad I absolutely agrees .
For me , cars is funneir thab Homsr , although not magazines say that Homer is the best character
It was her dream raihy Zunday morning .
I was n't in the door to go out anyway .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the bus and quite a while .
Suddenly , we use a heavy knocked on the odor .
Who , earth could eat be ?
I could have even bothered to play me a visit dufing thie bloody awful weather ?
My concerns wewre answered swiftly , you the man on my threshold yedlled : `` I have a letter , Mr. Samson !
`` I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n't received a better to songs .
I opened it and quickly scanned tue tezt .
At first , I be observed ghe etter cautiojsly , but when I noticed my uncle 's time in it .
Although , I had n't met in a single home , this letter is his past dull and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
Fifty thousanc ponds , to be precise .
Exultation ssized my mind instantly , but I son began to work : `` What will I do with this amount of money ? ``
Well , many tasks I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying or last ten years .
Actually , this town is located in the middle of his not a river without Qatar .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of the town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
First of all these are very dirty by nature .
There are very casual with the environment in the importance of cleanliness .
So callec people of good future are inactie anx talmative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household bearby teh puglic roaxd throws the dirty tuings easily and we do n't bother about the one of the municipality .
I see all these During my morning walk .
What I need is to everyone who are staying the town shouted at least kerp clwan their own front places in kids sureounds the .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow props and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
People are now semi - centre and very narrow limped .
though they are becoming so callde educated but in real sebse theh azre still garage .

Nowadays , public transport has become a math topic .
The idea of leaving public transportation site is widely supported in developed countries , but the idea is erected in developing countries , like the job I live in .
As a matter of fact , car ownership has increased over the last decades Reducing the amount of people using public transport .
The Possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of waiting time in a long queues .
Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own car or maybe they can afford to travel by a father means of transportation Then the end provided by the local government .
There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to play the bus or rather than paying for a full tangy .
Similarly , people in countries and less income corn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
To conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage epople gkve it .
There will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in another when the will see it as long as their esconomy needs it .
People need easy , at a cheap solution .
In general , using a car is easy then taking a train or a bus .
It 's just near our house or your office .
You do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weight , or suffering because of the rain or the sea .
But if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply not do n't like to drive , you can find easier to have a public transport .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and working around , or reading newspapers and bones .
Is the car tastier than public transport ?
It depends on
The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
Sometimes Cars are faster than buses , sometimes but are faster .
The tdains afe slways fastsr then cars .
Speaking about money ? Traveling by car seems chsaper tgan publuc transport .
But , if we consider all the expenses ( buyinb ths car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe Mars do not so cheap .
In fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
What about the environment in the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by food citizen and strong supported by governments .

The last few words have been really tough for Michael .
This whole business started to go on his knives .
He has to help ate it , the signer be better .
For me one thing is clean as ash - the one he is in love with is Maria , not Angelina .
The one he Rate is Angelina , no Manila , that 's the problem .
He ca n't dump And just like that , they 've been friends for years .
She 's not need .
As he has to me stop to be without hurting anybody .

He 's Speak up with her .
Probably , when tomorrow .
It will starred in such an idiltic wzy .
The door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom wigh juxt a hotel and his waiszt anr Angelina happened to go in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n't really say what they ended up having Neo - perhaps , at the time he was posted at himself for not having fails to be the girl he loved Because of all these religious tissues , Malaga 's family and so on , but this is what happened .
And that definitely is not be right thing to do .
At that moment he di n't realise that .
Only after , when Angelins left , Michael closed the door and then he knew he had made a huge mistake .

Well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great ngineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
I 'm good at school , my marks coudl prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
These days I started studying English in particular 'cause it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I story about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronicd that all the subjects that I like most .
My teachers are very good at one jog so I have to be like them one day .
The big problems in my class are the majority of my classmates : the car hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
The thing that more annoys me is that they copy of the time from me and the other food student .
However , I do n't hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people who they want .
coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial College .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate cerfificate of English and when I am going to try better at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitouf : A great experience to our mouth .
Nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoys the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kids -Why are going to gain and so that stuff .
I arrived at Mxico Citu one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , licence .
We discovered our fasdination with food and ' The Puersuitour ' was born .
Then a brainstormed about meals and places to visit began .
The first day starred in an important dance … Tavo Day !
Tacontento wae ghe place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled lions , accompanied by food Hearts .
Due to Puerquitour is something to have , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vabcouver .
Ariana we are tax , but this time to work species .
The Home of the places is Marcos La Shue and tacos are gourmet shore .
It means that there are different taste of todtillas -vanills , strawberry , chipotl , normal , and want , along others and sales -tamarimd , Java , man , guacamole , etc .
The boy did not finish wins the Paco , after a week in Redorma and a lot passed in the Independence Amgel we went to move theatre to much he art movie Renoir hile we are cries .
Third lays the one of my favourite , I Place is soooooo nice and the decoration and eve of attire of the waitresses makss yoi feel into the bus .
La Pasta Guyana , which is located in La Condesa , offers bake potatoes with age of famous women and lovely drinks .
Totally recommended !
I Azuo Rezturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation fpr thr fourth ray of Puerquitlur .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are created sjrimp , for fillet nad shrimp Al Pasror qnd coconut water .
With kay , it 's time to eat more tacos , the plane ? … El asqdero Hidalgjense .
You have to be starting to pay a kolcajete by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you for not take breakfast it is a good action or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
Do n't forget to ask for a matter of beef ,
lost a week in the Puerquitour .
The Sixth say was to celebrate Mwgda 's fknal tsst , a fried food with school , who already presenetd it to get the castle Degree ; and the farewelp of license , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
Because we like the end , we celebrate rating in Kemelas Oub .
You ca n't go there we do n't be memelas , that is like huafache but Tiger and very delicious .

When we want to a good fair nd visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan as to dinner at Hilatia Gastrobar fod all the door comments about it , but that day it is closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequigo the traditional Al Pastor Sprcial accompaniewd by black beer .
The last day of the Ouerquitour eas accolplished with my favorite dessert , a strawberty cheesecake at Sgarbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I have to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitlur ! ! !
The cirst gwo chapters extracetd ffom Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as it .
This is a big caused by his sister , a person . mistreats Pip and his own husband .
Sadly , it has no future in any possibles way .
Moreover , he is just a regular life with a terrible life .
Besides that , it seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
He does not is complex norms when he talks in bug he uses them what he narrates .
Also , his life will be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a kid who only feels copmfortable whn he visit the tombstones of hi parents .
Obviously , nobody would like to live in wife , but I think everyone would ten to see sadness reading these chapters and , finally , kike him .
At least , I felt sorry for him and I would like to find what his stay has a good ending .
He likes lift a good boy that lives in hell nd tue Devil is his sister .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the trip protagonit qnd tyhe wag to tell the actions is the reason why we srory cwn connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
The one auyhor does not try to describe the protagonist wsith qords , but with action .
The narrator did not be a description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Also , the narrator mainly used djrect peech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a new occasions preferring to his own world .
This exertion can be read at the end of the first chapter , there the narrator answer the thief ariting thxt he did that he would get him the file , and that he could get in what brokne bifs of food he could , and he would go to the thief at the pattern .
Apart from this , he just write exactly what the characters said .
the voice is in first person and uses a subjectove plint of life .
He only know what he sees and he thinks about it , but he was n't have an omniscient power .
However , his piwer could be analyzing and descrtibing yhe sifuations wth a nice vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Also , he described in parents in a hilarious erm , making his father as a square , shout , dark and , which curly blak haor just looking at their tombstone .
These twists and creative thougjts aqre spread all over the dot , accompanied by green mode twisted reflecxtions like at the end of the first chapter , when he described the an eye stole Co. as man rid of the end hides in the rgaveyard jusg becase he saw him hugying himself .
Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a bad and boring life that pushes me to abase our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not have an effort to describe psychologically teh othef characters , he focused on their appearance .
Actually , we all of that Mr. Jake tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and he is worried more about what their neighbors thimk bout her rather than worryung abiut the person who live in his own house .
The narrator describes far as woman that has learned a good reputation beihg aghressive witrh his little brother .
An we know that you is a moody man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - figured , sweet - tempered , Mass - pong and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters rack is opposed to the way the narrator wives .
In fact , the dialogues of a character and not longer than me than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his painted in twelbe long sentencez with complex structure .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talks with short and simple sentences .
For instance , there is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second cheaper :
`` My sister , her . The surgery , was more than twenty years older than I , and was established a great reputation wkth herself and the neighbour becajse sdhe hsd brought me up `` by hand . ``
waving at the time to find put on myself that the expression Bent , in knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be lucky in the habit of making it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suppose that I Vargery abd I were both brought up by hand . ``
On the other hand , the dialigues aer simple and shlrter :
`` How lookee here , `` he said , `` The question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
what a film is ? ``
`` Yes , it . ``
`` Are you know what witfles is ? ``
`` Yes , it . I
Moreover , the vocabulary use by the narrator is exposed to what the characters said .
it uses a nice vocabulary , using a lot of metal cerbs ands abstract conceprs ghat are usually inspired by concrete things .
The math pointed on the first chapter is good example .
Regardless of the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
The third said `` Who d 'ye wigh ? ``
This is written as it is said , making it as realistic .
Notwithstanding , to play this novel is narrated is the protagonists .
The events are nqrrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic door - line withbout falshback .
The story is narrated as it happens .
The second hcapter makes reference to te first and teveals something about the other .
Also , is slow rhythm is debate .
The narrator refeals nokt so much about him or the other characters , but he write about the essential things we should know through the text .
the thief disappears , but I first chapter ending make us feel dubious about the most resting .
Therefore , I do n't know how the storey will end .
Too mych mtstery nd just a new facts ca be read in the coasters .
As I know is that this sport will nor have a happy ending .
Probably , the thief 'll take up to an unwanted advehture thst will make him growing up later .
I would like to read a story where it ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
Like another price in the wall , another tombsfone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a very witbout talpe , just a regular man who bird while he is learning to live .
Previously , this would be difficult as a narrator vokce clearoy comes from a person who lives while he is printing .
This is obvious why he makes reference to the fact that ohotography dod not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading the chapter is a pleasure , but it is difficult to help Skat is going to happen or , who is more , what the author is going to transmit .
If the story was a happy ending , then the central themed would be getting more adversitiws ; if it , it is a ad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day of her .
She has been waiting , on foot thix dawy to me .
It is the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She knew he was adopted once she was 7 ears old because her parents told her about it .
She did n't feel sad about it because she loves her parents every much and she feels lover by them .
After he 18th birthday , Anna yell a sudden necessity of knowing what happend to her bilogical mother nd ehy dix sne yave Ann away .
after finding the adoption papers are contacted by adotpion ahency .
She donvinced thw lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of `` very little sister who had a disease and need to know if they bioogical motherd woukd be a match or a idney transplant `` .
Even though it was legal , the lady gfave jer hte name and he contact phone number of Sarah Fielding , her niological mither .
A month passed by before he had the courage to deal that number .
The hesitated several times because they use afraid of her mother 's reaction .
After a few seconds , a huge picked up the phone .
At the beginning Anna did n't say anything , we could n't use any sound .
But then he said `` Well , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother `` .
After ajother few seconds of silence , and heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
the greed to meet the next ray in the park .
She was going to have so many answer to be much questions .
Anna will be able to finally lost an important chaptre in our life and that is that she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
The most exciting day of my life .
Last summer I went on holidays in Sardegna , in Italy , with my family .
On the first day I was very angry because my parents did n't like with us Ilariax , my best friend .
But I changed my mind when I heard at the radio to relax Sandman , a Swedrish singer , was on holiday in Sardegna near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I know it is possible and my parents do n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third say , where I was swimming in the sea , I am sure temple in the distance and so cameras , but at the moment I thought they were taking a video .
Then , I realized the boy at the centre has n't a simple way , I was relax !
So I ran toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting .
Then I went to me and he got a photo push me .
He seated there a few hours and I spent the best way of my life , doing his some questions and finding is done .
When he left I was sad but also really happy .
This is certainly the most exciting part of my life .
L'Albero , the most Pizza West of all
One of my favourite restaurant that I am always angry for is L'Albsro Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbvourhood .
As you wanted the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be too .
The walls and covered with trophiex and photographs for the worlds bext pizsa .
The pace , family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
My only complaint is thee are so many delicious choices on the menu , it is often fifficult deciding what to her .
So far I have never be disappointed .
To start , you must say the most Wind Nala , it 's a forest , flavourful salac thag is served in a boost made of pizza cult .
As a man does , you ca n't go wrong ordering one of the pizza 's , you are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
Besides the great atmosphere and are delicious meal , the service is friendly and efficient .
The story is very helpful explaijing tue menu to customers .
Also they prijces wre incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .

Several people said that Hational Botaxnic Garden is the best place tor students to get a spell time outdoor .
On the home there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
Sport started being admired by youth and I imprint a model of behavior on the Kong 's minds .
In the way to sides of the position stated above will be analysed before my town pefspective is provided .
from one point of view , the athletes ate good models to emigrate from several reasons .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
The man he will want to a sport , which is essential for their health .
Secondly , doing sport as teachers priuceless liufe lesslns , such as disvipline ajd dealing with success in failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goals ad prqcticing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professionap aportsmen .
This is a good examples for youngsters to follow .
From other perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good use models .
Firstly , sport has become business .
Many sports stars are not concerned about one of fame .
They ca lrad adolescebts to believe that money and some are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play aell anr having the fan of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who are disgustinbly .
For example , some time drugs or eat in order to win at any case .
It goes without saying , that this kind of behaviour spends a wrong message to the young .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantage in regard to profesisonal spirtsmen as you able modsls fpr oung people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professiomal athletes may be exclelent roke model for the youth , as long as the present the positive aspects of playing sports .

Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person nzrrator or the point of view of the protagonists of the story .
The relief is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he made pathos ahd ckmedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the prices an virtues he wish to portray , which the Bronte sisters use realistci style Place with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic malw heroes and female protagonists that the psychologically complex .

I am writing about an important historical place with is my favourite one , I am referring to huge city .
I visited Lugo Last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through my beautiful qsuares ajd parms and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedrals .
There are a lot of places in Lugo wprth visitjng .
For example , you can walk around the car will , which has been decpared a protected UNESCO Wirld Herutage Site in 2000 Becsuse it is the one woman Fill in the world that is complete .
I think that also is very beautiful .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visit a bus souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can not delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lu , a traditional parties and festivals take place .
money he lost omportant I ca mention Szn Droilán qnd Arde Lucuz .
From 17th to the Octobef Lugi holds its Wan Froilán Fiestas .
San Forilán is a festival of National Touris Interes .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , nd it shows traditional Galician costumee aznd folklore .
Another important festival in Sumo is true Lucas .
It is celebrated in June .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the of century town once again , so you can see Roman Marcus , Celtgic weddings , artists baskets , my musical evenbts taling ppace asnd local people an visitors got into perjod costumes , such as gladiators and Roman emperors .
I recommend you visit ago in June becauxe Ard Lucuys is celebrated .
You can enjoy tradktional Roman customs and Roman lived in Arab Luís .
Sumo is an incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform percise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
The bigger the city , nigger the problem .
The town is the end oargest urban agglomeration in the country , producing aily large amounts of waste . ``
City X `` has no specifuc wxste disposal Pan , but a general as establishes a due ferm umtil 1st July .
Despite it , there are a one plans to increase the great axreas ad revitalize the town .
The city is arriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluaying hte Council 's eco - friendly proposal .
In accors wifh ghe aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced duing yhe yearsd 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86 % of it discardsd inadequately .
This is due to the low effects of the `` Recycling Words `` progarm over the disposal problem . ``
City X . incinerates hozpital reaidue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7 % of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling fxctories have a point venture with the municipality to sort wage , and show a result 20 % better than last year .
The program reresents 2 % of - employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
The city and many projects such as the `` Keep it clean , keep it beauty `` , whose goal is to promote proler disposao in the public areas .
Another important one is the `` Let 's make it three `` , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150 % during the last ten years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of real and common areas .
A player crucixl activity are the `` Golem Communities `` , currently carrying 72 % of the town amounts of consumer vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A munixipal wzste policy this inyegrates pirvate and public sectods ans the community is required to solve the current problems .
The city needs a joint venyure to support a fjnctional adn sustainable comlerce of recycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of me according to the ED report of 2012 and also wins in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the `` Recycling Words `` problem is caused by this way of training , which ca be solved by trainijg offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a car or between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
For example , you can travel to new places .
Another idea is not at work , you can find a job and ear one before you start university .
Moreover , sometimes people are tire when they find schools because of my exams so they need to have some time to relax .
You can travel to different countries . yo have time , I would like to go to sit , Thailanf or Tina .
But you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first word ad then travel .
or cab find work as a waiter or in a shop .
However , some people in your should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , not forget what you have learned in school .
But I think or van apso lrarn if you travel or if you for so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technologcal sevelopment make people believe that in the future everything will not like in science - fiction movie .
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose me with planet we want to live .
At that about houses ?
Will people 's homes be different or all the same ?
Imagining tne fjture , I had everything different .
They plant - made and futuristi projects of houses will be the most fesirable .
the houses will have , for example , the shape of a severe or igloo .
Some of them might be turned upside down .
Sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .
At that about interiors ?
In a service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : Alex , cook , reminds us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
In pratice thefe wipl be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .
Everything will be artificial wnd uncozy .
That 's how I see a one of the future .
Max to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last rounds of interview next month !
I really hope to work with you today !
To make the job at the position successfully , there are the useful advice and information you might want to know .
At the interview , learning interviewed a good impression is of treat importance . Her 're some tips on how to do it .
First , meeting as properly as possible .
Budinesslike suots ans toes fit in well with the for occasion .
Euitable dressiny comes across as effective and reliable .
Second , being punctual .
Inteeviewers hgave to cope with tight schedules everydqy so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's a somehow .
Third , been prepared .
As the old saying goes , we prepare is half done .
You 're expected to know something about your company , is proper questions and communicate effectively wjth intervidwers .
If you can learn as much knowledge about your company as you ca up irons , you really stand a change in the interview .
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales managdr will be intefviewing gou .
He stand out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbvers all day long .
Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to he saw department two years ago .
He got prooted vvery quickly because he always brougbt firth newa iedas xnd facilitate the reform and development in the department .
In his eyes , what counts most is the lack reord abd the capailities shwon in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you soon quedtions like what you achieved and you up full abouf youyr last job .
I hope what I mentioned above all be of some help to me .
Looking forward to hearing from you soon .
Lots of pope ,
I

Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised by lot but Lack of eight to twleve - year - olds , and often orgahised psorts and evening activities for them , such as teeasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spend my summers working in the college cwnteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .

I did it quite difficult to find an area of improvements gven Andres 's outstanfing overall performance .
Yet , iftentimes , being ovedly respectgul may play against him and although he has gained he respect of all the people he had woken wine , some of the suggested he should build up hid spear - confidence , rather than end up attempting to for everyone 's face and taking lwnership for other people 's mistake .
If I was my own language school I would first year in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school ad the service it will provide .
Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , populayion statistics such as it , tender and family type , potential customers and colpetitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able to only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my oroduct anf to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of large markets are devices some strategies to attract the .
For instance , if my good way to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presented by posting regluar updates about my language school on Gwitter ahd Facebok or to offer discounts for siblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awareness , advertising in local newspaper or offering intensive courses dould prover successful .
However , if the target market wede botu , young people an adults , offering discounts to family guys could be a better choice .
The last step will be to recruit a state of professional , experience a qualified teachers and to be an attractive and reasonable price of the service I would provide .
Last but not least , I would get udeas adn approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeed .
I ok ?
Have you eve thoughts about how you can propose your language courses for example ?
I challenges you to think about it and try it .
According to recent research , there is no doubt that natural gas crilling rigs , natural way pipelines anc underground as storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the area of natural games infrastructure earn from a few to several percent mopre tha those who live in other regions wnere sucb an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is the developing natural way inudstry equaks new jobs that is profitable fkr leople livint in whereabouts .
exploration and extinction of the same gas wilk crdate lotw of new jobs in every differeny branchrs connected with car industry for instance in exploration , sing , production and distribution of shake gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooprate wifh this infrastrcuture will also create vacajcy mobs .
Even if companies will have engineer and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgroath in a number of you positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to at a sleep somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in ghastronomy ahd hospitalitu sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Inztitute conducted a research which show the Roland as benefit from extracfing and developing the infrastructure of sharp as
breeze is an amazing countdy tht a lot of people visit annually .
When plannibg theif vacation a lot of tourists and faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
Choosing where to go in Greece cab be far as the use so many choices .
There are some travel desginations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
My Beaches , crystal clear wallets and I fridndly kocals are not the only thing that do it apart from other Islands .
Santorini also has a volcano Which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
Another places worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
Believe it or not , others is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
The Parthenon , the necropolis Muserum ad ghe district of Mohastiraki aee just a fan of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but it leads , Cvrete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
After that having beautiful sandy beaches are being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports pxrks ghere , which are extremely fun !
Summing up , breeze is a beautiful country worth visiting , although chlosing where to go can be hard .
The question is whether it 's better to prepares for a long time before the day or few days are going to be enough .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's such Better to prepare for a long time before any exxm yuo may face in your life .
It 's quite important to be organised to the the highest score you can get in your exam .
For example , one year ago , I bad my final surgery drum .
I do not up a plan to study all the book we had to go through to the exam plux reviewing thdm twice .
The main required my commitment for around a 12 hours daliy tsudy for almost 3 months .
The new era worm and perfect discipline , I am able to get a very big scores in my Surgdry tinals .
If I do n't had such an organizer plan , I would never have n't such a perfect score .
Another thing to add is not going stresxed before the day night .
It 's quite normal to pass this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when Trams are approaching .
What is not normal at all is taking anxiety Due to the plethora of stories you have n't finished and are included in your team .
For example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant Enough to reflect my studies thinking that I still has enough time to make my exam .
I do before my exam , I realized that I ran out of them .
I am insomnia yhe bight of my room , it was n't enough that I ca n't well prepared it also my nerves gotg torn ouy znd that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in it due time in order not to be ovrrly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I was at getting high score , I asserts that memorizing thw ddtails is important .
If you do n't start studying before esam wkth an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the road lines of the subjects , but this will never help you soon to details and understand the concepts lyign behibd evefy single word .
That will help yo a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise evergthing bwfore your exam .
I can call that time when I am quite ill before my Anatojy wxam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .
In the exam , I had that questions where it requires describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
Since I had practise a lot and memorized that foncept bsfore mny imes , I was able to remember it .
It was just floodkng without so much effort .
So , for us having enough time to memorize and practice was a year is going to help you a pot in our way .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation pad is much better than having an few days to bet prepared . If you want to bet hkgh scpres ahd perform geeatly , you should start studying fromk da one if possible .
Do n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one only aim at ?
In my opinion , nuclear energy is to be bane to replace foseil fueps .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't need foe the environment .
The Carvon dioxside emidsions is very small .
The biggest text is the explosion .
However , the technology is evolving ane nclear power plants are getting safe .
Secondly , Nuclear power plants are ready very popular in this type of energy is the lowest to replace fossil fuels .
Ednergy whic we get from sun and wound is still a Only a few percent of work every production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plot is expensive .
When we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
The most expensive thing in nuckear lant is to hire qualifued peesonnel .
Besides , we need something that ca ork alk the time .
It ca n't for making energy whyen tye weather is `` , because people need a log of electricity .
If we run out of power entire cities would plug the chaos , and this is unacceptable .

Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving accunt in the UK . I 've got some research to find out the best savinhs avcount vor you .
Bepow you can find a few suggestions of mine .
The thing and might get quite a god offer for you .
Firstly , the age of interests is by 9.8 % , which is quite good .
Additionally , if you open a thing acxount in the man , you will be a diary as a girl .
And you do n't need to lay on annual chxrges fo having a credit card .
Unfortunately , the bank notes n't have branchex in Britain .
And of banking operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , as many branches in the UK ( even 62 ) , so yo can make all bank oprrations on spot .
But there is a service change for Owning a credit card ( £ 12 Ten year ) .
You do also get a gift as a new aqccount uolder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .
All in all , I would recommend you to open your first servin account in the Phone Bank , since the rest of interest is her and you do n't need to pay a annual charges .
I doin operations by phone are usually very easy and they always have to a great opportunity to improve your English .
The final decision is yours .
Take care and see you very soon ,
Yours Agineszka

I have been skiign for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to eat skirrs use these days .
Every day as soon as I woke up I worked forward to my morning on the slopes .
My parents would ask me to a gentle slope wash my brother and leave us the for a couple of hours to the skiing on our town .
The temperature was of several degreea below zero , and you could free if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My mother hoped a natural talent for the sport , bug I feel qiite uncomfortanle and scared .
Little by little to improve my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
Nowadays we have a lot of my skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skating is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a new lessons with an experienced instructor at using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school shbjects anr passt expdriences , I have no doubt that the preference I 've selected above are to accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business Kid .
The subject I 've putsued at my high school level such as fimancial accoubting , commerce and economics , given me the opportunity to utilise and put into perspective on knowledge of understanding businsss concept and has given me a solid avademic foundqtion .
I 've also participated in various group work and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a Bachelor 's degree .
I would love to associate it extremely talented students , lectures and even professors in order to receive a week roundwd introductjon to the numerous aspect of any of the preference I 've selected anime .
academically , I 've always been a very determine and studies individaul amd I would be more than willing to devote myself to the artwork necessary in order to achieve a Bachelor 's degree .
I also have an indrubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of te Business Studengs Associqtion ( BhSA ) , Head boy ( sdnior prefect boy ) and captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield orle .
undertaking a scholarship so admission into one of the univerdsities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business settings , as well as devslop fhe communication , organization and numeracy skillz I have acquired at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Governmeng Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic Before taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with his possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undegroing rapid wocial chajges and transportation , making it a fascinating places for students of any discipline to study in .
Check universitiea provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuzes wtih outstanding abilities , safe and affordable edcuation warm and friendly environmenht adn culrural duversity .
I believe that I will have an opportunity to experience both modernity a tradition in one if the safest ad for stable countries in Europe .
Above all , the high quality if educatipn wikll makd me ready for the future .
Another major reasons why I am being motivated to study in Czecn Republi is lack of Finance .
Also , education in Nigeriz is not a joke as teachers and elcturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Niferia aer ot safr !
Right now , I am really looking forward to the challenge of a university is academically , social and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn his business concpts voupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities in community service , would make me a competent addition to the end of my proposede yniversity and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can take a positive contribution to my proposal university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy leafning environmnet for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who is the commitment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing breath to my proposed university in mind was than me .

In that is that there are there for , to make people Happy .
These haity four - lsgged animald are also very protective .
One of their jobs is to watch on their humor family .
So if the sense that their own might be in danger , the immediately react by working at a person or a thing that they might have passed it .
The stranger fhe bond between the dog was their owner , the stronger than Pig 's reaction will be .
It is believed that do requires a lot of attention , which is not too .
For zre reallt not too hard to take care of , bathing in grloming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
These acts add a few lacks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all da at work or in school and knew some physical activity .
So having a job could also remind them to live a healthier life .

Yours faithfully ,
The aim Tsoh
Education is a milestone oh my life and having a good education is te main room to the labor market .
The parentsw disappointed with educational system and institutionalized educatikon tey to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homesxchooling mah szeem , according to some of these Parents ' opinion , `` a paved road `` , it
is a path not suitable for everybody 's hard nd thst compelz us to seek othdr routes .
Homeschoolikng should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon eince ony a new countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can bat .
The area sorts of countries that do not
Except homeschoolihg as a legal alternztive so , and others wore it is just an isolatred happening .
The situation in Spain and be assessed as `` legal vacuum `` in life of our constitutional dight to free
eductaion meanehile attendance is compulsory in elementary wnd secondarg ecucation .
Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homleschooling may also free up time for complelentary aftivities suvh as music , sports , and even the family lives .
Homeschokled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardzie tezt an ice recognition of prestjgious universities .
Now though , before homesxhooling your kids you are late to consider the same amount of roadbhlocks :
The lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up bring a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned , want to think about homsechooling as a wake up all of educational
Systems .
However , homeschooling aill nwver sjcceed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , I technolgoies open up as `` The
Pollution `` and blenedd learning is the future .
Geographic and natural environment around the building span , as well as the neighborhood , would be surely taken into consideration whipe designjng houses of the future .
Obviously , the future azlso ineicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In are exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and foods , people should have the house built of resistant materials .
steal or concrete structures could give the dseired effec in this particular matter .
Environmental rfiendly buikldings aill be definitely on the drawimg obard .
Build wkth recyclalbe or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be easy to be fit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skyligjts and poor panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even those days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors oughtf to be controlled by computers in order to maximize comfort and energy efficiency .
Urban housung issues ( such as pollution grpwth ) will be solved by exploiting some new area .
Maybe it 's bujlding casztles in the air , I houzeboats and apartments situated baove city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up pace tjat eould otherwise be late .
Although people would keep mulling over how to modernize their way houses ( and bargain shout it to beighbours ) , the wall all need a car , most read in a nice cup of te .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concert ivory tower .
watch it to use it
The alpha and the opera of a good team is trust .
That 's the most important point if you want to play handball .
You must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammates and he had to catch it .
Otherwise the opponents will have the chance to get a point .
Are you a real team player ,
Handball is one of the most dynaqmic spirts in the world .
Over eighty points can be more mall together in sixty minutes , if not even worse .
This shows how rapidly and game and changed .
She lost rail can make your day the owner of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
At first , it was only a hobby bht wit the years it became Yassin .
When I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditionak tean spirit .
If you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good tram and do n't forget to fun !
Triathlon : A fgamous slort throughoit the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practicing a lot .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work for da nd as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
In fact , we can see many people jkogging and cycling thesr cays whwther it is in the morning before going to work or even faster .
Despite tnese tw veing thw mlst popular sport amongst alleys , many more are just as interesting nd profitable .
One of them . biathlon , which is my favourite sport .
It consists of a picture betwedn three different sports , swimming , cycling and joggnig and as a result it can be extremely demandiong .
What I enjoy more about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which mean I can do it near me instead of having to go to a sports center .
It also means I and chase he location that most plrases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
Triathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to buy it .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand the improving in such a demanding sport requires me who is is important to establish some days in order to jeep motivated .
You must not just yourseld tko far .
A gap year between school ad college sounds a great idea for those that have to decide what they want to study .
However the re some questions whether it should be everyone or you .
First , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gal year to earn money to help with the bills it is time we spend .
But that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
Most of the people think that the gear is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , bug this is not true , you can travel to develop your cultjre anf do voluneter sork , so you can become a better person .
On the other hand , my teens who use a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
For example , things might gone not as they have expected for mulyiple reasons such as not having enocf moneh or not getting a mob .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all played and knew how shown that the shade the possibility to do something useful with their time .

`` carer sales of him `` is a fantasy story written by R.R . Tolkin .
Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of times , a fame of the village of gas whl ecomes a hard againmst uis wihses by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chtysophylax fomes ajd devastates everything , he is set fire against them , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , nut also obtaining a huge treasures .
At the end of the sky , sales becomes an independent kiri .
I liked a sort this story firtsly becauss I have fantaxy stkries , especially Tplkien 's lives : they bring me to another universe , making me get every day 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional levends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights feveal fesrful adn incompetent and clothes are wo with word instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkiem 's ironic sale , based so on the comical gust of Latin winds , makes it extrsmely pldasant to read .

Dos traveling broaden your mind ?
In my opinion , travelling deos hroaden yoir mind .
When visit different places , you go to be different environments , vultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a two basic sequences , you fan communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to be the way in which other people have , to see that your way of living is nor the only one that exists .
They can help you to understand that if everyone has access to many things you do have access to , an to raise than pehaps ypu should apprecjate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even feel rather , which is a basic resource and we tend to the for granted that everyone can see some water to drink even though this is not true .
Besides , when we travel to different places we meet there are many different cultures eat diffedr greatly from our own culture , if we see how different from one another Humans are .
For all of the reason I think travelling realky bfoadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fldeged researdher and academician .
To flufill this dream a PHD degree would be the most essential footsteps .
I am mlstly lso interetsed to pursue my Paz on theoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium propwrties of condensed - whose systems .
I would also like to carry out my why research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as srugs agains several human diseases , as cosmetics materiasl ahd as phofonic axnd optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemisry ajd Environmental Cemistry are the interesting fields of chemistry Because of this numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation an intgellectual capavility to build a career in one of the previous mdntioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barjsal .
This is no future for Public transport ?
The number of cars grow up rapidly , however they Public transport is still in ours .
Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidren to drive through the city center witgout some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient , own car or public transport ?
Well , depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
You do n't have to carry abou yhe scheduke - you are a differ so it 's your decision whdnever hou want to go or play longer in some places .
You can listen to your favourite music or radio .
You have to book .
However , as a lover you always have to be careful and watch out on the role .
If you want to travel is one place to another to see different places , our own car is the best solution .
It follows go to see much more in your pace .
The thing about the costs .
is how much you can for a petrol nowadays .
Consider as well so many days do you have for vacations .
Maybe cheqp arilines arw better ?
But bid to our everyday life .
Most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
What if we are the public transport to get to work ?
Well , due to do n't have to worry about the parking pace and not an read more backs on the way to work .
Simply , you can use the way to work as an additional Bye for yourself .
What do ?
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
And if the ecology this important for you just think about the pollution .
Let 's rflect one again : is that a future for public transport ?
In my opinion : Yes , there is a
. Travelling by car more convenient ?
Well , it depends !
By using the first narration ?
The first narration canm attraft readers ' attention at the beginning of the fridtion anf maks thr rwaders get into the thought of the madman easily .
We ca n't understand the others think Usually , but in the fiction , the author invite us know that beside the madman 's mind .
Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were not involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like real happend .
Using the order directly mwkes thw horror penetrates ibto out hearts .
For dows ths auhor create a word of horror to the reasons ?
The other created the horrible atmosohere by describing the scene , the disordered mijd anc rhe sound of hewrtbeats .
First , the scene tyat described the murder makws readers ca n't help themselvea smerging thw imagese in their mind .
But like a man 's own car happening reigns in front us .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbwats .
To my opinion , heartbheat is the element tyat push the whole story to the climb .
Every time when he south of heartbeats starred housing , something insured .
In the first time , when we madmsn hexrd the heartbeats of the old man , he had found to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time we madman heared the heartbeats , he became impatient , scare , excuse anhd insane , in the end , he confessed what he killed the man and dismembered the course .
At the same time , the geartbeats also dragged thje readsrs nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think he had to autho wanjted to express the disordered jind of the barman is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the function he confessed the crime , the madnan 's uses the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell me rsaders tje process of the true thing that he had done .
We share contract for he came and the cruelly , leads us a strong impression that the main character has totally insane and crazy .
Shievring insider our heart , and horror increases .
`` Let 's go to the first to be the variety of animals which are found there `` , a told to his friends one sunng afternoo .
When we can set , they started their turn to the forest .
When they arrived there , they started to look around Trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits a deer .
Max and she finds took a walk under the great fun , actors to live , they saw something had looked like an animal lying on the grass . `` What 's what ? `` , My said aloud .
They ran quickly , closed the rules and they reached the place where the animal pals . `` It 's a beer ! , its low is in a trap `` , Max 's friend shouted .
When they are the animals , we could see that it was Suffering , so they decided to free roe deer .
By this decision , Max gook couarge to open te Yep , but the Peter did n't come because its dig was injured .
One of Max 's friend bought water from the right to get to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure those animals .
Afterwards , the find a better and it walked away slowly .
The one day finished , Max nd bis friejds returned home feeling happy because they and saved the animal 's life . `` What an amazing day ! `` , Max whispered to himself as he hot it be that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
probably not , but they are many people in slow - business or politucal life , who are ready to do everything to have their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for the reasons : Because of their jobs or because of their sfandalising prkvate lifs .
If you decide to became famous because of your scandqlising private life , it would be silly to complain about taking paparazzi .
There is a while , probably , of the most important in public love , that has more or less : ' It is not important what are the Talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .
Most of celebrities follow this type , as it is just what they are living now .
This is why they are often be to get information about their private life .
Real problem stadts wahen journalist inmjures noy yhe celebrity , in its friends or family .
Paparazzi and careful in contact with famous people 's children , that can have negative influences on their emotional developments .
How about those who do n't want to be popular because of scandcals ?
In most was there are just doing this job as well as they can , reading the long time .
And when finaloly paparazsi noice tuat there is nothing interesting in this lie , they just leave the plane .
Summarizkng , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalist .
And I hope they understand , their city is to save their relatives .
Great food is Probably one of the most valuable Pleasure of life .
As a person who likes to me , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the many factors to decide where Should I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurants in Lksbon callrd `` Las Fichrras `` .
It was suggested by two friends of mine in according to then , because the good for and funny environment .
I want to dinner with more , trends in order to hearing his hand car or Mexican food after a stressful week .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity server and the easy services .
We face continuous oroblems ith thr order such as : dishes feom another title serged flr us by mistake , and drink were served with a considerable Nepal and the bill has shown veen withour ssking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinka were still on the table ) .
To my back ( or not ) , I met a friend of nine on the day after that told me that shed eat dinner at `` as Fidheras `` before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , the restaurant is terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexdican restaurant is just opened with lower prices and good service .

Global warming and its consequences in 2015
The Guardian 's article `` world 's ultimate about to enter ' unchzrted territory ' as it passes mm of warming `` , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the process of global warming .
Referring to scientists at the British Met offices , 2015 is going to be the year when we milestone of a parking will be broken - caused by global warming - with all lead to unknoan consequencesd on the future .
The World Metworological Oranization madd known upblicly thay 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it was used more carbon dioxide on average by burning ofssil fduels .
These problems just announced recently will be issue to talk about at the UN sumkit in Paris in three weeks .
Then , food leaddrs wiull be nefotiating about putting the increased carbonb emissione couplerd with the El Niño clumate pnenomenon .
Stephan Beaches , director of the best Offide 's Hadleu Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate change as the rise of temperatures or the catzstrophe expdcted by scientists wgen global warming rises beyond . . This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , number judo , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics are to his consequences on economy , global secueity abd the fight against poverty .
the stand up for a global deal condirmed on the UN summit by the reading states and therefore these climate target should be a stone - model for other countries .
Furthermore , climate scientist , Hawkins expects a conyinuation of global warming , clarkfying thus sttement wigh hte example of Central England , which is warm 20 % More than the goal average .
Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water stress an Lots of harvest .
Taking the consequences , a `` wxrming woulc be even more dakaging acxording to teacher .
Despite the result of a NSaA study pointed out that there would have been an ice mass gasp in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10 % that this pdognosis will come true according to grow Andtew Shepherd , university of beds , as the study at alresdy bee proven song by 57 other studies .
Although the NASeA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists is global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and Economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
I prohlem lise in the outdated frameworks in which they IWC opdrates .
Fifteen whaling natioms formed tge JWC after half populations collapsed .
The organisation was initially it up to conservd whalesx only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
The qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and when experiences them , the evoke a sense of wonder who admiration .
To be included on the old Heritage Lisr , properties may be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selextion citeria .
The world heritage This is important because it attract tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
It is a protected by UNESCO becauxe ghey havew found new animals or plants ; they are endangered Faces in the area or have a significant importance in History .
Would Hritage is the destination on played on Earth What are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as much , have been inscribed on the world heritage pits to be protected flr futur generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the poetry of the country on his terrutory it is located , buy it is considered in the interior of the international community to protect the city for future generations .
Its protection and presentation becomes a concept of the international Woeld ehritage commjnity as a home .
Another advantage for a site to be described on the List is that once a country wigns tje Convcention , he has its inscdibed on the world heritage Lost ; the redsulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments to heritage reservation .
Great awadeness lads to a central rise in the levels of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance amd exlert advice from he works Heritage Committyee to support sctivities fof thr preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage Oist afe that the sites are hot fundex so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover thy remidn in the list of sites in danger withoit to receive assistance .
In my opinion they sites in danger unless they do answer at ten criterka should be project for UNESCO .
It 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance my friend the natural and cultural heritage .
Cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching a flying about it .
It 's my first passes and I am following it as far as my earliest mjemory goes .
Cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collabroation and sfrict discioline .
It it teaches us how to become individuao weaknesse nd gain advantage of other strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket -in my early childhood .
Even when I as a kid I started playing with boys of my higher age than me .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed fricket religiosuly and have watched almost every match Ondia played .
Sachin Tendulkar is my favourite cricketer .
I am fan of their batting .
He has grown almost every record in cricket history .
Apart from his cricketng skills I loved his ability to handle presshre ane his calm nature in all situations .
If someone wants to learn more about crickwt I will arrive him to watch batting of great blue Sachin , David , a wide Pointung .
To learn more about bowlimg onr should watch madam , large and Murli .
I will also advise rrading mre about crickwt on cricinfo.ckm .
It was nice articles , reviews ahd stztistics on my players and gaze .
Reading biographies of time about cricketers will also help to understand the inisghts of the game in deep .
Cricket is going through roufh hpase dhe to match fiximg znd betting scandaps .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this ad will spread to wings all across the world and once again in its covers a magnificent Snow .
I got a friends about the week ago , nd he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my racket test ?
I ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my live in such a deep way .
By the way , do not know that a ticket Skat is ?
It is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of land , then I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly Happy .
about two weeks before I met . I watched a very beautiful movie called `` the vault in my stress `` .
It 's about a week couple who are doing Because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
The movie has touched me very telly , it made me think about life and about the way people need to live without apprecciate ghe reaoly important things .
So after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thimking abou my life .
Now I have te feeling that I need to live alone , but I have no idea what is this `` Sorry `` .
Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I heed to do other things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necesxary meet someone new , from another emtire djfferent cultute to make me in about what I want .
It is very strange than another person bexame cufious bout a very profound Diary of me that I have never thought of .
Well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my racket it that I now .
However , now I have an awful feelkng aboht what I am doing today , because of the first time in my life I am sure that I need chabge somethimg , and I think this `` somethjng `` is almost everything .
People lives ill change in the future , and I bet it 's not to the better .
Unlike populxr understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towatds `` progress `` , whatever yhat wortd means .
It is a cyclical process .
God has it away in the first century `` , bit jog three centuries later it was only a shadow of its last .
one later pdriod Romans were n't been able to make the high quality cejent tha their ancestors were able to make and have technicsl mastrry over cost a new centuries earlier .
one who can safely say that three centuies from his Humans will possess all the technological nowledge thaf they possess now and asked for granted ?
No one of assire such a thing .
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new cafe has .
But let 's kick the World War hypotbesis forf a second .
A fire world war is the only see in which we could be a dramatic change in peoples lives in the same length of 50 years from bow .
But there 's , at the day , prospects for a no World War II
I do n't think so , but on the other hand beat the will do I know ?
The clauses that will lead to a new world we may will be in ecistence fight now for and I know , and no one , or only a few car wide and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Fdrdinand could be killed , and that ysmbolic event ciuld serve agaim as an excuse to come countyr declare Qtr to another , but the role undrelying causes that acfually led me countries to wage or against a mother would have its roots in much older ones .
As the causes of the Second World hav had its roots on tents that was the outcome of the First off , a Thirdly , hypothetfical war , could have its roots on a car conflict that may well are happenned aready .
the pet 's not digest into that , that 's all other toxic rhat falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had called asleep on the touch watching TV .
I got up and I made to say to the front door .
Outside stood and most extraordinary - boiling an : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
I was taken jack , so I called my mother , the car sleep with the boyfriend .
I came down , but he did not stream .
Instead She started crying .
The man as it turned out was my father , it has been missing for 15 years ...
I did n't know what he was still alive .
brother had always told me he had died in the car .
I think she did this to my own good .
I was very caused by the situation and did n't know if I like him or not .
In my team I had been gym as an intellectual but now he was in my dining room and he looked like an elephant or something rxotic .
It was very odd to the time in my home .
Now we will live together .
Although the most is more difficult , now we al get on well .
It is great to be a whole family gin .
The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .
It is surrounded by Federal of buildings such as the city hall and the building of the corporstions of the Middle Ages .
The more groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
He helped each other and the modern ones taught them youngsters .
Sometimes , he became very rich .
Each building is decorated with the blazoj of the ckrporation .
These architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of who ate hosting fats , hips and restaurants that attract a pot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is covered with pavement Inn is a pedestrianmized srea .
It is an important place to the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is more of narrow pavef streers , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shape .
Recently , several of the building he went reztored qnd we can not better and the beautiful building and carvings .
Every year , the Christmws comew , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the facade of the building while a hug fkr tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is on of the highest rwnked monumentd in the history and Culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
The first castle , called palatiu , was built in 11th century , the remains of it is still visiblke insiee the walls .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century funally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged ubtil todat - time to depresentative remnant is probably famousa arcaded clutyard .
During the for the visitors to shown szeveral room and aparfaments , as well as Royal Privats Apartaments with sea - famed twpestries of Polish ' kings collection .
Another attraction of the court is vjsiting fhe Crown Treasudy , the Polish coronstion insignia were scared , and wrmoury .
Apart from the features , there are also an marvellous exhibitions in the Castle congaining itfs hisory as well as the other corrections .
while visiting Aawel Roywl acstle ohe canh not fit xeeing Dragon 's fun - a car under the castle , were , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its east and uniqueness .
It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and cultures .
Everyone will find something interesting Along the variety of exhibitions and this , and for certain it will be a memorable experiences .
I have been learning English as a second language since I am an years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky man because I have ad the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and taught lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn to speaking , singing , and among other activities in English , in a way similar to now we learn you own money languages .
Moreover , I travelled to England and lived in English failies fod a few week every summer since I started learning until I was sixteen years old .
So I grew up thinking I could spend a write quite good English .
Even though I do have little thworetical knowledeg about English grammar rules , I can have mysefl undersfood in a normal conversation , and I can rite an email to a friend wituout makiny topo many mistakes .
One day and I decided to the the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enrol in a creative ariting courze in order to practise my writing skills .
Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments are submit him to be evaluated by my peers .
And there I realize at least we thing : the first one that it is possible to learn how to with better ; the second one hat even when you can male yojrself generqlly uhderstood , It is not so easy to be precise .
A magician uses a more and a lack hat , bug it could n't be a mark show if he did n't know how to perform the sick .
In the same way I am the ideas and the goods but I have to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I want to do the magic truck of precise a stylish warning .
adolescence .
Everybody say it 's the best period in our home site ; that they do n't remember is that it could be so the worst .
Adolescence would be compared to a foggy patu abd even when it seems you ca seem something three it , in reality it do n't .
The awfhl ofg is composed by our uncontrolled nations .
Everything is unknown , but we try to present that we know a lot of things .
We would be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often wit oyr patents : every time we desclver somethin new or we say something , the judge us or the big some long speeches to try to change our ideals .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that the confuze oue mionds .
As I said adilescents cpuld be very confused and if there 's a thing that girl under our ski is when moms can sometjing wnd ghen yell us to do the opposite one .
The worst part is that they are angry with us !
We 're confused , they 're not clrar ad thwn tyey alsi get any as they 're surprised when we very mad at that !
It 's true that we should always be respected but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provide us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with a parents is to find a sort of sccordance , because in the end we do n't any form anger fix them but also a lot of love .
Love . That 's a new farming thxt adolescents have to face .
It 's in the usual Are they 're used to me , as close to family and fiends , but it 's a new kind of one .
It 's a kind of hope that ztruggles ; it makes butterclies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tui .
This kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the top of jobs that does n't make us feel sleep at night .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is `` score as exiting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical ad in the following one you own knew he did .
Dear group leader ,
First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shop to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice selcome and , please , feet at home .
Her , in Mallorca On the use a lot of places to visit but I will recommend yo a nice place , without tourists , Rose and crowded beaches .
On the east of Mallrca yopu waill fibd a small and beautiful village called Arat .
In the municipality of all of will find a counter ton , situate on the edges of the mountain range of elegant .
I Colònoa de Sant Here is a traditional fishermne vlilage .
Nowadays , you can still see some vishermen foshing on the seashore .
Here you adventure starts .
In order to get to your destination you must rude a bicycle and just enjly he wplendid panoramic giew .
You will rides until Ca lps cans , one of the most rnigmatical beaches of Maxllorca .
This one is part of a protected arrow , a natural Bade .
or that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
As Machado said `` . he camino al and `` .
It means that we must important is the day , the journey .
Going on a is near the seashore wit fhe brewze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experience in life .
On the way to be loz canw , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
There ate a lot of trees called `` tamarells `` , native terms of the most of Mallorcq .
Moreover , you will go between two anciwnt obelisks which are given recently restoredr .
Finally , you will get to be los Cans .
It is a special deal with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
There you van practise dfferent soorts .
It is a perfect place to go diving bescause yoi can be different fishes , sea urchins ans seaweef .
There you can also take a chance and middle in the while sea .
A car drom spotts , you should not do different cultures points .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificarications tbat werr used to keep the small boats of the local cishermen swve crom sorms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical twoer callrd `` Talaiot `` .
The function of the Talaiots is not clear e.g .
Maybe it was a defensuve tower or an important building for high - class people .
It is important to stay in the beach until the sin goes down .
The sunset in the place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Trxmuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the Qlcúsia bay , lack of the mountains range of Tramuntana amd the type of Formenjtor .
Ca los Canx is a mixture of me , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it was , of course , I need to work in a favour : Please , keep our secret .
Regards ,
Paula .

the Future for public transport
When we imahine futuer , we rarely imagine overcrowded see an rusty subwsy train .
As technolgies degelop and become cheaper more and more people by personal care .
A car allows us to have lasted did not to spend on others .
Travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Does rhis akl mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
In my opinion , it is not true .
Firstly , they will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a cat .
Students , children from are families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Secondly , cars ca also try to public transport .
Science fiction offen xepicts future as the world where cars are used freaky .
anyone can see the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do n't have an inborn driving skills , so even in the future chuldren amd tednagers wjll need public transportation .
This is also the for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least dueing thd nearest ton of genre .
pie chart above gives sdome infirmation abojt the average monthl salaries of buses and doctor in our different countries .
According to the court , the two countries with the last salaries are Country A and Country B .
the ones ate called `` source counteies `` , which means that they provide a Supply of health care workers to other countries .
Otherwise , the country with the biggest saliaties zre countfry C ajd coumtry D. Differently from the first two countries , the one was called `` destinatio countries `` because the healthy cab service is provided by foreigb and quaqlified workera .
Moreover , in the first those countries doctors earn aboht twice as much as a nurse dears , apart from the car country , Country D. In this one , I zalary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in the countries .
In Countr D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
In conclusion we ca say that from the standloint of the doctors and nurses , boring abroad is a much better deal .
Spring is a common , well known and well love sport amongst Most countries in the word howevrr it is also punching , dangerous and disilked to the extent that man people want it rained , possible with good reason .
Boxijg is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and then diseases .
All professionzl boxers are at his feom been killed in his best night .
If not kill then more likely paralyses .
There have been a number of cases in the last ten tears of the top few lovers having trahic lossrs thtoughout their monks .
This is out from the elite few , and there is mre rfom those helps them .
More deatsh wouls occur through boring if it very banjned .
the port would go underground , there would be no safety measyres like goes , a doctor , parameidcs or early stopping of the fight if someone lookex unable to continue .
When he going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
Dangerous dogz eho were trainer to talk and magic in similar underound do fights have already proved dexdly to innocet psople , the new boxer would be even more at him .
Once Moving is tanned an no - old Grow up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully news all round interest in violence making tin and cities much safer place to live in , the will be less fgighting outside pubs and clubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reason .
change the rules of being slightly would muych improve the safety risks of the sport and not detrzct form that entertainment .
The aim sll sodts of proposals , lijghter qnd more cushilning gloved could be worn , ban punches to the road , headfuards aorn or many fights shorter , as most of the serious injurues occur in the latter rounds , there would also show off the Powers skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .
Even if a boxer is a success and manages apt to be seriously hurt he will face serious consequences in later life xiseases tat attack the brains have been known to get in as a direct result of going , even Myhamed Alu , wo was famous ( ? ) but I had bolxing anjd hiz quixk - sighted intelligence now has Alzheimer diseas and fan no longer do my everyday acts .
and other sports , more dangerous than boxing , Motor sportw andc esven mountaineering hss riks thar ae reak .
Love close to know , but as racjng drovers drkve .
In many of the majority works of modern literature , they ca be my emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .
Although such a show of strength by these weeks ' character is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negaive contributioln to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is the conflict upon which make stories of ethnic American literature are based .
However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each jinority wodk , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature and to be catagorized as merely the result of heart of oppression .
Rachel , thus Wee - changing and easy - challenting aspect of monority literaturw creates an especially imporetant necessity beat each work be considered individuallt as both a product of means of struggls axnd a work inherently deistinct rrom any other .
In the minoritgy worsk , the conflict and rebellion presente accuratepy reflects society as a whole , and although the other 's in The day Ludk Vlub rebel agazinst such forest as arfanged marrisges , it in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , in the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to cure their inheeent rjghts from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is when no as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce betwedn alo cultires , I Julie , too , reeists hre arranged marrixge in The Color Purple , in the murderous Homes in Jazzx rwflect Tita and Pedro 's destrucitve passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .
Rebellio nd copnflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , bit they are pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg wotks thqn they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Wmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of uathority re particullary oppressive in words such as Lkie Wster for chocolates and The Color Purple , other minoriry works influding Love Mledicine ajd Jaz do n't respect the clearlky defindd authotitarian cigures onr the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responive actino which the obviously mentioned works show .
This was impliew that these etnic Americzn pieces of literature czn notf be catagorizer as mefely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
He does Voltaire fackle he question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?
Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurencw is for some good .
Foltaire sets out in Candide to criticism this philosophy .
In Czndide the representative of the philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher played at Thhnder - Wee - Tronckw .
The whole body is a critocism of l'optimisme .
For example when Candide is forced to join the Builgar zrmy he is beagen almodt to eat at Candide des not concernj himself because he knew it is for my own good - in fact laude in the look he uses his training to become a soldier .
Although this could seem to be good it is not because of is running he kills two men , a new and an Archbishop witfh no hesitation and them proceeded to kill his zweethearts brothwr .
Voltaiee show is dilsike of l'opitmisme wen Oangloss , Candidd abd James and caught in a bad study at sea in which James is crowded and there are only thee srvivors , Candidate , Pangloss and a saklor .
The story was caused by an earthquake which destdoys fhe citgy to high Candise was sailing to .
On arrival they had starvation nad dceath .
Canride is obviously horrified , especially when they sawilor begihs pillaging thr fity .
Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Oangloss cfan pnly tell him that some good way home of it .
Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , away appeals to be sceptical of it .
This is no more true that when he arrived in the new world , South America , an how to read his darliny Cubégonde witrh tbe Commissioner of the police .
Candide can not be at posxible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him milling thed Je andr Archbishop bdcause they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout this book we begin to go home Canidde is gradually lead away from l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly its l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
The constant belief that good and come from bad is n't actually inspiring but leads to a contact rows of disasters .
Cnadide 's lives , in the book , appear to show this .
He is thrown out of Thunder `` Wee - Tronck becauss he embracrs Cunégobde , he is used in the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost kjlled as part of an art - da - up , he likes the churches , he is almost Garten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .
Candikde 's lives is governed by his belief the gold will prveail .
Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégone bu sue is to the beautiful young flkwer tuat he and loved .
We can become Joly and be worse by the car .
The illustrates emphatically th folly of l'optimisme .
Candide haa travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he had gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégodne but at the price of her look in personality .
Voltaire , in Canride , shows on the philosophy of Optimism is one of repair not hope .
It would be tempting to think of the various European Fommunities as an embryonic Unites Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of Europe Winy .
However it is important to realise that Eurkpe is a very long way from becoming anythjng liie the United States .
When I origianl 13 Aemrican tates resoved to for that is now he United States of America , they were intern on working a poliutical as well as ecoomic entity .
see well prepared to feel as much of their own sovereginty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political forum .
A galance eas tnerefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual shades as much self - gvoernment as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
It is time than today are still Near the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempt to return home powers to the individual gates , buy no - one would challenged the fact that , on matters exrernal to the United States , the government in Washington represents the same polciy - making pony .
In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a politician union of the countries since this world produce a formidable international military fine .
However it is usually clear that while there might be some unified pklitical action flowing from the European Communities ( such as is seen the Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands disputw ) , the Communities wers intendwd as purely economic entities in the first place .
Membership almozt certainly involve some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom coild probabvly lexve the community by a simple majority vote in the Westmintser Parloament , something with no state in the United States could lawfully do .
We are still a very long say for a Snigle Larliament for Western Europe at power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the guns between the UK and Europe is very wide .
The sipremacy of Patliament wull enver be challenges .
It ability to make a great in law - made by it or Europe - jeans at it remains cull sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws to that would unitge it fulky with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it would tokorrow repeal all the past .
The fact that Parliament does n't bind itself or in both be bound by a pokitical body mean that it is never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliamejt consented .
But with the average jingoistic Brifon there is no chance of us during oursedlves of our zenophobia znd evdr wishing to be fully integrate with Europe .
Even now the channel tunnel hzs joinerd us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile wand .
Naturally , the problem of a single role would end as deeply as the benefits that we could presumably ultimately receive .
It seems to me that for the most fun centuries , Britaih hase always considered itself to be reached from the most of Europe .
Whenever necessary , he has caused herself to European powers , such as in times of us of extreme distrust .
Britain and been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , the car beem more concerned with her overses empires thn ith anywhere else .
In this letter has centuy though , he empire has diminished amd she had had to have mounting respojsibility in Europe .
Because of our history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
For instance , British law is based pargely upon precedent , that is judge me law .
We have establish a system of a while dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and expected .
There is very little European influences on out law , of course in many respect it will be the same , but the pack of influences will displsy jany differences .
With the formation of a single Europe , news law will have to be accepted thrkughout tfhe continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
The British tend to be very proud an possession of the day , the changes may well cast illfeeling abd discontent .
Of course , the same poins will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
like there must be one sysem ?
The cuontry typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it is to be altered .
Our ondividual monetary system I support , could be seen as a symbol of sopvereignty .
It can be said that if a single Europe as created , problems by aliens ovee igs fundamewntal political concepts .
Of course rbitain woyld lose her sovereignty , as would the other options of the union .
It has been suggested that the jungle Unipn could be used on a basic rederal structure , thereby local autonmoy coupd be safe , but I unioj as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
To a certain extent , even if sovereignty had lost , some national personality would be preserved .
The fact is that , when united , European city would still in essence be divided .
There will always be aspect of the society that the other 'll never accept .
Europe as a while raise the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , kiting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
If the Federlaists acgieved gheir aims in a European city , they would do the best to achieve ddmocracy anhd promot it nationality , so that individyality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
The problem facing The British , really results from the isplated past .
The sovereignty of the nation has been flats , and the fears of loving it are very green .
whether this could happen wants to be seen , and would dependf completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the Federal oublic asnd thr politocians peading thye cluntries .
With 1929 niw only a year ago , the question of that a Single Eurooe will mean to Britain bdcomes incresaingly relkevant .
I firmly believe that the advent of 12 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
This also heed not however be negatives .
In fact , in political , economics and defdnce terms I feel that realisation of resources in and will be very positive .
Write to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to a Britain is in danger of handling will control over to facelesx beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .
throughout the world a kind of channel is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
This process , continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolve with or without a participation of Gritain in this process .
It is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making high risk eventually decided to new world border .
However to be fully involved , sacrifice Dare to be made .
Each safrifices wikl invllve certaih aspects of our sovereginty .
In relenquishing asnd tyus centralising cxertain powers , the aim is not to diminosh hte wtrength of individual nations bid to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world share .
As family demonstrated by recent event in the fuel , Eurolean cooperatiin in the field of defence may be with impressive and effective . Whikst I would be reluctant to his over a control to eefence to any central Guy .
I can see a future for some form of European raspid readtion force .
Write to an expert criplping defence costs could be at this would n't necessarily lead to a reduction in the time of defence available .
In popitical terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like to set of Europe is becoming increasingly cosamopolitan in terms of the population composition .
the North Sra wilp increaxingly ome to represent a very puddle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important to Britain to join fuoly wifh its European partners to adapt to the changes in geography .
Politically we are living closer together .
Possibly problem should be styudied ad solved if possible before they happend .
E.R.M . is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especialky careful .
While not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no systems can lower interest rate , and inflatio while raising growth , with the possible excepiton of the Magic riddle .
In the rest of the simple currency , again I feel that is inevitable .
That is important is to base has currency on the strong currenciesz within the End as opposed to an average based system .
To conclude I would say a single Euripe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain but not concdrn itsslf with loss of sovereignty nut gain of the European equivalent .
If we miss the best I think we will train before the next boat comes .
We are threats of Rome . signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid wore a new `` conginent `` - a united Europe .
It is said that Europe could not be created Quickly , but one Several years .
I Brotain netered thed European community in 1973 after a national referenxum , the debate bgean conferning rbitains relationship with Euros .
When 1992 waa et as the date for the singles Europsan Maroet , the debate flared up again , but even how far Vritain should be integrayed .
The rest of Europe needs prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decided hesitant .
The former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatchet wad not used to learn Britain into a Unitdd Eueope because he felt it would lead to a cost of our sovereignty .
There is no doubt an integrated markwt would have multiple Benefits for the countries involved .
Business in other traidng organizagions are preoaring themselves for 1992 , in the signs market .
rate will be easier , with no frontier conttols aloowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
There will be business boo and free competition in the removal of protecdtive practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
I Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much Already , it decmialization , the new Euro - pawsports and in the pound stering being tied to the C .
They may feel Britain is being bullied ihto Europw .
Further changes are forecast for Britain , affecting day to that matters , to create a `` European Standarf `` .
This may make Britons fesentful of Europe and tired of `` 1992 ane lal thqt `` .
A single market requires one central institutions to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
With the people of Britqin be prepared to give up their government and be dirscted ffom Strasbour or Brusseos ? .
Many people would not .
All the and come when I would sterling is taken over by the CV ?
It may well - but I try Britons have a chance to voicr their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits for a single integrafed narket would far outweigh any nqtional drawbacks .
As this date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe muxt increase .
They must look into the future and consider possible effects .
As Britain be drawn into Eueope agajnst its will ?
Perhaps it more of Btitain bwcomes `` Eurofied `` , Bfitons wipl wzke up and the other sovereignty is being taken away .
Britain is never geographically bheen a part of Europe .
We are in the LED and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to the alone .
We have a lot democratic process , which may leople woukd not want to solve this up .
A fully integfrated market witfh Britainb as a full member would be to the detriment of the political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
There has been such a lot of all about a Single role in recent years that it is hard to live at it will be on us very soon .
Now that it is a reality , and not just a lrobability , te question in the minds of my Britonz is indeed : Will this men a cost of sovereigntt for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
Firstly , a positive approach .
Looking at things from an economical perspective , this is not a problem .
The benefits in terms of cost - sitting owing to join thngs obce , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
oils , because of being able to look gheir resources , ill be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe 's therefore be a nation to be refkoned wjth as regards competition .
To look at things on a more individuals have , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living hsould jncrease .
A great potential of ideas From a greater fume of expertts will , in theory , results in more knowledgeable a better - informed individuals .
Smiplicity is one of the Commission 's new aims , with the idea that if things we wimpler anr more easily and everyone to understand people will be happier , but on better .
If this is so , they should also work better .
Ideaoly thdn , there would be more equality , pet rube , gretaer producivity and greater economic growth .
On the other hand , will this Single Eutope mean a cost of soveteignty for Britain ?
It must be remembered that you only do Beitain hzve a small populations compared to the majority of the other members states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
We found this matter ?
Well , Britaib has quite a history and therefore a car number of traditions .
It is possible that it could become enhulfed in the new Single Europe and use its identity .
Britons ( especially those two older generation ) Why then feel `` lost `` said that they do not really `` belong `` any more .
The next Single Europe 's be too new and unknown fix them to make their allegiance to it .
Then there is any questions as to where all this ideapism really will work .
Will there be seen prosperity , best - informed , happier cities , or will this never come off because of politicians bheing unanle to agree on pooicies ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not in the one of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
Was it when you got quite a look at brake , its character at least , in integrating itself into the Single Europe ?
No one should dispute that this is a difficult question .
The fact remaikns hkwever that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .
This , as everyone is well are , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more toleeant every member state is of each other , the more successful and Sinmgle Eurkpe wjll be .
It is up to Britwin therecore to accept this fact was to show an example by reading this way as regards tolrrancy .
When we will to be able to look at the future in a one positive way .
The European community is a unique groupiong of twelve sovereign European Member States the car committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
The community has an able to break down the economic and political barriers they have traditionally divided Europe .
In particular , the community seeks to facilitate gdeater movemrnt within its frotiers ; movement nopt pnly of good nut of service , capitals and people .
However , the sake of sovereugnty is certainly a must eebated one ; to hear extentr shohld a number and on its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
Let us look at the founding of te European community , before we discuss this issue of soverekgnty in some details .
There were several attempts at peaceful unification after the first World War , but only after Europe has an been devsatated by car was the facility of national rivalry tfruly aoparent .
the political and economic exhaustion of the European states caller dor a fresh start and a car more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
This fresh start a aboug bscause of three main actors .
Firstly , was Europe 's realization of our own weaknesses , not having got his age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
The superpowers were economiaclly , militarally and politically sgronger thwn thd diviedd undividual Europaen states .
Secondly was the convicxtion that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; aftet aol , the two gdeat warz haf both been as Ruropean `` civil Bass `` . Third wax the common desire for a better , order world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
One of the first mahor movse tosards European integration is the creation of the European Dconomic Community , in 1888 .
I membership had grown vrom tje ten original founder countries to twenty - free .
One of the most innovative features of the European Cokmunity comparee with other international bodies is that the member states have needed to it a part of their national sovereignty and enjoyed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adapt acts , having the force of national lol .
This novel Approach to boiling natiobal sovereignty is called `` integration `` .
The 1970 's a progress in ibtegration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
All of the number states added in principle to the idea of a single marked by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .
This is to say that only way to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many hot unanimousa votjng , but majority joking .
Many Use this issue as a threat to their own reguoations znd lwas , she could flresee a shop in sandards if they do n't take him .
The situation is seen as a threat to the country in question we do not wish to bildly give up their soveriegnty for the one of European city .
Whether or not the coninuation of the progress in the field of European city is stressful depends very much on the Temple of Europe .
If a feeling of European unity develop and van be sustained , the threat woll subside as a feeling of identiry takes her .
On Britains rkads therw is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
The roads network is no longer able to carry the traffic wityout hod - old and traffic jams ..
To rmeedy this has gkvernment ha startsd addinb a fourth landed on some trenches of our motorways ahd constructing fing rlads and bypassse , with mixed reception .
While the road system is being improved their needs to be an endless series of roadwlrks which resfrict the highways and cause further delay whipe fhe roadworks are in place .
The inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives facing an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
It might need an easy solution to his mayhem aould be to use public transport ; i.e . the Railwqys .
People are not liking to the train system because of its Lack of integdation due to the recent privitisatin of different areas .
It is very shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
The main disadvantage of the always is as the rail sefvice ajd the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
If I servixes wers integrated they would be a bus timw table whicg coincided with the main xrrival timles .
Then people would be more likely to watch te train as they would n't hav to look forwards to a long wall , but for a bus or an expensive tax ride .
My solution to the problem would be to improve the rail sister and is related bus services , this will be people of the roads and one is train .
To improve the main service trains are not to be tied to arrive nd delart at ten times i.e . arrive at night o'clock and learn at half past six .
The train and is comoanies havd to live with each other in the main stars have to remain relatively cjeap i.e . The same price or loss as it would cosy to go by car .
One basic dilema faxing the UK 's all and read transport system is the general rise in population .
The lead to an increase in the number of commuters and transport usesrs every year , consequently puttjng pressur on the UK transport network .
The biggest word to the system is the road rise of car uswrs outzide th major cities .
Most largr citiea have managed to encourage commuter to use public transport thus decreasing major congestion in rush hour periods .
Public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in populatiln if it is made code to computers , clean , each and efficient then it would fake thr stfain of the overloadee British ropes .
For commuters whok rebularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motorwsys wnd othet transpoet links are constantly big extended , widehed and slowly turning the country in a concrete jungle , it is only trying to come wit tbe incdease in traffic , we are our own enemy !
Another major problem created by the gaps of vehicle transport is the pollution emitter unto the atmosphere damaging tfhe ozobe layer , creating smig amd fodming acid rain . Tourturing the earth we are living on .
In ckncluding I wish to promote Pan , efficient comfortable and help public transport for the near future .
see modern traffic jam or not a familiar situation to nearly all of the western world population .
If ecery timr we use of cars to travel by disance we find oufselfs in a 10 girls tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .
To illustrate my point , if every time I took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would show liking it .
So I do we all brist on travelling on the road .
The answer most like lies in 2 area , Firstly the attitude of many westerners is that `` it is the right to travel in such a minor ' .
This is in my opinion , you considerable ignorabce .
I am by far as awwy no ' greeny ' Who wants to make everyone dived in three 's and eat soya bran sup , however I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic but is on our days that .
The government answer to the considerable growing amounts of traffic on our roads it out to ask move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , that more and you eople ar now diving .
We all agree thus we have a divine right to be on the road .
Why do
Do we , the western world ( 5 % of the population of the world ) , have the right to be the source of the most of the work at the environmental cat ?
Just because we can not be bothered to get out of me a lot earilrne to watch pubic yransport .
Even if we do , the story so does the most of the world .
We could have disasterous ikplications .
The end Beacon , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is delining so much , there is no trying to watch in the morning .
People stopped being train because of the fall in standards , the people were forced to the job , out becamd unptofitable ahd so were closed and services vut bac , ofrcing morr people on the road .
The whole system . Now formed a spiraling circpe of food are .
This is not been ihtensifyed with the case of the railway , to provide all Company , profit motivated .
The vitae , small rail linka msy now be closed , previously they where subsudised to wake up to loss , all the private companies and it afford to do that so many well arose , cutting off small town and villages .
The only way to stay in circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we take the effort to use public transport it will expand into a food service ; Unfortunatly the public lead to be appethetic to the idea .
Today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with TVs . chwnnels competeimg for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , there is a big nosiness .
Apart from athletics , being seems to be the only poplar interational spolrt from which Britsin cqn still old to be high .
We have superb fighters wifh excelldnt chaeacter such as Lennox elwis , Tiger pens , Nashesm Haled qnd kur belobed Frxnk Beuno .
Despite being enjoyable to watch , doing is very dangerous .
clown to my head can cause the brain to little about the skills with a cause a train can or too .
Last year , to fight between Chriz Eubank and Michael Watso led to call for boxing to be banned wben Micheal Watson slipped ate a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
Many tours in low income areas see boxing as ' a way . ' , a chance to make it to the job and earn a lot of money on the car .
This way , however , people who regard posing as barbaric , brutal and primitivs .
These people argue that there is no need to boxing and that it only promotes violence .
During the fight , yes , of course it is ivolent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
I precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
During fights dcotors a few close to the end and have the authority to help it off prematrely if required .
Abmulances are also keen on stand by at big events .
Although it may sound cruel , I do n't believe that ant fighter man entered a professional bnoxing career without knowing the tasks .
Because there are so many buddnig young lovers , to be boring would be insan , since it could almost certainly go underground .
Underground nights are a more dangerous zince kess protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .
Asking him into account and Considering that boxing is about hurging yhe opponnet , it can be said that boring is a relatively safe sport .
Although far less popular , the and other ports which are a more brutal and dangers , such as ' he Boxinv ' , the competitors are encouraged to use their knees and elbows .
I ardgument continus , but for the sake of party in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .
Which is good new for the majority of the British public .
Two men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically That is the main principal of boxing .
Although throughout the year rules have been made to ilute fhe sports sadistic sied , should boxing be banned ?
Every time a boxer gets punched in the heart is brain moves vigofously inside his soul .
This causes the power to lose many bfain cekls ped bocing fight mad if they occrus ffequently thrn tye boxer can end of career path brain damage .
In my eyes are probably the eve of others this is reaspn snough dor thw bannijg of boxing .
The sport to a car Heart is actually a good sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' Once you oppoistion out ' , although this is armed by Chrius Eubajk he believe he is a sportsman lays the one of boxinb is an art form , he ways that he does nor spwcifically go into a boring ring to know how opponeny out , to sit on points differences and to live Chris Erubank his jusy reslect mkst of his fights habe bedn won on points .
But there is the exceptioj - to origins Example , the first referencs why boxing should be Nannies , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put on a coma by Chrus Eubank ( the main way dies n't specifically go into fight to know his oppisition our ) .
This example on prkves too well with a dangerous so called ' sporg ' boxjng is .
The boxijng fededation is trying to do as much as it back to have the ' spot ' for having rungeide doctos , banning cars and fight but the job in bottom of the argument is the end blow to the end causes consixerable damzge .
There is always much speculation Over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
This is emphasis and exagvgerated whrn a competfitor in the story tfragically dies .
A recent death in the in has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy ovsr whether the sport should be banned or it is yet again the forefront of discussion .
Let us consider how a professional boxwr would need .
He is clear aware of the dangers and brutzlism of this sport , which is possibly why he enjoyed it so much .
I have yet to hear my goxer regret his voice of career .
the excitement of being in one ring , the job at knockinh an opponent to the canbass , ad and the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keeps boxers cighting .
The only that is there for the thing for the very best of the most is ridiculous , and not do tip boexrs esrning sums of many such as £ 20 million ( or in time Tyeons comebaxk casr , $ 60 milluon ! ) it is hard usrprising hoe implortant thr spott van be to some .
Let us consider ' Sky ' vibes , recently beginning a subscriptions to view Thsons `` me Live Lights `` .
The member of the public does n't want the sport to be banned fiber .
Now let us consider the friends or family of a beer , he has been perlanently injured ( or been killed due to a night ) .
the individuals and others learninf wbout the magic incident in the media protests against the sport .
My family , we use iriginally agxinst the idea of their own finishing cfollege early to take up the sport would be leading the protests against boxing .
How Please , prpud anf patriotic fhe British publuc felt when Frank Bryno achieved his ultikate gosl anx bscame the Heavyweight cnampion of the world , yet how smart many wire to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
This hypocritical view is shovex by so much that whether boxing should be banned or not all remains a controversial issue for the forseeable fiture .
There were 2 in ovjections raied ayainst ghe introductin of te natiobal lottery .
The first was the objection that the lottery will be little more another form of vacation , in fact , when they then , a tax on the poor .
The second one main obnection came from cahrities who predicted that charitable donations woule go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , wit ghe ecxuse that some of the money spent buying new ticketf wluld go to charity .
There is also some controversy ovef the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eentually wemt to Camelot , which as nor see as the strongest vontender for the boy : the companies or consortiums promised to give me honey to charity with lower rujning coets .
Richard Bronson promised to move all of his profits to charity , it was rejected .
My personal objections to Camelo as the porter prganiser is that a huge proportion of the consortim are american or foreogn firms , but exampls JBM has a sizeabel stake in Camelot .
The British nxtional lottedy run by his Vritish firmz .
Since it introdjction therr gas been more controversy lver th national ltotery .
When it promised to the 45 peace in every pound to xharitable cquses , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money could go to charity .
The two also been some controverdy ober the allocation of money .
For example 3 million plunds were given to Etpn collefe onje of the richest pblic school or a gymnasium money is also give to the royal opefa hohse .
The letter seemed to be a reverse Robin ohod : taking fromn thd poor to drive to the price .
the lottery has also offered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratcy cards .
It is used claimed that it is so addictive Most people will spend all their availiabld cqsh on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
It has been calcilated thqt nly 4 pencs our of every pound recieved by the lottery Due to charitwble cause , the rest is take the price and , profrits , and the so called charities .
It was also we calculated At the chance of running anythong substantial is one in million , I highly likely .
It is also very alleged that the jackpotw ars too high cost of was lucky winnwrs jave said themselvbes tyat thw jqckpot had rented Their life , alenating hem from friends and family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery should be rained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpotd should be cappdd at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give foteen peopld a fortune than to give fourteen fortune to me pesos .
I would also remove any americazn huisness interesrs ahd give the charity honey to more diserivng ' chadity ' .
For the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it feom society .
The comluter as been one of the most influential invention of all time .
Computers do dominate the majority of government business , science and Communication , as well as any other areas of human life .
In my way , it 's take the place of the human brain in performling calculations and thought process .
The most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instruments used by mathneticians andr scientists for taking numerical calcilations .
This is made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations znd ruh throygh eqautions , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
This , unfortunately , means that the gednius csientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operators , the needs only to know which buttnos to stress .
This can sleep an extreme pier , as there is still much in the world of maths and science chock a computer was n't calculate , but this may nor be the case centurise into the future .
Computer hav been used as a means of feeling regards , the same as bug superseeed handwritten Lexi , ( in a few decades People may well be faced with a computer screen and ksyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the glory , even to create artwrok adn to entertain .
Computer generated pictures , including ' fractao ' pictures , brown rrom equations , seems to be more popular in hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games were to provide for entertainment to any game or activity that takes place in the day , physical worm .
Vkrtual reality allows people to hav ' - ' entertainment created to help by a computer .
Whether you not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it is certainly made the human body and but redundant .
People , businesses or corporations may be contacted at any point around the globe by a machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer the fume of communication to actually meeting face to face .
Money can be transferred instantly without even tending to make the mutual bone - to physical doinage does n't matter , it is the computer records fhat state how push each bank has ownership of .
However , the idea that the human raid is no longer iseful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their exoected wituations , and can not adapt to new situations usibg judgememt .
Human beings ofteb zct withut loic or prison , and only the human beings can cook and saw his coat .
Also , computers and break down , and then a humans is needed to fake control - such as an airlind pipot , and there are still certain task Only a human being can perform , and the as often among the simplest .
They cried , the cheers .
Their names edpressed joy , triumpu , ride nd perlpexity .
The world watches in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the image of the TV , expecting smething jew at every home and not want to pass it -- I remember that is it was the only topic of conversation at school : `` Have you wear ? `` , `` I ca n't believe it ! `` , `` Aftrr apl thus time ! `` , `` I have thought it could happen .
`` We all get that we are living one of those histoirc moment that you as about in a history books and were proud to be a part of it -- It was Nvember 9 , 1989 , the day that the ball fell in Berlin
within a few weeks , the excitement and deep down and people and turned their attention to more recent 30s .
I got me , this had been to stay .
It is the start of what our now as - rpesident Bush likes to order to as `` or `` sinking of the Cold War --
It was the event was the end People of the faster lboc dountries tye hope that their efforts wede nit in van -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a commumist regime than bad not allowed me to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
She had been expected -- I had a clqssmate whoe gather had escaped from Hungary -- He was keen his family and friends , hi whole life and bad leaf out of Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him on if he had n't be scares , scared of what he would find once he went --
He told me that nothing could compared to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Evdn tyough I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfole in Germany --
Bolstered by the German ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roman tose againsf commuinst regkmes as well -- No , three years later , community as we one knew it no longer exists .
whether he People are happier or not , I fan next day --
However , they will have at least seen the `` other one `` .
The struggels xnd bopes of fifty years will nor have been in pain -- Witgout tghe `` events of Berlin Wall `` history probably would not have taken a very different courses -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
However , history can not be written and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall aftively contributed to the esurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bkoc -- As such , it was the datalyst force that need to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the the significant events , we will always remember the way the ball fell --
The development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do n't speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
This thing , technology has been one will always be with the closest friens ajd yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .
Science and technology are allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a loving our my family , they are used my grandmother of career , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the field of Medicine , science , engineering , and even be less ovdrt corners of our lives .
The one of the end hmuans hwve eeveloped is where the greatest problems lie .
And , they do not threatened us , but when they become weldes witb certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially -the most dangerous things that we hold in our minds .
Speaking From my experience living in the United States , I have time to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our tour in particular .
People do that techhological developmrnt haqs made our world much smaller ,
If I would occur hat a great majority of American live in their own persobal closets .
In schools , Geography ckasses radely , if ever , exit .
Before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did n't seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
Science and technology have bad effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel at its people be adopted the same `` I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any Me `` time of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
Our awareness of other people , the culture , and other languages is very kil on the priority Diet of our educators .
until I was 15 , I was unable to study a foreign language at all , and even at the time I had only one choice of languages German .
Since I am twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of the circumstances , then I mentioned before , I have no choice but to wait until I am twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
Mine is not the only experience like this .
The effort of the United States gas caused our minds to be heard , in a word that is growing Give my country was behind in it slefish self - satisfaction .
Many people are nowadays that , with the advent of computers technology , our mental arithmetic is for me we are becoming a nation of couch potatos .
It is true in a day , the development of portable calculating machinex ( calculatofs ) are meant that we no longer need to be able to work out guns in a bad , bug at that case ?
In my mops , the czshiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simple of us without he and of their Smilla .
In many areas , the wail of human judgement has been replaced by faster , the accurate , computers .
My sole hav had their jobs positions takeb oved by commuters .
Having cabinets are becoming a think of the most with computer database .
But when such menial tasks as giving are good for us .
We encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
When people talk about artificial intelligence ( AVT ) , I heard any funny tales form people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and all eventualpy rule us .
These are just to ranking of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that kind dvery computer is a programmer .
Even if artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .
Humans brains stjll work on how to but he computers , due to program themk adn , more Importantly , due to control them .
As for making the human bran redundsnt computres cxn help to improve learning skills , the main beach , test and improve our kinguistic skilsl .
Reflexes are improved ( and the not been scuentifically peoven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents may turn their children in ' zonbies ' .
We can exoand oir imaginqtion and fonvert kur kdeas knto cokputer simulatec moddls , enabnling us to design buildings and road networks .
The computer revolution has no made our brains redundant , it has speed up ahead of then we never knew existed !
It is not the age of the computer .
almost everyone owns a computer or has access to me .
computers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filldd whlle dooms .
They are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and effort etxremely difficultr mathemqtical equationx in must records .
Computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
But are the sick a good thing ?
When calculators came along a trip in ability of student for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used to the simplest calculations .
The computer could do the same thing .
Computers encpurage lazibess in the general public , shy work on something yourself when the computer cats do it for you .
This is every time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
For instance , swelling is no long as important as it was you can simply use a `` spellcjeck `` to correct our English , which is absurd .
For the youth of metal computsrs offer links around the world and millions of facts and figured .
The club be argued to be education .
However , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours post at a keuboard tapping lazy in the door and good of the house .
They should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experience for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
It is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .
I find the preposterous anf people . Using he ability to communicate and form relationships .
Computer van offed escfape froj the human - drumk rputine of daily life by means of games but they are mixed - nursing and T - inactive .
There is howwver a more dangerous threat from computers , it is the fuel can do the world if man .
This could lead to high unemployment .
The people to work with computers are long periods of me every day facw probkems .
the reaction of tapping news all day and staring at the street may be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
Computer may be the future but what are still and have in the future .
There will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hxrdly sver yalk and the only career avaipable wolud be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers and helpful at people should n't live through their computers can be so reliant on them .
They should read books and live more in order to regain the lost imagination and sense of adventure .
Also , in school I feel that work should be done mainly by many new calcupators and computers should only be used monimally in mathematics in order to help the production of computer addicts and again and formal people .
There are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
These include ( the emission of identificagion of harmful hereditary grnetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield cries .
There can be no doubt that genetic manipulation of genetic engineering jave hda highyl bemeficial effects on many areas of society .
However , many people dialike or a prejudiced agains , genetic manipulation .
Last This is a ' car of the unknown ' ; something which rampers wiyh he intfinsic compoments of plants and animal live is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore pfovokes rear .
But people have also become aware of , is the imjense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individual .
This has been very good to feed popular culture ( I Rim ' Jursasic Pafk ' being an obvious reerence point ) .
There is also However , the very real possbiility thqt tue power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of incontrolled unregulated individuwls aho couod use it for ' evil ' purposes .
hits the , is an argument against scientists bearing morap responsibikity for their job .
anything in life may be missed .
Whether it be a kitten - life used to say someone , a are used to an someonr ovet , or something as harmeldss as a pillow user to sufgocate .
Everything in life , if misusec , can have harmdul effevts and Genetic engineering ad genetic manipulation are no exception .
Though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - wide or car , this is surely a subnective view by present - day standards .
Certainly we could not hold the makers of a car or matches - knit responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scienyists should bear the mayor burden or responsibility if gendtic manipulqtion is not to misuse .
The fundamdntal fla in saying scientists must learn the mayor budden or more responsibility for the park , is that if this had been applied nuiversally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and ranking would be without electricity , radio , quite simply , anything above the mud hat ' existence .
Scienific researdch is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition of entering itself .
The other funsamental rlaw is asshming rhat induvidual scientists have responsibility , science is a process of discovery rather the creation , it .
no - one created gsnetic manipulstion , the power of it was there to be discovered .
If one scientisr roes not male a discovery then another one girl .
It is fair to hold responsible the scientist on the one front of human knowledge , who discovers something when anothed scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independemtly afterwards .
The only argiment flr makung scientists responsible for the note , is that quite often , and particularly in he made of genetic manipulation , it would be a scientist to misuse knowledge , an thereforr rhey shoupd be responsible .
While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual svientist could be held responsibly .
But , our genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only one domain of scientists , the original scientist eho discoveres genetic manipulation can not be hard responsible for that 's misuse of it .
There are many problems taming the monarchy .
Some of the same listed below :
The diviskons in their family and the fight between prince znd te princes of cases and the possibility of the divorced .
The other problem is that people Lab ( or think ) that they do n't do anything buy the very rich and so they do n't want and gaze .
Another problem is the people think that Monarcyh is bolishing in an countries and many countries are public so Monarchy should be abolsihed in this country too .
There are also arguments against abolishing the monarchy too .
For example many people like the road family or they are uonest people not like the politicians hat always play .
I think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do n't think it should be abolished .
In the `` I think if many people at the monarchy to be published a general elecvtion shkuld be valley and then see if Monarchy shopuld be abolished .
`` In Vitro fertlisation `` is the fertfilisation of an egg in the laboratory . . in a gesture .
The age is taken from her mother and placed in an environment which will optimise ths chances of fertilisation by the sport for the false .
Once fertulisation has occurred thr fertiised egg is implanted bavk into our mothers coma and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
Normally more than 1 egg is take from the mother so that the eggs can be store and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccessful or so that more than we can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
is usually leads to multiole births , .
twins , triplets etcd .
There are people who are against this , saying it is not nature and is it fair to the child havikng stqrted life in a lot rube , as they believe it start from the moment of conception .
There are erhics involved whereby Leo is given the treatment and who is n't ?
, at that the shower . treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in it fertilisation fpr one person who the same amount of money could be used to saves hundreds of lives by vaccinaying people against measles fof exakple .
The people who are for this can argue , saying that it is the right of every person to have their only child .
Women whp woukd bot normally be able to have children can now do so it invitro fertilisatuon .
Through no fault of the one she would have a block fallopian tube using her to be unable to allow eggs corn to the job and it is only fair in telling her to have children .
Technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics ajd practicql guudelines hzve bren left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to make certain egulations ie .
1 . Fertility treatmen should n't be given to post - menopausal wimen .
The menpause is the body 's day of talking to the you are to open and your body is no long capable of fearing a baby .
Last gear there was a case of a bit menooausal woman who by thing about he be as dived in vitri fergilisation ( AVT ) .
I do n't think this is fair to moralpy correct to the child sinec hee mother would be xlaiming ner pension wyen she was at primary school at her mother would probably the while the child was in the teen .... sheep should be a test that is given before ( AVT ) is married Due to check the water is not as the menopause .
2 .
Eggbs xhould not be taken to aborted foetus .
The foetusee wiol have been abhorted fir a reason for example : if it was te resault of a nap or if it had congenigal deformities .
They should be a guideline or law sating thst eggs shoukd lnly be taken from the other and hot from dead , foetus .
Science is moved on dramatkcally since the 19th .
Many ca things have been invented and many things medicalky habe cuanged .
People in our modern times and now able to have liver , heart an open up transplanfs , there are many domplications hut many are successful .
People are able to have a hole in blood supply if theirs lackd thd sufficiejt requirements or , a more marrow trajsplant if the blood lacks white ideals .
On the above is carried out on using pope , but nowadays biologidal opoerations can be carried out on human which are not even born .
forms can start ten days in a test tube .
This is called ' in video fertilisation ' .
This is when an egg . removed from a woman placed in a test tube and them paper is played in to the test tube and the eggs and spend huge together .
The test tube is then incuabted for a few weeks ago when we famous is tired , the baby is then inseeted baci in to the other .
The famous is left to go and develop naturally .
This idea is extremely beneficial to marired couples who have been trying for a baby both have been unsuccesful are able to have children .
An in Cairo feetilisation allows me back to grow Inside , which allow the mother and baby to bond and it would feel part of them , this world n't happen if the couple adopted .
What I do well is ethically incotrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides zhe wxnts a baby .
Nature has already taken its mouse to help him she is too old to the only children so shy should she have the implanged into her .
It is not fair on the child because when it grows up at all is frisnds ate playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its other would be drawing hsr penhsion znd I am sure she could not feel like playing with her child .
Also Our mother na die in our age before the child has led a full live and this would be unfair to the child .
The child can also have to look after the other in the old age .
As the fetoius begins its life in a test tube , and the sport is selecter , this means that the sex of the sport could also be sliced .
The way , zoo can be chosen is by using genius .
The one has 2 X chromosomes adn the man 's of X and a Y - chromksomes .
One day in which the day can be selected is that the egg is always X On the sports nucvleus can either contaij an X or a Y chromosomr .
The X chromksome sperm is slightly braver than of Y so we can be separated .
If I motber watns a book Y sport is selected mad if a girl X is selected .
This was ready to an increase in our sex , and a decline in the other .
As a result they would reduce he population as there would be less courses .
Also waht hapoens if not people the year you are horn are keen and the ate a man , this would be and unpopular sex .
Science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?
The main reason for the people of Hritain to stop eatign beef at the moment is the treat of St .
This is a vital isease fhat attacsk the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .
In Does it is common nor as we cow diseases and by law and how showing these signhs musy be destroyed and it solid foe Arat .
The problem is However the signs are n't shown on a long time , this Being a vital disease .
It can be passed on to human through eatng pzrts of the animals such as the train which is affected and take part are usually sold and put into fast food such as beef burgewrs .
The rest of the main however is relatively late and eating , e.g . a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
However the British press was ignore this act and boost the situation out of proportioj consideringy only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
Another reason for the British people to stop eatnig bsef is the push for vegetarians , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the farmer oint abuy BSB .
These factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry oreventing hte ssle of British daory livestock nt only in Britain bus or export aswepl .
With glibal communications as good as the and now , it could see a scare across the world about British Wee - minded stance and Germany already have rsstricted and somwplaces banned the sale or impact of British beef for fear of it 's safety .
Although British farmers have learned to diversity , daily farming and the sale of week peoducts stilk formjs the backbone of British agriculthre anjd eould completerly change the face of parking in Britain .
After thry swutch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , sjbstantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
people throughout the United Kingdom were , dpubtless shockdd andf perhals ulset by images in the national presw anr television news of cows and had contracted tfhe disease bovihe spungiforj encephalapthy , or H.G .
The so - called ' a cow disease ' seem to make the club or a sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .
Here there is diseass as sound were put down before the symptoms progredsed further .
Those cowd whivh yad bsen out dkwn weee not uses for old .
The disease infectw the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid withi ghe spine On the train , and as the animal fluid is usually shit in the laughter of battle for that , the risk of contamination of the meat as one the industry was not willing to take .
The human disease , Crentzfelx - Jadob diesase , or CEO , is believed to be a man forms of US , although no clear link has yet beeb esgablished between the car .
It is clear whether incidenxe of Cup is on the time , or whether awareness of the condition is heijghtened , but are cases , from all aims have beem diagnosed recwntly , and the disease is always fatal .
The government insistz , perhaps correctly , the British beef is perfect safe to do .
However , people are genuinely scared of the presence of te disease in the UK , and many are axbstaining ffom eating jeep .
and schools have removsd beef from the media , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef havw showh a decline .
I implications for the beef industry cold be rather Furious , where everybody to boycott beef products .
To compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remajns scdptical .
If beef continue to tell him flour , then the best inudstry 's future would be unflear .
the products at present in an foodstufs such as jellkes , fruit Huns , all of course stoci cubss .
Would All these products has to find ysnthetic or substitute ingredient ?
Even if the entire beef industry went to give to a fact , the numerous Tens of new waffle worldwide could no longer be needed , but , being used as they are , for beef , they would be useless fod milj producgs .
Not all , cab be invented , though , and the situation has become a waitkng game .
The area to be repreiged or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE amd CJ are printed , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contacted by taking meat contaminated ith thw folrmer .
The natjon awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interest to there be no proven link .
With this space .
Personally , I believe that it is merrly that man is better at diagnosing CJD no than ever before .
The replrts say that it can take up to 20 tears to develop , so we could also already have it .
Whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my most meat and Yorkshire puddinjg , tahnkyou .
There has been a high scores in Britain recentlg that some beef , dontain SE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the huge equivlaent of CO2 ( Creutzfeldts - job disexse ) .
But is a disease in most thaqt effects the brain and sliral tidsue ( or offer as it is sometimes know ) .
After a is reported Cases of CEO , a similar Firm of the disease found in human , it is not thought that ' Ka - cow disease ' ( CPE ) is the cause .
Researchers belisve thzt eating beef containing off will transmit the total disease to humans .
This chain is sevestated fhe British beef industry as people are now too scared to a beef in the other contacts the illness .
Already the sake of chef in America hwve dropped by about 15 % and in Britain htey hve dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
Although scientists say that to contract CND part of the cows offal must be cointained wthin the beef .
Customer are still reluctant to eat the meat inacse it has come for some ' dogs ' butcher trying to cut Pasta .
As you can imagine this has had a tremendous influence on sales in plants such as fast food restaurants where beerburgers are the main item on the menu .
An example of one is MacDonalds wjere they are ikmmediately brough out a notice statint tyhat their beefbyrgers ars mwde from 100 % of the first , pure been an cojtain no ideal .
In my view no hlaf recent restaurants with a good repuattion would find buying of beef in case a custom daught JD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
An outcome lie this would mean they would be shed our several thousands of sound and would probably have to sell up .
As a result of a lower beef delay in places of food production tjere woukd be a lower need for beef cows .
This means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
Because of that the price of beef will have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
So , as a result of the claim that need containimg xontaminated offal mzy cause Cup in human , farmers ( in particular beef faxrmers ) are losing post as they will have to tell the media in a low price due to the low demand .
As a result They may have to diversify towsrds ither areas such as crops , making Wow , et . or even have to be a government untidy .
I feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJE wss jot strong enough bwfore teh claims were released .
It has therefoer cauesd an unnecesszry , delteerious effetc on the agricultural industry and we Parker .
The question of compensation for services rendered is ever so simple as remittin a predetermined salary based on qualificatios ane a person 's dedication to the test at half .

Contribution to society `` is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate `` equakly ' .
In the 1988 in American , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually took for a living , but merely lived off the interests of their investment .
the stock market was experjencing a good , and several formerlt workjng - class citizens became Health and realised the idea of retiuring early .
In several great authors of that period qhestioned th right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; he received money , but the contributed nearly nothing to society .
People who inhsrit joney or live off the interest of investors olften seem to spend their time in search of a new thrills , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
Having almpst unpimited qealth changes people , both these who are born into wealth and these two turn their own money edarly on .
But do they have the right to live this way to
What about people . were very yard yet to see to be paid miserable .
A migrant work may snake away in a field all day long and has less money in a way that a healthy perosn spends on a girl at lunch .
The answer this question lies in one 's feelings about Demovracry .
She would argue that if a person is part enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inherktance ) he or she is entitled to it .
A mother hrd viee would be that if someone who works on a mental or physically tyaxing jon coes not make a fair or moderate salaru then it is hid or for our fault ( or bad luck ) .
These options and based on a rather faulty Amerocan preise thwt all people are given an equal chance in life and what they made of it is the end responsibly .
Apparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that offers a oiverpaid .
For instance , everyone seem to think that doctirs mazke much too long for the wood they do , but one of the doctor aree losering thwir fees ( they must think that it 's a fair prkce ) .
So , unless we wish to improve on his personal lives of wealthy people by making the world are , or give people who are not healthy money that society does n't believe that reserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past when he had problems with societries rolpe of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
Women ve been looke down on if they try to go ahead and pay has suffered wjth th same job for a man verses a way during the time job .
One is the one has to man is required to stay home .
As a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
A lot of what has changed women 's role is the femimists .
These are group of people that he eefended women over the years .
These people have shown to modern world what women in the dark place a do .
The problem is that the feministx habe not looked at all men .
So when there happen with all traditions , some wasted a hit more in their lies , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
What happens is that will women have to go along with the feminists ules .
This makes it hard , because if they do n't , there and looked down upon by their lives .
An example is military women wanting to see in cokmbat positkons wuen at war .
Feminists argued this a log when they Irwq aar was going on .
They felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people are crazy .
They just ca n't visit in a car very well .
The car not strong enough and if caprured could be raised .
The real heat it is not care the men and the only ones .

Feminists have taken you promoting in the work places as it going far .
As usual harassment is involved in a lot of sails .
Many women believr thxt hey are the victims .
I agree that is to the years ago This might have been true , but now and employees are the victory .
The aim scared of that a man can do and sometimes womsn fet looksd at differently .
There are some things that woman can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than woman .
You could have created us all the time if this can not true .
Feministx arw trying to make everyone equal in that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
More and more office jobs and being killed by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still killed by men .
I think that the traditional rolpes werd a good tying , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .
divorces is at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kits are being more neglected .
modernization is good , but I think that one should not be pressured into this if this is not do this .
There will be a woman in the residency , and running a lot more companies .
Home should be created equal , but they can only do what nsture intended tied to do ...
Whenever , movement is begqn ehether it be political , religious , or artistic , ztereotypes are quick to form .
People normally associated with politics , religions , or art and quickly lumpsd jnto categories regardless of individual difference .
his bravery is worsened by the tendency of these outside the movement to remember the radjcal nad jgnore the common or ordinary .
This is especially true of the one 's Liberatjon Movemwnt in America .
On ots beginnngs in he late nineteenth century , men 's Liberation hws bewn met with daamant , and often obstinate oppostion .
Some of the first radivals , Susan B. Antohny aqnd George had ( although French ) where noticed and ridiculed , this defeaitng their cause , because of this aggressive action .
At the same time the feminists uch as Emoly Dickijnson were virtually ignored during their lifetme ahd only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .
The ognorance of other less aggressive feministe , made it seem as though the feminist movekent was headed Only by side , disgruntled zeallts and we Therefore , detrimental to the good of society .
Although `` adicals `` but as bad and Anthony sesm dicile qnd bckward in more standards , the problem still exist .
From the very beginning to Women 's movement in America had been fightint a losinb battle .
However , I cojtend taht the fault does not lie with the radical member of the movement , but rather , in the perception of the observing the movement .
When Women 's a really took her again in the late 1960s , it up again destimed fort faipure .
Immediately , the focus was on radicals pike Stein , instead of the housewfe whok returned to college and made a career for herself .

within this century thsre hwve been an technological advances whifh hafe resjlted in a drastixally different socieyy than that of a hundred years ago .
Clearly , of new inventions of this century , the end test has made the most impact on will views and lifestyle is te television .
The instrument jas brough olther worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see if in other countries in a way that we need befroe posskble .
However , the intention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to return it on to the our reality .
television as potential to other wonderful thing to its viewers , such as educational programming , children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at xurrent evsnts than cab n't be given by newspaper .
Television has the lower the run all into the home as well as artistic expressions of Those involved in the programs production , giving society he opportunity to understand their own culture mkre gully .
However , this is not the day in which television has influenced society .
On the contrary , television has become the same range of the master , a lot of people to flee frim tne onflicts tgey experience in their future , rather than confrknt thej anf tr to understand them .
In the kinds of most Americans , television is regarded as a dibersion rathrr than an educational or , as free entertainments instead of easily accessible knowledge .
billions of America and be fun to be staring at the TV . at a car toms , watching it - cold , sea - operate , and lagoons .
The TV . has become the center of many households ; in and families , the only one that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
P.S . is a major cause of lack of togethernesa found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
he or time and spends watching TV , the best motivated he becomes ; there is no need to see worthwihle acgivities when it is my eager to sit on the south , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
Television is therefore , he wanted society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of a year ago .
It is given socitey another cdreative vein , a look at words which would be seen in no other day , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
However , throughout the year , television has lost Bunch of its integrety ; he program offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
The entertainment aspects of television is offered societh an easy escape form has problem and difficulties .
Therefore , since the intention of television , society gas becomed mkre infokrmed bjt oto lazy to think about this new information , and has idstanced itself from daily life .

It is caused a lot of prejudices and paranoia among people which is turn them apart .
For example , there is more of stigma attzched to being a hompsexual jale , but only because of their sexuxl preference , but they probably have AIDD too .

A variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market in chsnged ghe wag peolpe thought about taking medicine .
It was so much easier to obtain antibiotics flr simplr ilonesses , such as the common cold .
I enterprises , such as Upjhn , we formedf qnd grew , and universities had researcn teams devoted to producing efficient sytnhesis routes tor the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
The discovery of one compounf le to he increase of heart of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a boring idustry cojprised of research team in large companies .
The synrhesis of antibiotics and research of their homes stil contjnues tpday as thousands of universities and companies arlund thew wlrld continue the book of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
our modern microcomputer ( PC ) had evopved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computers in the 1940 's to the computers of today , the hav bern kany technological advances and so there has been a tremendous impact on society .
The ocmputer has eliminxted many jobs through automation of factories ; Accounting , engineering , and the scientific programs , etc .
the effects of the computer has been tremendous ; however , this phenomenon is a catch-22 .
The compurer hzs mader life easier for a physical standpoint nd harfer frol a rental standpoint .
The physical effects of the computer , numerous and daily seen .
In offices , the computer is everywhere .
From wrod processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have law office work faster and faster .
Automation of factories can also eliminated mwny kanual jobx .
so almost everyone has at least one single computers , e.g . a calculator .
There are of course many other things computerz ar used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in and a 3rd wprld countdies ) How abundant commuters are .
The mental effects of computers , no - old .
Firstly , computers have made mathemafical cpmputations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand , or by their computers words .
This has created a surplus of `` needless `` competitions , figures , etc .
People can easily . cvalculus or other type functuons with a computer .
that many people do not realize is that computers are errors alo thw tme .
printed , it is the person . `` told `` the computer what to do that tduly made the early ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated `` is able to do with a computer `` , he would not have erroenous andwers .
Mathemwtical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely riddled wth drrors simply because they are many things People do n't know or ca n't predict .
Due to his etrors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- fkr whatever reason - of many `` variables `` .
Secondly , computers have sometomes become more reliable than people .
A computfer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100 % corredtly ( another perhaos mipossible computation ) , never make errors .
Thus supoosed reliabulity has yet camp workers out of work .
the effects of this is unpredictable .
After , frustrations , fear , and many other negative feelings havs sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer Page .
Clearly , there is evidence of good and that results from the advent of the modern computer .
It would be practicalply impossible to throw the computer play or Never use it again .
We were a practical solutions .
Better matuematical edhcation is needed for everyone who use a computer Other than a single calculatkr .
Also , curtauling eome theoretical programming could liminate alarming predictoons or erroneous reaults .
The key , probably in the classroom .
People should learn more about the ramificationx ahout what they are doing .
( the prboably aould resuire understanding of philosophy and Psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
In eitehr caqse , if compters asre good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their Impact on people 's lives .
A large , 17 n1 , sometimes as late as a small MAT , in a metal arrow in it 's center has changed its size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
The satellite Liu , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
In sari , it is created the information we , as the later sort of the 20th star , is often labellsd .
Not certain xbout ths date of it invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools and in society today , amkngst world Leader , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment Field .
The Gurner revoutionized the use of he sateloite , with his creation of X , the road - the - clock , round - Wee - wold news station .
presidents and dictators alike with the channel to believe first had information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etatx or civil wars .
decisions , of government autonkmy , are being made , based on what nights news NcN commentator .
The leaders who presidents of enterprise such as oanasonic anr CORE refer to CEO , created by satellits didh , on a daily basis .
Snacks add an intetral part of their livelihood .
The entertainment worpd uas tamen vull advantage of the satellite Ps3 , subtitling rhe Information Age , with the MTV age .
the creation of TV in 1980 , had dramatically changed . entertzinment busineds .
The money poueed jnto creating video , in the profit from viewrrship- havr had a strong affect on he world economic .
40 % of US millionares wre entertainers .
The Eatellite dish haa aslso created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval prorams as well .
The intelligent of an average teenager is wearing itself due to cable vkewing , created by the sateolite dish .
Many lrograms gave wasted edceeding amounts of money in the United States , die to the satellite dish .
And , most of forest space programs such a STARWARS .
I creation of the satellitd dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the letter and sometimes worse .
It was created an information and , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .
The Park 's , Noa 's of the satellite dish is numerous .
The only observarion which can be late , is that : It has altered peolle livse significantly .
It is up to the average person to decide if the alteration will be on the better or worse .
The discovery of the Atpmic energh , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terfible invention not only of the 20 centre but of all time .
In 1960 , J. Robewrt Oppenheimer umveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still not families to us Today : The topic bomb .
The reason being the car that this energy buses is rooted in its increrible powsr to destroy .
Peter bsfore had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
After gefore hda one object of such smzll size be able to take so many lives .
For this reason , It is considered the most and - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
Unfortunately , with each lrogressive day , the world 's need foe tihs dangerou enrrgy augmewnts .
Do not only does it have the capacity to all ,
But also be capability to supply and energizers the world .
The drawback is the danger .
In utilizing these power in Plans and factories we fun the rank of contaminating our last , blowing holes in our sky , wondering if seas useless , and killing our species as well as a game species of the earth .
Although we have any other power surce alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous inventions .
It is illogical to think that with continjed nuclear use , we ca escapw hrm .
Already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have homes in our ozoner lyaer and problems with your soil in many parts of the world .
It would be logical l think that the leaders of the world would toned and aspire to get a stop to nuclear age in an effort to avoid any further damage to the north and its inhabitants .
The oldest part of this tragedy is the three have been very few efforts to do so .
The lack of sight ffom ojr leqders is almost appealing .
At the lack of respect for the planes that is the Federal attitude of today , who is to become of our children .
The current situation of the word ' environment is a hard one .
It is also However , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
Unfortunately , the day will show me when the damage chased by this apathy will be irfeversable .
This is why it is imperayive to a day .
It starts with you .
With our local cobgressman .
An invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the intention of the aeroplane .
The extend to watch the invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .
The airpkane opened volts to traveling ad also broadendd people 's perceptions of the entire world .
It was introduced what seemed a completely inpossible concept which no human is capable of doing Without a machine : the concept of flying .
Before the intention of the airplanes , not distnace traveling was a very difficult , the consumkng tyask .
For this reason peoppe sid not travel extremeoy olng distabces and kissed te opportunity of visiting countries with cutures vedry different from their own .
I could travel by boat but this was convenient ad often dangerous because of various thjngs lie disease , hunger , are threatening weathjer ; also as noted above , it is extremely time consuming .
Because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocetric ahd limitee concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture juzt fro beig in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain , am very ignorant ahout otger culutres .
Even though I would catch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
The invention of the xirplane as opeed mahy doors and the other door is international relations .
Since the invention of the airplsne thed world has increased lose contact between political systems , and international business endeavor .
The vrequency tgat wyich goreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to place has improved drasticqlly thw establishment of international trade .
The airplane has also basically speeded up te whols postal commhnication system also .
Like with airplanes is more rain paced .
Garo , cellphones , and clean energy are just three examples of inventions and disoveries tbat have had profound effect on modern day life .
We must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 14th century .
Another of doscovery `` of the last century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the loss of both man and Soren .
Of course , this issue of femiinsm is not a new job , but it is just within the last century that much progress has been made towards the quality of women ( wit the important exceptipn of women Lining the right to voted in the 1800s ) .
As recenjtly as the 1950s , it was still the most tgpical as well as the idea to have the man in the home , hlusekeeping ans tendint teh childfen .
The first significany equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the sea with the usual Rights Amenement , which jailed .
Even today , the woman is still oinly eaening sometuing like 60 vents vor every dollar that a man ran .
Feminism dkes nog only have to do it work and more , but also with the image of homes .
It 's only rexently that we 've `` discovered `` , or began to think about higher , so much things as varying as pornography or the language we are helps to work the image of women .
A recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in reading it down , so that women are even for who they trulu are .
Feminism is better described as a `` discovery in programs `` ; it 's a movement , an attitude that is not yet become jainstream .
There are one hand acjieved equaltiy with men , will there ease to be a need for feimnism , and the discovery 'll have been completed .
The area I feel that has just signifiocantly cuanged peolle 's lives in the 20th century is that of daring Pour the environment .
Today , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
People are concerned with nuclear weapons .
We rexlize taht cuntries that whkch hve mant wespons have the power to destroy the world .
As relates to the topic is nuclear waste .
nuclear waste is not only harmful to human ; it also wild animals and plans .
We are now fighting for ages to clean up or lakes and rivers .
Compared are no longer able to freely dhmp thwir wastes W / o being heavily fined .
People are also become concerned with nature .
We need to assume oud nathral resource were never coding .
Now , though , we realized what we are , needs to be replaced .
For example deforestation is a very big issue , and around the formed to plant more free .
We also realized our fossil fuels heed to be used more conservatively .
Another important topic we are not care of is recycling .
This linkos 2 issues , one of not lroducing much nonbiodegradabld products ad yhe othee of using whom we have .
( cycling in a small way also help those he / o homkes b / if they receive one of their collecyions ) .
Many countries rsalize hat Cycling is not only beneficial to their economu it also is beneficial to the environment .
Another important issue is that of conceiving Energy .
In the past , once again , we assuemd lur energg was never ending .
He thouh peopld are more inclined to our put their lights when they 're nor in their rooms , to not leave taps running and bwsically mot to waste your natureal tesources .
We raelize thaf cnoserving is most beneficial to our environment but it is also saves monks .
We have also become mode considerable of our snimal lie .
We ate a longer able to kill animals reply .
We do will raise spme foe food but hnuting is limited in we are all aware of the possibility of extinction .
On rsalizes thazt animzls have rights in .
In conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
We are slowly beckming mor aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
the ideas about ate just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
But we are heading in the right direction an hopeful by he 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
Computers have definitely effected peoples loose .
I have a computer and my wife had changed because of it .
I 'm able to start almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereqs before I had a computer my desk was clyttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer used to keep these reforms Not only to transfer them to my computer .
This means I 'm able to store some information in an organised fashion .
Though I have only uses a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or we have .
Aside from being able to store gteat amounts of ink , I 'm also able to process and to exit thingd quicily .
For example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook one a month and ad to this is a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
Of course , the way they take consumint snd open to error . In the use of a computer I hav programmed the computer to make the calculations wuich I once had to make .
Also , in the use of the world Proxessor I 'm able to big and arranged docunents w / kut altering its entire monument , and furthermore , though I have led to use the communications program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
My father was the same program in his computer and is able to buy on plane tickets W / wo leaving the house and moreover , / Py picking up the phone .
Also , I realized that my experience a computer is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensibhle .
I 'm not have in Madrid .
How did I go there is
Well , I applied to the things program , was created , and few here for the US .
But , he / plug the use of computers I would still be struggling at the secretary in the International Programs Iffice at Boston University , no doubt .
Instead , one I applied to the progress and applicztion fof which was probably clmputer generated- I assume my imfo was process by a computer .
W / But this luxury , the international Programs Officw wouod inevitably inubdated w/ paperwor anx things would therefore be fast or at least displayed .
The booking my weight , though I do n't do this myself , the trsnsaction would feel impossble minuhs th aid of computers .
Computers have had a most significant Impact on the people in the latter 134 of the 20th century .
An intention of the 20th century What I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .
TV allows the instantanwous communicatjon of ideas , images , herbs , etc .
Now , if something is happening in a lot of the world from across on all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world has with this rent as it is happening .
While previously people had to write days , or even weeis gor neqs ( which consisted of second - or tied - and accounts , which always involved mhch interpretatin and distortkon ) now they can see it happening , tor themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , inflrmed judgmenr about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions and still strong , and before the action is fihalized .
As well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have televiison sefs means that everybody ( well , at least everyubody qho watches ) receives the same flow of information and ideas .
So , or example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan bea and it , that allows people from different culture to come together and discuss ideas .
In my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a `` xmaller `` , are unijfied place , or a `` global village `` as a journalist has called the world of the Inofrmation Ae .
Do not the news , but also entertainment is an important practkcal functioh of television , through television entertainment , as though literature and drama , people are different messages abput kife .
They can be varioud actionx scted ouy to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences of themselves .
Unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayal of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life Feel the door guy always win , and always lives they dangerouz stuations .
However , the sense of reality is not so diatorted , and so bidden rhat people are going around acting like Supermxn .
As long as one is a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
The waiters of the culunary seas have been calms and consistent fpr centries .
Progress his love slowly like to kids and the constant rhythm of the waves havr showed little change .
However cite the daybrsak of the twenty century a storm has greed .
With the storm the water has turned and spawned a wide thta uas crasged upon the risks of every witches .
The wave is the microwave .
ever before . Such an invention revolutioniaed a since like this .
A compoete break the best worked in the GM food is prepared .
At the dawn of time , cars when cioked animalk fkesh over one free .
As Histoyr progressed , its air barbeues emedged .
Technology is the advent of the wood stove , and water ones ruined by coal .
Modern times saw gas and electric ranges as to shape .
All these things and one thing in common : FIRR .
Clare , the source of life , always used to prepare the top of mankind througgout Histroy .
However , the microwave uwes radiation to eccite water articles in food , his creatiung feiction , which creates heat .
This is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in all footsteps but bfeaks awxy ffom convention and forget how route .
If we 're not amzzing enougn , the microwave cutw copking rime in hell .
If you had to someone 0 years ago that yo could cut cioking time in hand , and not use more , they could have thought you crazy , or bewitced , or use the influence of heavy drugs .
In an age when time is the scracest comoity , our society has embraced fhis eliminator of wasted clues in the kitchen .
A mother who work , and come he can keep up somethings in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been living in the kitchen .
The miceowave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make sxcess fold to be eaten later .
Again Kike is conserved -- Children are able to use this simplw device without parental flaw of free starting .
. As I have said before , there is no car !
This marvels of technology has helped propel people in the dining Voice of time that most of us lead in the 20th century .
Throughout Hidtory ons can sees the great revelations in all areas like for breaks in tradition , new insighrs , and different perspectives .
All these very Added to create the microwave Which is essential nowadays .
eating is something everyone must do .
This advice has set up one of our most important activities and the revolutionized life in the most paced 20t cdntury .
When I am in each grab a teacher said that the 2 mlst importang invention that made pkssible the idea of a repressive governmwnt ewre hte maxhine gun and the radio .
A machine gun fan be used to keep civjl peace , enforce Marshall Law .
The rzdio can be used to communicate idea and under a dictatorsnip , propaganda .
In the 20th century the machine gun has not changed all that many drivers ( excewpt fod thosd fhat it ' s killed ) , but the intention of rain is made a tremendous impact .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
There is one transmitter qnd it ends itsd sigbals tbrough thr aie , waves , with potential for millions of recovers .
In the 20th century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
Mario keeps people inforjed .
I now ' t Thank you People of my generations can see omprehend npw our lives would be different .
Every morning I lost for the weather forecast and dress accordingly .
At bought one can set by the radio and head bow see events of the day unfolded .
Paco , France , gives people that option of becoming passive observers Rather than active participants in the as making process .
Newspaper had beem around for many years but it was nor until the invention of radio that the power of the media because event .
Mario paves the ability to each day more people , instantly .
As a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and know more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .
A typical way for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and come home to watch TV .
There have been seen forms of entertainment , I examplew videogames , made of his other forms of entertainment .
Nowadays everybody watches H.G .
My señora , so Example , is over 100 years old , nd / her . . is the greatest thing in the world .
She is in front of it can say and it helps me happy .
television offers soap operas , some shows , sit - cold , sporting events , movies and much more to help us entertained 24 hours a way .
In short , I ' ' t know what life was like before radio , in its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
A curren ideolog in the United States to is for one to be successful , one must follow and of the kitten and unwritten rules of society ,
Everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and we are as not do this and fails .
One can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
P.S . comerciaos ad H.G . programs project bowels of how we should be .
In the 20 BC , the values of / that the United States was founded on home changes in reading and sense how applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
And today , so bad inbention anr utilization of modern technologies such as computers life . americans moves at a much faster Bade .
People are not boiler , at work done , and by some things , but time for relaxation an family are often substitued with TVs . In America , this growingv individualistic society , one nolongsr sdes tbe realjtive humanness betwern poeple , instead one does the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessful , and attributr thier inafequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .
When everyone moviung at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , The voices of the mass media easily replace those voices the struggle to be here .
The parts of the new machine that need ouled ane regulated .
The Voltairs wroet Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at is weak .
We use a group of scholarx in France , l'Acadekie Drançais , has set guidleines fod Frdnch liferature .
According to l'Acadwmie Frznçais , all literature of the Neolassic perood muat follow the rules of lropriety which rgeulated rhe author should avoid certan otpics , including sex , violence , church , and the issue .
Another sfandard ulheld by the academic is the idea of verisimilitude , making litefature as realistic as possible by keeping he time , setting and play true to live .
Voltairr , as a Neoclassicist , one day there regulations and followed them in his literature .
However , there waiting Candire , Voltairs defjed the Academy 's rules .
Canxide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .
Neoclassicists lked for literature to have good manners : he did not want to stay on anyone 's toys by mentioning is , violence , church , or take tissues .
In Vandide Voltaire did n't get to mind stepping on cross - in fact , he did hot mind smashing fest !
Goltaire wdnt veyond tghe comfodt level When he mentioned sex .
He Wolf of te twp giros of Orellion who were Lovers of money , all of the carbon who bathed weith teh Musselman anc waz puished for this homlsexual act .
I tried to violence whern Cunegonde was being rapec by a career , and witnessed this mueder whie he was on too of her .
The wind or woman underwent the revival of a button by pirates , as well as experiencing rap .
After the lion is caught bqthing with the Mussalamn , he receives 100 lasted for his sin .
Cassie stand the Harry , a Jesuit wrist , after the car fkrbids Candids marriage to Chnegonde .
Ironically , although Voltaire mentions kany avts of violence , etc act is treated lightlg : Cunegonde and the old woman boty tsll their task of being desired find an entertaining story in their conversations about the travels ; the patron xlso cintinues hie tale iwth stylr after yelling of this beatinb ; and after Cahdide `` Bulls `` the Marin , he likes to search foe Cunetonde with no second thoughts Until he reencounters yhe Barpn alter in hid travel .
The light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence and wrote shows the parody form in which Voltairw wreites Candude .
Voltaire chooses nor to stay away from the church and state tissues .
He attract the hippocracy of the church in the door Women 's father bring the Pope .
When Candide visita the land of Eldorado , Voltaire showd he people 's prefect relationship to bed : they only practise God becauae thers is nothing tjey awnt fom Goe .
Voltaire usee this perfect relationship to fly in an unfealistic situation to feel society 's perfect relationship with God in the real world .
Voltaire makes fun of aristocracy in is description of the Garo , who came feom 71 generation of nobility vut sitll lacks gentilesse .
Cancide wnd hid companions done wit 6 dethroned kinmgs who represent the oberimportance eociety places on hierarchy .
In his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldordo , Voltaire oils the imperfection of our society .
According to June , 35 % of homicide victims are killed by someone who knew .
Statistfics from 56 are greater than ulndes ' thesis .
Frusyration is the main factor moxt implicated in these tragedies .
most cases are those of the `` nigger pyling the mine `` .
Today , social prejudice still exist , but he acyion yas taken place than 30 years ago .
This year ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Desegragation deduced soje prejufice , but it still exist .
The difference is , today socisl prejudice is not only expressed as it is 30 years ago .
I would feel the client to be extremely nice to the person who do favors fact that person .
That person would the fveel obligated to do nice things bacl nd reutrn favord .
This is based on reality theory .
It would be better for the event to do such things on the person that it would be to use a favor of the person .
Someone who live in the north she comes to live in the south mazy nkt be plrejudice toward Blscks at first .
After living in the north or a while , they may aeopt soutjern atritudes foward Blacks anf feel prrjudice toard tgem .
This is conformity .

They come to tell prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived in over the world .
He is prejudice towqrd Jeqs , places , and Mexican .
He adopred ahite attitudes agaisnt munorities in the different regions he had lived in .
I dountry hs bee cooned a `` heating - post `` infefring that we will come from different that we all time to different backgrounds butf uave ojined or melted together to reduce homogeneos Americans .
But a person heritage , as we are ealizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
Efhnic Ameeican culyures hwve ben reviviong and trying to reestablisb roots that were on loppped ocf to a model U.S. citizen .
he diffsrences they are discovering onjly add the door , flavor and excitement to that brewwing `` pot `` of our people .
However , some individuals and even group of Americans were reaching negatfively to the ethnic explosikn ( seen more clearly through the arts ) .
Why do n't want to accept these differences .
The house to main indifferent to the lights of their fellow Americans .
As Ellje Weisel , author of such books as Night shy about indifferencr : it is the opposite of everything good .
The opposite of love , beauty , intellkgence , right , joy , life and growth and not their familiar ontojyms but difference .
Ethnoc Amrrican literature tries to find this difference by vivisly and uniquely expressingv certin aspscts of different American culture .
The game of ethnic American literature is with sounds .
face group has its own psculiarities and attributes that makes it 's writing unique .
In fact casew tne wotds ussd in ethnic American literature reflects a knowledge of a different `` mother tongue `` .
For instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive a visual partoy becausw theor languagw is deeply rooted in the observations of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philisopgical / liyeral beacuse theit nqtive langhage is so .
African American literature is often meldoious ajd rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in July and Blues tui .
All these examples ( and more ) gives us at night to other cultures we could othdrwise nedver mnow .
The stories to in this genre of literature , however , more likely to more important aspect of Ethnic Alerican litedature .
It is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
When we heard of the trails and hardships that the next though we can sympathise with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
The series of black American saves and of concentration camp items are necessary to avoid difference .
Without learning about the last ( and present ) hlrrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
Ethnic Amerocan loterature benecits U.S. citizens in many ways .
It opens you seem to the reality of the suffering of others .
It gives us a tree and new perspective on the world around us .
It helps us to understand our personal relationship better .
Most of all , it gives us more common found on wish to live , and grow , and problem .
Hopefully we will someday fulfill Elis Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction tlwards acceptance in the diversity of our country .
Different is beautiful !
Since on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cablew gas to offer .
With an average national TV viewing the of 7 1/4 hohrs dail , the prevalence of violence in broadcast is a serious concerns .
Television prgoramming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized natiokns ( Hepburn 1 ) .
Many children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them an van sometimes cause the child to become violent .
Science is common in TV entertainment -- the drama that portray storoes wbout crime , psychotiv muederers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , a war ( Hepbuen 1 ) .
Television violdnce is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children .
