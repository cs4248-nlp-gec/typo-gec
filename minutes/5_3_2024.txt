- Slang?
  - Current research on slang is quite minimal
  - Train on typo, analyse performance on a small slang dataset
- Scope of project
  - Most important is analysis of the model
  - Explain why the model behave the way it does
  - Analyse different components of model in isolation
  - What inputs does the model do well on? What inputs does the model sucks on?
  - Anything goes, really
  - Misconception: Dataset => Task
  - Play around with data, "get your hands dirty", transform it anyway we want
  - From playing around, ideas come out naturally
- Translation?
  - Apparently German, Dutch and English are quite semantically similar
  - Translate existing dataset? 
- Close to proposal deadline
  - All good projects undergo a lot of pivots
  - We don't have to stick to the proposal 
  - Just ensure that it is kinda similar
  - Time remaining is less than 5 weeks
- Write own code as much as possible?
  - Fine with fine-tuned / pre-trained models: use them as baselines
  - Go beyond: Test the limits of the different models 
  - HuggingFace is an amazing resource
- Grading rubrics?
  - Rubric is not available
  - Good analysis is the most important
- Submitting code
  - bulk of the code comes from analysis
  - Free to import models from HuggingFace
- Bad results? Does not agree with hypothesis
  - Macro analysis, micro analysis
  - Ulimately, want to anaylse why the model does better/worse than baseline
  - Borrow evaluation techniques, rely on literature. Don't have to come up with new ideas
  - Mechanistic interpretability
  - Transformer circuits
- Micro analysis
  - Manually inspect output, can pull specific instance and understand why exactly the model is behaving badly
  - If model does well, can pull out success cases and explain why it does
  - Use linguistic techniques to help explain 
  - Can be tedious, but helps to understand model behaviour 
- Role assignments
  - Not particularly important
  - Just make sure everyone is involved
- Weekly meetings
  - Flexible, let Rish know beforehand
