== 7/4/2024 Minutes ==
- ZX: Went through current progress. Went through the sub-hypotheses and the results we have obtained so far
- CZ: Went through the generalised model
- ZX: Looking at scoring alternatives, such a GLEU score
- CZ: Attention maps are confusing. Too many heads, not sure what to focus on. 
- Rish: Good stuff so far (yay!)
- Cherry pick some of the nice looking attention matrices
	- Don't need to present everything
- How do we interpret attention matrices?
	- Different opacity of lines
	- Everything is connected to everything else, kinda
	- Line from word i to word j: Refers to attention score of i,j entry in matrix
	- Essentially a symmetric matrix: if word i attends to word j, j also attends to i
	- Row wise sum: Take the words with the highest attention score
- Does last layer always contain the most important information?
	- Not necessarily
	- Maybe in some intermediate layer, the words with typo attend to each other
	- Translate attention scores to highlighted words in a sentence, nice graphic (How do we do that????)
- Github?
	- Only need to make sure it's "camera ready"
- Report?
	- Reccommend our project from STEPS?
	- Don't need to write report, only need to create a poster
	- Make poster have nice visual stuff: fancy diagrams, figures, etc.
	- Prepare charts, plots, tables before we start poster
	- Talk about aesthetic design of poster at a later date
- Keep investigating
	- If we really want to write report, can do in one day, but most do all the analysis beforehand
- KH: Pros and cons of going for STEPS
	- When not to: Can't go all in into the analysis
	- Do not need to write a report! can just chill with a poster
- Has Rish participated in STEPS?
	- He has. It was boring.
	- A lot of waiting around
	- But fun to present when the time comes
- Deadline for STEPS is next Monday, effectively
- How is grading different?
	- Instead of reading text, will be grading in real life
	- Grading on the spot when we present
	- There's also going to be a ranking? 
	- Otherwise, grading is more or less going to be same. i.e. same criteria
- Going to be ~30 teams, but likely to be less
- Get the models trained, get the figures done before we make the poster
	- List all the figures that we can add
	- Then we can pick and choose what figures we can show in the poster
- Ultimately, poster need to looks good

== After-Rish meeting ==
- What we need to do:
	- Evaluation metrics: PP, gleu score. Look at the interpretability
	- Finalise results for typos: light, medium, heavy, long sentence, short sentence
- What makes our approach better? F1_0.5, GLEU, PP
	- Across all the different types of typos, specialised model is better
- Changing hypothesis 3? Explore and investigate over next few days
	- Heyi, look through results again, what remains consistent?
	- ADJ, ADV currently have highest correction rate
- So far, waht do we have? 
	- Specialised is better than generalised
	- For generalised, fine-tuning is better
- Clean up repo. Only keep: light, medium, heavy, long sentence, short sentence
- Creating nice graphics: Shaun and Heyi
	- draw.io, box.io
- DEADLINES
	- Until Tuesday, get all the data, and do your own analysis 
	- Have another meeting on Tuesday night to consolidate
