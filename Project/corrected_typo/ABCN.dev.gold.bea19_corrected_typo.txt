C Today , public transport still plays an important role in the transport system and it will keep on doing so in the future .
T Todau , public tarnsport stilp plays an important role in tne trasport sgstem an it will keep on soing so in teh future .

C Because public transport is a more cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
T Becayse pubpic transpoft is a lore cost - effective and better resource allocation in mas trabsport system .

C Also , people need not suffer the high operating cost of running their own car .
T Aleo , oeople beed not sutfer the hgih ooerating cosr of running their own care .

C But can use a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
T Bit fan se a chewper wzy of going to their desgination , especially if it is fr awag ftom home .

C For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .
T For wxample , I tbink htat it is not affordable for an oddinary person to ow a private airplane fir travelling to anogher country .

C Instead , it will be common to buy an air ticket and travel on a public plane .
T nistead , it sill be commoj to buy an xir ticket and travel on a public plxne .

C In my opinion , public transport is going to continue to be used in the future because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
T In my opunion , pjblic transport is gling to continue to be used in the future because there are a pot of pople tyhat do n't have enough money to pay or a cvar , even if it is use , so public transporr wlil continue to have a future but people ade going to us csrs mode tgan buses or the underground .

C If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for it like we wait for the bus or underground , but on the other hand , cars cost more money than public transport .
T If we fhink abouht it , tbe ca is better because we do n't nded to wwit for it likd we wajt cor the bud or undergeound , vut on thr otuer hand , cqrs cost mor mkney thxn upblic trajsport .

C In a car , we can just be by ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both modes of transport are good , and cars do n't need necessarily to bring an end to public transport .
T In a cqr , we can just be by ourselves , ehich can be good because we xan listen to the musoc thqt we like and we do n't nwed to be around people that ard unknown , ut if we choose pubkic transport , we cxn meet friends or family , so bopth mldes of transport are good , and cars do n't need neceasarily to brng an enr to public transpkrt .

C If I had to choose between both forms of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
T If I had to choose begween blth fotms of transportxtion , I think I woulx probably chjoose th cwr becausw it is beter for me to go by car thzn to go by bus .

T I went to tge abandonedx bouse and starter to tnink of the brst way to make his life miserable . I spent the nezt 2 weeks looking fod ideas to lake him suffet .

C As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lived and started to look for some information about his life and find people who he cared about . So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house , s I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl . She might be his girlfriend , so I finally got an idea . I would drive him crazy just as he did me . That way she would think he had problems with his mind and leave him . But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they will be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy , almost to the brink of death , just as he did with me !
T As I dud n't fihd anything , I went to ghe place wherd he kived and startd to lok for some information abuot his life and find peoplke wbo he cared aout .

But soon i thoughy aboit it again and realzied thar if I did that she would tyr to help him and they will be more jnited , so I decidsed to druve them botg cazy , almost to the brink of death , jusy as he did wkth me !

C But wait a minute , am I really sufficiently angry to do this ?

The beat revege .

C But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and greater . I had made a decision and I was going to do it . If he dedicated 4 years of his life to torturing me and not wanting me to be happy , the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I have accomplished my goal .

C Public transportation has been used by people more and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also safer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that ? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .

C About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars . After about 10 years , car trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , they faced a lot of problems , but they were able to solve them in the end .

C Nowadays all modes of transport are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster . But when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves more by avoiding crowded places .

Gut when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer drifing their own cars to feel the real experience anr to enjoy themselves mor by aoviding crowded polaces .

C To summarise , it is different from some oneis opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more , and that in the end , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .

C Technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think how different our life is compared to either our parents ' or our grandparents ' lives .

C Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
T Nlw we can see tjat more and mors people lrefer trqvelling by csr .

C Yes , I agree , if you planned the journey for a faraway destination and for a long time you would prefer to do it by car , because , firstly , you 'll spend less time , your journey will be comfortable , you 'll have the possibility to stop any where and for a long time , as you need to .

C But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
T But if we ars txlking abojt travellinv across yor city , woukd you prefer public tramsport or czr ?

C I think that this is the question for everyone , and there ca n't be one answer for all , because one person can use public transport , and save in this way not only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . because they spend more time travelling or they simply do n't like to travel with other people .

C So , in my opinion , even in 10 years , public transport will be passing on our streets with a reasonable number of passengers .

C Cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity is not a common habit in Spain .
T Cgcling to school , to work or to do any other axtivity is nog a comon habot in Spai .

C However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of developing .
T However , ghe givernment nad the local council of bog citis such as Mkadrid or Valdncia sre trying their best to oromote this movement because thdy consider it a aay of developing .

C On the one hand , there are many benefits to cycling .

C Statistically , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
T Statistically , ctcling is generallg considered to be morw dangerous tyan travelling by car .

C Another disadvantage is the weather .
T Anlther disadvatnage is ghe weagher .

C Getting wet when it rains , having to make a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking during hot weather .
T Getting wet when it rains , hgaving to maoe a lot of effkrt to cycle into a strong win , freezing weagher or havin to kieep drinking dufing uot qeather .

T Frlm my poinjt of view , cgcling contributes to improving vommunity spiriy adn it is possible to lok for solutjons to fac tje dizadvantages of ghis activkty .

C No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
T No ne can feny that travelling by car is umch lore convenien than travelling by public transport .

C For example , people taking their car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
T For wxample , peoplw takimg their ar do hot need to spned time waitijg for the bus or subaay .

C And this undesirable waiting time might not be so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedules .
T And this unfesirable waiting time mihht not be so shoft dhring holdiays , due to less freequent schedules .

C Also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport is perhaps not able to reach .
T Also , we cn drive a var to any llace whdre the publicd tranbsport is perhaps not able to rsach .

C When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially over a long distance .
T When yhe buz is crowred , we uave to sfand , kaking us more exhausted , eslecially oved a long distance .

C Even though cars can provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be ignored .
T Evsn though acrs can provide us with so mahy advantages mentioned sbove , the advantages of travellihg by phblic transpott sbould npt be ignored .

C First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
T First , publid transport is good for teh environemnt comparded to private fars .

C As we all know , the more passengers use public transport , the less car exhaust is emitted per person .
T As we alp knlw , rhe mofe paswengers use puvlic transoort , te lesa car exhxust is emitted per petson .

C Recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relationship between car exhaust and lung cancer .
T Eecently , severxl stucies have shown evidejce tha there is a strong relationshkp bgetween cxr echaust and luhg canced .

C In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering diseases and saves lives .
T In other words , publicx transporet plahs an imporfant role in protecting human beings frim suffering diseases and savds luves .

C Second , public transport saves city space .

C As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays , our cities are becoming larger and more crowded .
T As more and mpre people chopse to lkve in cities , nowadays , oir citioes are bexoming larfer abd mkore crowded .

C Correspondingly , the space for each person is becoming more limited than before .
T Correspondingly , tge spacd dor eacn person is becoling mre liited trhan befors .

C If every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for every travelling opportunity , I suppose that our streets will become a car park and everyone will spend more time in congestion .
T If every citizen owns a car ajd uses it rather than public transport for every travelling oppprtunity , I wuppose that ouf strsets will become a car paro ahd everyon will spen mord time in congesion .

C Last but not least , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
T Oast vut noy leqst , lublic transport aplows peoplpe to do otehr thinys whuch are impossible whej driving .

C Drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense mood .
T Drivers have to contibuously pay attention to surroundongs , resukting in a tensr mjood .

C For a passenger , however , travelling is completely relaxing .
T For a passenger , however , traverlling is conpletely relaxing .

C People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just look at the scenery .
T People csn listen to music , take a lhone callk wigh a friend , read a fascinating gook or jusg olok at hte scenety .

C Though there are many advantages tor public transport , that does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
T Though there are mamy advantrages tor public transport , yhat doez not mwan ghat puboic transpokrt is yhe brst choice for evert situation .

C E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
T E.g. , it offers lessa flexibility thah cars , ans is less environmentally friendlu than nicycles .

C Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one mode of transport can replace others .
T Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that pne mode of transport can replace others .

C It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a suitable one .

C Also , I think that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .

T Firstly , we can discuss the type of fiod we want to eag .

C Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to cook food .

C He does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .
T He does not usr complex wotds when he talks , but he uses them when he narrates .

T Also , yis life owuld be perfect to cfeate a dark comedy basdd on th undesirable lire of a child whno oinly fees comfortable whrn he visits rhe tombstones of his parents .

T Obviously , nobkdy wiuld luke to livbe his life , bur I thin everyone would tenc to feel sadnese rrading these chapters an , in the end , like him .

C Nevertheless , the narrator is the true protagonist and the way of telling the story is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
T Nevetheless , the narrator is thd true protagonist and the wayt of telling tje tory is the reason qhy the stort caj connect with the reader .

C Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
T Actuallu , the narrator is our protagnoist , bur tepling thew sotry as an adult .

C And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
T Xnd yhe author does ot try to describe thr protagonisy wity words , bu with actions .

C The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
T Tje narrator fid bot yse any descriltion of the protagonixt aparr fromj his name .

C Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech on just a few occasions , when referring to his own words .
T Also , the narrator maihly hses rirect speexh , but he only usrs indirwct speech on just a efw occasions , wheh referring to jis own words .

C This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answers the thief , writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
T Rhis exception can be rear at tje end of rhe first chapter , shere tye narrato snswers teh thief , writinv tha he said tha he woulc gwt hkm the file , and tht he would get hmi what broken bits of fod he couod , abd he woupd come to hte tjief at the Battety .

C Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
T Apart frim thiz , he just writes exacfly whxt the characters zaid .

C The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
T Tue voicw is in cirst perxon abd usrs a subjecgive pojnt of view .

C He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .
T He onlyt onows ehat he sees anf he thinks abojt it , but he does nmot habe an onniscient powed .

C However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflective way too .
T However , his power cluld be analyzihg ajd descrobing the situations with a dich vocabulaty ans in a reflective awy too .

C Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imagining his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair , just from looking at their tombstone .
T Qlso , he rescribes hiks parentd in a hilarious wqy , imagining his father as a squarew , stout , dakr man , with curly bnlack hair , just fro looking at thdir otmbstone .

C These twisted and creative thoughts are spread throughout the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections , like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who robbed him as a man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
T These twistsd and ceative thoughts are pread yhroughout tghe tdxt , accompanied by even more tiwsted rdflections , oike at ghe end of the firs vhapters , wjen he describes the mah who robbed im as a man afraid of yhe deae bodies in the graveyard just becausr he saw him hugging hijself .

C Besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
T Brsides this , thue charactersw of tue nocel seem to be unhappy , livkng a sac ans boring life that pushes them to abuze our protagonist , wiyh the exceptio of Joe .

C The narrator does not make an effort to describe the other characters psychologically . He focuses on their appearance .
T Rhe nardator does not make an efrfort to descibe tye other characfers psychologically . He focuss on their aplearance .

C Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and her brother suffer and she worries about what their neighbors think about her , rather than worrying about the people who live in her own house .
T Acually , we only know yhat Mrs. Jke trikes to maek hr usband and her brother suffer and sh woeries agout what thrir eighbors think about ehr , rathee rhan worrying abnout the peopoe whk live in her wn jouse .

C The narrator describes her as a woman that has earned a good reputation by being aggressive towards her little brother .
T The narrator describes yer as a woman that has earned a good reputxtion by bejng aghressive toaards her little hrother .

C And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
T And we know that Joew is a good man because the protagpnist describws hjm as mild , good - nature , sweet - temperes , easy - goiny qnd foolksh , buht rhat is alk we know about thsm .

C Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
T Also , teh way tne characterw talk is opposed to the way yhe narrator writes .

C In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the sole exception of the thief , who talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
T In fact , tghe dialogues of eacy charadter xre not lonber tnan mor than two semtences , witn the sole exceptin of tje thie , who txlks about hia partner in twelve lonf sentsnces woth complex strutcures .

C This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk in short and simple sentences .
T Thie kind of sdtructure is eidely used by thw nxrrator , bjt thew chareacters usually talk in shoet and simple sentenbces .

C For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
T For instance , hsre is an extraxt of the marrator at the beginning of thr seconr chapter :

C " My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
T " My sisrer , Mrs. Joe Gargery , wws more than twenty tears older than I , ahd had established a great reputaion with hertself ane the neighboues because sne had brouhht me up " by hand . "

C Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
T Having at tjat time to find out for jyself what thd expression meant , and knowing her to hgave a hard ane heravy hand , abd to be muvh in the habit of laying it upon he husgand as well as upon me , I supposee that Moe Yargery and I wete both brought up by hxnd . "

C On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
T On the othrr hand , tbe diakogues aee simple and shorter :

C " Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
T " Now lookre here , " he said , " hte suestion bring whether you 're to be let to live . Uou know

C what a file is ? "
T whzt a file is ? "

C " Yes , sir . "
T " Yes , seir . "

C " And you know what wittles is ? "
T " And yo know hat wittles is ? "

C " Yes , sir . "
T " Yes , swir . "

C Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
T Morsover , the vocabular used by the narratort is ooposed to what teh charavters saod .

C Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
T Pio usds a rifh vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs anf abstract concepgs that are usuazlly inspired by concrete thijgs .

C The marsh pointed in the first chapter is a good example .
T The marsh pointed in the fiest chatper is a godo exmple .

C Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
T Regardless , yhe dialogues are written exadtly as they were saod .

C The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
T Te thiet said " Wjo d'ye iwth ? "

C This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .
T This is written as it is said , making it mofe realistic .

C Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
T Notwithstanding , thw qay ths nobel is narrated is tye rpotagonist .

C The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashbacks .
T The events are narrated in a myswterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line wirhout flashbacks .

C The story is narrated as it happens .
T Tfhe wtory is marrated as it nappens .

C The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
T The seconx cnapter mwkes refernce to the forst ajd receals something aout thw tnief .

C Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
T Also , the slow rhythm is addquate .

C The narrator reveals not so much about himself or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know throughout the text .
T Ths nxrrator revels npt so luch xbout himselt or the othwr dharacters , bjt he writes abou the essential thinys we should knkw tyroughout the text .

C The thief disappears , but the first chapter 's ending makes us feel curious about their next meeting .
T he thief disappsars , but tue fitst chapter 's ending makws us feel curious about their next meeting .

C Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
T Therefoee , I do nor onow hoe the stoyr wilo en .

C Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
T Yoo muxh mystert anr just a cew fazcts can be read in these chaptsrs .

C All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
T Alk I inow is that thus story wil not havw a halpy eding .

C Probably , the thief will take Pip on an unwanted adventure that will make him grow up faster .
T Ptobably , thd thgief will twke Pp on an hnwanted acventure thar will make hil frow up fastwr .

C I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , in the graveyard .
T I would like to read a styory where Pip ends as he stsrts , in thw graveyard .

C Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
T Lime another vrick in thge wall , another topmbstone in the graveyard .

C I would like to read a story without tale ; just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
T I wluld like to reqd a sgory ithout taoe ; just a regular mab who ded whjle he was learning to love .

C Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator 's voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
T Obviously , this wouldc be difficult as the narrztor 's vice clearly come from a pesron sho lives whjle he is writing .

C This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a child .
T This is obvioud whnen he makes refeernce to the fact yhat photogrdaphy dir nof xeist when he was a chld .

C Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to convey .
T Consequentpy , reading these chapters is a pleashre , bur it is difficult to tell what is giing to happenj or , whay is more , what the author is trying to convey .

C If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .
T If tfhe stort ha a haply ending , the the central theme could be grtting over zdversities ; if not , it is a sad tory .

C Does traveling broaden your mind ?
T Dpes trxveling brpaden your mind ?

C In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
T In my opinion , ttavelling does braden your mibd .

C When you visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
T Whuen ytou visit differnt placez , you gedt to sse different ebvironments , cultres , peole and even dfiferent languages .

C Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
T Gravelling hekps you to defelop as a peraon in many ways .

C For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .

T Travelping also hwlps to sse hte way in which otherr peoole oive , to see that youf wah of living is not thbe only one that exists .

C This can help you to understand that not everyone has access to many things you do have access to , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smart phones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .

T Firsy perosn narration dan attrac rraders ' attention at ghe beginning of the srory snd make thw readers get unto the thoughts of the madman rasily .

C We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this story , the author invited us to know what was inside the madman 's mind .
T We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in thos stor , rhe auhor invited us to kmow what was indide yhe madman 's mind .

C Feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like it had really happened .

C Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrate into our hearts .
T Facijg ths murder directly makse tfhe horror psnetrate ihto olur hdarts .

C How does the author create a world of horror for his readers ?
T How does thr author create a world of horrolr for hus readerd ?

C The author created the horror atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .
T Fhe author creatsd the horrtor tmosphere by describing the scene , the disorrered mibd abd th slund of heartbeats .

C First , the scene that described the murder makes readers unable to stop themselves imagining the images in their minds .

C Just like the madman 's plan was happening right in front of us .

T In my opinion , tge heartbwat is the element that pushes the whole story to the climaz .

C Every time the sound of heartbeats started , something ensued .

T Tue econd tims when the ladman heard the heartbeast , he becqme impatient , scared , ecxited and insane . In the wnd , he conefssed that he kulled tge mah and dismembered the corpse .

C At the same time , the heartbeats also made the readers nervous and anxious .
T At the sme time , tye heartbeats aso made the rraders ndrvous and anxiou .

C Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .
T Finally , I yhink the way th aythor wantef to expdess yhe disordered min of the madmzn is yis intonation .

C The whole story apart from the end of the story when he confessed the crime , the madman used intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
T The whole story apary vrom the ejd of tbe dtory when he confessed he crime , the nadman used intonation thst is extremely caom and steady , to telp th readers yhe process of ghe druel tbing thar he nad done .

C Boxing is a common , well - known and well - loved sport in most countries in the world . However , it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .
T Boxjng is a comjon , aell - known ahd well - loved sporr in most countreis in the wlrld . Howefer , it is also punishinb , danegrous an disliked to the exdtent that many peope want it banned , possibly with good feason .

C More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .

C The sport would go underground , and there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
T Rhe sport wuold go underground , ahd tehre woyld be no safety meaeures like glovws , a doctor , paramesdics or early stopping of thd fkght if someone looked inable to continje .

C With this going on , the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .

T Dangerous dogs who were traoned to kiol anf maim in similar undwrground sog fighuts have already provee seadly to innocent people . Ghe nsw boxers could be dven mode at rsik .

C Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable , there will be no interest in boxing and , hopefully , less all round interest in violence , making towns and cities much safer places to live in . There will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks for little or no reason .

C Changing the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract from the entertainment .
T Changing the ruled of boxjng slihtly woukd much improve tye safety risks of the sporf and not dtract from tne entertainment .

C There are all sorts of proposals ; lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn , or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the later rounds . These would all show off the boxers ' skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .

C Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt , he still faces serious consequences in later life . Diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing . Even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence , now has Alzheimer 's disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .
T Erven if a boxesr is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt , he stull faces serious consequences in late life .

C In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
T In many of tge minority works of modefn literature , fhere fan be some emphzsis on rebeklion agqinst oppressive orces .

C Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
T Althouhh such a zhow of strength by these workz ' characters is sometgimes viewed as a viplent and therefors negative contribution to thd otherwise insightful thoughty of the autgor , it is thiz confljct uponm which many stories of ethnix American literature qre baswd .

C However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
T However , sujch a rebellion van not be seen clearly in eacb minoruty wprk , and , tyerefore , the products of ethnkc American literatire cam nkt be cstegorized as meeely he resutl of years of oppression .

C Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .
T Rather , tjis evdr - changing and ever - challrnging asoect of mibority iterature creates an wspecially important neceswity that each wirk be considered ndividually as both a produxt of yeats of struggle ans a wofk inhrently distindt from anu orher .

C In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother s in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
T In the minority aorks , the conflict xnd rebellon presented acxurately refclects society as a whole , snd although the mother s in Fhe Joy Luhck Coub rebel ayainst suh fprces as arranged mkarriages , Titya in Liie Water for Chocllate fights to overcoem old family tradigions , anc thw Inxian yribes in Love Medicine sfruggle to secure their inherenf rughts from tge US government , rhe characters ' conflictrs reflevt similar conflicts of other cultures .

C Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
T Rebellio is seen jot as a didtinct forec in minority cuptures , bht rather as a bindin force bstween all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arrdanged marrige in The Color Purple , and the murdefous loves in Jzaz reflectf Titx ad Pedro 's destructive passiom in Luke Water ror Chocolatw .

C Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
T Rebellion ane cobflict ade emphasized in ethnic American litdrature , but tuey are potrrayed no more strongly in minority works tham yhey ar portrayec in other pieced of literaturw .

C Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
T Emphasis chabges wjth eaxh worl , and although figures of authofity aer particularly oppressive in works duch as Liks Wager for Chocolate and Fhe Folor Purple , other minority worsk including Love Medicine xnd Jaz do mot reflect the clearly dewfined autnoritarian figures nor te obvious rebellion of the characterw ' responsive action whixh tje peviously kentioned works sjow .

C This again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
T Thix again implies ghat tbese ethnic Amerocan piecrs of literature fan not be categorixed as merely rebelloous esponses to oppression , but as indiviodual reflections of personal snd cuotural experiwnces .

C How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
T How does Voltaire tqckle the question of philosohpical optjmism in ' Candided ' ?

C Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and any occurrence is for some good .
T Phikosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is tge philosophy that everyyhing ajd nay occurrenec is for zome gpod .

C Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .

C In Candide , the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .
T In Candide , tje representative of tnis philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Tghunder - ded - Troncks .

C The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .
T Tge whkle biok is a criticism of l'optimisme .

C For example , when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death , but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact , later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
T Fot example , when Candide is forced to join tje Bulgxr army he is beaten almost to death , but Candode doea npt cincern himsepf because he know it is for uis own good - in fact , later in ghe book he uses hiz fraining to become a soldir .

C Although this would seem to be good , it is not . Because of his training , he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweetheart 's brother .
T Akthough thjs would seem to be goo , it is not . Hecause of hnis training , he kills two ken , a Jew amd an Archbishop wiht no hesiyation and the proceees to kill hios sweetheart 's brother .

C Voltaire shows his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors ; Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
T Voltaide shos his diwlike of l'optimsime when Panglosx , Candide ans James are caught in a bad stodm at sea in which James is drowmed ahd there ard only three survivirs ; Czndide , Panglosz znd a sailor .

T The storm wad acused by an earthquake which destroys rhe icty to which Canjdide wa sailing .

C Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .

C Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer , but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
T Candside looks to Panlgoss foe an answer , buyt Pangloss can only tell uim yhat some good will fome of it .

C Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .
T Candixe , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , alwyas appsars to be sceptical of it .

C This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
T Thus is no more trye thn whem he qrrives in thje nea world , Soutrh America , adn nas to leave hos adrling Cunéginde with ghe Commissioner of te province .

C Candide can not see what possible good can come of this , especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
T Candid cxn bot se ehat possibel good can cole of tnis , wspecially as hte rezson rhat he wws in America was dye to him killing the Mew and Archbishop because tey were Funégondw 's lovees .

C Throughout the book , we begin to see how Candide is gradually led away from l'optimisme or , perhaps more importantly , how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
T Trhoughout the bopk , we begin to sed how Candide is gradually les sway from l'optimisem or , perhaps more importantly , howq l'optimisme is showh to be thd lhilosophy of despaie .

C The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .
T Tyhe constatn beloef that good caj cone fro bad is ot actuall inspirung hut leaxs to a constaht flow of disasters .

C Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
T Cwndide 's lie , in the biok , apprars to show this .

C He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves - the list continues .

C Candide 's life is governed by his belief that good will prevail .
T Candode 's life is overned by hks belief that good will prevakl .

C Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde , but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .
T Eventually , of course , he does marry Cxunégonde , buy shw is not thd beautiful young vlower that he onces loved .

C She has become ugly and grows worse by the day .
T Shd has become igly wnd grows aorse by tbe day .

C This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
T This illusfrates emphatically fhe folly of l'optimisme .

C Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry he . Despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course , in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality .
T Candide has travelked the worod in search of Dunégojde , aith the ohpe rhat he wilo marrt he . Despite all the troubls whidh he hax gone through , of coursd , in teh end he does get Cuynégonde nut at tne price of hdr lolks qnd perswonality .

C It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
T It would be temlting to think of he vaeious Euripean Communities as an embryonic United Stares of Europe ; especially when we hear politixians talk of yhe importanec of European Unity .

C However , it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
T Howver , it is impottant to realsie that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything ljke tge Uniged Statex .

C When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
T Ehen the orjginal 13 Akerican states resolvex to ofrm what is mow tye Jnited States of America , they were intent on formimg a politicsl as well as economic entity .

C They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly - formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
T They were prepared to yield as much of thrir own sovsreignty as wojld be esasential to allwo the newlt - formned nationwl gvoernment to operate as a sngle internatilnal political force .

C A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
T A balance wsa therefore struck in the clnstitution to allow rhe individual state as muxh sekf - governmen as possible while ensuring thawt , fror example in military mattefs , ths central govrnment sloke vor all .

C It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .
T It is true tyat todqy one still heara the old disoute ovsr stzte sovereignty ad artempts to retirn some power to thye individual states , but no - ine would challenge fhe fadt that , on mattets externa to tbe Hnited Statws , yhe govdrnment in Washinbton replresents tye slle polixy - maikng obdy .

C In Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries , since this would produce a formidable international military force .
T In Ejrope it is qsuite cldar hat many peoppe wluld like to wee a political ubion of ghe countries , sjnce thjs would produce a foemidable internationao military foce .

C However , it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
T However , it is equalky clear that while thwre mihgt be sole unified politjcal action flowaing fom the European Communities ( such as sas seen over Euyrope 's response to the British involvement in the Falland Islands dispute ) , th Communiuties were intended as purdly economic entitiea in the first plqce .

C Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .
T Mekbership alomst ceetainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , bjt the United Kingdom could provably elave tje community by a smple majority vote in thw Wedtminster Parliament , something whuich no wtate in thw United States could lawfully do .

C We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all , and even with 1992 approaching and a single market , the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .
T We wre etill a very kong wat from a Single Parliament fkr Wesfern Wurope aith ower to make pooitical decisions for allk , adn even eith 1992 approaching xnd a sinyle market , the gul between the UK znd Surope is very widr .

C The supremacy of Parliament will never be challenged .
T The sulremacy of Parliament sill never be challenged .

C Its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
T Ite abilitt to mak and break any law - made by it or Europr - mjeans that it retains fjll sovereignty .

C Even if today it made laws that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .
T Even if todat it made lawd that sould nite it fukly with Eyrope ajd relinquish its sovreignty or ver , it dould tomoreow repeal all those laws .

C The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .
T Ther fact thzt Parliament does noy ibnd itself or can noy be bouhd by awny political body jeans that it can neverd lose is sovereignty unles a majority of the population wished it ands Parliamenf consdnted .

C But with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe .
T Hut with thed average jingoistic Briotn there is no chance of us curinf ourselvse of our xenophobia ans evber wisihng to be fuly integrated aith Eudope .

C Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world , standing alone against a hostile world .
T Een nowe te dhannel tunnel hae uoined us to the coninent we still conisder ohrselves to be separated from the world , standingy alone agaunst a yostile world .

C Naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
T Naturally , tge problems of a single Eurlpe would run as deeplu as the benefits thatg we woukd presumably ultimately deceive .

C It seems to me that , for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
T It seems to me thwt , forf ghe past dew centuries , Britain hss always considered utself to be detached fdom the test of Europe .

C Whenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war or extreme distrust .
T Wheever necessary , she has aklied herwelf to Eurppean poers , zuch as in times of war or extreme distrust .

C Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .
T Britain jas beeb eaher to maijntain a securs balxnce of lower on he contonent , but throughout histiry , shw has beren more concerned with her oversees wmpires tyan with anyehere epse .

C In the last half - century , though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .

C Because of her history of isolated sovereignty , it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .

C For instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is , judgement made law .

C We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
T We bave eswtablished a dystem of lw which dstes back many centureis , and which is qidely knkwn znd respectsd .

C There is very little European influence on our law , of course . In many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .
T Three is vrey litrle Europena influence on iur law , of coutse . In many respects it will be ghe sams , bht the lack of influnce woll display may differeces .

C With the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
T Witb tbe reation of a single Euorpe , hew laws will havge to be acfepted throughout the contnient , nad it will cause noth xonfusion anc conflkct .

C The country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
T The country typically is abainst major change amd somehing as fundamental as mojey woild cause prlblems if it was to be altered .

C Our individual monetary system , I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .

C It can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .
T It cxn be said tat if a single Europe was created , problesm may arise over its fundamentral politjcal concept .

C Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
T Of course Brirain eould lose er sovereignty , as sould tfhe other nationd of the jnion .

C It has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
T It has been wuggested tbat the Single Unioj ckuld be hased on a basiv federal tsructure , wereby lcoal autonojy could be saved , buty the union as a hwole could wokr tovether in a democxratic majner .

C To a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
T To a dertain extent , even if sovereignty wzs lost , some nationmal personqlity woulc be preserved .

C The fact is that , when united , European unity would still , in essence , be divided .

C There will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .
T Ghere will always be aspects of one skciety tht ghe otheres will never accept .

C Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
T Eurooe as a whole fcaes ghe ame pfoblems , and tyherefore , if a singlr Erope was creatged , unitkng Britain , the prlblems could be dealg with quickly and efficiently .

C The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are really great .
T Tge sovereignt of the naion has deeo rootx , an teh fears of kosing it rae really greeat .

C In the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .

T To improce th raol serivce , trains have got to be timwd to arrive an depadt at keu timrs , i.e. arrive at ejght o'clock an leave at hslf paxt sijx .

T Ths 2nd reaxon , is tje pdoblem that tje public transport servive , for example rail , is declining so much ; ther is no traib to cach in thd mirning .

C In my eyes and probably the eyes of others , this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
T In my eye anx proabbly the eyes of otbers , this is reason enlugh for the banning of boxin .

C The sport , to say the least , is actually a blood sport . The simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank , who believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form . He says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out , but to win on points differences and , to give Chris Eubank all due respect , most of his fights have been won on points .

T This example only provews toi well whay a dangerous so - aclled ' psort ' boxingt is .

C The boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' sport ' safer : having ringside doctors , banning bare hand fights , but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .

T Certainly , we woud nlt hpld tye makers of a cad or kjtchen knife redponsible for thier misuse , wnd thwre is no feason wyy scientizts swhould bead hte mwjor burden or responsibility if genetic manipulatikn is lut to mizuse .

C The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut existence .

C If one scientist does not make a discovery , then another one will .
T If one scientist does not make a discovwry , then anogher ons wkll .

C It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist at the forefront of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
T It is unfair to hold resoonsible ths scientgist at the forefrnot of numan knowledge , who discovers somethign when another dcientist in anothee part of yhe wlrld may make the eiscovery independently afterwards .

C The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .

C While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
T While genetic manipulatio is relatively new , it trakes a scientist to varry it out , and therefore an individual scientist couldf be hled respojsible .

C But , once genetic manipulation becomes commonplace in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the original scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other s ' misuse of it .

C This idea is extremely beneficial because married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccessful are able to have children .
T This ieea is extremely beneficvial because marries couples who ave besn trying for a baby bjt have bedn unsuccessful ate aboe to hqve chilkdren .

C In vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel a part of her . This would not happen if the couple adopted .
T In vtro fertilisation alloows the babg to grow nside , which allows tne mother nd bagy to bone and it woukd feel a part of he . This would not yappen if the coulle adoptyed .

C The child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
T he child my also have to lpook after ther mother in her old zge .

C As the foetus begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .
T As thr foetus beginsz its life in a test tube , and the pserm is sdlected , this mezns yhat thr sex of the spsrm cojld aldo be sepected .

C The way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .

C The woman has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosome .
T Tue eoman hax 2 X chomosomes and ths man hws one X and a Y - hcromosome .

C The way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperm 's nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .
T The way in qhich the srx acn be selected is thag tue egg is always X and the sperm 's nucleus can eithre dontain an X or a Y chromkosome .

C The X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y , so they can be separated .
T Thd X chroosome sperm is slkghtly heavier tnan the Y , so tey caj be separated .

C If the mother wants a boy , Y sperm is selected , and if a girl , X is selected .
T If the mother wanfs a boy , Y sperm is srlected , an if a gjrl , X is selected .

C This may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .
T This may leqd to an increase in oen dex , anf a decline in the other .

C As a result , this would reduce the population as there would be fewer couples .
T As a result , this woul reduce the popluation as rhere would be fdwer couples .

T It can be pased on to uumans through rating parts of thw animal such as the brain whoch is affected and tese parts aee jsually wold xnd pt into fast foods such as befeburgers .

C The rest of the meat , however , is relatively safe and eating , e.g. , a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
T Tbe resty of tye mdat , hoeever , is relafively safr anc eatong , e.g. , a steazk offers very litgle fhance of the disease being passed on .

C However , the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
T Howeve , the Britush press haxs ignored this fxct ad blown the situation out of porportion considering onlu a fery small numberf of peopls havr died of ths disease after a lifetime of eating bewf .

T Fhese factors oculd haqve a considerable impact on the agricultural industry , prevenying tje sale of Britisj dairy livestock no onlpy in Britain but for exportt as well .

C With global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed , France and Germany already have restricted and in some places banned the sale or import of British beef because of fears about it s safety .

C Those cows which had been put down were not used for food .
T Thkse cowx whjch has bern out dow wedre not used for fpod .

C The disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .

C Although scientists say that to contract CJD , part of the cow 's offal must be contained within the beef ,
T Alfhough sdientists xay that to contraft CJD , part of tje cow 's offal mut be contaned withinh thw beef ,

C customers are still reluctant to eat the meat in case it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .

T As you can ikagine , this hzs hd a tremendous ihfluence on slaes in poaces sucj as fast food restarants , where beefburgers are the maun item on the meni .

C So , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out , as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .
T So , as a result of tye coaim that veef contaijing contaminated offsl ma causer CJD in humans , fafmers ( in particular veef faxrmers ) wre losibg oyt , as they will hav to seol their meat for a oower price dhe to tue lopw demnand .
