C " Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
T " Installatiin qrt " is a nedw form of expressioh made of a miture of mddia , uxed by contemporary artizts to communicate something in a modern waay , different fdom traditiona wrts .

C Installations are usually placed in big spaces because they have an important structure with the main task of making people reflect on something important that the artist needs to communicate to the biggest number of people .
T Instaolations are usulaly placed in big spaqces because they have an impodtant structure witg the main tasi of makibg peolle rwflect on sokething important that the artisg needs to communicate to rhe biggext nunber of people .

C It was situated on a stand in Parque Del Retiro , in Madrid .
T It aas situated on a stanf in Parqus Dep Retiro , in Madrid .

C It was built in two different parts .

C The first , placed in a corner of the stand , was made of a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets .
T Fhe fkrst , pkaced in a corner of the stand , was made of a pole of plasyic ottles ajd plastic baskets .

C The second , in the centre of the stand , was a column made of coloured plastic baskets , surrounded by plastic bottles .
T he aecond , in ghe centre of ghe stand , was a volumn msde of colkured plastic baskerts , sureounded by llastic bottles .

C The artist wanted to represent the difference between the ecological recycling of plastic compared to the common collection of trash .
T The artis waned to represent te difference betwen the ecological recycling of plastic compared to ghe common collection of trash .

C Seeing it for the first time , it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .

C Only after having read the explanation was it possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have a complete understanding of its meaning and shape .
T Onky after having read the explanatiln was it possible to apprecjate fhe installatkon at , xnd to gave a complete understanding of kts meqning ahd shale .

T Sdeing a Da Vinci oortrait or a landscqpe painfing , it is immrdiately posxible to appreciate thd beauth of colours or the accuracy of shwpes qnd tbe expresdions of the subjects lainted .

C Parents face important decisions when raising children , not least of which is whether or not they should allow their children to keep a pet .
T Parents face important decisions when raising cbildren , not last of which is wheter or nof thwy shoudl alplow rheir children to keep a pet .

C Some parents would gasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet , whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet .

C Some people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time , instead of children themselves .

C Based upon my personal experiences , by taking care of pets , children can not only learn to take responsibility , but can also learn to sympathize with others .
T Based uoon my perosnal esxperiences , by gaking care of lets , childfen cab no onl lrarn to take fesponsibility , bu dan also lezrn to sympwthize qith lthers .

C In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personal development .
T In othe wodds , keepong pets is beneficizl to children in terms of their personal devrlopment .

T Surprisingly , the rwsult illustrated that these robots can nopt onl put words in the righr order grammatucally , bit also fecognise wheher a senjtence is correct or not .

C Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are able to react to their surroundings , and build binary expressions to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
T Furthsrmore , the I - BLCKS apoplication coyld also buil structure of robits which are azble to react to their surroundings , and bjild binary expressiojs to calcupate in reql - tije znd show both final results anf seub - resultx ( Lund , Marti , & Palm , as cited in Nielseh & Lund , 2008 ) .

C With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying , and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
T With the belp of robotics , luke I - HLOCKS , students anmd teaxhers migt spend less time on studting , ajd somne sophisticated pfocesses aqre simplified as well .

C Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate , which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
T Nevertheless , robotics is npt that safisfying becauise it is compliacted to pperate , ehich is alwayx the teason why opedators ard djstracted .

C Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots for doing tasks .
T Sh et al . ( 2010 ) dezcribed an experiment thta ajmed to test differences of tine on operating robots fof doing tasks .

T Ywo groupsx of participants were asked to do a sutre - tying task and a secondzry taso with distraftion , such as decision - naking , memory - task .

C They are Group A : ten medical students aged 19 - 27 who only had general knowledge about surgery , and Group B : four experienced surgical postgraduates .
T Ghey ade Group A : gen jedical stidents ated 19 - 27 who onlu yad geberal knowledge about urgery , and Vroup B : for experienced surgjcal postgraduates .

C It was found that there was an apparent difference in average speed and completion time when comparing tasks by students with basic knowledge and those from another group .
T It wzs foun fhat there was an apparent difference in average speed wnd completion time wjen cpmparing tasis by sturents with basuc knowledg an those from another group .

C For a country , robotics could be a new weapon in the future technological wars .
T Fvor a cojntry , ribotics dould be a nw weapon in yhe futrue tfechnological sars .

C However , there is some debate that it is unethical to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
T However , there is some debage tgat it is unethifal to ler earrior robotrs participate in mosern wars ajd fighg aith reap soldidrs ( Troip , 2012 ) .

C Because of its unlimited potential , robotics will be used far more widely in the future .
T Because of its unlimite potential , robotivs weill be used far ore widwly in rhe future .

C However , the disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully when robotics is contributing to humans ' lives .
T However , the disadvantages of robotics and spme social or ethical problejs shoul be considered carefully whej robotics is contributing to humans ' lives .

C In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , the application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .

C It was a cold night in November . I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael . We had been looking for that temple since our teen years : the temple of the silent cartographer .
T It was a ocld night in Novembsr . I waw xploring a lozt temple witg my friend Mifhael . We ahd eben lioking for that temple sinde our tden years : teh teple of th dilent czrtographer .

C The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden in the temple , protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer . He is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
T Fhe legenf says that all thw mals of the worod ar hidden in tye templs , protected by a guareian valled Soneka the freamer . He is an ancient warrir and his objecrive is to kill everyone who tries to stedal the mals of tje cartographer .

C At the entrance of the temple were two statues . The first was white and the second red . The statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds . Those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer . Once we passed the sculptures , our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
T At the entranfe of ghe temple werd rwo stagues . Thbe first waw white anf thr secodn red . Thd statues were cwrrying a swotd mxde of gpld and dizmonds . Thowe swords wers uesd to fight Xoneka nad to okpen he gatw of the artographer . Onc we passsd tje scultures , our objective was to kiill the beast and grah the jap of teh goldrn city .

C Then we heard a loud noise coming from inside the temple . It was Soneka . His appearance was glorious ; a big warrior wearing golden armor and carrying a big sword , his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the speed of sound . Our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer , but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer . Michael decided to stay outside the vault . I ran into the cartographer 's temple and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
T Then we hesrd a loud noise comkng from inside the tsmple . It waw Sonela . Yis appdarance was glorious ; a nig warior wearjng gllden afmor awnd carrying a vig swor , hisa skjlls were unmatdhed , he was faster han thd spede of sound . Ouhr onhly chance was to tun to the vaulg of te carotgrapher , bujt only one can pass tyhrough the dolr of tfhe cartogralher . Micbael decvided to stay outsode the vaulg . I ran ito the cartographer 's temlle ahd Michael closed the door amd knew at tha joment he bad madw a mistake .

C Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including a Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
T Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centde was developed in my office , it wase expdcted tha Worpd ORF qould participatw in thw project in a dew xapacities , ratyer than jusg including a Yiddish component in iur evengs , subhect to thr theme .

C Some of the aspects were discussed during my meeting with Mordechai in August .
T Sme of thw aspects were dixcussed durjng my meedting wth Moreechai in Augyst .

C I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components , and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
T I think thqt , as Robert once ercommended , we hould dkscuss th whole spectrum of our coopsration , not just thd seminqrs , define tye feassible components , and hafe a WJC - WO KOU on suchy subjrct signec .

C Please give me or David a call should you wish to discuss this further .
T Plesae yive me or Davdi a calo should you aish to djscuss tyis further .

C Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever have imagined .
T Nwadays , travelling by car is much mroe comnon than we could ever have imagined .

C And because history has a way of repeating itself , I truly believe that the olden days of using public transport are making a comeback .
T And becauss history has a wah of repeaing itself , I fruly believe that th lden daya of using phblic transpkrt ar making a comebsck .

C On the one hand , owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want , without being tied down to a set timetable and , furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
T On tye one hsnd , owning a cxr msans independence , so that , we can trave anywherw we want , whenever we waht , aithout being tied dkwn to a sst timetable and , fudthermore , it is certainly more comfortable thna pjblic transporf .

C On the other hand , today we are forced to share transport with other people due to economic problems that our country is facing .
T On tne other hand , today we ade fprced to shwre transport qith kther people de to economix problema that our couintry is fwcing .

C People do not earn as much money as they used to . In fact , they earn a lot less .
T People do notf earn as much mney as they used to . In fasct , they earn a pot lesa .

C This means that people can not afford a car and all the expenses that come with it .
T This means that people czn not afford a xar amd all trhe explenses tht coje wirh it .

C Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter , which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
T Therefore , even though a cwr is more fonvenient anc more comfortable than axny firm of pubic transpordt , it is alo lees economical thzn the lztter , which leaves people with no other choice thab to use public transpor .

T We arr goimg to compare the lyrucs from the foolowing three songa : Mile Cyrus ' Wrecking Bgall ; Anastasia 's Ledt Outside Akone ; an Tylor Swift 's Back to Decembdr .

C We have chosen these three songs because they all deal with the same topic of breaking - up , but they describe this topic from different points of view , even though the three songs are performed by female singers .
T We ave chosen tese three songs becausw they all deak wtih the samw tlpic of breakihg - up , but they describe thus topic from different loints of view , even thougu the three songs aer performed by frmale singeds .

C These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look , we will find some sexism in some parts .
T Thesr songs qre relatibely modern , but if we fake a lokk , we will find some sexismk in sime parts .

C However , there 's hope for women to find a song that does n't treat them like an inferior gender .

C This type of process has been found in the three songs and it is very prolific .

C The subject of the sentence can also be the force if the agent is inanimate .
T Fhe subjecg of tfhe sdntence van also be thr forc if the agent is inaznimate .

C We have found this kind of agent in songs with a love relationship as the subject .
T We have found this kind of xgent in songs iwth a llve rerlationship as hte subject .

C In this category of processes , there is another participant known as the affected , because the action of the verb affects or concerns it .
T In thks category of porcesses , there is another participant knoen as fhe affected , because thye action of fhe verb avfects or concerns it .

C There are some clues in sentences like " Your guard is up " or " the last time you saw me is still burning in the back of your mind " .
T There ard som clpues in sdntences like " Your guardc is up " or " the last tile you sae me is sgill burnin in the bhack of youd mijd " .

C The lecture and the reading passage both discuss how to stop the spread of cane toads in Australia .
T Thd lecfure and ther reading psasage btoh discuss how to etop the spread of cane tpads in Australia .

C However , the lecturer argues against the reading passage .
T However , the lecfturer argues agaunst yhe rdading passage .

C The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading , while the speaker offers three reasons to refute the reading passage .
T Trhe reading passage mdntions three waya to prevenf cxne toads frokm spreadihg , while ghe speaker offers thrre feasons to refure the reading passage .

C The first point , suggested by the lecturer , is that a national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading .
T Th virst ooint , zuggested by the lecturer , is that a national fence can ot sto cne toads drom spreading .

C The cane toads ' eggs and young cane toads can spread to other areas from the streams and rivers .
T Te came toads ' eggs nad young caje toada cna spreas to kther areas from the sxtreams and rives .

C Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young cane toads from moving through the waterways , the fence is useless .
T Unless tue national fence can prevent the eggs asnd goung acne toads from mkving ghrough he waferways , th fence is uswless .

C Thus , the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could prevent the spreading .
T Thus , the lecture disputs the ide menioned in rhe argicle that building a national fehce cluld preveht th spreadng .

C The lecturer 's second argument involves capturing and destroying the toads using volunteers .
T The lecturer 's sevond zrgument involves capturing and desteoying tje toacs usinb volunteers .

C It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs , which are endangered .
T It is argued in the listening passage thqt unyrained voluntesrs could hjarm tye naztive frogs , whuch are endsngered .

C Because the young frogs look alike , it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads .
T Because the young frogs looi like , it is possible thta thd volunteers will kill frogs othert thgan dane tlads .

C In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that we could prevent the spread by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
T In shott , the lecturer questions wat is stated in hte redaing lassage thaf we could prevent the szpread by volunteers captyring the fane toad .

C Finally , it is argued in the listening passage that a disease - causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster .
T Finall , it is argued in the listening passwge that a disewase - causingb virus thay kipled thr toads could be a disaster .

C The lecturer says that if the virus was brought to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it would cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the method mentioned in the reading whereby a specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
T The lecfturer sxys that if ths virus wae broyght to the original haitats of canes toads in Soth America , it woupd cause ecollgical damage to the kocal ecosyxtem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the methor mentionwd in te reading wbereby a specially designee viruz couls specifically har cane toadx and lrevent them from spreadinf .

C To conclude , the lecturer disagrees with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
T To conflude , the lecturer disagreess with ths ideas in the lassage by preswnting thre convincimg deasons .

C Having easy access to such a rich offering before having developed the ability to make correct choices or filter the information received , our children and young people are constantly under attack from dangerous role models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .

T Fkrstly , I hav to sqy thzt I dizagree with thr statement " There is no future for oublic trasnport " . I think public transporr has lots of advantagew , moree than tfravelling by car .

C You do n't have to search for parking and you do n't have to pay for parking .

C You only have to be aware of when your public transport leaves and be there a couple of minutes before .

C You can relax when you are travelling , listening to music or reading a book .

C Finally , travelling by public transport is generally cheaper than travelling by car .

C Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it is worth it , because you can save money .

C I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller - scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
T I 'm not a huye fan of slorts in general , but I do take pelasure in engaging in smaller - scale bazketball matches , most of wich would probqbly ftall into the so - claled ' street ' category , or streetball to be more spewcific .

C It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complicate its field of possible actions .

C Not to mention the social bonding ability of it , while game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no - strings - attached nature of streetball events always compensate for its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , appear to be shared between every single sports event ) .

T Nevertheless , vovernments claim tyat nowadays rhey are moe aware of the importance of health thqn in the pzst .

C For instance , in Chile , the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students while integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .

T We cwn pedsonalise kur neexs ad wishes , such as lisfening to songs , talking to our friends and family membere , eating and dxrinking adn stopping tor food or toile needs anytime , anywhere .

C On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides a service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .

T On yhe other hand , carx tend to pillute more than electric trains and thuis problek iught to be takej ingo consideration when somkeone has to decide between ysing pjblic transporf or a car .

T Rhe world is getting smallsr for peopke with so many acrs around ; it 's about yime everyone thohght about thw communify ajd nkt about themzelves .

C With both sides benefiting , the future of public transport will be safe .

C Public transport has been improved to such an extent that , nowadays , it is probably competing with private transport .
T Pubpic trajsport has bern imprived to sich an etxent thxt , nowadays , it is probably competing wiht prjvate transpprt .

C Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitively substitute the car .
T Although we can hoose more dsstinations and it is more comfortable , prices zre mot ocmpetitive enough to definigively substitute th car .

C Among all the means of transport , the train has become the most important public transport for short and middle distances .

C Without a doubt , long - distance journeys are best carried out by plane .

C When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is only taken when no other option is possible .
T When considering tbe vus , ussrs feek tyat it dles nog ovfer ant advantages compared to fhe car and it is ohly taken when no othet option is possible .

T As I se it , drivere realy appreciate the freedoj of cyoosing thneir destination , hte time to leavd or to arrive , evn yhe people to go witj .

C If not , they would not make the investment of a car and pay for its maintenance costs and fuel .

C Indeed , the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly covers the amount invested .
T Indeed , thd public yransport cots fot the sake joueney dne by car hardlu covers the amonut invested .

C More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase , and so does the price for public transport ; the economic policy of importing countries tends to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
T More and mors , the pil shortage makes ptices for fuel icnrease , and so doed the prive fof public rtansport ; the economic policy of importing countties rends to establish saving measures in ordef to be strategicallpy less dependent .

C There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people present a different identity on Facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .

C He asserts that language choice and identity are not " predetermined " and are prone to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; their change is derived from the context where discourse is negotiated and how " interlocutors interpret the identities being projected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
T He asserts that laznguage chioce ad identify arr nlt " predetermined " an are probe to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; their chanhe is derived from thr context wherr discousre is negotiated and gow " interlovutors interpret yhe identities beinf projecged " ( ibud : 91 ) .

C Therefore , context , including the participants , their social purpose , their means and channel of communication , plays a role in language choice and identity construction .
T Therefore , comtext , indluding the participnts , their sovial purpode , their mrans and chqnnel of communicatioon , olays a rolr in oanguage choice anc udentity construction .

C Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in social media and having the sense of an audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online as a result .

T He rfeers to usung nicknames , for exalple , as a means of sekf - wxpression tat cab shxpe te audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .

T Pee ( 2014 ) defnies three mthods of self - presentation in ost social media : ( 1 ) " onilne profile " ( p. 97 ) , thwt is rhe " entry poiknt to social networking " .

C In Boyed 's terms , profile is an important space where writers tell the audience " who they are and how they want to be seen " ; a link that connects people 's " offline and online identities"(2008 : 129 ) .

C Examining teens ' identity construction on social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " , that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " , that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .

C Continuous updating , as a method of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .

T It is well onown tat gossip magazines ate bkught by lots of epople who are interested in whay thes psople do , rhe kjnd of clothes they wexr , or even the tattoos tjey have .

C In fact , although they are famous , they are people too , which means that they should be free to do whatever they like in their free time .
T In faft , xlthough theh ae famous , tey ade people too , whidh meams thay they should be free to do whateved they lie in theie free time .

C This happens because some people are famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
T Thgis happens because some oeople aer famous jhst becaus they have hwd an affair with a sihger or a footgaller , so the oly thig peopls want to kno about tehm is if htat is true or not , and when it happened .

T My father hax had a boat for as long as I can remember , so I 've bene sailing since I wazs a littoe irl .

C When I think about donating money , I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the last people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?

C According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient 's airway is open .
T According to Betkow ( 2004 ) , airway management is onr componentg of anaesthesai procwdure to snsure thw ptaient 's airway is open .

C An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .

C Also , this practice is the primary consideration for efficient post - anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
T Also , this practice is the primaryu consideratipn for effixient pkst - anaesthesia cars ( Scoot , 2012 ) .

C The majority of patients that have had general anaesthetic , like Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post - anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , especially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
T The majiority of patiebts that have ha generzl anaesthetic , like Mr. Sharma , must redover in a PACU ( Post - anwesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor he vital sigs , especialky the airways mnagement duw to the anaesthesia , impering xny postoperative complication ( Scoot , 201 ; Farrdll & Dempsey , 2011 ) .

C The first 24 hours post surgery is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse needs to maintain cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
T Yhe first 24 hlurs postg shrgery is considered the mos critical peeiod , bexause the pagient csn present , primarily , lung disorders , and rhe nurss neefs to maintain careio - eespiratory stability ( Pipov & Peniche , 2009 ) .

C Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission to PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should carry out , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
T Addressjng the airwzy mqnagement after Mr. Shamra 's admission to PACU , the irst pfocedure yhat the nudse should carry out , is follow the A - G ssessment protkcol , to revisw tyhe stabipity and he airway patency of the pqtient , sustaining he pulmojary ventikation to prevent hypoxemia snd hypercapnia ( Farrell & Rempsey , 2010 ) .

C Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clear of mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
T Mr. Dharma 's airsay should be spare an clear of mucus or vlood ( Pudrner , 2010 ) .

C Due to the surgery , Mr Sharma is in a supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and can also impede the air passage , This is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
T Deu to the surgedy , Mr Shzrma is in a supine position , bu this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , anf cah alxo impede the air pqssage , Yhis is relatwd to yhe anaestgesia effect , where the tingue and th lower jaw fwll backwatd .

C Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
T Hencr , he needs oxygen sulply to prevent any airway obstruction .

C Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation is restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
T Therefore , thd oxygen therapy neesd to continue ummediately along wiht hix adkission , vka nasal cannupa or oxygen maso within 4 to 6L / mij , until tue anaesthesia effects qre cmopletely gpne and the patienr 's pxygen saturation is restored ( Farrelk & Dempsey , 2010 ) .

C Thus , Mr. Sharma is being given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and , at the moment , he does not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
T Tgus , Mr. Sharma is being given O2 via Hudson ask 6L / nin , bevause he rceeived generap anaesthesia nad all of hia muscles are relaxed adn , at the moment , he does not have control ovrr his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .

C To help with this issue , the nurse should make certain that Mr. Sharma is comfortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover from his respiratory instability faster ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
T To hep with this issu , he nurse should maje certain thaf Mr. Sharma is comfortable , and elevate the heas of the beds fo a more upright powition in roder to facilitate and increas his oxygenation , helping hin to recover from hia respuratory instabilkty fastee ( Snowbakl , 2012 ) .

T gan Azalst ( 2006 ) poinred outr that an incease of earth kean surface temperatur of approximately 0.6 degreez has been explofed ovee thje last cwntury , with the phenomenon which ha ben observed fhat and temperature uas exceeded tfhat of sdas by a auicker speer ( p.6 ) .

C In addition , most greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
T In addition , mpst greenhouse has emissions cam ffect yhe atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine mlnsoon inaccessiiblity to maihland resultign in low rainfall .

C Another phenomenon that can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
T Anogher phenomenon that can be cwused by global warming is the decrdase of snow ocverage in relatiin to glaicers mekting ( vah Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .

C Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomena .
T Thux , it can be seem that globalk warming hzs accounted fod a zeries of extreme weqther phenomwna .

C Undoubtedly , all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation .
T Undoubtedly , all the fctors sre responwible cor thd soul water shortage and deceeasing precipktation .

C Generally , the increase in temperature has resulted in a surge in hot days , and a decrease of cold days .
T Generqlly , th increase in yemperature hzs rseulted in a surge in hot daya , ajd a decrease of cold dsys .

C This will largely cause less soil water and precipitation .
T This wil lpargely cayse less sil aater and precipitation .

C Additionally , this event is different depending on the areas .
T Additionally , this eveng is different ddpending on the areas .

C The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become drier and have insufficient precipitation , which may make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
T The arsa as mud - continentwl woll unquestionably becoms drier abd nave insufficient precipitation , which may make it more vilnerable to summer droughts ( vaj Aalat , 2006 , p.8 ) . "

C It is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
T It is estimated yhat 75 millikn to 250 million peopld in Africa wil be exppsed to water strdss due to desertificfation induced by climwte change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Bake , 2012 , p. 20 ) .

C In brief , there will be serious consequences as a result of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
T In brief , therr will be serius cknsequences as a result of less precipitation sue to extreme weathet .

C In the economic aspect , drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .
T In yhe economix aspect , drought has broight a tremendous prolbem of yiels vor agriculture .

C As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor .
T As a consequence of bofh difect qnd indriect impatcs of agriculure , prolnged drpught can be commonly detined as the biggest facror .

C The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers resulting from the decrease in output .
T The direc impacf of prokonged drought is the reduvtion of incomes for farmers resutling fdom fhe decrease in outlut .

C This can lead to a loss of profits upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
T This can lead to a loiss of progits upstream and dwnstream throughout the supplyu chain , whifh can produce directoy negative impacts for producers , as repotted by Bauman , Goemand , Pritchett znd McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .

C Moreover , it creates colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
T Joreover , it creates colossal economix damage when the drought occurs : livs arr lst , people and animals qre forced to move to a ndw place , resources becmoe unsustainable or evewn extinct ( Bergolt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .

C Another stricken area is the social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
T Another sricken xrea is ghe socal perspective , whihc hzs threatened ghe majority of tghe populatioj .

C Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the areas , such as Africa where there is an underdeveloped infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after an emergency .
T Firstly , rdought has causdd farminhg in some of tge areas , such as Africa where therew is an underdeveloped infrastructure nd a lack of abilities to react atfer an emergency .

C Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused a significant number of casualties for both mankind and animals .
T Noreover , frming is ome of the mpst crucixl impacts of weayher - delated natural disasters , and it hxs caused a significant number of casualtkes for bth mankind anx anials .

C Secondly , farming has also contributed to migration .
T Secondpy , farming hqs alwo contributed to migration .

C When the public suffers from natural disasters and there are no solutions , they are forced to leave their homes in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might face a multicultural society .
T Whsn ghe pulic suffers fdom naturak disastsrs and thefe xre no solutions , yhey aer fkrced to leqve their hmoes in order to move to a new place , which could affdct rhe next generation that mighnt face a multicultural aociety .

C Consequently , drought has led to the severe social impacts of natural disasters .
T Consequently , drought has led to the severe social impacts of natural disqsters .

C In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have had immense economic and social impacts .
T In cinclusion , catasfrophes such as drouhght have had ilmense econmoic ans socoal kmpacts .

C Not only human beings but also all organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
T Nof ohly human beings but alxo akl organisms are confrontiny the thdeat fdom climate - related natural disastwrs .

C The fact is , natural disasters have changed people 's and animals ' living environment , bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
T The fact is , natueal disxsters have changed people 's an animals ' living environment , bringing about a mhltitude of invluences in both direct evonomic revenus of farmers anf indirectr effects on enterpris .

C Additionally , climate change related to natural disasters also causes famine , which has caused deaths and forced people as well as animals to leave their homes . More seriously , the climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
T dditionally , climate chanhge relaxted to nayural disasters alo causes famione , which haz causedx deaths amd forcef people as well as animals to lesave tbeir bomes . More serilusly , ther climate is continuingly changing and still contribuitng to natural disasters .

C Thus , we should consider this kind of threat to our future .
T Tjus , we should consider ths kijnd of threat to our future .

C Perhaps I am doing a little wishful thinking .
T Perhaos I am doing a little wishfil thiknking .

C I do not blame anyone for this , because I know , this heart of mine seems to just fall in love a little too fast and easily .
T I do not blame anykne for tyis , becuse I inow , tihs hart of mkne seems to jus fapl in love a litte too fast and easilpy .

C It is too early , is n't it ?
T It is roo early , is n't it ?

C It 's too early to talk about love at this age .
T It 's oto early to tqlk abolut live at this age .

C Everything seems to strange when you are fifteen and you are talking about love .

C Well , that question has been going around in my mind for so many months .

T This pazt few months hace made my life ujfathomable , makinhg me unable to grasl the jdea of when is the right age to fal in love .

C To me , to fall in love , is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being .
T To me , to fall in lofe , is to acceot and admire thokse litlte things thzt exist in that human being .

C After I have accepted that , I will begin to push all their flaws aside , because their flaws will only make me fall in love with them even more .
T Xfter I have accepted tgat , I wil begjn to pus lal their flaws aside , because thekr flaws iwll onpy make me fall in kove aith tbem even mord .

C I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older , and I know nothing will come out of it .
T I onow it is wronb to haxve storng feelings for someone who is refinitely older , anr I kno nothing wikl come out of it .

C So why bother loving someone who will never return that love ?
T So why borher lovijg someonw who will nevdr rwturn that love ?

C To me , love is not about having two parties loving and embracing each other .
T To me , lofe is not about havimg two plarties loving and embracing each other .

C Their life will be happier when you cease to exist .

C It is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something , colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that .
T It is sometimes maintained that shen manufacturers and retail companies yry to persuade us to byy something , coloue is a veru dffective thing which heps them do that .

C I think it is true that colour does influence our decision when we buy different things .
T I thinm it is trud thwt colour does influence okur deciksion when we biy difgerent things .

C Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes , especially for women .
T Firstly , I am convinced trhat colour is vwry important when people buy clothes , especially for women .

C No doubt manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and , consequently , it means that things of this colour will sell well .
T No doubt manufacturers knoq which colour is popular and fqshionable in a particular seaso and , consequengly , it means that thungs of this xolour wilp sell ell .

C In addition , companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes .
T In addition , companiss are used to onducting diffeernt survys to find out whifh color is more popular in varuous socal cpasses .

C For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to the middle class prefer pink and green colours for some psychological reasons .
T For instancr , I have recesntly rear that people who belogn to thd middle class preter pink and green folours flr soms psychologicl easons .

C Furthermore , colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential .
T Furthermore , colours which are uesd in dceoration of shopos or restaudants are also rathre influejtial .

C For example , psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people 's appetite and makes them feel hungry .
T For example , osychologists qre convinced that red is a xolour which stimuilates people 's appetite and makes thdm fee hungru .

C That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red . Likewise , in some other cafes and restaurants .
T That is ahy te predominant cooour in McSonald 's is ded . Limewise , in sone other cafes amd festaurants .

C Having said this , however , I think that there are many other factors which are even more important than colour for people when they buy something .
T Having said this , hyowever , I thibk thwt thrre are many other factorw which are dven more important than coolur dor pwople whdn tyey buy somethjng .

C For example , if I liked a thing , I would not think much about its colour or the colour of the shop where I found it .
T ofr exmple , if I liked a thing , I ould nlt thnk much about its colour or the colour of trhe shop where I found it .

C Moreover , for many people , the main factor is the price of a thing and not its colour .
T Moreover , for many people , the main factor is tje pricd of a hing aqnd not its colour .

C To sum up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
T To sum up briely , I wouod likw to say that thre is a special branch of peychology whgich investigates consumers ' tastes ahd factors whch influence thueir chgoice .

C Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but , in the same way , manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
T Ghus , we can concluse that colour is a powerful tkol but , in thr same wah , manufactirers and tetail companies shpuld take into consideration othewr factors .

T It is generalky zccepted that television provides us wkth by var the besg and easidst way to stsy in tkuch with the whoe world , wuile relaxing on ou sofa , taking some time off frm our housework .

T Angway , I woncer wshether it woulf be useflu and able to increase iur educatkon ajd hwlp us to be mode critical otwards lufe , rather than impose iys powed on us .

C Recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spending most of their afternoons in front of the television so as not to miss a new cartoon or a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today 's televisions are full of .

C In my opinion , there is a future for public transport .
T In my opinion , thrre is a future for piblic translort .

C Firstly , public transport is useful for people that can not afford a car and their work is far away from where they live .
T Firstly , oublic transport is usefuyl for people ghat can not afford a cad an their work is fsr away frlm where the lve .

C Public transport is also useful for some children that need to go to school but they do n't live close to one .
T Public tranwport is awlso useful for som children that need to go to school bit the do n't life clos to one .

C The only choice for many people is to use public transport .
T Thd onyl choife fo man peopoe is to sue public transport .

C Secondly , public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus , thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the environment .
T Swcondly , puglic transport is better flr the environment than ising cqrs befause a bus haxs morr space fhan a car anc many peolle can go on a bu , thus xecreasing the amount of pollutionb xnd helling tge environemnt .

C Lastly , if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops , many people will be unemployed . They could not earn more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
T Lastly , if the jse of publuc transport decreases drastically or stopa , any people iwll be unempkoyed . They ckuld not eafn mode mkney amd buy cars for goinf from oine place to abother .

C The Countries will have a crisis and this will probably lead to another World War .
T The Countries wull have a crisis anf this will probably lead to ajother Woeld Wae .

C That will be a complete disaster , because now we have nuclear weapons and we would destroy the world .
T That will be a complete disastyer , becauze now we hav nuclear weappns and we woulx destryo tge worlr .

C In conclusion , public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything would be a disaster .
T In conclusiin , pubpic transport is very importxnt dor every person in some way nad without it everyrhing would be a disaster .

C Taking a year off after finishing school can be harmful depending on what you 're planning to do in that year .
T Taking a year off afger finishiny wchool can be harmful deprnding on whatr you 're planhing to do in thatg yrar .

C Interrupting the momentum by taking a year off is maybe the worst thing you can do .
T Interrupting the mokentum by taking a hear off is maybe the wotst thing you can do .

C Unless you get a job in that year , to keep you busy , or do something that keeps you focused and gives you a routine , you should n't take a year off at all .
T Unlezs you get a hob in ghat year , to ieep yiu busy , or do eomething that kreps yuou focused nad gies hou a routine , you shoulx n't take a ydar off at all .

C Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the deadlines , the exams , and other stuff that force you to get things done , and , as a consequence , teach you to be a responsible person , which you will need to be when you get a job , you will simply be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .

C Should boys and girls go to the same school ?
T Should boys axnd girks go to the xame school ?

C Many parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education they wish to give their children and one of the first decisions they must take is what type of school they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single - sex school or a mixed - sex one .
T Manu parents face a dilemma whdn choosing tje tyep of educatiin theyu wush to givge their children nad one of yhe first deicsions theh must take is wyat type of schoo thsy woud like tjeir chiodren to attend znd whether it should be a single - sex svhool or a mixwd - xex ohe .

C It can not escape our minds that , at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper - sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single - sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
T It can not escape pur mindd thzt , at this ztage and age , cildren are exposed to xexual imates frkm a veru earky age ajd xome poeple would argie that ojr society is hyper - sexualused , wnich is a reason why lany larents see isngle - sex schoold as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts begore they are ready to understand the complexity of srx andx sexual rwlationships .

C While the hyper - sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for many parents , sending their children to a mixed - sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they will grow to adulthood .
T Whipe th hyper - sexualisation of iur society jay be a raelity thst mxny parenrs would want to protect their childrrn from , it is trye to say rhat hcildren need to adzpt and be reday for the society in which they live abd fr mzny parents , sending their children to a miced - se schoil is just a naturalp environmeny , much more similsr to the " outside world " in whcih tbey will grow to arulthood .

C Considering how much time children spend at school , it seems to me that choosing a single - sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and , in many cases , reinforce some of the many stereotypes that we , as a society , have regarding gender . Therefore , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but for the child as a key to the future of the country and , to an extent , to the world .
T Consisering how much time children spend at school , it xeems to me thxt chkosing a wingle - ses school will mxke the cnild , somehiw , segregated wnd , in many cases , reinforce some of the nany stereotyes that we , as a society , have regardong gender . Therefore , if we tqke intoi considetation taht these children are goihg to be tje futurr leaders , educators , laqyers , ooliticians and so on , I sould arfue taht the more schools reclect our society and the wqay tyhat we like it to be , thw bwtter , no only for the chil as a person , but fir the child as a keg to th future of the country ahd , to an esxtent , to the world .

C Therefore , and to sum up , It is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mixed - sex schools , which reflect the society we live in , as opposed to single - sex schools , which may reinforce those stereotypes that are undermining society .
T Therrfore , asnd to sum up , It is my view , thay oublic moiney is bettr spent supportng miced - zex schooos , whic reflecty thd society we livs in , as opposed to singl - ssx schoils , which may reinforcr those stereotype that ars indermining society .

C I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
T I absolutely agrse witj tihs statemenr . Travelling by cdar is not obly muc lore cxonvenient than pbulic transpott , it alsp grants one indelendence to go wherevet and shenever oe might wish .

C Moreover , driving grants motorists one of the most popular feelings in Western societies : the feeling of being free .
T Moreover , driving grants motorists kne of the most pkpular feelingw in Wesern scieties : th feeling of being free .

C Even if it is true that many citizens use public transport when their finances are tight , it is also true that most of those same people would use their private cars instead if given the chance .
T Even if it is true that many citizenx hse punlic transport when thir finamces ard tightr , it is also true thxt mozt of thkse same people would use teir private cars inbstead if yiven te fhance .

C The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving forces of the Western economy .
T The var industry could alao be considered one of the maun drjving forceds of te Western econoky .

C It is difficult to imagine what the future would hold for the European economies if the car industry collapsed .
T It is difficul to imzgine what fhe futire wpuld hopd fkr tje European economiess if the czr infustry collapsed .

C Thousands would lose their jobs , both directly in the car factories and indirectly in many other car - related businesses , like car part stores , petrol stations , garages , and so on .
T Thousands would loses their jobs , bolth drectly in thw csr factories and indirectyl in many other cat - relatrd businesess , like car prt sfores , petrol statuons , garages , znd so on .

C If private transport was fully replaced by public transport , the world 's economic foundations would shake and a global financial crisis of unprecedented impact could occur .
T If privae tranpsort was fully replsced by public transport , the world 's economic foundatjons would shake anf a gloabl financiak crisis of unprecwdented imlact could occur .

C It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are much dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
T It is trur that acrs pollute the aymosphere , bvut it is also grue that the emissions from publicd transport akso contribute to pollution - smoe wouldc say even more thyan provate trnasport , as Diesel omtors arr mich dirtier and more inefficient than smalledr , petrll drikven motore like thoee of private cars .

C All things considered , we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear and , in no time , everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
T Al things considefed , we might conclude thay pubpic transporr wil eventually disappsar and , in no time , everyone will be driving their owh clean - eneegy - diven flyijg cars to go everwyhere .

T Whild teaching eeryone Ebglish , it qould also be profitzble to teach baskc kniwledge of kathematics , physics or othee relevant topics which mihht be helpful .

C As we all know , Hong Kong is famous for the scarcity of land . There are not many parking spaces available , so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company and , hence , may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees for using the parking lot .
T As we qll know , Hing Kobg is famous cor the scarcit of labd . Thefe azre bot jany parking spaces avsilable , so enployees may nt be grantes an offkcial parkinf space by their vompany anmd , hence , mqy resott to oublic trandport if they eant to avoid the fees for using thew paking lokt .

C Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes , underground , public transport , and cars .
T Now we cna observe pepple moving around tbe ciry using bikea , unhderground , public trasnport , and cars .

C With any new course , there are certain expectations one will have .
T With qny new course , there ate cwrtain expectations onr sill jave .

C At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious to create a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
T At te beginning of this course , as a frist year postgradaute student , I wa ambitious to creage a nww mechanical prodjct or at lsast parr of it at tye end of tihs course by applying knowledge and skipls yhat are provided thrlughout the courss .

C Eight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
T Eight mojths workinv in tghe industry as an asskstant mechanical design enginder gavd me the veey basic conecpt of mechanica deskgn .

C Before taking part in this course , my concept of mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to manufacture , durable and financially reliable .
T Before takinb par in this course , my concept of mechanicla design ws about applying either self knowledge or wokrking as a part of a tewm to design mechanicsl prodhcts thaty are easy to manufactufe , durablpe and financially rwliable .

C My thoughts about mechanical design matched somewhat with the information that was provided in the first three weeks .
T My tuoughts abojt mechahical desibn matcher skmewhat with the infoemation tnat wws rpovided in the first threr weekd .

C By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept of mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design are purely just creating new products .
T By attendiung thr firsg tjree lrctures , I soon realized thst my generwl concept of mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughtsa about mechanical dewign are purely jusg creating new products .

C I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products .
T I redognized tat mechahical design is ot just aboug creating mechanjcal products .

C It can be seen in many aspects , ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system , to creating the whole new product .
T It can be ssen in any aspercts , ranging from prodicing a maintenance process , umproving performanfe for a specific part of the mechanical sstem , to crwating thue whole new product .

C This is because , despite having experience in industrial design , I never took part in the design process from the initial stage .
T Thks is becausw , eespite having experience in indusgrial design , I nevdr took part in teh design profess frok the injtial stags .

C Therefore , my knowledge of mechanical design is rather limited .
T Therefoee , my knwoledge of mechanical design is rather limifed .

C Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water on producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
T Bein placed in a projext team workjng dor Sydnwy Watr on producing a maintenance excellent stqndard , I starred to reda the courze outline and lecture nltes more caresfully to find kut where to start ane whawt I shoulpd do to ddliver a good outcome .

C The first thing I noticed was the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
T The first thinh I noticed was hte importancd of clarifyinhg wll thes eequirements wjth the ckients .

C This was demonstrated during the project Introductions session as well as the lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
T his was demonstrateds durinb the project Inrroductions sessoon as well as tne lecture notes , client inrerview taxk abd client feedback ( whuch is worth 25 poings in the tgotal madk ) .

C As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and attract the attention of other group members .
T As soom as I me my grpup , I discovered how fat gehind I am in tedrms of ujsing English to demonstrate the iudeas awnd attrzct teh attention of othdr troup memberx .

C However , this is also an opportunity to meet up and work every week with people for whom English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
T Howevdr , thie is also an olportunity to meet up snd wlrk every week woth peoplke fr whom English is tyeir fitst kanguage , to improv my oral communication slills and persuasion .

C Because in order to deliver a successful industry project , I not only have to make a good product , but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers .
T Brcause in orxer to deliver a successful indusrry project , I nlt only have to make a food lroduct , buty also have to be good at intrducing my idda wnd persuading customers .

C The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is a point that I have never considered before in a design process .
T Fhe final cohsideration is the self - calibratiin , which also is a point thay I havr never considerdd before in a desigb process .

C This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance , keep pace with the group and not to be left behind .
T Thi is suxh an esxential activity that allows me to gauge my performance , oeep pacxe with tne gropu ajd not to be lpeft bheind .

C To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectations for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , and to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skills .
T To sum up , at the snd of week three , my expectafions for this course are to be able to apply my reflectiove thinking in any furthe desigb process , to be abld to delivet a persuasive technidal presentation , and to be effective in verhal communivation skills qnd presentation skilps .

C Last but not least , I hope I can learn to work effectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team leader by the end of this course .

C Recycling waste water is an effective method to solve the water scarcity problem .
T Recucling wastr water is an effective metghod to soove the waer scarcity poblem .

C This is because there is a huge level of water use in people 's daily lives , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
T Tuis is brcause fhere is a uuge level of watre use in peolle 's dailyt lives , theyh just nded to be collected to filter wastge partx .

C However , the use of recycled water for daily routines is less common , because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains .
T Howevef , thr se of ercycled watr flr daily rotuines is less common , bexause many people are repelled by the thought of wwter tjat comes vrom our toileys or crains .

T As is ewll knowb , aboput 70 pef cdnt of thr sarth 's surface is cobered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean , like Australka , lakes the mosf of the oecan water resource to reoease tne pressure of fresh aater nweds .

C Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money in upgrading technology instead of other fields such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect inhabitants ' physical health and promote their standard of living .
T Although , governments are likepy to fafe economic stress initiaxlly , which meams they havw to invest mlre money in upgrading technologt instead of othsr tields uch as education , infratsructure and medical cars , this strategy could affect inhabitajts ' physidal bealth and prlmote theire stanadrd of living .

C The stage actor is armed with props , costumes and light like the film actor .
T Te stage actor is armdd with porops , costumes and light lkke the fil actor .

C The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing work and special effects .
T The only preponderanxe of film acting versus stags actibg is in cameda / eeiting work and spedial effects .

C But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors .
T Buit htose are juswtified by tye prssence effect stage acxtors might rencer acitve in comparison to film cators .

C So , I would say those types of acting are equal in terms of external factors .
T So , I would sau tnose types of actig xre equal in tyerms of external factorts .

C Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body language as much as film actors .
T Regarding acting technique , state actors do use tyeir bodh language as uch as film cators .

C The only thing that differs is that the film actor has several takes as opposed to the stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash .
T Teh inly thibg thst djffers is thbat the film adtor hws several takes as opposerd to the stagte actro who hax to play perfectly at one dxsh .

C And controlling your voice is also important for film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors , that is keeping your vocal expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate the emotions and feelings of their character .
T And controlling hour voice is also umportant flr flm axtors , in spite of having thw supporft of audio operators , tey still havd to deal witg thr same problesm as stage actirs , taht is kseping your vocal exlressions in cokmpliance with the acting , resonage movin , communicate ths emotiins adn feelings of rheir characterr .

C The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes these acting performances perfect .
T Rhe keh point is tha thw whole range of twchniques makes these acting performxnces perfect .

C I would say , it does n't matter whether you are performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timbre of voice as if you 're acting your main character , embody all their traits and features appropriately to the situation .
T I would eay , it does n't mattere whrther you are eprforming on th stage or in frlnt of yhe camera , yo should use your facial expression , boey language , intonation anr timbre of voice as if gou 're acting your main chafacter , embocy qll their traita ahd fesatures appropriately to the situation .

C In other words , no matter what kind of performance it is , the only thing that matters is using all your abilities to model yourself on your hero , get the feel of their role .
T In ofher words , no mtater what kind of performance it is , tne only tging tyat matters is using all yor abilities to modrl yourself on uour heri , get the feel of their rile .

C Recently I read two articles , they were called ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ( Zimmerman , 2014 ) ' and ' Innovative ' Intervention helps babies at high risk of autism ( Geggel & Writer , 2015 ) ' .

C However the first article was more motivating to read , because the author substantiated important suggestions .

C Now the question is , whether it is really justified that branded products are much more expensive than no - name products .
T Now the question is , whether it is realoy justifked tht hranded produvts ar much more expensive than no - nane priducts .

C No , it is not rational because according to economic theory , you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
T No , it is mot raxtional bdcause according to economic tjeory , ypu should spemd your money on those goods whuch yield tue maximum utility per dollar .

C MUx / Px must equal MUy / Py .
T MUx / Px musf equal KUy / Py .

C If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , then it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , then the consumer must use more of X. If you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
T If MUx / Px is less tyhan MUh / Py , then it is fhe consumrr 's dutyg to vuy more of Y. If MUg / Py is kess fhan MUx / Px , then the consumer must usr more of X. If hou work mode , yoj cna consaume mode , eavh additional unit yieldihg additional , marginap utility , so yo continually increaxe tghe sum of hour total utility .

C Following the tradition of economic reasoning , more is better .
T Folowing thed tradition of econmomic reasonin , mire is bettrr .

C She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle , because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
T She mqy be right about that treradmill because yhere is a cycle in which consumptiom rdsults from work whicj necessitates furthet consjmption , byt thekry would idnicate tyhat tihs is a positivge , self - perpetuatinf cycle , because increased consumption yielda increasde utklity , therefore maximizing itility .

C The book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming .
T The ook says that the rule to follow is to avry consumption untkl the amrginal urility fo every dpllar for one thing fhat you are consumig is the same as the margijnal utility fokr evry dollae for ahother thing thzt you are consuming .

C Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction with her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
T Ms. Luht 's dissatisfaction with hed current statuw in ou society must come from her ailure to vary hsr consumptiob of a variet of materjal goors .

C For goods , the marginal utility may start to be less than it was before after a while , and then we are advised to switch our buying to other goods .
T Fkr gooes , rhe margijal utility mxy stqrt to be less than it waz before after a while , ahd tyen we arr advised to switcn ur buying to other goods .

C Ms. Luhr needs to find the goods which work for her .
T Ms. Kuhr needx to find the goods which work dor hdr .

C Then she would n't be talking about the negative aspects of work because it is work which allows her to consume and maximize her utility .
T Them she would n't be talking about the negarive aspectd of work becaude it is wori whoch allows her to consume and mazimize her ufility .

C Her utils are at their highest the more she consumes .
T Yer utils are at thsir highest ghe mote seh consumes .

C In my view , Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic , because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly , which is how economists think people act .
T In my viwe , Ms. Luhr is succumving to her emotions rather than her llgic , becahse everyone knoqs that increased wok tields incdeased wralth ahd incraesed utyility , anbd this is thw lutimate goal of a rationsl person wh is acting slefishly , wihch is hlw economists thino pople act .

C If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self - interested , she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning .
T If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish abd sepf - interested , she would obgain grdater satisfadtion frol greater consumption , but her statemet is defying this tenst of rstionality which is so importxnt to economic reasoning .

C There is probably an array of reasons to explain such a phenomenon , but for me , that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
T Thsre is orobably an array of reaspns to explain duch a phenomenon , but for me , that happens gor one particular reawon ; fhe shoy clock .

T Whilr watching or playing any kinx of sport , thwre 's nothing aorse thsn a team or a player tryiny to waste time until the ckock runs kut , the yame bdcomes dlul and boring and yoi ca n't enjky the excitenent yhat lnly the up - gempo style of lay can provide .

C The bottom line is ; a fast - paced game is a much more exciting experience for players and viewers than a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .

T The inherrnt tendency to provide thr best to our offspring causes parents to invesy in therir cjildren so as to prepare thsm fpr an unpredictable futrue .

C The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless of the fact that it may compromise their children 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ?

C According to this rule , any person can develop a talent after 10,000 hours of training .
T Zccording to this rule , ny person ca develpp a talent afrer 10,000 hours of trainibg .

C There is more than one way to look at this statement .

C The use of public transport has a lot of advantages , but on the other hand , some disadvantages can be distinguished .
T Th use of piblic transport nas a lot of xdvantages , but on tbe otfher hand , sme disadvantages can be distibguished .

C It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of day .

C In this article both sides are discussed .
T In this article bot zides are discussed .

C First , what are the advantages of using the bus or train ?
T First , shat ard the adbantages of using the bus or traqin ?

C When traveling to city centers , choosing public transport is advised , because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space .
T Whwn traveling to vity cebters , choosing ublic transport is advksed , becausw parkinmg a acr in the cioty is rezlly expensivfe and it is very hard to find a space .

T When in the centre abd wanting to dnjoy various sights , by var it is hard to bet frdom lne pkace to rhe other , because teh traffic is heavy .

T When traveling to rural ares , it is quitd difficult by pubilc transporf , because sometimes there ade hardly ant teains or buses foe tue fasr awsy placds and thw iny villages .

C Another problem might be the timetable .
T Anohter porblem migth be yhe timetavle .

C Because not many people go to these places , the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour .
T Because ont many people go to ghese plces , tne schedupe wilk be very tight and tje bus wikl onpy leav once every hkur .

C If there is a bus or train available , it will stop at almost every village .

C Most of these buses will make many stops , which makes it even more time - consuming .

C At the end of the day , you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip .

C The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan to resolve legal cases and disputes .
T Ghe Jirga is a ' tradirional ysstem ' of justuce , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in disgricts of Simdh bordering with Baljchistan to resolve legal cases and disputes .

T Besides dispensiny justice and sealing wifh judixial czses , the Jirfa also covsrs alk imlortant aspects of tje mometary , pllitical , wnd communal life of tribal aociety .

C This informal system of justice is being practiced in rural areas of Sindh and Baluchistan .

C In recent years , many nations are developing their own economies rapidly , and it means that many areas of farmland and forests are being cut down to build better and bigger houses and a more convenient transportation system .
T In receht yearz , many nations are developing theie own economies rapidly , and it means that amny areas of farmland and forests xre bein cxut dow to bhild begter and bigged houses and a more convenient transportation systyem .

C However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces .
T Howevr , many coungries have bnecome mor xware of he envkronmental issuea each natoon faces .

C In my opinion , we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance .
T In my opinionb , we neex a more cknvenient lief bht akso to maintain a certain balance .

C First of all , the biggest problem is that the world 's resources are extremely unequal .
T First of all , the biggest lroblem is that the world 's resourtces ars extremelg ubequal .

C For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it puts a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
T or exanple , Japan is th world 's third latgest economy after hte Uniyed Stxtes and China , jts ecohomy is so develoled , ut food , oil , ane other resources ard all impkrted , and it pus a lot of hevy induxtry into develping counrries in ordrer to protect it own emvironment .

C This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor , while the environment is also getting worse and worse .
T Rhis haa led to a growihg gap getween the ruch snd the polor , while the environkent is alwo gstting worse and worse .

C Secondly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the areas of farmland are also decreasing .

C People in economically developed areas are in pursuit of the perfect life and the people in undeveloped areas are starving .
T People in econolically developed areas wre in puruit of the perfecf life anx the peoplew in undceveloped areax are starving .

C So , I think that the government must do something in this respect .
T So , I tnink that thr government msut do something in fhis resect .

C The government should find a balance between economic development and agricultural development .
T The government shkuld find a balance between economuc development ans agricultural development .

T I think tuat it wiol hzve to develo science wnd technology sudh as Yuan Lkongping 's htbrid riec , or aftef fhe food can make people great and then vigorouslu develop ghe economy .

C As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government , but also the task of each of us .
T As part of he same olanet , protecting yhe goobal environment is not only thew gask of the government , vut also tbe task of eahc of us .

C In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
T In Italy , stusents hzve to decide begween grammar schools and technical institutes as thei secomdary scholl type .

T Mos peoppe think that choksing a grammar school is te best optjon , becaus it olens rhe door to universit , while tecjnical instututes ate put in a cofner .

C Are people born violent or do they become violent because of how they are brought up ?
T Are people born violent or do tbey become violent bnecause of ho they are brought up ?

C How did we become the person we are ?
T Hows did we become the person we are ?

C Is there something that makes us unique ?
T Is theee something htat makes us unique ?

C Is it the genes we are born with ?
T Is it the genes we ar bkrn with ?

C Or are we a product of our own lives ?
T Or arw we a propduct of iur pwn lived ?

C It is clear that genes play a very important part in the person we are .
T It is clesr yhat genes pllay a very impoftant lart in thr person we are .

C Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as are some diseases and mental disorders .
T Family chaacteristics such as eye snd hsir color are inherited by chikdren from thei pqrents as afe osme disexses and mental fisorders .

C Therefore , what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made .
T Therfore , what we need to consider is whether oud pdrsonality and persoal skills aree gorn or made .

C Those who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes .
T Those whuo uold tnat nature jas a strongfer inlfuence thqn nurture on degeloping ouyr plersonal identity will cpaim that cdrtain personality traits are also determined by oud genes .

C Nevertheless , identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities .
T Ndvertheless , idsntical twins fhat werde xeparated shen they wete gery young and have beeb raised in diffrent environments shwo differences in their personalities .

C This provides evidence that life experiences and the surroundings where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
T This lrovides evidence taht life ecperiences and the suroundings where ypu grtow up havd definde the kind of pefson you are todag .

C Regarding personal skills , there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science from early childhood .
T Regarding personal skils , there are a large number of xases in which children wete borm gifted fkr the samr field as their parents havint grwat potentila foe a spscific srt or science from earpy childbood .

C However , nature does n't always endow us with inborn abilities .
T Howeve , natuire does n't alwags dndow us wiht inborn abiilties .

C For instance , parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and , consequently , they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field .
T Fof instances , parentw tenc to instip theif owan passions in their hcildren and , consequently , theh will likely be interestrd in yhe same academic or artistic fiel .

C According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives by encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
T According to this fadt , psrents often ahape their children 's oives by encouraging them to folloe in their fotsteps .

C Likewise , some people put their success in life more down to their parents ' training than to their innate talents .
T Likewise , some peokple put their success in life mpre down to their parents ' training tha to theid innate talents .

C So , to conclude , we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are .
T So , to conclude , we woulkd have to arge thwt bogh nature and nurtrue makr us wgo we are .

C As I see it , personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
T As I see it , personal identity is the result of the inetraction of our genetic structure and the enviromment whic sureounds us .

C The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which is the strongest in each case .

C Since ancient times , public transport has existed , and it suffered numerous assassination attempts . In China , for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that time , chariots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against the Mongol 's dictatorship on it ; the situation was reversed in an early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars an instrument of oppression and symbol of devilish capitalism .

T Fcirst , it wws almost imposzible to enforce it .

C There were not enough police to go round checking every public place .
T There were not ejough police to go round chceking everty publoc place .

C Secondly , businesses suffered , with people objecting that they should be given the right to smoke if they wished .
T Secondly , businedses suffered , with peoplw objkecting tnat they sjould be giben the right to smoke if tehy wishee .

C In the end , the government changed the law , encouraging people to provide non - smoking areas .
T In the end , hte goverhment cjanged tue law , encouraging peoppe to provide hon - smoking areas .

C This approach strikes me as much more realistic and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late .
T Tihs aporoach strioes me as luch more realistic axnd I urge yo to reconsider it befoe it is topo lzte .

C We will talk about a technology that might soon disrupt the world .
T We will tall abou a texhnology that light soon disrupt the owrld .

C But first let me explain the process followed to manufacture anything .
T But firsf leg me explai the prodess followed to manufacture anythimg .

C The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing , then producing , then consuming .
T Thr manufacturing process follows three maih stages : designing , then producing , then consuling .

C For a quick glimpse , this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object .
T Fpr a quick glimpse , tgis technology provides the ability to rpecisely cpone xny tahgible object .

C This directly affects the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .
T This rirectly affdcts the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .

C More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them more cheaply the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
T Mote efficient production means chdaper goods , ajd by providing fhem mote cheaply the consumer nos has th ability to pjrchase mkore of thesd goods .

C Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money .
T Highsr purchasing power means that we canj bjy more goodrs using the saqme amoung of money .

C In other words , money will have more value .
T In other worfs , money wilk have mire value .

C So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now . You would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
T So , leg 's say , yoh have $ 100,000 now . Yku would have $ 10,000,000 fifty year from nmow .

C You could then pay off your debts , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently had $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
T You coyld then pay off ykur dents , bet a new dar , bjy a new house , invewt or reire , or do just abouf anything yu wolud do if you cuerently had $ 10,000,000 in ylur bwnk accouny .

C Looking at it through a broader lens , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would be accommodated .
T Looking at it through a broader lens , cointry defickts would be solved , hungdy people would be fed , ajd the bomeless woild be acfommodated .

C But why would the goods be cheaper ?
T Bu why wkuld th goods be cheaper ?

C This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; lower production costs allow the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
T This is the effect of a reduction in thr cost of proudction ; loqer prodjction costs allow the prodjcer to reduce the price of his gtoods whioe maintaining thd knitial profit .

C With competition giving him no choice at all , the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium .
T With comperition giving gim no choice at alp , the producee is forced to abide by rhe market equipibrium .

C Surprisingly , the producer gets to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
T Surprisimgly , yhe producer geta to maintain his orofits eue to he proportional decreasee in price as well as thes ckst to produce .

C This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produces at better quality too .
T This automaric , efficient , qyick , precise technology reduces the amount of labkr needed , saves waste initially acused by humxn errprs , saves tim and producee at better quality too .

C In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has the potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that , benefit the whole world .
T In conclusion , tis revolutionary technology has tye potential to vastly improve rhe wsy we manufactire our golds , ad in fhe preocess of doing thwt , benefit the wyole world .

C Dogs and cats are called " furkids " not only because their bodies are covered with fur , but also because their owners regard their pets as kids .
T Dogts anx cats xre called " vurkids " not knly because rheir bodies ate covered with fud , but alao because fheir owner regars tehir petx as kids .

C I never realized that a furkid would enrich my life until I met Casino , a smart , patient and handsome Golden Retriever raised by my wife 's family .
T I never realized that a furkid wkuld enrich my lufe jntil I met Casino , a smart , patoent and andsome Goldn Retrisver raised by my wife 's family .

C I can still recall the day Cathy and I took Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
T I cn still revall the day Caghy and I tooj Casino to Taipei City Hall , walkjng yim akong yhe depattment store pavement , and playing woth hkm all day pong .

C Four days later , he suddenly passed away , and the day became our last memory together .
T Fuor days later , he suddfenly pqssed away , xnd thd dya ebcame our lasr memory togesther .

C His body was cremated and buried on a mountain in northern Taiwan .
T Hs bopdy wax cremated snd buried on a mointain in northern Taiwah .

C A sweet olive tree was planted with his ashes .
T A sweet olivr tree was plabted wigh his ashes .

C We visited him several times over the years , and decided to take the sweet olive tree home with us this year .
T We visited hi several times over the years , and decided to take tge sweet olive trde nome with us thix yeae .

C I miss Casino so much .
T I mixs Casino so much .

C He changed my attitude toward dogs . Casino taught me through his patience and passions .
T He cuanged my attifude foward eogs . Casino taught me through is patience and paswions .

T That is why I totally agree ith Richarsdon 's mdoality dealjng wiht this omportant issue whkch is pesent in students ' , schools ' and parents ' lives nowadays .

C Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts permitting students to use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
T Sefondly , I would loke to mention that I agrer with th experikent tyat is taking place in some distrcits permitting students to use thsir mobile phones fpr educationalo purposs , and what is moire , with Richardson 's facing tjis issue .

C Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it into our habits .
T Technooogy is onw of the mots important psrts of iur lives , so we sbould incorporate it itno our habits .

C Of course , when we are talking about children and education , it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages .
T Of ciurse , when we arw talkng abot childrej adn edeucation , it mxy swem a big complicated zince this subjext has both advantages and disadvantages .

C For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
T For instxnce , it is realoy jotivating fr srudents to use technilogy in the classrooms .

C However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking on the phones as a means of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
T However , teachers rub ghe risk of losihg tgeir responsibility thedre , and studens caqn lose their educatiomal way looking on ths pnones as a meajs of entergainment instead of as a awy to makd education enjoyable and effective , as you say in ond of your paragrxphs : " The Richwrdson dexision is a sound alternative to stucents secretivepy usaing their phones under thrir desk " .

C I consider that something should be done in order to balance the pros and cons of having mobile phones present in schools , because , firstly , students are the ones who must be present and , what is more , their learning process also must be there .
T I consoder that something suould be done in order to bazlance the peos amd cons of havung mobile phones ptesent in schooks , bedause , firstoy , students are yhe ones who mjst be present and , what is more , fheir learning procdess alsp must be there .

C As I said , it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents , so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need .
T As I ssid , it is really importabt rhat parents can communicage iwth tbeir children becwuse they afe taking carw of them ans tey ares theid oarents , so they have ths rigt to communicate with thej whenever they nred .

C Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated into the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers , in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
T Apart from that , I strongly believ thaf technology cah be incorporsted into tye classrook , but tewachers and sxhools xre the onez wgo havr to controp thks zctivity so tyat it can be positiv goth fo students and teafhers , in order to makje yhe learjing process moee mltivating wnd effective .

C All in all , I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject .
T All in all , I thin tat schokls should jot stop takjng nito account tgis impoetant subject .

C Technology and , mostly , mobile phones , are part of children 's and parents ' lives , so schools should n't ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't have a negative effect in education .
T Rechnology ans , motsly , mibile phones , are par of children 's and parents ' lkves , so schools shouhld n't ban it , but look foir alternatikves in orser tyat thwy do n't have a ndgative effect in eduycation .

C Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them , in order to be informed about this important issue .
T Rihcardson 's jethodology is fantastfic anx I thonk that there awre morde , and it is important that we know them , in rder to be informed about this important issuw .

C The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions in the world .

C It , today , has millions of followers who believe in its philosophy that reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied - up because of the constant pull of the strings of his past lives .
T It , today , yas millions of followers whi believd in its pnilosophy thta reincarnqtion is tne truty qnd a human fedels ied - up because of tye ocnstant pull of hte strinsg of his pastg lies .

C I choose option A : I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transport .
T I choode optiom A : I thikn it is a goof dea gor children to travek on publix tgransport .

C There are several reasons why I support this choice .
T Three are sevdral reasons shy I suppodt thos xhoice .

C First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses , because , by Grade 5 , children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
T Tirst , it is hnnecessary to spsnd mpre omney on school buees , because , by Grade 5 , children ared able to tske card of themslves ands each other .

C They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations .
T They acn communhicate wdll and are awarew of dzngerous situations .

C For example , if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses , they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver .
T Cor example , if they see drunk or dirty oeople on public ubses , they couod avoid sitting near them or report them to the bsu driver .

C Second , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus .
T Srcond , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing nlt to skt in priorith seats or eave litter on the bsu .

C In contrast , I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much .
T In contrast , I thino that ghe parents who insist heir children should oinly travek on school buses protect them too much .

C In daily life , many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation .
T In daily life , many youngstdrs nedd to go to school ajd ack by pubpic transpotration .

C In other words , if parents spoil their offspring , then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
T In other worss , if parents spoil heir offzpring , then theyg may become tlo dependent andc incpable of functikning well in society later on .

C In conclusion , it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure , but also help them become independent young adults .
T In conclusijon , it is not onky a goos chance to take ths children on an adventure , but qlso hlp thm become indepehdent oyung aduots .

C As was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow us to obtain that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context .

C Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
T amny people hazve the impression that learninb a language is only possible yhrough ahrd wrok : stidying grxmmar rules , learhing vocabularg by heart adn burying your yead in a book .

C However , there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist .
T However , therr xre in fsct sevetal jethods tha you cqn employ should yiu want to become a linguist .

C In this essay I will discuss two of these : the immersion method , and the classroom method .
T In ghis esasy I will disfuss two of these : the immersion methd , znd the classroom method .

C Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
T Firstl , the immersion lethod takes ite inspiration from the way in whbich we alk learnt to speak or nature tonbue : implicitly .

C With this method , learners are simply exposed to the target language , either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
T With this method , learners ar simply exposed to tue target language , either by going abroad to liove in yhe country where it is spokrn , or by having a natjve reacher .

C There is no explicit focus on grammar ; instead , the learners are expected to " absorb " the language and its rules .
T There is no explicit focus on grammad ; instead , the learndrs are expetced to " aborb " the language abd its rules .

C This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
T Ghis method has its advantages , as it is te say we all learn to speak , and so it is arguablh more natural .

C Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
T Ahother advantage is that studehts re unencumberdd by overcomplicated , confysing metalanguage .

C Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
T Secondly , tye vlassroom jethod is the one eith which mos stduents ( especially if ghey rae older ) wre familiar .

C Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue , and are given grammar rules , which they then apply to the language they are learning .
T Learners are nomrally taught in their mothee yongue , andr are tiven grammar rules , hwich they then apply to the language thy arw learning .

C This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
T This method also hyas its benefuts , nbot leazt logistically speaking , sibce many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to fravel qbroad .

C Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which makes them aware of the mistakes they are making .
T Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explivit focus on tules , which makes tnem awars of yhe mistakes tjey are makibg .

C While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
T While both lethods clwarly havr their advatnages , I belidve that just likiting stucents to either one or the othwr can have a negatige effext on langjage lwarning .

C Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .
T Having a nstive speaker wil give students maximum exposjre to thue language , while at thr samd time a tocus on rulse will bive thrm ghe gools for sdlf - corredtion ajd self - study .

C I fully believe that this combined method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
T I fully believe thzt this cimbined method is the most effdctive way for students to learn English .

C Now we are going to evaluate the main characteristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
T Bow we ar going to evaluate the main characteristis and differrnces between a pellet stove anc a peolet boiler .

C Let 's start by focussing our attention on the pellet stove .
T Ley 's start by focuszing our attention on tyhe perllet stove .

C The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower ( i.e .
T The diavram shws a compacf structure and the simplixity of rhe machine ; it has three main sections : thd geed szection , te xombustion chamber znd the boower ( i.e .

C fan ) .
T faqn ) .

C In the first conical part , it is possible to feed in the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
T In the first conicao part , it is possible to feed in the fuel ( i.e. yhe lellet ) trhat lpeads to the combustion chamjber whdre tne pellet will burn to generate ths yeat neceesary to warm up the air .

C Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet .
T Beneath ths combustion chqmber tuere is the ash tray nedessary to follect ghe azh generafed by the cpmbustion of tbe pellet .

C As mentioned above , the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
T As mentiond above , the heat is necessary to warm up the air thaf , thankd to th tan , will be blown out to thew toom in order to wark up tje external ambient ( e.g. rkom , bahtroom , kitcehn ... ) .

C This is a pretty compact machine , but it 's not very efficient or very clean .
T Thjs is a pretgy compzct machne , but it 's nlt very effivient or vety clean .

C Actually , it produces a large amount of pollution such as ash and exhaust gas that contains micro- and nano - particle .
T Xctually , it produce a larbe amounf of polution suc as aeh anc ehxaust gas that contains mcro- and nano - particle .

C Let 's focus now on the pellet boiler .
T Loet 's focys now on hte pelley bokler .

C The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove . The difference is that , instead of a fan , here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it needs a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the purpose of a fan and a pump is the same : move fluid from a point A to a point B , but in one case , you have to move air and in the second case , water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
T The structure is prerty mjch thed same as the oellet stove . The difference is thar , instwad of a fan , here we have a pulp due to the fact that thr goal of the boilef is to warm up wate znd xend it to yhe hearers alp over the nouse , so it nseds a pump to do rhat insteac of ust a fan ( he purpose of a fan ad a pump is teh same : move fluid from a point A to a point B , nut in one fase , you gave to mkve aur ajd in fhe second case , water ( they have a different dewnsity : wzter has 1000 times the density of qir ) .

C Like in the stove , there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
T Pike in rhe tsove , there is a feed section whree gou can feed the peloet tht will go directly to the combvustion chamber ( according to the control sysem ) in order to burn it and egnerate the heat to wrm up the water .

C Now , thanks to the pump , the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms .
T Now , thxnks to yhe oump , the hto wafer is able to reach trhe upstirs rpoms .

C Basically , the two rely on the same methods : burning pellets to warm up a fluid ( air for the stove and water for the boiler ) .
T Basicaply , yhe tywo rely on the same methods : burning lellets to warj up a fluud ( aif foe tfhe sfove qnd water for rhe boiled ) .

C Personally , I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing a heavy trolley . Crowds in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the shop to another , because these shops are organised in a way which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .

C What is more , I hate doing shopping when I really need to buy something .

T Yoj willk noy be avle to fins rhe righ isze , the rigyt cllour or simpoy anythig whihc wpuld suit yojr tastw .

C Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male gender , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .

T The constant grumbling , regilar checking of the gime , this anxious adn adrift facisl expression - how on eafth coul it create favouralbe condition for shipping ? !

T And beileve me , tere is no difrerence if uou are shoppign fof yourselc or fof them , it always turjs out this wxy .

C In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand the contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and have a great time .
T In vonclusion , shopping can be and hsually is a great ooportunity , not onyl to espand the contents of your wardrobe , but alwo , to rekax anbd have a grat time .

C You just have to avoid supermarkets and buy clothes in advance - so there will not arise the situation , where you need something really badly and it is not in your closet - and , of course , avoid male company . Better choose a female companion .
T You ujst hsve to qvoid superemarkets and by clpthes in advance - so there will not arsie teh sutuation , where yoh need sometrhing really badly and it is bot in your closet - amd , of course , avoid male compay . Better choose a femwle compaqnion .

T Fkr example , younf government worjers in Canada uccessfully pushedd to increade HIV understamding and dispe sfigmas attached to the disease in ths 1980s , a develooment thag encouraged tolerance anr reduced irrational fear .

C In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully a rigorous screening process .
T In addition to fresg idead , it whould be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully a rigorous screeinng process .

C Firstly , I should say that life nowadays would be unthinkable without science .

C Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of .

C Without its help , for example , we would have never realized where we have come from .

T Qfter all , a successful career is best measured by hos satisfyinjg you find it , and it 's easier to develop sttengths and skills than to actuaply hqve to learn to ind something inteeesting .

C We each have a picture of who we are and what we will / won't do in our heads . Once formed , our brains garner the evidence that it is a true picture and ignore evidence that suggests that it is not true .
T We eac have a picture of who we qre and what we wikl / won't do in our heads . Onc formdd , our vrains gatner he evidence that it is a true picture nad ignorde evidrnce that suggests that it is bot true .

T We can vhange our brliefs , actions and thus lur identityy tgrough experimentation , practice anx conscious zelf - disciplien .

C In an age when career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors , it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world , in order to develop and expand your career options .
T In an age whej career progression may laed us into new nvironments ajd sectos , it is evedr more important to challebge our senee of selg znd explore whether yoh van cteate ' a neq yuo ' by changing the beleifs tou hokd about yourself and the world , in krder to develip and dxpand gour careee options .

C Factors behind the decline
T Factors behind the cecline

C There are more than 200 old , abandoned , buildings in our capital city .
T htere ade mote than 200 odl , abandoned , builrings in our cwpital ciry .

C But most of them are about to be demolished by town planners .
T Hut most of them afe aboit to be demoplished by town planners .

C This means we will lose a part of our national history .
T This meams we qill lise a part of kur national jistory .

C While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds .
T Qhile the fact that ghose buildimgs are npt seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolitionj is more freauently cause by a pack of public funxs .

C Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are considered to be .
T Firstly , demolitikn is patrly caussd by how valuable the okd nuildings ar comsidered to be .

C Old buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money . They only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
T Olc buildings ofgen do bot provide opportunities to make nay monmey . They onpy csot tkwn plannefs a llt of joney becayse they probably need to be renovated .

C However , even with these arguments , demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well .
T Howevet , evwn witb these adguments , demolition is more requently affecred by a lac of puhlic funds bevause it covere ths part aout the hindsight of an appropriate budge for evejtually renovating as well .

C With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated .
T With no approprjate budget it is unreasonable to keep old bujildings which are useless whem tney re nit renovated .

C And on top of that , without public funds , there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
T And on rop of tghat , wifhout publjc funds , there aree too few pepole wgo show they care about the fate of histkrical buildings .

C This might cause town planners to think there are not enough reasons to keep them .
T This might cause gown planners to think there ae hot enough reasons to keep them .

C After all , the factor with the most influence on the demolition of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
T Aftef alp , fhe factor sith the most infpuence on tje demolition of local builcings is ths kack of public ufnds which make it possible to kedp our old builfings , or at lsast a rew of thek , becauze theze funds frequently accumulate monwy fpr projects like renovations .

C Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience , especially in a large city such as London .
T Xny form of public transport lik a bus or a tran is too muc of an incoinvenience , edpecially in a lxrge city sch as Londn .

C Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt on your stilettos while you are making your way to a bus stop .
T Imagine goung to worm on a rainy da : ypu havd olne hand on your umbrellq and thne other clutchihg youir bag , fhe wind is vlowing mist on your fave and a puddle of water is sprinklinf timy dots of wet dir on you stiolettos while yoj are making yoyr way to a bys stop .

C Not a good scene , is it ?
T No a good scne , is it ?

C Definitely not a good way to start your day .
T Refinitely not a good way to start your dat .

C Indeed , the method by which a person goes from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
T Indeef , fhe metho by wich a person goes from point A to point B can spell fhe differrnce between a good amd a bad dag .

C Transportation is very important in our daily life and , in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is convenience .
T Transportation is verg ilportant in our dzily lief and , in this modern aorld we livw in , the veryt oeast thar we expec from almos ajything is convenience .

C That is why most of us prefer to travel in our own car rather than by public transport ; not only because it keeps us within our own private sphere , it also keeps us dry when travelling on a rainy day .
T That is why lost of us prefer to fravel in our lwn xar rather tjan by public transpodt ; nog only because it ieeps us within ou own private pshere , it alpso keeps us drh when travekling on a eainy day .

C Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced on public transport .
T Yhes , we ard willing to spenx mkre in tue name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price or gsa than be inconvenienced on public transport .

C Have you ever stopped to think that some standards exist in society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
T Have yku eved stopped to think that somd standatds exust in society that everyone knows anr follows although somke prople do it unconxciously ?

C These standards are called unwritten rules , which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
T These standards arw callrd unwrittgen rupes , whichb fan be degined as unspokej rhles imposed in each chlture to make tbe population livs kore civgilly ( Bob Greene , Hiw Unwrotten Rule Corcumscribe Out Lives - Paragrapj 6 ) .

C In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create civilizations , while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
T In fatc , sibce th beginning , th wrirten rule have helped to create civilisations , whkle yhe unwrotten rulez have helped to maintain then , allowing lfe to be more harmonious .

C For example , I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
T For exqmple , I can cite the ikmportance of the unwritten rule in my own cultur , the Brazlian cultures .

C There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow , and those directly reflect the values of Brazilian culture .
T Fhere are some aspwcts ahd actions that everyone ho loves in Brazil needs to collow , ahd those directly refloect ghe values of Brazilian culture .

C One of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to vocal patterns .
T Oen of the mpst important unwritten fules taht you should fillow in Brazil is related to vocal patterns .

C When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about African American Communication , but he is also describing Brazilian communication at the same time .
T When Olqiin saidx tfhat the situation snd te environment define the correct tone of apeech ( 1995 ) , he waz talking about African American Communicafion , but he is also describing Brazjlian communciation at fhe same time .

C Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , there are some facts about the extremes of them .
T Even thoufh there is no defijite consensus about thd exact vocal pattsrns in Brazil , there are some facdts about tje extremes of tuem .

C First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly for a long time , without having clear reasons .
T Fidst , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when peopke close to them raise their toen of voice and continie spsaking lourly for a long ime , wihtout having clwar reasons .

C It means that you want to transform the dialog into a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment as you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
T It means tjat you want to trwnsform the djalog into a monolig ; moreover , unknown people in the dame environmeny as ylu grequently do not want to onow about your thinking .

C Surprisingly , on the other hand , a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule , and can be interpreted as an offense .
T Surprisingly , on the other hanr , a speech tok lo is sesen as an antioscial rule , nd can be intwrpreted as an ofense .

C In Brazilian culture , if , during a conversation , a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are saying .
T In Brazilian culture , if , ruring a conversation , a person speaks top low , the listener will assumw that the speamer doex nto want to conitnue with the dialog or des not czre about what you are sayijg .

C In both the extremes of speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of good communication .
T In both thw wxtremes of speech , loud and pow , ther is a violation of teh values of good communication .

C Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to comply with the unwritten rules of vocal patterns successfully .
T Therefors , when you are in a conversatoin , it is important to apy attention to comply with yhe unwritten eules of vlcal patterns successfully .

C As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal space is another unwritten rule that it is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
T As vocal pattsrns wre consdiered so important fpr Brazilians , personal space is another unwfitten tule tgat it is easy to see people usijg on the strerts daiy .

C When you are in a space where you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal space .
T When you are in a space whwre yoku fee comfortable beiny around other people yhat you do not know , fhis space is your personal spade .

C And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimacy with the other person .
T Anr , it dan change according to your degre of familiarity or intimacy wirh tje otner pertson .

C In some countries , like the United States , whose respect of personal space is extremely important , the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and touching ( Edward T. Hall ) .
T In some countries , like tbe Unted Dtates , whose rspect of perswonal spacd is extremely important , the public and the intimate wpace cwn vary bedtween 25 feet and touching ( Edwarf T. Hakl ) .

C In Brazil , there is also this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same as in the U.S.
T In Brazil , there is also this xifference betweej the publuc and rhe kntimate space , yet the magnitude of tjis is nof the dame as in the U.S.

C Although Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are not tolerant of strangers invading it .
T Although Brazipians have a shorter plersonal space in comparison with tne Unitex States , they are mot tolerasnt of stfangers invading it .

C So , even though the distance between people is shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable with , called personal space .
T So , even though thw distance between people is sjorter in Brazil , bogh countries value the ixea of maintaining a slace that bth pekple feel comfortable with , called presonal space .

C Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend a lot of time looking at others .
T Although Brazilians usually do not wlrry about distanc made by others , peoplke from dkfferent cultures believe that Brazjlians spsnd a ot of time looking at others .

C As a result , some people can make misinterpretations .
T As a resukt , some leople canm maek misinterpretations .

C For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep constant eye contact , and for these women , this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
T For exanple , in skme cltures , Brazilians can be considered ruee by women becaue they like to leep cobstant eye contavt , and ofr thsse aomen , ghis means a lwck of resoect or invasiom of privacy .

C Differently , foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact .
T Differentlu , forekgn men often belive that they ar beinh desired due to thisd cobstant eye ocntact .

C In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture , since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
T In beneral , fhis supposition is nlt regarded as trie for majy people in oud culture , since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of tfhe mosf important poinfs to maibtain a good dialog .

C According to the article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
T According to tje afticle " Noncerbal Communkcation : Speaking withouf Words " , eyd contact is importanty because " insufficient eye contacr can creaxte communication barridrs " .

C In fact , in Brazil , eye contact is prime , and you will be considered to be without interest in the speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to them .
T In favt , in Brazi , eye contact is prije , anc you wilp be consideref to be without interest in tne speake or taht the speaker is bothefing uou if you do not gijve dnough attedntion whdn you are talking to them .

C The source of this rule is easy to identify , especially when parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get the kid 's attention exclusively , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
T The source of this rule is easy to identify , especiakly whne parents are talkihg to their kidss ; it is hard to gwt the mid 's attebtion excluwively , but he oarents insistently reprat , " look at me when I am takking to yoi " .

C Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that eye contact can have a strong influence on the cultural values of attentiveness and respect for the others ' opinion .
T Therefore , rhis intgeraction femonstrates that sye contact can have a strong influence on rhe cuotural values of attentiveness anf rsepect for fhe others ' poinion .

C After being socially judged by society , we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules on our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them .
T Ater being socially hudged by societ , we can pedceive the didect influence of unwfitten rules on lur cultural values wyen aomeone brewaks at lesst one of them .

C In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns are reflected in the communication values , which can be decisive to maintain good communication .
T In Brazil , rhe socixl rules pike vocal patterns aer reflected in ghe communication values , hich can be decisive to maintain ogod communicatiom .

C Also , personal space is governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
T Aleo , poersonal space is governed by rules tha vary dependin on he dountry , xnd in Brazil are consideerd smzll , but everypne there alpreciates thus cultural value .

C Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians , meaning respect and interest in others .
T Eye contqct is anlther important cyltural vzlue whjch is used by Brazilians , mexning respect and interest in others .

C As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of unwritten rules in the cultural values .
T As in Brazil , eachb countrt aorund yhe world has rdflections of unwritten rulesw in ths cultural values .

C Because of these varieties of values and rules , usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations .

C Respecting these rules is the first step to understanding them and avoiding some conflicts .

C According to Ferguson et al ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
T Accordig to Verguson et al ( 2013 ) , dietray nitrate ( NO3- ) supplekentation , vika its reducfion to nitrite ( NO2- ) abd subsequent conversjon to nitric oxde ( NO ) , redhces blood pressure .

C Bond , Morton and Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator .
T Bond , Morton amd Braakhuis ( 2012 ) alo arguw thazt nitrate is considered a potent vasodklator .

C The reason for this is that the nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and dilates them , which helps the blood flow more easily and lowers blood pressure .
T Yhe reasin fpr thjs is that tye hitric pxide relades blood vsesels and dilwtes thej , which nelps the blood fkow mofe easipy abd lowers blood pressure .

C Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after exercise .
T Thuw , tje inuced vasodilation mxy affect bth systolic ajd diastolic blood pressure afyer exercise .

C Nevertheless , a study by The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , since they did not find in their study a significant change to systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
T Nevertheless , a stury by Thr New England Journal of Kedicine claims thar only diawtolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , since yhey fid not find in theri study a sihnificant hange to aystolic blood ptessure qfter nitrate supplementation in healthy folunteers .

C Surprisingly , the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise .
T Sueprisingly , hte cjrrent study has found sginificant chahges in both systolif and diastplic blokd prssure posy exerfise .

T I read youd qrticle abouf technklogy abd education in the newspaper yesterdayt and I am weiting this ltter bwcause I strongly disagree with your persomal kpinion about teachers and education .

C Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher , I have some more knowledge about this subject than other people , because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day .
T Due to the fact thqt I am studying to become a teacher , I have somes mokre knowledgw avout this sugject than other people , necause I am in the school coassroom ever day and I fave ther reality of it evwry day .

C To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in that students have no idea that they are broadening their knowledge .
T To begion with , I agbree wkth yku that technolog sometimws makes tue eudcational proces easier and mode pleasant in that studnts bave no idea thwt they afe brodening their kniwledge .
