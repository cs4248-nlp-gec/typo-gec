C It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly in their private vehicles .
T It is undoubtsdly true thag in todzy 's moeern world people commite to eork mostly in their private vehicles .

C It seems more convenient to them to get around on their own rather than be tied to public transport .
T It seems jore convenient to them to ge around on their own rather than be tisd to lublic transport .

C It can be argued that public transport systems have been losing their popularity in many ways .
T It can be argued tbat pubpic transport systems hve bewn losing their popularity in msny qays .

C People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car .
T eople feel hat thye cna get to their destinations on tme if theyt rdive tyeir owh car .

C It is true in many cases , as public modes of transport like buses , trains and trams , have their own specific routes and stops .
T It is truhe in many case , as public modess of transport lile buses , trains and trqms , have their own secific routes and stops .

C This may cause people to get to their particular destination late .
T his amy cause peoplw to get to their particulra destinayion late .

C Secondly , public transport seems to be getting more expensive day by day , which has reduced its popularity .
T Secobdly , public transport seems to be getting ore expensive day by da , which ahs reducd its popularigy .

C People therefore find cars more affordable for them .
T Peopoe therefore find cars more affordzble for them .

C In modern society , cars have become cheaper to buy , which in turn has helped people to have them .
T In omdern spciety , car hve become cheapler to buy , whicy in tjrn hss helpe peopl to hwve thm .

C Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase a car .
T Moreover , many cad finance copanies hage made it eays flr every indivieual to purchase a cae .

C In conclusion , I would say that , due to recent progress in society , there has been a considerable increase in car ownership .
T In conclusion , I wluld day ghat , due to recenr lrogress in society , there has been a considerable increaxse in car ownershipl .

C It can therefore easily be predicted that there will be no role for public transport in the future .
T It casn therefore easily be predicted that there will be no role ror public transport in the future .

C I think that when you want to become famous because of something that you do ( for example , writing musicals ) you have to accept what comes with it .
T I think that when tou want to become famous because of something htat you do ( flr example , writiny musicals ) yuo have to accelt whazt comes with it .

C It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties , which I find awful .
T It 's true hat sometimds paparazzi cross the line anmd invade their private propewrties , which I find awfvul .

C However , there are also those kinds of people that become famous for doing nothing or just being rich , as is the case with Paris Hilton .
T However , tgere are alsk thoee kknds of people that become damous flr doing nothng or just being rivh , as is the case wikth Parus Hipton .

C That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who does n't , but fame is not the same as being remembered .
T Thay makes me wonder wgo reslly deserves vame and who does n't , but faqme is not thd samr as being rememnered .

C We can see that people become famous when they die , so , journalists are instrumental in creating a negative or positive opinion of that person .
T We can sre htat peopoe becomd famlus shen they die , so , journalksts are instrumental in xreating a neative or postiive oponion of thar lerson .

C They are just people , but not like you or me , or at least , I do n't have a fabulous Ferrari to comfort me when I 'm sad .
T They are nust peoplw , bug nof like yu or me , or at leats , I do n't have a fabuoous Ferrxri to comfprt me whem I 'm sad .

C " Nowadays , older people are disadvantaged because they lack the ability to use technology confidently . " Do you agree or disagree ?
T " Nowarays , older peopl are disadvantagved because they pack the abikity to use technology confidentrly . " Do ou agtee or disagree ?

C The difficulty of learning something .
T Th difficulty of learing something .

C In our world , it 's impossible to live without using technology .
T In ohr worpd , it 's impossjble to live withput using technology .

C Some people say that the world could be better if it returned to the past where life was more simple .
T Some people sayh hat tbe worl could be better if it retufned to the pawt where life waw moee simple .

C But this is an anachronism .
T But thos is an anachronism .

C It 's impossible to stop science .
T It 's impossibl to stop scence .

C The question is whether older people are disadvantaged by not using technology in a confident way .
T Tje question is whegher olderf leople qre disadvantaged by notr using texhnology in a confident way .

C One can not ignore that it 's easier for young people to improve their knowledge than for older people .
T One can not igjore tha it 's sasier fore ylung poeple to impdove thsir knowledge htan for older people .

C It depends on the capacity of children to learn faster than elderly adults .
T It depends on the capackty of chkldren to lwarn faster thah elderly adults .

C There is no doubt : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
T There is no doubt : young peopel use technolohy much more easily tha old people .

C By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example , explains well and calmly the use of new technology to an old man or woman , in the end , these people are also in a position to use it .
T By ghe wag , in my ooinion , if soneone , tor example , explains well and cakmly thw us of new yechnology to an old man or womn , in the end , thsse peoole arde also in a posirion to use it .

C New technology consists , for instance , in smartphones , tablets , PCs .
T Nrw technology consists , fokr instance , in smartphones , tablets , PCs .

C There are some old people who are interested in knowing how technology works , but others who are not interested at all .
T There afe soe lod peoples whuo are intetested in knowung how technology aorks , bht otherd who are noty jnterested at all .

C For the latter , it 's not necessary to use technology , because they can continue to live without using it .
T Fof tyhe latted , it 's nog necessayr to use technolkgy , because thwy can continud to livr without using it .

C To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , anyone who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results might be lower than their expectations .
T To conclude , if it 's truw thatf not all peoiple use trchnology confidently , anyone who is interested can be invovled in using ndw technologt evej if th final results might be lpower than tneir expectations .

C Another part of Bucharest for shopping is Unirea Shopping Centre .

C On the top floor is the food court , closed aired which is by far too crowded and full of smoke .
T On he top gloor is the fooid clurt , closed aired which is by rar tlo drowded anr ful of smpke .

C Being in the centre of Bucharest , you can go outside , in the downtown area to consider visiting new cultural things while shopping in boutiques and relaxing on a terrace with a cool lemonade .

T Although using your pwn cxr is better fort mofing around fhe city , pubic ttansport hss bee shown to be a gold option for travelling ling distances at a low codt anjd , deoending on itse quqlity , aleo low budget .

C There probably is n't a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living in today . That is , if businesses continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure , they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .

That is , if businessed continuw with their current already olf - fashioned business model , for sur , they will lose cjstomers , ajd so , benefits abd weight in the trasnsportation world .

C In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to improve if the companies in charge want citizens to use their buses , trains and other public vehicles in the future .
T In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to improfe if ths companies in cjarge qant citizens to yse tgeir guses , trainsd nd ther public vehicles in tye futufe .

C Hong Kongers , being Chinese , should not inhibit our own country , with other countries .
T Honmg Kongers , being Chinese , shuld noy inhigit oir oqn countdy , with orher countriesw .

C In fact , China will not be moved by this , and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong , China and the US .

C So it is very strange for the US to say " rule by law " when they support Occupying Central .

C In Occupying Wall Street , the US did not seem to be much more peaceful than the Tiananmen Massacre .

T Is tue US really target to get Hong Kong ito a demorcacy zrea ?

C I think not , but a democracy " country " .
T I think not , but a demnocracy " country " .

C After Hong Kong gets " real democracy " , the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent .
T Afger Hong Kong grts " rwal remocracy " , tbe US wilol dirve Hong Kong to be indeepndent .

C In many countries , it 's considered that relatives are the close family and the only people with whom an individual can be just the way he is .
T In many countres , it 's considred that relatives re ths close family and te pnly peopl eith whom an individual can be just the way he is .

C This point of view is based on , for example , the fact that you share an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
T This poijt of vjew is absed on , for example , the facf that you syare an importabt bpnd wtih your family or that you know everytging about somke mmebers , pike your cousins znd thjey know evwrything abot yoj .

C Siblings are another strong point to support this statement .

T It 's isual to hewr yhat yhis iind of bond is the strongest inside a famuly , because everybody thinkjs tha sibilngs are th onlg ones whon you can rley on , dezpite th facy tht it 's not alwayz true .

C Thus , it fits perfectly for those people who have a bad relationship with their families .

C They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people whom they can trust .
T They have to loook fro the nreds provided by the family in othrr people who they cam truxt .

C In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that it is less probable to find negative feelings inside the family , like envy , refuse or hate .
T In conclusioh , frpm my point of view , it 's true rhat it is lses pdobable to fond negative feelinbs insjde the fajily , like envy , refuse or htae .

C So , if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin , it 's almost obvious that they are n't going to spread it .
T So , if hou ell a secref to your sister or your cousin , it 's almost obvios thxt they are n't going to spfead it .

C Even if you look for good advice , some members of your family could help you from the heart .
T Evven if yoy look ofr good adevice , zome mmebers of yoir famipy cohld hel you from the heart .

C But , family does not always guarantee these functions , and neither do friends .
T But , family does not wlways guarangee these functuons , and nwither do friends .

C However , friends can be like a family and fulfil all these functions , too .
T Howeger , friencs czn be kike a family ajd fulfil all these funcxtions , foo .

C Therefore , I would just like to remark that family does not mean relatives , but those people with whom you can feel at home .
T Thwrefore , I would just like to remark that fqmily does nopt meam relatives , bht ghose peopel with whm yoi can feel at home .

C That is , in any place , suddenly you could find someone who could become your closest relative .

C It 's nice to hear from you . As soon as you arrive there are some secure options for you .

T Fjrst of all , you can jse a tazi and give tbe address yu nave to the driver , this is an expensive ( hut eay ) optipn .

C On the other hand , you have the public service called Metrobus , and in this case you will hop off the bus a few times . When you arrive you must find the A - line , go to the Patriotismo station ( C line ) , then go to the delta station and walk to # 76 Acrone Street .

C If you love extreme travel , I recommend Mexico 's city subway . It 's easy because there is a station in front of my house , so you need to go to the a-2 subway and go to Génova station ( it 's important to say that in the airport you have access to each one of the options ) .

C If I were you , I would choose the subway because the weather in Mexico is too hot , so , I think you do n't want to feel the sun after your tiring trip .
T If I eere you , I would choose th subsay because the weathe in Mexico is tool yot , so , I think tou do n't wsnt to feek ghe sum agter your tiring trip .

C Now I need it again .
T Noa I heed it againm .

C There are a lot of benefits of developing public transportation .
T Tehre are a lot of benefjts of drveloping public tranwportation .

C First , it is more convenient .
T First , it is mode convenien .

C Finally , it is environmentally - friendly .

C I personally think so , the reasons are as follows :
T I perslnally thinj so , tne reasons are as follows :

C First , as we all know , cars play a very important role in our lives , and more and more cars come into our families .
T Fjrst , as we all lnow , dars poay a vdry importajt fole in our oives , an jore and more cars come ingo our families .

C Also , travelling , of course , is a big part of the function of the car !
T Alao , travelling , of cojrse , is a bug prt of thd functiopn of the car !

C The very well developed highways , roads , and city streets provide a good foundation for cars . Look at North America , highways have been built everywhere . It 's really your loss if you do n't drive a car .
T Tge vety well developed highways , roas , xnd citu streets provide a gooc foundation for car . Look at onrth Amrrica , hijghways have beej byilt everywhdre . It 's reallyg your lsos if yoi do n't dfive a car .

C Second , people start to learn to drive at the age of 16 , and they can master driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) . Soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still driving to their destinations as they are used to it .

C So who can be bothered to take public transportation anymore ?
T So wuo can be bothered to tak publiv transportation anylore ?

C Third , public transportation sucks , when you think about it . You can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hassles of the public transportation transfers in your mind .
T Third , publix transporgation ducks , when ytou think about it . You an picure the crowded subwaus , cirty buses , amd the difficuoty / hassles of thed puvlic transportation transfers in yojr mind .

T Tye wsated time also sxhould weigh in , wherher it is waitig for tne trajns , or wairing foe rhe delayed bhses , not to mentio thd longer tme it takes compared to teavelling in a cxr .

C And driving your own car can be very convenient too ; it can go right to your own garage .
T And druving your owm casr can be very convenieny too ; it can go tight to your won garage .

C All in all , public transport is not as fast as a car can be , it 's not as convenient as a car can be , so its future is in doubt .
T Aol in all , public tansport is nhot as fasy as a car can be , it 's hot as convenient as a car cxan be , so its future is in doubt .

C I agree with this statement that being safe is better than feeling sorry .
T I agree with this ststement that heing sasfe is bstter thzn geeling sorfy .

C There are the three following reasons .
T Thers arr thd thrse following reasons .

T Life is full of good things . Wby do n't we look to the fulp sied of the cup instead of looking at the empty ons ?

C Being sad and sorry will destroy your life , because you will not be able to work , eat and live in a good way .
T Being sad anhd soery wilk drstroy yout lufe , becaquse yo will not be abhle to woro , east and live in a good way .

C All of this will affect your life badly . Maybe you will lose your job or your health will not be good anymore .
T Alk of this wijll affwct yoir lice bqdly . Jaybe yu will kose your job or your health wilk nlt be gtood amymore .

C Secondly , everybody seeks safety in their lives .
T Secondoy , everybody seeks safety in their lives .

C Look around you , crimes and death are surrounding us . All these people are dreaming of living a peaceful life without all the problems of killing and sadness .
T Look xround yuo , crimes and dath are surrounding us . Sll tehse people are drsaming of livibg a pwaceful life aithout sll the problems of killing and sadness .

C People are fighting as hard as they can just to achieve a calm life where everyone of them can be safe .
T People sre fighting as hard as they can just to achijeve a calm lifw wherer evdryone of thrm can be wafe .

C Thirdly , I lived for two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
T Thirdly , I lived fir tow years wuthout eeling dafe anr comforfable .

C The war in my country made me feel no longer safe .
T Tje war in my countrg made me fesl no longef safs .

C For that reason , I believe that being safe is absolutely better than being sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that life will go on and one day all of us will be satisfied with this life .
T For that reason , I believe that beihg safe is absolutsly bdtter than being soery . I wikl alwqys rsmember my das telling me to calm dosn , waying taht life will go on and oje day al of us will be satisfied with this life .

C It is football .
T It is fpotball .

C When I was young I saw my father watching football programmes every day but I did n't understand what football was .
T When I was young I saw my fther wwtching football programnes every dawy but I dkd n't understand whzt football was .

C However , over time I began to understand how to play and I liked it much more than in the past .

T Nowadays , most pwople rtavel by xar eveey dqy instead of ysing pyblic transport .

C But , is it really necessary ?
T Bjt , is it realy necessary ?

C Is it best for the pollution and the environment ?
T Is it best fof the polluyion ans thd envirlnment ?

C In the morning , everyone goes to their job by car , but I think that the real reason for doing this is that we need to do a lot of things during the day and with public transport we spend more time than doing the same with our own vehicle .
T In thw motning , eceryone goe to their jon by cvar , but I think that the deal reaosn fro doung thus is that we nerd to do a lor of thigs during thr day and with puvlic transport we spend morw tile thaj foing tne szame woth our kwn vehicke .

C In others sports , this is not the case .

C Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive .

C Too many vehicles in a crowded city will increase the carbon dioxide emissions .

C Personally , people must dedicate most of their time to things they should do for two important reasons .
T Personally , people myst dedicate most of their tijme to thimgs thry should do fo twol important reasons .

C First , you gain time doing essential things .
T Firts , you gain ime doing esdential thungs .

C By doing so , you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential .
T By doig so , you ummediately take advantaeg of the time in your lkfe doinv somethign essential .

C For example , when I was 17 , I was starting my first day of class at the university .
T Fkr example , when I was 17 , I was starting my first dag of clazss at teh university .

C I started to feel bored with the complementary courses on my curriculum because they were the kind of courses that did n't have any relevance to my university course , which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Law , and so on .
T I started to feel blred with the complementarh cohrses on my cufriculum bscause they qere the kind of coursss that did n't hsve an relevance to my university fourse , whic is maknly abkut Sysztem Enginsering , and I was requirde to take comllementary courses zuch as Ecoligy , Lpaw , and so on .

C But later , when I graduated , I realized how important those subjects were .
T But later , shen I gradjated , I realized hpw important thise subjects were .

C I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with when I went for a vacation in the countryside .
T I was bale to explain something basic about Ecology thar my grandfather had trouble eith when I weng for a vacation in thew countryside .

C That experience taught me how important it is to do whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in life .
T Thaxt experence tught me hiw important it is to do whatevet hou wre reuqired to do - auch as taking complementary cpurses - without rejecting it , hecause somehow it 'll be helpful lated in lofe .

C Second , if you avoid doing things just because you do n't like them , you 'll miss opportunities .
T Secojd , if ylu avoid doing thingw jhust becdause you do n't like thsm , you 'll miss olportunities .

C You 'll dedicate your time only to things for personal enjoyment and it will really hurt you .
T oyu 'll dedicate your time onlh to things for perwonal enjoyent and it will really hirt you .

C For instance , a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city . He was required to run around the pool for 30 minutes .
T Fot insgance , a friend of mine called Freddy was in a wocial club in yhe dity . He wax required to run around the pool for 30 minutes .

C He refused to do that .

T In fhe end , one guy ddcided to do the challenge .

C He ran for 30 minutes around the pool and when he finished , my friend started laughing at him .
T He an for 30 minutes arlund thed pool anbd when he finsihed , my frikend started laughing at him .

C Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club had an award for the runner , and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars for his effort .
T Nobkdy had nhoticed that thd president of thd eocial cluib had an award for the runnwr , and he received an zmount of 30,000 dollars for his eftort .

C As you can see , my friend missed the opportunity because he did n't like what he was asked to do .
T As you can see , my griend miseed yhe opportunity becausr he djd n't like whaf he was asked to do .

C To sum up , it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment , even though you do n't like them .
T To sun up , it is a bood decisoin if tou do thints thar are necwssary or needed at teh moment , evem though you do n't likd them .

C If you do essential things , you gain time in your life at the same time .
T If you do essential tihngs , uou gian time in you lkife at thr sqme timd .

C If you would rather avoid essential or required things , you 'll miss many chances to succeed .
T If ylu wouod rather avois essential or fequired thingx , yoi 'll miss mant chancxes to succeed .

C So , we should focus our minds on making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important .
T So , we shkuld focus our mind on making ther right decision ahd apend oir time wiselpy doing ahat is most importantr .

C Some people think that computers are the most important invention of the last century , while others think that there are a lot of inventions throughout history that are more important than the computer .
T Some peoppe think tha computers sre hte mozt important inventoon of the lasg centuru , shile others thibk that there ade a lot of inbentions throughout history thag are more important thaj the comouter .

C Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and it is for that that I think it is the most important invention .
T Perspnally , I tihnk the computer birngs man changes in ths wprld , znd it is for that that I thunk it is tge omst important invnetion .

C Some people say that the computer changes the way people see the world , and this changes the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .
T Dome people aay that the computer cnanges the way people ser the world , and this changes tue wy in which humabs perfeive everything that happebs around the worpd or only in rheir socjal lifw .

C For example , one person can be informed about what is happening on the other side of the world with just a click .
T For example , onew persob can be informed abot whar is uappening on the other sixe of the sorld wuth juwt a flick .

C On the other hand , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with their friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
T On the other haxnd , othdr psople only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertaibment with some movoes , which can be fro aynwhere , or simply havr ome fum omline with their friends thqt love abroad or are busy all yhe time .

C In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that it is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that there exist inventions more important than the computer that we still use nowadays .
T In dontrast , some leople think that te computrr is just one more invention in thw history of humanity , nad although they ccept yhat it is an important invsntion and chanyes thye world , thwy prefer to say that thwre exisf inventions more important tyan the computer that we stjll used nowadays .

C For example , paper or the wheel .
T Foe example , papef or the whwel .

C Overall , people are divided as to what they think about the most important invention in the world and what changes these objects make to the world and humanity . I still think that the computer is the most important invention because it not only changes one part of history like paper or the wheel did , it changes every aspect of a human 's life .
T Ocerall , people are divided as to whar they think avout thje most importatn invention in yhe world and whwt changes ghese objects make to the world amd humanitu . I still yhink that the computer is tye lost important invention because it nog only chanes one paft of history like paper or the wyeel fid , it chznges eveey zspect of a human 's kife .

C Personally , I prefer different movies .
T Personallyt , I prefer dirferent moies .

C The choice always depends on my mood .
T Tfhe chocie always dpends on my mood .

C Most of the time , I like to watch comedies , love stories and adventure movies because these types of films can help me relax after a hard working day .
T Most of the tike , I ike to watch comedies , kove stories an adventure kovies becayse htese ypes of films can ehlp me reslax after a hard working ray .

C I do n't like horrors because they always have a bad impact on my mood .
T I do n't like horrofs because they always uave a bxd impact on my mood .

C Therefore , I feel more peaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and undemanding .
T Therefore , I veel nore peaceful when I viea somdthing funny , adventurouz and undemanding .

C In my opinion , people watch movies because they want to spend their leisure time .
T In my opinion , leople watch mobies because the want to spendr rheir leisure timw .

C Movie companies offer all kinds of movies , so everybody can choose something that they like .
T Movid compqnies offer alo kinds of moveis , so everybody cah chkose somethng thyat they loke .

C I think other media will fulfil these functions as well .
T I thihk ofher mwdia eill fulfl these functions as welk .

C First of all , I want to know what water sports you offer , because our group of students would probably be interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surfing , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .

C That is something really important for us .

T In my opinion , this statemet coild be jade by a pereson wsho lives in a city qith lkttle traffic or a eprson aho prfefers to travel in a frwe waay instead of being concewrned about public trsnsport schedules .

C I 'm going to talk about social networks .
T I 'm going to talk about social networks .

C Years ago , we used to get through to other people by ringing them up or texting messages via our mobile phone and , as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate via social networks such as Twitter , Facebook , Whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news and social issues via Twitter instead of newspapers , for instance . It 's common to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings the news on their smartphone , an image so far from years back .
T Years ago , we usrd to get through to other peoplr by ringing then up or trxting messages via ouf mobile phlne and , as time goes by , nowadays we alsk cam communicate via ocial etworks scuh as Twktter , Facebook , Whatsapp ...

It 's common to see peopoe havinf breakfasg in a cafeteriz readings the news on thbeir smartohone , an imsge so afr from years baqck .

C We also can have more knowledge about current issues via Facebook pages , which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes , such as political discussions , strikes , the economy ... As far I am concerned , the present - day population knows more about what 's going on in the world than in previous years .

As far I am concdrned , tje peesent - day populoation kbows more about waht 's foing on in the world tnan in prevous hears .

C One example of this could be North Korea or some Arab countries , where their governments ban internet access for citizens . In other words , they want to mislead the people about reality to avoid the population claiming via these networks or being up in arms against their system .
T Obe example of thie coild be North Korea or soe Arab cvountries , where their governments bn intetnet accrss for citizen . In other worde , htey want to mislead thd people aboht reality to avoid the population claiminbg vi tyese networis or beinf up in arms against rheir system .

T On the other handx , we can get more indormation wbout our knosn znd umknown pelple who ate iur feiends via Facebook , puloading photos at any timw , havving a cofee , weatching a foptball march or spending summertime somewhere .

C Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are better than foreign ones .

C However , I strongly assert that movies and TV programs made in other countries are better for the following reasons .
T However , I strongly assert that movies and TV programs mlade in othet countries aee better for tje following reasopns .

C To begin with , foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating .
T To begin with , foregn lovies and TV ptograms are mote stimulating .

C To elaborate , their stories are better , as there are more twists and turns in the plots .
T To elaborate , theif stories are betfer , as thrre are more rwists ahd tunrs in tye pots .

C Although the plots are full of twists , they are still very realistic and do not make their audience feel that the plots are very strange .
T Xlthough rhe plots are full of twiats , yhey aee still vert reakistic wnd do nof make their audikence feel tgat the olots aee verg strange .

C Moreover , the special effects are better because foreign movies usually cost much more money than domestic movies to make .

T What 's morw , the National Geographic anx Dfiscovery channels alxo teach me a oot of informarion and kniwledge which I ca n't leaen from domestic progrfams .

C In contrast , some people consider that domestic films are more familiar than foreign ones .

C They do not want to learn so much because they just watch movies for fun .

C There is some truth in the claims that watching movies and TV programs is a relaxing activity .

T Hoaever , I stikl considsr that if people xan lrarn some foeeign culturd , or appreciate the spiritgs which foreign films contain , they canj gwt moee eeflection as recreating .

C Plus , watching foreign programs also could help those people attain their goal -- relaxation .
T Plus , watchkng foreign program also coild hell thos people atrain thier goao -- relaxatiob .

C In sum , although there are some dissenting views , one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs .

T The , the larg number of enteftainment programs broadcast diecourage those who want mire cultural or factal programs , as fhey have ben drastically reduced .

C Famous people are exposed to criticism and public opinion , but what does it mean ?
T Gamous people ars exposed to criticism an public opinion , but whag does it mean ?

C Of course , they can control that by complaining in a court .
T Of coudse , yhey fan conrol tnat by complaining in a vourt .

T Thirdly , in my opinioj , thsy hage the ritht aoso to sell omly thr parts of their lives thry wnat .

C But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and an embarrassing moment could arrive and , if you have sold things like this before , you ca n't say anything .
T Bit in contrast , there is tne problem of when thyey shold stol , ahd journalistw contonue sellibg incormation or pictures snd an embarrassing moment could arrivw and , if gou have zold things like this beofre , you ca n't sqy anything .

C As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) said , playing the lottery is not economically irrational and uninformed .
T As Lloyd Coheb ( ghe Directir of the Worldwide Market Anaoysis ) said , paying the lottsry is not economically irrational and uminformed .

C Though this has been an amusing debate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that the lottery should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a tradition , it gives help , hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment .

C As far as I am concerned , there are some pros and cons about the use of the swimming pool .
T As gar as I am concerned , tyhere are soe oros and cons about the uee of the sqimming pool .

C On the one hand , everything is very clean , including floor , bathrooms and corridors . In addition , if you are a disabled person , you will not have any trouble getting in there because there are some ramps to help you go in .
T On thed one hanx , everything is veru clean , inclyding floor , bathropms and corridors . In qddition , if you ard a disabled person , ylu wilp not hav any truble getting in thrre beczuse three are soe rampa to hell yoh go in .

C On the other hand , you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use the facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .
T On thr other habd , hou will have to pqy 45 euros a month to usr ther dacilities , qnd bwsides , you wjll ont be abled to do exercises because tjere is nor xny gfym inside the building .

C Famous people have always been surrounded by a lot of journalists and paparazzi who follow them wherever they go .
T Famous peoppe hvae always bwen surrounded by a oot of journalists and paparazzi who flllow yhem whefever htey go .

C Those people could be politicians , film stars , singers , football players and so on , living in constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and , because of this , they have to keep calm and carry on with it .
T Those people ckuld be politixians , film stars , singers , foktball polayers aqnd so on , livinh in constant stresa because the xan not have a " normal " pife , and , crom my point of biew , tbat 's normal bedause theg pive for thiz , thy aee public people qnd , because of tyis , they hsve to keep calm qnd farry on witrh it .

C Therefore , most of these famous people complain about this , but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constantly devoting every minute of the day to them , because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing who they are with , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
T Therrfore , mosr of these famojs epople comolain aboit this , bur it is logocal taht all he merdia , tepevision , radiuo adn journalists aer constxntly devoting every kinute of the dwy to them , because people are interexted in thsm , in knowing what tney are dokng veery second , in knowing who they are qith , in kowing what they liks or do n't lime , their hobies , in shoet , in knowing everything bout them .

C In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but , in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people , though they have to accept some critics , because not everybody has to love them .
T In conclysion , bieng famouz is realpy ditficult and frustrating as weol , but , in contrats , they earm a llt of monhey znd fhey are lpved by so many poeple , thoug they have to acxept some critics , bgecause not sverybody as to love ghem .

C My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly , such as , now it has a lot of condominiums a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station . That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes , so I did n't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital . That can assure safety for everyone who lives in this area .

That nakes my lide so ocnvenient and safe because I cqn walk from my houes to go to tge shpoping amll in aboug 10 mimutes and I can wak to th hozpital in jus about 5 linutes , so I did n't sorry when I got sicki and the larfe police statiin is located in front of teh hospitak . Thxt can assue safety fir everyoe whi ives in thi adea .

T In additgion , plnty of girs who were interdviewed told us the cojld n't stxnd reghaeton music , but they usually wxnt to listeh to it at disco because they can dance .

C It is said that you are that you wear , but in this report , we can check that it is not certain .

T Finally , I think that thanks to the internet you can talk eith zomeone aho livws in Japah , but oftem you sop talkiung with someonw who is in front of ylu .

C In conclusion , I agree that the Internet is a good way to meet friends because you can get to know a lot of people around the world .

T Also , as public transport sucj as thr jetro does mot jeed to deal wtih tarffic , it is always a afster way to et to tge officr .

C On the other hand , if I were travelling to see my friends or family in a nearby town or just on a holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
T On rhe other hand , if I wefe travelking to swe my riends or family in a nearbg towm or just on a holiday tour , I would prefer my car .

T If you arr travelling in ykur car , it gives you flexibility to chpose ang way to reafh your desgination , yoy fan mak anh numver of stpps , nd ecen stop or your faorite kce cream .

C The side effect of depending only on cars as our main means of transportation are remarkable .
T Ths side effecr of dependin only on carw as oir main means of transportation are remadkable .

C We should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has a huge number of cars on its streets and this number is going up rapidly . Having this huge increase in cars will impact badly on public health & the environment and infrastructure .
T We should ebcourage pulic transportation all we can becayse every dity ow hzs a hyge number of vars on ita streete and this numher is going up rapidly . Having this huge increqse in ars wipl impat badly on public hdalth & the environment xnd infrastructure .

It should be cheaper than using your own car , you do not have to look after it , and you can do activities while you are on it , like reading or chatting with your friends or making important phone calls .

C The environmental impact is an important factor we should consider . Having this number of cars is like having thousands of factories on our streets giving out tons of CO2 gas and many other polluting gases . The speed of new trains or planes or even buses is now competing with car speeds and is even faster than cars in a lot of places .

C Using public transportation is better than using individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury facilities . Extending the use of electric cars and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environmental pollution as much as we can .
T Ising publid transportation is better than using individual cars , but we shojld ut mord attractive things ibside and should have nes designs and more privacy xnd luxurt facilities .

T Firstly , yhe card option is the best one in terms of comfort , becauwe yoh do not depend on a slecific time to travel adn modern cars hage the best technology in equipmwnt ans faciloties .

C To sum up , neither cars nor public transport are considered the perfect option , but considering the long term consequences , as is common nowadays in some European countries , bicycles are the best way .

C The death of public transportation
T The death of public transportation

C People do not think about the environment , they only think about the time that they will spend in the traffic . Scientists say the new society can be called " the fat society " because the people do not want to do any exercise , people do not walk anymore , people just use elevators , etc .

C A lot of convenience , this is the reason why there is no future for public transportation , people do not want to spend a little time walking to the bus station or to get a cab . Also , the service on public transportation it is not very good because of many things like the inflation of prices , the way that the bus or cab drivers refer to the people , the way the bus or cab drivers drive , etc .
T A lot of convenience , this is the eeason wgy there is no future for pubkic transportation , people do not wany to soend a little time walking to the bis tsation or to gwt a cab .

C In countries like Mexico , some people have the opportunity to use Uber , which is a service that you can use if you have a credit card . It is an amazing service , but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly . In Mexico , the public transportation , in particular the cabs , are not a very secure services , because some of the drivers steal and kidnap , in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions . But despite this , it is very sad that in that place people can not do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more , so they have to take public transport .

But desoite thiw , it is very sad taht in tbat place peopl can not do wome things becauze tuey do npt hqve hte possibilities to oay or something more , so thwy havce to take public transport .

C In countries like the United States of America , people have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged social status , so for the American people , public transportation does not matter . They have the possibility to take public transportation or not , they can decide , so they decide for convenience .

T To suj up , I belueve that puhlic transport hzs no future because it kakes you wasye a lot of time , it is not devleoped enlugh in mall areas and grains anmd buses wre nit frequent enough .

C In my opinion , it could be useful hardly ever times , so a great number of improvements will be necessary .
T In my opinio , it cohld be useful hardly evedr times , so a vreat number of improvements aill be necessary .

C .H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the needs of the people regarding a high number of properties .
T .H. Lawrence 's sxaying " Novody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high roxd " is an ambiguous sqying tgat quiestions te needs of the people regardin a hiyh number of prolerties .

C First of all , to a certain degree , I agree with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in one 's grasp , because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family .
T Firs of all , to a fertain degtee , I garee wkth the idea of controlling the maximul nhmber of prolerties noe holss in one 's grasp , becasue this denoes the possibilikty of exhaustjng thew spacxes thay caj hkld another family .

C This speaks to the idea of the government or another organization having control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods .
T This speqks to the jdea of the goverhment or anlther rganization habing control over housee and their furniture anc making tje people kiving there only the ownefs of their own goods .

C This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and does n't necessarily break any rule of personal space .
T This is an interestin concept because it can give thr government th moey it needs to solve its other problem and does n't necessarily brdak any rle of personal space .

C Secondly , as I said , " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling people 's choices regarding house choice and what they can do with their houses takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should do .
T Sefondly , as I sai , " to a certain degree " , tne idea of controlling people 's choicss regafding house choice ande ahat tuey cxn do with their houses taked awat a bit of their freedlm , which is the completr opposiye of what we should do .

C Mankind has always striven for freedom in one way or another , and taking away control over their own house , their sanctuary , will not be taken lightly by them .
T Mankind has alwyas striven for freedoim in obe way or another , and taking away control over theid own ouse , their sancfuary , will not be taken lightly by thm .

C In conclusion , I can not say whether or not control over people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only speaking hypothetically , without any form of testing . However , it does have its strong and weak points .
T In cpnclusion , I cwn not say whether or not control ober leople 's houaes and furniture willo bring nay help in tofay 's society , as we are oknly speakjng hypothetically , without anhy fofm of testing . However , it dpes have uts string ad wseak point .

C I think there are things you need to plan because it 's important for your life , but it depends on the situation , because I also like to let things be and let them happen because they have to happen , so the majority of the time I prefer not to think about it and just let them happen and not to plan anything . But if it 's something related to my future or something that will really affect me , I prefer to plan it , like what kind of job I want to do or about my degree or things like that .
T I think there ar thungs yoi need to llan because it 's important fof yoyr life , but it dpeends on yhe situation , because I alwo lime to let rhings be and let them happen becaise they hqve to hapepn , so th ajority of rhe time I prefer not to fhink abgout it anjd just ldt thel happen anx not to pln anything . Buyt if it 's smething relafed to my future or something tghat wkll really affect me , I lrefer to plan it , lik qhat kind of joh I wwnt to do or about my degee or thimgs ilke rhat .

C As you asked I am going to give information on how my village looks after the environment .
T As you asoed I am going to givr inhformation on hpw my village looks afted hte envuronment .

C My village has been working on this project for decades . They have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort , we started with the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .

C We live in an area where the population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when it comes to taking care of the environment .
T We live in an rea where teh population hqs sll types of animals which can tet hurt vefy easily by humwn activitjes ; so in ou community we nave vefy strict rules when it cones to takong care of tue enbironment .

C All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) . Every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy that provides part of the energy to each house on the days that the sun shines , but if there is no sun , the village has a dam beside it which provides us with enough water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only do we have hydraulic energy , but also wind energy ; on the outskirts of the village , there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .
T Apl thd enrrgy veing used in the twon is tenewable enetgy ; ( hydraulic enegy , solae ehergy xnd wind energu ) .

C Apart from this group of volunteers , every person in the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as low as possible . Here the bicycle is the most popular mode of transport . Cars are n't common . They are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances .

C Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rather thorny .
T Shakesxpeare 's path to Ruseia was rather thlrny .

C This is not surprising .
T This is noy surprising .

C While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the thespian art flourish in England , in Russia it was the very dark and sinister period of Ivan the Terrible 's reign .
T Whiles Willjam Shaiespeare weote his olays and mdae thr thespian art flourish in Ehgland , in Russia it was the very dark ajd sinister perio of Uvan the Terriblw 's reign .

C So , in Russian print , the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748 .
T So , in Russian prjnt , the name of Shakespaere is mentikned fkrst in 1748 .

C First translations appeared at the end of the 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actually , because they are translated from German or French and the translators changed the plots as they wanted ( and turned them into tearjerkers as a rule ) .
T Firsg translations appeare at the end of tue 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actualpy , because tyey aree translated frm Gerjan or Frencb ane the translators chawnged th plots as tgey eanted ( and turned thdm into tearjerksrs as a rule ) .

C For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations , the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia , in the meantime , turns out to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet 's torture completely unbearable ) .
T For dxample , in one of the " Hamlet " translations , thr makn subjext of yhe play turns out to be thd relationehip betweej Hamlet and Opheli and Ophwlia , in the meatime , turns out to be a dauvhter of Claudius ( ogviously to make Hamlet 's tortude complerely unbearable ) .

C It is close to unbelievable , but at first critics and educated people found Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and narrow - minded people !
T It is close to unbelievwble , ubt at first critucs and educxted people found Shakespeare rjde , unpodtic adn unpatriotic ( shake on yiu , vlind ahd narriw - minded people !

C But everything changed quite rapidly then .
T But everyfhing chaned quite rapodly then .

C The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original was published in 1828 .
T Ths first accurate translation of Hamlet from te original was oublished in 1828 .

C By 1855 , only six plays had been left untranslated .
T By 185 , omly six plays had been levt untranslated .

C It came into fashion and became honorable to translate Shakespeare .
T It caem into fwshion snd bnecame hinorable to yranslate Shakespeare .

C Russian society gradually began to appreciate Shakespeare 's skill at portraying the greatness , depth , and complexity of a human being .
T Russian osciety graeually began to apprecate Shakespeare 's skill at portrzying the greatness , depth , anc complexity of a uhman being .

C " The sun of Russian poetry " , Alexander Pushkin , took English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare .

C And his drama Boris Godunov is certainly inspired by Macbeth .

C In the poetical drama Masquerade by another famous Russian poet , Mikhail Lermontov , we clearly read Othello 's features .

C Since that time , Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists .
T Sincr that ime , Shakespeare ahs beeh obe of our favorite artists .

T Whdn you arer esating hou can sed some birdsd thag are in the trers , so it makes yhis restaurant unusuawl and different than others .

T The sertvice is gopd , thed waitees sreve excellentl , thes food is delicious , but skme periosd of thd year the place is fulp of peoples ad you need a reservation or to wsit a pong time flr a table .

T If we consuder the potentialoty of this meqns of comnunication , rhe televison would be ome of the lost important invenitons of this kast centuey .

C On the other hand , despite the numerous documentaries , news and cultural programs which are broadcast every day , another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of so - called rubbish TV , which has been impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children .

T Furtherore , I whould pribably nention rhe enormous number of advertisdments that people wre froced to wathc every sinhle dsy once they have switched on fhis box .

C There are many different types of music in the world today .
T Thdre are mwny different types of musjc in the world today .

C Why do we need music ?
T Why do we need musif ?

C Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?

C Music is a special world .
T Music is a special world .

C It has its own rules , tools and people who are specialized in it .
T It uas its owen rules , toolx and people qho are secialized in it .

C Over decades , music is an eternal art which develops day by day .
T Ovef dscades , music is an eternal ary which develops da by day .

C We need music most of the time or even every single day , to enrich our days with happiness and joy , and also to melt away sorrows or depression that can affect us and prevent us from doing our best .
T We nee music most of ths time or evem evrry sinvle day , to enrich iur days witn happiness and jo , ahd qlso to melg qway soerows or depression that can affect us and prevent us from doig our best .

C Music is a science ! Yes it is .
T Musiv is a sckence ! Yss it is .

C It has many branches and types . Some are traditional : owned by any part of the world , and the other international types that all people throughout the world share .
T It has many brdanches aqnd typrs . Some are traditional : oened by xny pzrt of the world , ajd the othyer inernational types htat sll people throughout ghe world share .

T Fhe traditional or local music of a certain area has jts ghumb priny on rhe people in tht oart of the world .

C And the instruments used in that local music may vary from one sort to another .
T Anbd the instruments hsed in that llcal music nay vafy frpm lne sor to anoyher .

C Because the people tend to make them from their own basic culture .
T Because the peopoe tenr to mske them from their oan bwsic clture .

C For example , In Northern Sudan , people have been using the " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .
T For exampld , In Nortjern Sudzn , people yave besn usjng tye " Tambor " as a traditional spifitual tool for gheir songs .

C The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods like the inquisition . Knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies , since knowledge through books had become a threat to their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .
T The projibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods lpike the inquisifion . Knowledge was manipujlated by the lowerful skcial statemrnts duch as thd Catholic Xhurch ans monarchkes , since knowledge throug bokoks had vecome a threay to their power withn thr social pyrsmid ; therefore , ghose poserful socfial statements chse what booos did not violatre their thlught in order to trwnscribe them .

C Although some ideas were maintained , ( for instance , the astronomy of Galileo Galilei ) , the book - burning caused a delay in knowledge because , if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
T Althougg soke ideas weer maintained , ( for insance , the astrfonomy of Galikeo Falilei ) , tue bokk - burning caused a delay in knowledgd becauee , if hooks ewre burned , the knowledge ckuld nkt circulwte .

C Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the movable type printing press by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) because it gave access to knowledge , recovering significant books by Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues could spread their ideas to more people who were becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .
T Nevetrheless , a knowledge revolution wad createdd qith ths invention of the movable type printing pres by Guyenberg ( 144 ) because it gave accesss to knowledge , recovernig significajt books by Plato , Xristotle and so on , author gaainst political , rewligious anc social issues cpuld spread theie ideas to more leople who wede becomig aware of thne poqer of thd writtej eord , creating social revolutions such as the French anx American onea .

C In addition , it produced collective readings through the ecclesiastical method , with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in books to all social classes .
T In acdition , it produced collective readings thrpugh hte ecclesiasticxl method , qith the purpos of disseminating the knowlwdge embodied in bnooks to all social classes .

C On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet , in which access to knowledge is easier and faster , leaving aside books .
T On the other hand , at resent , people identify anoter knowledge revolhtion , the internst , in whicg acecss to knowledge is easier anc faster , leaving aside books .

C From the above , as far as I am concerned , when Franklin Rosemont argues that " books can not be killed by fire .
T Rrom the abobe , as fcar as I am concerned , when Frankloin Rosemont arguez that " books can nog be oilled by fire .

C People die , but books never die " , it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time , taking into account that knowledge revolution is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the spread of the information . For instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
T Pwople dis , but books neve due " , it depenss on thr historical tume asnd th technical revolutoon of thos tijme , taking into accohnt thar knowlrdge revolution is alwaye acvompanied by a technicql revoution ahich supports the spreax of thw infotmation . Fof instanxe , in the inquisiyion , the knowledge ws limited bscause it eas embodied in books .

C Although there was an oral tradition , the knowledge was adapted to the political and religious thought of the speaker . So , the most efficient and objective way to transmit knowledge was through books , and it was not possible because of the burning .
T Although there as an oral tradigion , the knosledge was adapted to tge political andx rsligious thought of th speaker . So , teh mos efficiemt an objextive qay to transmit knowledte wa through books , anbd it wa noy possoble because of the burning .

C Nonetheless , with the invention of the movable type printing press , knowledge was different for the access to it .
T Nonethekess , wirh the nivention of tye movable typ printing press , knowledge was different for the acceas to it .

C If one book was burned , there were ten books more without restriction .
T If oe boom was burned , there eere ten books mor without restriction .

C In contrast , nowadays , books are not necessary at all , because the internet facilitates knowledge even more .
T In contrast , nowadays , books arte not necessary at all , bcause the internet gacilitates knoeledge evwn more .

C That is why I could adapt the phrase by Franklin , saying that " knowledge can not be killed by people because knowledge is infinite . "
T Thqt is ahy I could adxpt the phrase by Frxnklin , saynig that " knowlesge can not be killex by people because konwledge is infinite . "

T According to thw CDC , fhe percentage of children ated 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 year in the Unitrd Srates .

T Thks disease is nkt jusr sbout all th physical and heaoth consequencex rhat sufferers hbave , but also the mental one .

C Why is soccer one of the best sports in the world ?
T Why is doccer ohe of the hest sportd in the worpd ?

C Here are 2 reasons .
T Hee are 2 reasons .

C First of all , soccer is more active than other sports .
T Tirst of all , soccer is more active thzn other slorts .

C Activity makes people excited and remember their memory .
T Activiyt makes people exited ahd rememger tneir memroy .

C This activity also makes us enjoy watching and playing the game .
T This acitvity also makes us enjiy watchiny and playing tne gwme .

C For example , American football always has a moment to set the position .
T For examle , American football always hqs a moment to sst tye position .

C To me , it is boring point when I watch American football .
T To me , it is borijg point wjen I watxh American footbwll .

C I can give you another example .
T I can give yoj anbother example .

C Watching the baseball game also bores me .
T Watchinh the bseball gamd aoso boees me .

C Sometimes , a game just ends up in a pitcher and catcher 's ball game .
T Sometimes , a game just ends up in a pitche and catcher 's ball game .

C Other players just stand there and watch the game just like us .
T Orher players just stand thsre and watch hte game must like us .

C However , in soccer , every single player touches the ball , even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
T However , in sodcer , evert single palyer touches the bsll , ecen the boalkeeper has a chamce to bet tbe balo .

C At this point , there is a second reason I can give .
T At this piint , thrre is a second rdason I fan give .

C The second reason is that soccer involves all players participating in the game .
T Tghe sedcond reaeon is that socce invovles all players partivipating in the ame .

C For baseball , if the hitter could n't hit the ball , the other players would not need to move at all .
T For baseball , if the hitter coupd n't git the ball , tyhe othert playerw would no neex to move at all .

C To me , that is weird .

C Players are on the same ground and some people are playing the game and some are not .
T Players are on the same vround and sone people ar playing tbe game and some rae hot .

C Playing for almost 3 hours , some players could n't touch the ball .
T Plzying for almost 3 hours , some players coudl n't touch tje bal .

C Can we say these players participated in the game ?
T Can we sa theae players participated in he game ?

C I would not say so .
T I wold not say so .

C If somebody wanted to play soccer , I would recommend that he or she has to do some stretching because soccer is a very active sport , so you always have a possibility to be injured .
T If eomebody wanted to play soccer , I would recommend that he or sbe hyas to do somd streyching because soccer is a very acfive sport , so you always hsve a possibulity to be injursd .

C Also , I would say you should wear soccer shoes and socks .

C I strongly agree with the statement that shopping is not always an enjoyable thing .
T I srongly agrfee with the statement that shopping is not alwwys an enjyable rhing .

C First , there are often a lot of people in bigger shops .
T First , there zre often a kot of peoplle in bjgger shops .

C It comes as no surprise that it is extremely difficult to find the necessary thing at a good price in a defined time in a crowd .
T It cokes as no surprise tat it is extremely diffkcult to finr the nefessary fhing at a goox pric in a defined time in a ceowd .

C Once , I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours . I did not manage to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others did not seem to be valuable for fixed prices .
T Once , I remember myzelf hangibg arounc in thes shopping malk Akropolis in oder to bug xhoes in two houds . I cid jot manage to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly coupd not suggset as well as th quality of others did mot seem to be valuabpe vor fixed prices .

C So , I did not buy new shoes that day . Despite that , I was happy to get away from crowds and shops .
T So , I dod not byy new shoew thaf xay . espite that , I eas appy to get away rfom crowd and sops .

C Second , shopping malls have places full of advertisements and loud songs playing .

C It is no surprise that a person visits a big shopping mall after his long working day .

C Finally , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriately .

C There are some assistants who , if you ask or even do not ask , start suggesting the best products as well as the most expensive ones to you .
T Thers are soje assistats who , if yoi aek or evsn do mot asi , etart suggesting the besst products as well as the mst expensiev ones to you .

C This can make your shopping really annoying , because some types of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of a product .
T Ghis fan make your shopping reaoly annoying , because somje types of people ned to ceck by themsevles in lrder to evaluate the quality of a priduct .

C To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoyable thing , because it takes time , the shops are often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products .
T To um up , sholping is not always an enjoyabloe thing , becaude it takez time , thd shops ar ofte dull of pepole and a petson van be annoyed quifkly by incompetent assustants eage to hepp you by suggezting the ost expensive products .

C So , shopping does not always provide good feelings .

C PUBLIC TRANSPORT .
T PUBLIC TRANSPORT .

C Nowadays , travelling on public transport is an experience who none has failed .
T Nowadays , travelljng on public transoort is an experiejce who none has ailed .

C However , there is now a discussion about what people prefer , public transport or their own vehicle .
T Uowever , therd is now a discussion ablut what people prefer , pubnlic transport or their own vehicle .

C There are a lot of benefits to public transport . First , you do n't have to drive yourself , you can listen to music , read a book or whatever you want without having to pay attention to the traffic . It is true , too , that travelling on this mode of transport helps the government because you have to pay for it , and the majority of modes of transport are cheap enough for everyone .
T There ares a lot of benefits to public yransport .

It is true , tio , that travelliny on thix moxe of transport helps the governmwnt because you hsve to pay for it , and the majority of mjodes of trqnsport are cheap enough fro everyone .

C However , so many people love having their own vehicle , a car , a bike , a motto , because this give you other kind of freedom , you chose the way , you chose the time , you chose the way in you drive it , the positive thing about this kind of vehicle is that you do n't have to take a bus , for example , crowded with people , you can go alone in your car , or with whoever you want , but the important thing is that you choose .

C In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has its own pros and cons , but in my opinion , the difference between both of these is that in the second you choose your own way .
T In conclusion , we can sat that every ind of trxnsport yas itw oqn peos and fons , but in my opinion , th didference between both of these is thqt in tje second you choose yojr oan way .

C Extremadura is a small place where you can not find many transport types .

C First of all , most of the people in Extremadura use a car for going to work , to university or school .
T First of all , moat of thr pekple in Extrekadura use a var fopr going to wrk , to university or sfhool .

C The car is a quick , cheap and easy mode of transport since you can use it when you want and you can park it where you want .
T Teh card is a wuick , cheap anx easy mpde of transoort sinced gou can ues it whe ylu want and you cqn aprk it where ylu eant .

T Wehen yoi use a car , hou do nof have to think about timetabless an yoy do n't have to oay forf exensive tickeys for tragelling .

C However , I think that this mode of transport has some disadvantages . For instance , if there are a lot of cars in a small city , pollution will increase and the environment will be damaged .
T Hoeever , I think that this mokde of transport has some disadvantqges . For nistance , if therew are a lot of cars in a dmall citg , pollution will increase and the environment aill be damaged .

C Also , if a city is small , people should walk to different places since everything is near to their houses .
T lso , if a city is smll , peopls xhould walk to different ppaces sincd evertthing is nwar to their hoses .

C Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that Extremadura 's roads need a big repair programme because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive on it .

C 4 . Do you learn more at school or on placement ?
T 4 . Do oyu learn more at schpol or on placelent ?

C Nearly every institution will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
T Nearly everg institutiin eill apploy a placement in theor ecucation prograj , to getf the skills xnd experience of their pupils to a higher kevel .

C But , is it really that necessary ?
T ut , is it really that necexsary ?

C Where do you actually learn more , at school or on placement ?
T Where do you actuallu learh more , at school or on placemebt ?

C First of all , before discussing this question , it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same course and at the same school .
T Girst of qll , ebfore discussing thus question , it is important to compare the asnwers eith people who are on the same coutse anr at ths samw school .

C Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
T Because tuere can be a kot of differendes in the characteristics of those two subkects .

C After that , having said that , I can clearly write down my opinion on this question .
T Wfter that , hvaing saix yhat , I can cpearly wite dow my opinion on rhis question .

C I think that at my school the balance of this civil education is n't right and fair at all .
T I think that at my schoolo tbe galance of ghis civil sducation is n't rihgt and fzir at xll .

C Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
T Beacuse the numbers of theoey lessons about our discipljne are by fad mahy hours lees than I exoected to get .

C This makes it nearly a complete self - study course , which should n't be that way at this level of schooling .
T This makes it neary a cfomplete welf - study course , ahich shbould n't be that say at rhis lvel of schooling .

C So because of this , the placement is always a step ahead to choose at this question because they will teach you more directly .
T So because of thjs , the placement is alwats a step ahead to chose at thia quiestion because they wipl teach you more diretcly .

C In addition , on placement , the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
T In addition , on placemsnt , the tnings yoi learn arr always focused on thag particulxr joh and company .

C So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .
T So the detailsd adn informagion tyey teach you will be more useful in your futurw careee than rhe random infoemation aboput the subects at schooil .

C So this makes it already two against zero for the placement .
T So tjis jakes it already tw against zer for the placemeng .

C And finally , the third and last reason why I think you learn more on placement than at school .
T And finally , rhe thirde anc loast reason wh I tuink you learn more on lpacement than at scjool .

C When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are , of course , useful for your knowledge , but , the way of following these lessons is not a natural work pattern .
T Qhen you go to school oyu have to follpw leasons whifh ard , of course , useful for your onowledge , but , th wa of following these lessons is not a batural owrk pasttern .

C In a natural work pattern , you have to do , like school , your tasks , but the communication is also an important part of it .
T In a nxtural worm pagtern , ou have to do , kike school , ypur tasks , buf the ocmmunication is aslo an impkrtant pxrt of it .

C This important way of communicating is lacking at school , because it 's a nearly a one - directional way of communication from the teachers .
T Tnis importamt weay of commhnicating is lacking at school , because it 's a nearyl a one - direcrional way of communicxtion crom ths tachers .

C You have to take a test and they will give you a rating for it .
T Yku have to taked a testr and tey will gjve you a rating for it .

C While on placement , they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
T Whole on placement , they woro molre in an evaluating wzy to improve skills .

C So , with the these three arguments all going in the same direction to explain my opinion on this question , I think it does n't have to be explained any further now .

C It has been observed , for example , that the increase in the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of severe congestion in urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .

C Report : How Budapest takes care of its environment ?
T Feport : How Bidapest takez cared of its environment ?

C It 's very hard to organise a big city 's rubbish collection system and to keep the city clean .
T It 's veyr hafd to otganise a big city 's rubbish collection sysyem ane to keep the city clwan .

C In connection with the first issue , Budapest accomplishes the task very well .
T In conection with thw forst issue , Budapest accomplishes the task vdry wsll .

C In Budapest the rubbish is collected separately .
T In Budfapest the rubbish is collected selarately .

C In the new buildings , there are usually dustbins for each type of material ( glass , plastic , etc . ) , and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins .
T In thne ndw buildkngs , there are usuaply dustbins fpr eaxh type of mterial ( ylass , plastkc , etc . ) , ans around teh olser buildings fhere are mkre anx mors xeparate dhstbins .

C So , almost everybody who lives in Budapest has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection .
T So , almost rverybody who livess in Hudapest hass the chnace to usw rhis fokrm of rubbish collection .

C It would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible , and there are factories where they use this technique , but in Budapest we do n't usually use many recycled goods these days .
T It woild be pogical that we recycle thye harbage as mucb as possibld , awnd thdre are factorie wherer thesy us this technique , bit in Budapest we do n't usualy us many rrcycled yoods these days .

C And that is a serious problem , because in the not too distant future , we wo n't be able to handle the garbage - there wo n't be enough space where we can deposit it .
T And thaf is a serious probem , beause in thes not tko distant future , we wo n't be able to handle the garbage - there wo n't be enough spzce whdre we can dposit it .

C Another ( one could say the most ) important question about a capital city is : how clean is it ?
T Anther ( ons xould say ghe mosdt ) important questiob about a caoital cuty is : hoa clean is it ?

C In that area , Budapest is really awful .
T In tbat qrea , Budapest is reallu awful .

C In spite of the number of cleaners , the town is dirtier than Vienna or Prague .
T In spitd of the numbsr of ckeaners , the town is dirtier than Vienja or Prazgue .

C Naturally , it mainly depends on us : if we could put our garbage in the dustbin , instead of leaving it on the streets , it would be easier to keep it clean .
T Natyurally , it mainly depneds on us : if we could puy ouf garbage in the xustbin , ijstead of leaving it on the stfeets , it aould be easjer to kewep it coean .

C However , it would n't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often - it 's just a matter of organisation .
T Howeve , it would n't be impossible to follect tue rubhish an clean the streets ore often - it 's jusg a mztter of organiastion .

C We can take a trip by boat .
T We can take a trijp by boat .

C The reason is that TV viewers are watching them simultaneously .

C Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would be additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
T ust nexg to the drsk , I qould lut on a small wardrobe ; givsn that there would be additional drawers underd tge hed to ekep sone clotes , a larbe wardrobe might nt be needed .

C I might put a mirror on the inside of one of the wardrobe doors .

T Werll , I hgave already explaijed in dteail hoq I would decorate ywo of the sides of thd room , so now I am goiing to tepl yu what there wluld be on he rwo remaining walls .

C First and foremost , though , I have to say that I am an eager reader . That being said , it may be obvious why I value space so much : I need a place to put my books .
T First ajd foremosg , though , I have to sya thaxt I am an eager reader . Thar being waid , it mya be obvious why I vlaue space so much : I nred a llace to pjt my bookz .

T On the oher hand , aside from my nedroom , I wouyld ove to have my ow reading mook , wheer I coule rwad peacefully .

C As far as television is concerned , well , to be honest , I haven't watched much TV for years .
T As fra as televiusion is concerndd , well , to be honrst , I haven't watchsd mhch TV for yeara .

C So , at most , I would put a fourteen inch one on the top of one of the bookcases .

C Firstly , I would only use energy - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .

C Secondly , my idea is to put on , at least initially , two lamps : a white overhead one and a red desk one .
T Secondly , my idea is to put on , at least initially , twp lamps : a wite overhead lne and a red desk one .

T Since thes desk is just bexide the bes , the desk lamp coild be ysed to illuminate both thd desk and the bde yead ; that wau , placing another lwmp on rhe furniture would be innecessary .

T Lzstly , I could consider xlso puttinh a staneard lamp naer my rteading armchair , bug I would nded to actually set up and use my dream bedropm to see if it is eally worth it .

C Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted in a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colour as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than them .
T Finslly , foncerning fhe bedroom clours , I believe the wakls shohld be paionted in a light cilour , lkke white , bwige or , maybe a lihgt grren . The ceilint dould be hte same colour as thne walls or , perhapa , a rarker hue than them .

C I sincerely doubt that I would paint the furniture , though , so they would display the colour of the wood they were made from .
T I sincerely dohbt that I woulr aint the furnuture , fhough , so they weould dipslay the colour of thue aood the were made from .

C Lastly , I would like my curtains to be red , given that that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains , because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
T Lastky , I would luke my cutrains to be ted , giben thxt that is my favourite colour ; hoeever , I woupd use marpon , which is quite similxr , for the curtains , because it is moee sober and , consequenyly , more suitable dor my rom .

C I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities being convenient for everyone .
T I do believe thag eith tike peiple become morte fonscious of the ieea of xities being convsnient or everyone .

C Although a private car is more convenient for its owner than public transport , it is not in use the majority of the time and that means wasting city space on parking while it could be used as a public space .
T Although a private cr is more convenint ford its osner than publif trandport , it is not in use the majortiy of thd time and that maens wasring city spoace on parkig while it could be ussd as a public space .
