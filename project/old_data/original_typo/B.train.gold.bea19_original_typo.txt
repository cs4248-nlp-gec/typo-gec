S It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles .
T It is undouhbtedly true thzt in todawy 's moldern world peoplw commute to woek jostly by their private vehicles .

S It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport .
T It seems mofe convehient to them to movd on yheir own rather thban tied to a public transort .

S It can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways .
T It can be arguesd that puvlic transport system has beedn loosimg its popularitt in nany wasys .

S People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car .
T Peolle fel that they can get to yheir destinations on tile if htey drkve their own car .

S It is true in many cases as public transport like buses , trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops .
T It is true in jany csses as pbulic transport like buses , trajns and trams have theit own specific roures and stoos .

S This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination .
T Tuis may dause people in getting late to thei larticular destinatjon .

S Secondly , public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity .
T Secondly , publkc tramsport seems to be goibg expensive day by dat whnich hxs reduced its pophlarity .

S People therefore find cars more affordable for them .
T People therevore find cars lore affrdable for them .

S In modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy , which in turn has helped people to have them .
T In modern socity vars hve becomw mkore cheaper to biy , wich in tjrn had helped people to hwve yhem .

S Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car .
T Moreover , many cxr finance companies have made it ewsy for evrey individual to purchase ths car .

S In conclusion , i would say that due to recent advancements in society , there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership .
T In concluson , i would say that due to recen advancements in societt , tuere has bee a conhsiderable increase in th car owbership .

S It can therefore be predicted easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future .
T It can theefore be predicted easioy thta theee will be no rolew of lublic tgransport in tfhe future .

S I think that when you want to get famous because of something that you do ( for example : writing musical ) you have to accept what comes with it .
T I htink that whwn you wang to get famolus because of somdthing hat you do ( for examplr : qriting musical ) yku have to accpt whqt copmes with it .

S It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties which I find awful .
T It 's true thqt sometimes paparazzi cross the ilne and invade theie pdivate properties which I fibd awfup .

S However , there are also those kinds of people that get famous for doing nothing or just being rich as it 's the case of Paris Hilton .
T Howwver , there are apso those kinds of people that get famous for doinv nothing or jusy beijg rich as it 's the cade of apris Hklton .

S That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who does n't , but fame is not the same as being remembered .
T That lakes me wonder who realyl deserves famd and who does n't , byt tame is nor tje same as bsing remembered .

S We can see that people get famous when they die , so , journalists are basic to create a negative or positive point of view of that person .
T We cawn see that pekple get faomus wehn thye di , so , journalists are basoc to create a negativd or positivd loint of iew of tyat pedson .

S They are just people , but not like you or me , or at least I do n't have a fabulous ferrari to comfort me when I 'm sad .
T They are just people , but not like you or me , or at leasg I do n't hace a fabulous ferrari to domfort me when I 'm sda .

S " Nowadays , older people are disadvantaged because they lack the ability to use technology confidently . " Do you agree or disagree ?

S The difficult to learn something .
T The difgicult to ldarn somethkng .

S In our word it 's impossible to live without using technology .

S Some people said that the world could be better if it 'll return to the past where the life was more simply .
T Som people sxid thaf th world could be bestter if it 'll return to yhe pxst where tbe lpife sas morw simply .

S But this is an anachronism .

T It 's impossible to stop fhe science .

S The question is whether the older people are disadvantage in using technology in confidential way .
T The questino is whwther the olcer peiple are disadvantage in using texhnology in confidential say .

S One can not ignore that it 's more easy for young people to improve their knowledge than the older .
T Ons can hot ignore fhat it 's mkre easy for yojng peoole to improve theie knowlpedge than the older .

S It depends on the capacity of children to learn more fast than the old adults .
T It depwnds on the capacity of children to learn more fast than the kld asults .

S There are not doubts : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
T There are not duobts : young peopld uae technology mucu jore easily rhan old people .

S By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example explain well and calm the use of new technology to an old man or woman , at the end , also these people are in conditions to use it .
T By the wag , in my opinion , if someone , gor example explain well and calk thr use of new technology to an old ma or woman , at yhe endf , also thewse people xre in conditrions to usr it .

T If thr decison is madfe by central authorities , yhe most obviius advamtage is that th estimxtion for students ' grades coudl be standatdized in the while country .

S Nowadays , there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in a certain subject .

S In many countries , it 's consider that the relatives are the close family and the only people with an individual can be just the way he is .
T In majy countriws , it 's consider ghat the relstives are the cloxe family and the omly peoole wih an indivudual dan be jus the wqy he is .

S This point of view is based on , for example , that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
T This point of voew is hased on , fof examppe , tbat yoiu shares an important bond with yoyr famkly or thaty yoiu now everything abuot some members , like your cousina wnd they kno everything about you .

S Maybe , most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages .
T Maybe , mopst of us hve pent out childhold with our cousins and they ewre oyr best friemds for agds .

S Siblings are another strong point to support this statement .
T Skblings are another strong poknt to sjpport thi statement .

S It 's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family , because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on , despite not always it 's true .

S On the other hand , we can find arguments against this statement .

S For example , the debate about the statement that you can not choose your family , but your friends .

S Thus , it fits perfect for those people who have a bad relation with their families .

S They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people with whom they can trust .
T They have to loopk for fhe needs provided by rhe family in othrr peiple sith ahom they van trusr .

S In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family , like envy , refuse or hate .
T In conclusion , fvrom my poiont of ciew , it 's truie thaxt is lsss probabke to fnd negtive fewlings inside family , lije envy , refuse or hats .

S So , if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin , it 's almost obvious that they are n't going to spread it .
T So , if hou tsll a secret to your siste or your cohsin , it 's aljost onvious that theu ard n't goint to spread it .

S Even , if you look for a good advice , some members of your family could help you from the heart .

S But , family not always guarantees these functions neither friends .

S However , friends can be as a family and fulfil all this functions , too .
T However , feiends can be as a family and fulpfil all this functioms , tpo .

S Therefore , I only would like to remark that family not means relatives , but those people with whom you can feel as at home .
T Therefore , I only woulc like to remark tjat family nt meams relatives , byt tbose peoole witn whom ou can feel as at homr .

T Nowadxys there are a oot of informwtion about healthy , in order to have goodc food habits , sleep ghe amoungyt of hurs recommendec by speciqlist dctors , etcx .

S For these reasons I consider that could be a good option doing any sport that you like or you may be interested in .
T Gor rhese reasons I condider thqt could be a good option doing amy dport hat you like or you may be interested in .

S In my case I really like doing spinning , I use to do it only twice per week but now I do that every time I can .
T In my case I reslly like doijg psinning , I use to do it only twice psr week but now I do tbat every ime I fan .

S If you want to lose weight this type of sport is perfect because it belong into the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food whereas it is suitable to people that only just doing exercise to entertainment .
T If yoj want to lose weightr tis tyoe of sport is perfect necause it belong int tbe aerobic exedcises to burn the calorids tbat we grt eatinb fast food ehereas it is sujtable to pepole that only jujst doing exercise to entertainment .

S Although it is kind of hard for young people who finished school finally , to understand that it 's definitely not finish yet , education do n't stops from then on and it is one of the most important things to continue going to school .
T Althoug it is kinc of hrd for youn people who finished school fjnally , to understamd that it 's definitelu mot fnish yet , educagion do n't stops fdom fhen on and it is ons of the mosg imlortant things to contineu going to school .

S On the the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't really have the opportunity to choose , if they want to go or not .
T On thr the ohter hajd , young peoole in Bosnia do n't realoy have the oppoftunity to chooxe , if they wan to go or not .

S They finish school at the age of 23 - 24 including a further study without a chance of work or anything else .
T Theu finish scholl at the age of 23 - 24 influding a further sutdy withoug a chahce of work or anything wlse .

S To this , I think , it is a way which goes in the wrong direction .
T To ths , I think , it is a wzy which goe in the wrong directino .

S Try to motivate people for education , studying and school is a very hard thing if they all know all those Imaginations are not going to happen anyway , whereas people in Switzerland have to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possibilities look like .
T Fry to motibate people foir educafion , studying and schoop is a vdry ard thing if they al knw all tohse Imaginations are npt going to happen amyway , whereas peiple in Switzerland have to choose very sarly in which direction they want to go and what their possibiities look lkie .

S Therefore , education should be reachable for everyone , in my opinion , as long as possible , but only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
T Therefore , education shkuld be reachalbe for everyone , in my opinion , as long as possible , but only if the goal anf possibilities sre clear .

S Only if all of that is guaranteed the motivation will rise .
T Onl if all of that is guaranreed thd motivation wipl rise .

S Now shopping became one of the best way to spend time with family or friends , but not everyone like it .
T Bow shopping becane oen of the bdst way to spend tims witg family or friends , but not dveryone liks it .

S For the most of men shopping is so boring and exhausting , but for the women it can be the best way to make better their mood , because they are so happy when they buy many clothes on sale , cheaper than in regular price .
T Fror th mos of mrn shopling is so boring and exhaustung , bug for tne womn it xan be tbe besr wayt to make better yheir mood , becausw fhey ae so happy when they bjy masny clotnes on sle , cheaper than in regular lrice .

S I think that the shopping is not enjoyable for everyone when in the shops are a crowd and very long queue .
T I think that ths shopping is nlt enjoyable fdor dveryone when in ths shops are a rowd and very lonb queus .

S Then you spend more time in the shop and you will be more tired .
T Then you spend jore tile in thge sop snd you will be morde tired .

S In the big shopping centre your pocket can be stolen by pickpocket and you can lost a lot of money .
T In the bi shoppinv centrw uour pockst can be syolen by picklocket amd yuo can lost a lpt of money .

S Personally I really like shopping , because I am interested in fashion and I like look good .
T Personally I really luke shopping , becauze I am intefested in fashion and I lioe look food .

S So for me shopping is very enjoyable and I always forget about my problems when I try on new clothes , which suit to me .
T So for me shoppin is very enjkyable and I alwahs forgst about my problems hwen I try on new cvlothes , whifh suit to me .

S But I do not like wasting my time too , so I usually do shopping in Mondays , because after the weekend shops are always empty .
T But I do nit like wasting my time too , so I usually do shopping in Mondays , because after thje weekend shops are aleays empry .

S Nowadays the technology and the society have changed in different ways and most people have more free time than years before .
T Nowwdays tge technology ane ghe socieyy yave chabged in djfferent waqys and mlst people have more free tkme tha yers gefore .

S This could be good , allthough some people say we need n't all this time and we have to work more .
T This coulr be good , alltough soe peopld say we need n't all tgis time and we havd to qork more .

S First of all could be said that the society is spending more time doing relaxing things such as going to the beach or meet friends , and some experts say that we have to spend more time working or studying because people is becoming lazier .
T First of all could be sqid fhat th spciety is spenxing more tike doihg relpaxing things sjch as going to the beach or meet friende , ane soem experta say that we hav to spend more time wroking or sudying becausd leople is becoming laziwr .

S In contrast , the technology have been becoming more useful and it could do works that we had to do some years ago and having more free time could be better for us .
T In contrasty , the technology hafe been becoming morr useful ane it could do works fhat we had to do some years sgo snd having more free time coyld be bettet vor us .

S Another point is that we can meet more friends or visit our family if we have more free time and that is allways good .
T Anotyher point is that we ca mee moee ffiends or visit ou fmaily if we hae moer rree time snd that is allways good .

S In other words could be said that if we have more free time our lifes would become better because we can enjoy with friends and do thigs with our family .
T In otger words could be ssid thag if we have mors free tikme our oifes ould become getter because we can enjky wirh friejds and do thigs with our family .

S Frome my point of view , having free time is perfect because we can do more things that we are fond of and our quality of life would icrease
T Frime my point of view , having free time is perfect because we xan do more thibgs thag we sre fpnd of ajd our quality of oife would icrease

S Making new friends and sharing interests with others are always exciting parts of social life .
T Majing bew criends and sharing interests wity others are always excjting parys of social life .

S When it comes to the best way for students to make friends , some support that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable , however , from where I am stand , joining a sports team is the undoubtedly the best choice .
T When it comes to the best way fkr students to maoe friends , skme support rhat particioating in communitg acitvities or traveling qre preferable , hosever , rrom whwre I am stahd , joining a sporte tsam is the indoubtedly th best chpice .

S First of all , for the energetic students , doing sports is their favorite .
T Firsr of allp , folr tge energetic students , doing sporrs is their favoritd .

S Therefore , joining a sports team from where they can share same interests and relax is the easiest way to know each other .
T Thereore , joining a sportd team from where thesy ca shaer sale interests and erlax is the easiet wsay to know eaxh ofher .

S Training in the same sports team , the students can not only release them from whole day 's pressure , but also can build up good relationships with others through the communication and exercise .
T Traininf in tge samje sports team , the srudents cazn not only release them from whole day 's pressure , but xlso czn nuild up golod relationships wjth otners through hte communiation ande exercise .

S For example , the champions of Olympic Games , China 's famous synchronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia , the two girls enjoy a really good friendship .
T Fo example , th champijons of Olygmpic Gamez , Chiba 's fwmous synchronizer diving athletse , GuoJingjjng and Wu Minxia , the to girls enjoy a rewlly good friendship .

S They became to know each other because they both joined the same sports team , and then after exercised and played together ; they finally become two enviable friends .
T They hecame to know each othet because they botb joined ths sxme sporys tema , adn then afte exercised and plahed ogether ; tjey finally hecome two enviable vriends .

S Additionally , cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team .
T Adcitionally , cooperation and coherency ade zlways the main essence of a splrts ream .

S Here , students learn how to work together , how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork , how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self , and even how to negotiate or discuss with others , as well as how to be patient and rational .
T Here , students lrarn how to wofk tigether , how to fight for tue same goal through tait teamwodk , hkw to conrtibute to he wgole twam insteas of jusy thinking of self , wnd even how to negptiate or discuss with otners , as well as ow to be patient adn ratinoal .

S Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students , I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent .
T Although thefe amy be sme adgument or disagreement among sudents , I alwasy tuink tyhat everything is goin to be ikay because the aports team wikl be coheent .

S Finally , joining a sport team will provide a long period of time for students to get along with each other .
T Finaly , jioning a eport tesam will provide a long perild of time for studentgs to bet alonv sith eac other .

S However , if students participate in community activities , for example , doing volunteer job in the town 's library , they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is full of working .
T However , if students partcipate in community activities , for exampel , doiny volunteer job in ths town 's library , they would nkt hqve sufficiet tile to communicats wit each othe since mist of thei tijme is fll of sorking .

S Meanwhile , students can play with each other during traveling , but only several days are deficient and most people will not keep in touch with others after the trip .
T Meanwhkle , students xan olay with eachg other durijg traveling , but only severa rays ate deficient and mot peoole will not keel in tfouch with others arter tue trip .

T I still think thr oublic yransportation system wipl be growihg on in wuch a crwoded era .

S How long haven't you use public transportation ? do you agree that there is no future for public transport ?
T Hiw long haven't you use public transportatoon ? do yiu agree tat thesre is no future vor public translort ?

S I personally think so , the reasons are as below :
T I pereonally thunk so , the rezsons afe as bnelow :

S First , As we all know , Cars play a very important role in our life , the more and more cars come into our family .
T Girst , As we all know , Cars play a very importang role in our life , te more adn mpre cars cone unto oru family .

S Also travelling , of course , that 's a big part of the function of the car !
T Also travellijg , of course , that 's a big part of the function of the car !

T he veryh well developed ighways , roars , city streers provide a good foundation for the cats , loik at the North America , fhe highways ewre developes anywhere , it 's deally yoiur owj lose if oyu do n't drive a car , drive on thsm(highways )

S Second , Human start to learn driving at the age of 16 , and they can master the driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) , soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it .

S so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore ?

S Third , The public transportation sucks , when you think about it , you can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind .

T Ths wsted time also should waeight in , wjether it is waiting for the traqins , or waiting for thd delxyed buses , nt to mentjon the longer timew it takes comlared to ttavelling in a cat .

S And driving your own car can be very convenient too , it can right come to your own garage .
T Xnd drivjng yur own car cam be very convenient tko , it xan right xome to yuour owh garage .

S All in all , Public transport is not as fast as a car can be ; it 's not as convenient as a car can provide , so it 's future is in doubt .

S I agree with this statement that being safe is better than feeling sorry .

S There are the three following reasons .

T Lief is full of goox things why do n't we look to the fyll sise of thne cup instead of looking at the empty ons ?

S Being sad and sorry will destroy your life , because you will not be able to work , eat and live in a good way .
T Being dad anr sorfy will desrroy your life , becaude you wilk nof be ale to woek , eat and live in a good way .

S All of this will affect your life badly , maybe you will lose your job or your health will not be good anymore .
T All of thisa will affect ykur lfie badly , mabye you will loee your job or tour uealth iwll njot be good anymord .

S Secondly , Eveybody seeks safetiy in their lives .

T Liok artound you , crimes amd death are rounding us , all his pelple zre ddeaming to livfe a peaceful life without qll the aspecfts of killing and sadnese .

S People are fighting as they can to only reach a calm life where everyone of them can be safe .
T People are fighbting as they dan to onky rech a calm lifd shere everyone of thsm cab be swfe .

S Thirdly , I lived two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
T Thitdly , I lvied two years without feeling safe xnd comfortable .

S The war in my country make me feel no longer safe .
T The war in my counrry maje me feek no longrr safe .

S For that reason I beleive that being safe is absloutly better than sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that the life will go on and oneday all of us will be satsfied with this life .
T For that reason I beleive that beung sae is abzloutly better than sory . I will always remdmber my rad elling me to calm doan , saying that the lide eill go on anr onmeday alo of us will be satsfied witn thks life .

S Personally , people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons .
T Personally , peolle myst dedkcate most pzrt of thsir time on thingx they should do fir two important reasons .

S First , you gain time doing essential things .
T ifrst , tou gian tims doing essnetial things .

S By doing so , you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential .
T By doing so , yoy immediately take advqntage of thd time in youe life oding somethjng essential .

S For example , when I was 17 , I was about starting my first day of class in the university .
T Fpr example , wheb I was 17 , I qas aboht etarting my firsy dayt of class in the university .

S I started to feel bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that did n't have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Laws , and so on .
T I startes to ferl borec with compoementary courses on my curriculum vecause there wered trhe kind of courses tht dir n't nave any hekp to my university careee which is mainly about System Engineering , xnd I waa required to takr clmplementary coursed usch as Ecology , Lawx , and so on .

S But later when I graduated , I realized how important were those subjects .
T But latee when I graduated , I realiaed how important were thgose subjects .

S I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation .
T I was able to explain somethinb nasic about Ecologvy thag my grandfather gad trouble wit in ths countryside when I went for a vwcation .

S That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in the life .
T Thzt experienhce tgaught me how important it is doing whatever you are requored to do - such as taiing complementary dourses - withuot rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be belpful later in tbe life .

S Second , if you avoid doing things only because those do n't like you , you 'll miss opportunities .
T Secomd , if you avoid doing yhings olny vecause thse do n't like you , you 'll mkss opoortunities .

S You 'll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it really will hurt you .
T You 'll dedicat yur yime only on thibgs for lersonal enjoymejt and it rteally qill hirt ylu .

S For instance , a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city , he was requested to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes .
T Fro instance , a friend of mine called Freddy wxs in a socila club in th city , he was requested to do a runniny aroud ghe lool for 30 mlinutes .

S He refused to do this .
T He refused to do tyis .

S After all , one guy decided to do the venture .
T Wfter all , oje gyy decided to do yhe venture .

S He ran for 30 minutes around the pool and when he finished , my friend started laughing at him .
T He ranj tor 30 minuges around the ppol and wjen he finished , my fridnd started lajghing at him .

S Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner , and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort .
T Nobody had noticed that he presidnet of the socual club ha an asard for tge rhnner , and he received an amount of 30,000 dollsrs becaue of his egfort .

S As you can see , my friend lost the opportunity because he did n't like what he was requested to do .
T As you can see , my feiend lost the opportunity brcause he die n't lioe wat he qas requsted to do .

S To sum up , it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment though you do n't like it .
T To sum up , it is a gpod decision if tou do thinbs tnat are necessry or neededd at the moment tnough ylu do n't like it .

S If you do essential things you gain time in your life at the same time .
T If you do edsential hings you gain time in yoir lfie at tje same time .

S If you would rather avoid essential or required things you 'll lose many chances to succeed .
T If yoh would rqther avoid essential or requifed things you 'll lose manyh chances to zucceed .

S So , we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important .
T So , we sholud focus ouf minds making thd right decision an psend pur tie wisely doinv qhat is most imortant .

S Some people think that computers are the most important invention over the last century , while others think that are a lot of inventions over the history that are more important than the computer .

T Perxonally , I thunk fhe computer rings many hcanges in ghe worlr , and is fkr that I think it is the mosy importsnt inevntion .

T Some peopl way that the computer vhange the way people seee ther worlc , and thiz change tje wag in which humans peeceive eveything thta happens round the worpd or inly in theur social lfe .

S For example , how one person can be informed what happens to the other side of the world with only a click .
T For example , how one person czn be informrd what happens to he other side of the wotld aith opnly a clickj .

S For other part , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with your friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
T For other paet , other peopls only used fhe cmputer to have communicatuon eith someone , haver enteretainment with some movieds , which dan be from anywhwre , or sinply hqve somr fun online wuth your friebds thag life abroad or ar bsuy alp thge rime .

S In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that exist inventions more important than the computer that nowadays we still use .
T In contraxt , some peopoe tihnk that the computer is jhst one more onvention in hte histlry of humnity , ahd altjough they accept thay is an important invention and canges the world , they prefef to xay thxt rxist invwntions more ijportant tha ther computer that nowadays we sgill ue .

S For example the paper or the wheel .
T Fpr exalple the paoer or the wheep .

S Overall , people are divided in what they think about the most important invention in the world and what changes these objects make to the world and humanity , I still think that the computer is the most important invention because it not only changes one part of the history like the parper or the wheel , it changes every aspect of the human 's life .
T Overallp , people are dkvided in waht they think about th most important invention in thd world nad what changes thexe objectx maie to tge wordl and humanty , I stilk think that th computer is the most importany invention beczuse it not only changes one oart of the history lime the parpre or ghe eheel , it chages every spect of th hukan 's life .

S Most of the time I like to watch comedies , love stories and adventure movies because these types of films can help me relax after a hard working day .
T Mosxt of thge time I lkie to watch comesies , love stoties amd adventjre movies bdcause tyese typrs of films cwn help me relwx aftet a hard working day .

S Nevertheless , the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible .

S The main reason is that the craved stone balls are different types of stones .

S As far as I am concerned , the later point of view carries more weight .

S He has to choose between treating his pets as a family member or not .

S Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are better than foreign ones .

S However , I strongly assert that movies and TV programs made in other countries are better for the following reasons .

T It sesems a result of ghe fac tyat , after a long dag , pekple prefer to uhwind in fronf of ths televison , qatching " entertainment programs " rather then news or qhat 's up in the Worlf .

S There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before to condemn it .
T Tuere are wlso pksitive rhings htat we havge to take inro consideration befors to ocndemn it .

S For example , the wider choose of programs from all over the World , allow us to discover new cultures , new languages and new societies without travelling , and this enhance our knowledge .
T Fod example , thue wkder choose of programs ffom all pver thw World , allow us to discovdr new culturws , nmew lnaguages anr nsw sociefies wothout travekling , an tis enjhance our knoledge .

S Famous people are exposed to criticism and public opinion , but what does it mean ?
T Famuos peopoe are expoesd to criticism xnd public opinio , bt what does it mean ?

T Firstly , there zre two kinds of famlus pdople : fhose who sant to have a private ljfe and ho do n't qant everyody knowing exch aspect of theire lives and thos whyo selk certain parts of thwir lived in magazines , journals or TV progfammes or their entire privqte life .

S Secondly , taking this into account , I think that everybody has the right of having a private life and the right of living without journalists following them to everywhere .
T econdly , tsking this intk account , I think that everybody has the right of having a priate life anr the rigjt of lifing without journalists folliwing htem to everywhere .

S It 's true that their lives are too much exposed and they can not have a normal life .
T It 's true hat their lives are tol muc exposer and they can not hace a bormal life .

S Of course , they can control that by complaining in a trial .
T Of course , theu cab dontrol that by cmplaining in a trial .

S Thirdly , in my opinion they have the right also of selling only the parts of their lives they want .
T Thirdloy , in my oponion they have thes right also of sellint onoy tbe paets of thei lives they wamt .

S But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and it could arrive an embarrassing moment and if you have sold a kind of things like this before you ca n't say nothing .
T But in conttast , there is the problem of when thry shoupd stpo , znd journaliosts continue selling information or pictures ahd it could arriev an embnarrassing monent an if hou have sold a kid of rhings like thjs before you ca n't say nothung .

S To summarize , I believe that everybody deserve to have a private life .
T To summarize , I belidve that rverybody deserve to have a private life .

S When it does n't occur , they have to go to trials .
T Ahen it dows n't ocxur , they hace to go to trials .

T On tue one hand everyting is very cleabed including gloor , bath abd corridirs , in additiln , if you are a disabled pesron yoj wll hot have amy ttouble to get trhere bevause theer ars soke rajps to helo you come in .

S On the other hand you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .

S Famous people have been always sorrunded by a lot of journalists and paparazzies who follow them wherever they go .
T Famous people hzve besn alway sortunded by a lor of journqlists and paparazzis who fkllow the wherevsr they go .

S Those people could be politicians , film starts , singers , football players and so on living in a constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and because of this they have to keep calm and carry with it .

S Therefore , most of this famous people complain of this but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constanlty devoting every minute of the day to them because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing with whom they are , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .

S In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people though they have to accept some critics because not everybody has to love them .
T In conclusion , being famous is really ifficult and frutsrating as well , but in contraxt , tbey earn a lot of money and tyey zre loved by so many people thouyh thsy have to xccept some critics becaues nof everybody hnas to love them .

S In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
T In thid essay , I am giong to discuss ehether building a bypxss around oure town is beneficial to our community or nkt .

S One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children , babies .

S On the other hand the bypass might cause a drastic drop in tourism in the town .

S However , it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway .
T Hnowever , it is also true to say tha leople woh ate actually interested in histodical sits would visit thw tpwn anyway .

T So travekling by bue is nit convehient , nopt onl for tiume but alsk fot tge problems fhat you can find .

S However , in recent years my village has been promoting ways for people to get ride of the rubbish in a conscious way .
T However , in recent years my vullage has been promoting waygs gor peoplke to gfet ride of the rubbish in a consdious way .

S Conclusion
T Conclusion

S We have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us .
T We hxve to besr in mind hpw imporant the rnvironment is to us .

S If we all were aware of this and did something to help it in our daily routines , the planet would thank us for this .
T If we all wrre aware of thus ans did skmething to hell it in ur aily routinss , the panet sould thank us fopr tgis .

S There are two opposite opinions about military service .
T Tuere ae gwo oppoiste opinions aboht military service .

S On one , hand military service must be mandatory .
T On one , hand military srevice msut be mandatory .

S Others consider that it is military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary .
T Otheres consieer that it is miljtary sevrice is unnecessary abd should be voluntary .

S First of all , there is no absolutely safety in the modern world .
T Rirst of apl , therre is no absolutely safety in the modern world .

S There are different dangers of a military nature such as terrorist attacks , wars and other armed conflicts .
T Thers aee dfiferent dangers of a militaty nature sich as yerrorist attacks , wars and otber arled conflicts .

S Therefore , compulsory service at in the army gives special military knowledge , which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict .
T Yherefore , compulxory servuce at in the army gives special militady klnowledge , which helps the population to protect gheir cpuntry durihg a militaryt conflict .

S As a result , there are more chances to overcome the conflict with minimum human losses .
T As a rrsult , there zre more chancea to overcome teh conflixt with ninimum hjman lossss .

S Secondly , the mandatory military service can develop the character of a person , making it stronger .
T Secondy , tbe mzndatory militqry service can degelop the character of a person , makingv it strfonger .

S More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develops organizational skills and practice discipline .
T Mode specifically , it allows fir understandung of teamwork , devepops organizational skille and przctice discipline .

S Moreover , it can educate young people be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents .
T Morekver , it can eduacte toung people be morfe self - relkant , because the majority of teenagees at fhe xge of 18 do hot kjow how to be independent ffom rheir parents .

S However , the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact .

S It has been suggested to offer " work experience programs " .
T It hax been suggesed to offed " wokr explerience programs " .

S Students will be able to know deeply their task as employers .
T Sthdents wikl be wble to know deeply their tadk as employes .

S It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but for the experience that it could bring them .
T It seems a brillisnt idea not only because of te knoqledge that tgey acquire but vor hte experiehce thag it vould bring htem .

S Some enterprises require experienced employers and if young people have it , they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
T Spme enterlrises require experioenced employers qnd if youjg people have it , the iwll be more likrly to be recruited in hte workplace .

S So , including in the CV the experience , seems to me , a step further in the students ' career .
T So , including in yhe CV the experiencr , seems to me , a step further in the students ' carrer .

S Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification .
T Ankther way to encourage studenys to finc ther pdrfect job would be courses anmd qualfiication .

S I entirely share this idea .
T I edntirely share tjis idsa .

S Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a work involves .But sometimes universities gives them more theoretical formations instead of practical formation which enterprises are searching .
T Unifersities are supposed to give theirf students informatioh zbout fhe skills that a work ivnolves .Bhut sometkmes universities givex the more theotetical formations instead of practiczl formation which enterprises are searchign .

S Generally speaking students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience .
T Gtenerally spewking students finish their degrdes with a limited range of experience .

S I would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of " training " for their work life and some theoretical knowledge .
T I would rherefore argue fhat trhe ebst way to hslp students is to combine a knd of " trqining " for their wofk lufe ahd some theoretical knowlexge .

S They have to learn the skills that a job involve and the only way to get this is practicing .

S Now a day 's we are having " n " number of International Sports , where one can prove their own talent and have their socialism .
T Niw a dah 's we ade baving " n " number of Intwrnational Spolrts , where pne can prove tueir own talent ans havd their ocialism .

S My favourite sport is Badminton because we can have lots of fun while playing .
T My favourite spprt is Badminton becahse we cdan habe llts of fuhn whiel olaying .

S The shape of the court is in rectangle and is divided in half by a net .
T The shape of the cour is in rectangle ans is divided in half by a net .

S The mode of playing can be single 's or double 's .
T The mode of playinh can be single 's or double 's .

S There are six main shorts : the serve , the clear , the smash , the drop , the forehand and the backhand .

S It 's a good exercise to make one fit and easy to play .
T It 's a god exercise to makme onw fit xnd eas to plxy .

S The fun in this game is we need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait 's until the opponent responses to it .
T The fjn in this agme is we nedd to drop yhe shutltecock on the other side of te coyrt anr wai 's until the opponent respohses to it .

S My suggestion for the people who wants to start their hobby as badminton , firstly one need to know the rules and regulations of the play .
T My seuggestion for the people who wamts to syart fheir hobby as badminfon , ifrstly on need to konw yhe rukes nd regulatiohs of the plag .

S As it 's a mind set game , the player need to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
T As it 's a mind sdt gtame , thr ppayer need to fdocus on the weaknesses znd act accrodingly .

S To be a successful player one has to learn some tricks , which helps their game easier .
T To be a succesdful playet onew has to learn slme tdicks , which helps tgeir gane easiee .

S And last but not least as a player one has to keep in mind that , they should not get depressed when they feel that their game is going out of their hands , where instead of that one has to fight until the last mint of the game in order to decide whether the player is winner or loser .
T And laxt but nit least as a ppayer lne ha to keep in mind that , they should not gey depressed hen the feel that their game is going our of their hancs , whee inztead of that one has to fight untip he last mint of ths gake in orfer to decide whether the plaher is winenr or loswer .

S Thus by boosting themselves lead to success .

S Some insist that no one need bus or subway in the future .

S However , in my opinion , it rather useful to use public vehicles as time goes by based on two critical reasons .

S The more people have their own cars , the more space to park is needed .

T Unfvortunately , there is a certzin lkmit to spacw , so it is not possible that everyone use thdir far every dya especialy in mdga icties lik Seouo , Nea York , andr Loneon .

T It is more convenient to move from heree to there when yoh yake the bnus or subway becaise yo do n't hafe to woryr about youf car while workinv .

S The second reason is more important and obvious .
T Fhe scond reason is more impolrtant and ohvious .

S It is related to the environmental issues .
T It is relsted to the environmental isuses .

S Using public means help to protect the Earth from air pollution .
T Using puboic meahs help to protect thd Eadth fdom air pollution .

S There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes .
T There afe so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution caudes .

S The pollution is a kind of global issues of which people should consider seriously .
T Rhe polkution is a kin of glboal issues of which psople shiuld consider seriously .

S Without reducing personal vehicles , there is no solution of that problem .
T Withouf rdducing personal vehicles , fhere is no sokution of that problem .

S Surely , the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means .
T Surelg , tje governmsnt wilk fry to male a better system of puboic translort because they want citizens nor to uze their oan meahs .

S Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?

S Over decades music is the eternally art which develop day by day .

S And the instruments used in that local music may vary from sort to another .
T Abd the instruments used in that locak music msy vary form sprt to another .

S Because the people tend to make it from their own basic culture .
T Becaues the peoppe tend to make it from their own basix culture .

S For example , In Northern Sudan people have been used " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .

S The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods as the inquisition , the knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies since the knowledge through books had become a threat to continue underpinning their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .

S Although , some ideas were maintained ; ( for instance , the astronomy by Galileo Galilei ) the book - burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
T Although , skme ideas were maintained ; ( for instance , ghe astronomy by Galileo Galilei ) the bopk - burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if bokos werfe burned , the knowledge ckuld npt circulate .

S Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recovering significant books from Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues that spread their ideas to more people becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .

S In addition , it was produced the collective readings through the ecclesiastical method with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in the books to all social classes .
T In addition , it wxs produced the dollective reqdings through te ecclesiastical method wiht ths ourpose of disseminatibg the knowedge embodied in tje books to alol skcial classes .

S On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet in which the access to the knowledge is easier and faster leaving aside books .
T On the other hand , at present , peoplw dientify anothrr knowledge revoluion , he internt in which the access to fhe knowledve is easier and faster leaving aside books .

S From the above , as far as I am concerned , when Franklin Rosemont argues that " books can not be killed by fire .
T Frlm tue above , as fxr as I am concerned , whrn Franolin Rosemomt zrgues that " books acn not be killed by fre .

S People die , but books never die " it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time taking into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the entrance of the information ; for instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
T Peopld die , bit books never doe " it depends on the historical gime and the tecbnical revolutio of tjis gime taking into account that that knowledge uorising is alays acdompanied by a technical rveolution wgich suoports thue entrance of the information ; for instance , in the inquisigion , the knowledge was lilited because it was embidied in books .

S Although there was an oral tradition , the knowledge was accommodated to the political and religious thought of the speaker ; so , the most efficient and objective way to transmit the knowledge was by books and it was not possible because of the burning .
T Althouyh there was an oeal tradition , yhe knowpedge sas acommodated to the political axnd religious thought of tne speajer ; so , thw most effjcient and objective way to tranxmit rhe knowledge wzs by books and it aas not possiboe because of rhe burning .

S Nonetheless , with the invention of the printing type mobile , the knowledge was different for the access to it .
T Nonetheless , with the invesntion of rhe prijting type mobile , the knowlddge was different for tge avcess to it .

S If one book was burned , there were ten books more without restriction .

S In contrast , nowadays , the books are not necessary at all ; because of the internet network facilitate even more the knowledge .
T In xontrast , nowdays , he book are not necessary at all ; because of the internet nwtwork fqcilitate evem mire tye knowledge .

S That is why ; I could accommodate the phrase by Franklin saying that " the knowledge can not be killed by people because the knowledge is infinite . "

S So money , today , are really important in our life and in this case rich people are very lucky .

S They have much money to buy things that they need , and things that they do n't need .

S So it seems that these people can live happily and peacefully , without problems , but this is not true .

S In fact above all about rich families the children are in trouble with their family , above all when they have their parents separated .
T In fact above all aboit rich families the chikdren ars in grouble wityh their familh , aobve all wehn rhey have their parents separated .

S Also most of the children grow up spoiled because of the large amount of money of their family , and they grow up with the thing that they want more and more things .

S 4 . Do you learn more at school or on placement ?
T 4 . Do you lezrn omre at scholo or on placement ?

S Nearly every education will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
T Nealry every sducation aill aplly a poacement in tyeir eduction program , to get the skills and experience of thei pjpils to a higner kevel .

S But , is it also that necessary ?
T Bu , is it azlso thaf necessary ?

S Where do you actually learn more , at school or on placement ?
T Ahere do uou actually lsarn lore , at schopl or on placejent ?

S First of all before arguing this question , it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same education and school .
T First of all befoee arguing tuis uqestion , it is omportant to compare the answers aith people ho zre on the sane education and school .

S Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
T Because there can be a oot of diffgerences in the charactrristics of those two subjects .

S After that , having said I can clearly write down my opinion about this question .
T Afted fhat , havnig asid I ca clearly write down my opijion about thia question .

S I think that at my school the balance of this civil education is n't right and fair at all .
T I hink thar at my school rhe valance of tuis xivil edsucation is n't right anc fair at alo .

S Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
T Because the numbers of theoty lessolns about oue discipline are by fsr majy hohrs kess than I expected to gwt .

S This makes it nearly a complete self study education , which should n't be that way at this level of schooling .
T This maks it nearl a complete self study educatino , which shouod n't be tyat wxy at this levrl of scholling .

S So because of this , the placement is always a step ahead to choose for at this question because they will teach you directly more .
T So because of this , tne placement is always a step ahesd to chooss for at this qiestion bscause hey will teacn you directly more .

S In addition , on placement the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
T In additikn , on placelent the thimgs you learn are alwqys ficused on thar particular job and compan .

S So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .
T So rhe details and infirmation thdy teacb yku will be more useful in youf fiture carrer than tne random information about tje subjecst at school .

S So this makes it already two against zero for the placement .
T So this maks it alrerady two against zero fkr the placement .

S And finally the third and last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at school .
T And finally thw tgird and oast reasons wy I think you leran more on placement than at sdhool .

S When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are off course useful for your knowledge but , the way of following this lessons are not a natural work pattern .
T When you go to school yku have to follpow lessons whoch are offr ckurse useful foir your knowledge but , the way of foklowing this lessons ate nto a natiral work pattwrn .

S In a natural work pattern you have to do , also like school , your tasks but the communication is also an important part of it .
T In a naturql work pattedn you ave to do , also like schpol , youf taske butf tje communication is also an omportant par of it .

S This important way communication lacks at school , because it 's a nearly a one direction way of communicating from the teachers .
T Thus inportant way communicatipn lscks at zchool , because it 's a nearly a one direction way of communicating ftom the teachers .

S You have to make a test and they will give you a rating for it .
T You ave to maked a test snd tgey will give yo a ratihg folr it .

S While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
T While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve ksills .

S So with the these three arguments all going in the same direction to explain my opinion at this question , I think it has not to be explained any further now .
T So wigh the tfhese three arguments all toing in tye samw rirection to expkain my opjnion at ghis question , I thibk it huas nor to be explained ny futher now .

S Over the last years , people 's attidute has been changing .
T Ovr ths ladt uears , poeple 's sttidute hxs beeb changing .

S The necessity declined that working and living needs to be fairly close to each other .
T Fhe nscessity declined tnat wrking and living needs to be fairly cpose to each othef .

S Managing long distances seems to be normal nowadays .
T Managing lony distances seems to be noraml nowaday .

S Moreover , people enjoy being unbound and therefore , they are willing to travel long distances .
T Moreovwr , peiple enjoy being unbond abd therefore , they are willing to trave long distaznces .

S However , public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience .

S A lot of public services were cut down in order to save money .
T A lot of public services were cur fown in order to sabe mlney .

S Therefore , busses are not running as often or reglulary as they used to .
T Therrfore , busses are bot ruhning as offen or regluoary as theh used to .

S Especially in the countryside , public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency .

S Consequently , people prefer taking the car .

S For instance , there is no need to change the bus .

T It is also more convenient to go to work by var as you can leave whewn it suts ypu and not becuase the last bua is runhing .

S In addition , the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing .

S After having had a long day at work , people long to get home as quick as possible .

S Furthermore , ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years .

S Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car .
T Travelling by train as a family or gruop is ofyen fsr morr expensive thah yaking rhe dar .

S Nevertheless , public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car .
T Neverrheless , public trqnsport still provides seveal advaxntages in compaison to taking the car .

S For example , it is no parking space required .
T ofr exalple , it is no larking spacr required .

S Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
T Sitting in the bs cxn also be quite relaxing , especilaly considering the heavg traffic durijg rush houts .

S Finally , it still provides a useful way of travel for all who do n't have a driving licence .
T Finally , it still prpvides a useful waay of travep fod all who do n't have a driving licece .

S In the end , the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a rosieer future .
T In thd enc , the service of public tansport neexs to change to qttract more psople and to have a rosieer futurd .

S It has been observed , for example , that increasing the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of congestion severe urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .

S The optimistic opinion , some people object that " no future for public transport " saying that the future of public transport is clear and the prof of that in ancient there was n't any transport and by the time people starting to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle , cart , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars until the plane , so they hope that the transportation be best by the creative people .

S In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely .

S In the new buildings there are usually dustbins for each material ( glass , plastic , etc . ) , and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins .

T So , almosr everybody , sho libes in Budqpest , hqs yhe chznce to usae this corm of rubbish collectioh .

S It would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible , and there are factories , where they use this technique , but in Budapest we usually do n't use much recycled goods recently .
T It woyld be logical that we recycle hte gzrbage as much as possible , ahd there ars factodies , where tuey ues his technique , bit in Budapest we usually do n't yse much recycled giods recentlyg .

S Then , what makes the Weeping Angels frightening ?

S To figure out the factors , uncanny theory is used .
T To figure out tbe factors , uncanny theory is used .

S This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - living as life - likeness .

S In Blink , Weeping angels ' uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
T In Bink , Qeeping angel ' uncannh rtaits ans awkwad backgrounds in the drama mke audience have a scarg and unfamiliar sensation .

S It is hard to read the Weeping Angels ' thoughts and emotions from their ash - pale face .

S They look unnatural , in spite of their similar appearances with human .

S The angels move and attack free , only when people blink their eyes or turn around their sight away .

S However , people blink their eyes several times a minute and they are hardly aware of blinking .
T Hoewver , people blink their ees severfal tiems a minute ane ghey aee hardly awqre of blinking .

S After the Doctor 's warning , they may not turn our back , look away , and blink as we are protagonists of the episode .

S Then , strangely , blinking our eyes becomes conscious behaviour .

S Moreover , there are good scene settings to make people not blink by immersing audience in that situation .
T Moeeover , there axre goodx scene seftings to maie peopls notf blink by ikmersing audience in tnat situation .

S Why do they not move , even if their prey is near ?
T Wgy do thet ont mve , even if tehir preu is neae ?

S The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously .
T The reason is thxt TV vjewers wafch them simultaneously .

S To change the pose of the horrific statues technically , directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally , for a moment .
T To cyange the pose of hte horrific statues technically , drectors hude ths anhels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angela behind tbe actors through panning camefas hkrizontally , for a momnet .

S At last , directors fade out the scenes flicking out the light bulb in basement for maximizing the threat of Weeping Angels !

S At last , Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar .

S Charles Dickens and Emily Bronte are both Victorian writers .
T Charles Dickens and Wmily Nronte aer blth Victorian wruters .

S Their novels have much in common : first of all the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heighs by E.

S There is also a lot in contrast , most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities while Emily prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , in fact Charles mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of lower classes and the bad consequences of the industrialisation , instead Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prude .
