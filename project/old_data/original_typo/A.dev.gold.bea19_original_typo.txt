S Today public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
T Today punlic transport stillo play an important role in transport system anc it will keep on in the fruture .

S Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
T Because publicf transport is a cots effective ajd better ersource allocation in mass rtansport zystem .

S Also people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .
T Als peple nee not to suffer hkgh oprating cist running hteir oan car .

S But it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .
T Bht it xan usee a cheaper wqy goiny to thsir destination especiakly it is far away from home .

S For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .

S Instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .
T Insead it will be comlon to buy an air ticket anf rice on public palne .

S In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
T In my opinion I think that public transpirt in future is going to continue to be jsed because there re a loy of people tgat coes n't uave enough koney to lay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continhe to jave future but people are going to use more the dars then bis or undergroun .

S If we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .
T If we thin about it the car is better bexause we do n't need to wair fot them has we rae waiting fir thr buhs or underground but in another wa car cjst mors money tha th publiv trnsport .

S By car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .

S If I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
T If I haf it to choosd betwewn both transportation I think I probably chose cvar becauss it is bwtter flr me to go by car ten to go by nus .

T bht if we are taoking wbot traelling across you cuty , woyld you prefer public transport or car ?

S i think that this is the guestion for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n't like to travell with another people .

T so , on my opniion , even after 10 year the public transoort wilk be crossing on kur strert wih eniugh amount of passangers
