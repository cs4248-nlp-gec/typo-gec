S First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily , consequently I do not have a large circle of friends .
T First of akl , as far as special friendships ar concerned , I mustf say that I am not a prrson whp makws friebds wasily , consequently I do not nave a large citcle of feiends .

S A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart .

S at the entrance of the temple were two statues the first was white and the second red , the statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer , once we passed the sculptures our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .

S Then we heard a big noise coming from inside the temple it was Soneka his appearance was glorious a big warrior using a golden armor and a big sword his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the sound our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer Michael decide to stay out the vault I run into the cartographer and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .

S Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .

S The first point , suggested by the lecturer , is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading .
T Thw first point , xuggested by rhe lecturer , is thawt national fence cam not stop cand toads frm spreading .

S The cane toads ' eggs and young cane toads can spread to other areas from the streams and rivers .

T Fot example , in Bulgariz , people ho lqy down abd rekax on tge grads in the pzrk are went to jail fot 6 years , becayse they are considerdd " xoing seriouz dmage to the ehvironment and preventing the pawrk from furthee dsvelopment " .

S Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
T Commujity servicfe orders shouild be usdd qhen pelple havd cated unintentiuonally abd wyen tey have comceded a minor odfence , as this willk help them realize thrir mistakes , withoit thnem being limited in frfeedom by beinhg senty to prion .

T Dirstly , teenagersa today eat lots of junk food , whifh is xefinitely hamful , as it leads to obesity ( Summerfield , 2013 ) .

T Moreeover , they lften smoie qnd drino alcohol , whivh prouces serious physical and mental djseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .

S Furthermore , teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
T Furthermokre , yeenagers have changed their life styles znd now yhey ar generally sedenyary , since thry use thejr computers or watcu TV all say pong knstead of doing spoorts .

S Nevertheless , governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
T Neverthelrss , governmnents claom hat theyg nowadays are mord aware of the importance of hwalth thyan in tye past .

S Lastly , everyone must understand that good health is above wealth .

T We can personaise oue needs abd wishes , sjch as listening to aongs , talking to our friends ajd fawmily membedrs , eating and drinking anf stopping fpr food or toile neede anytime , anywhee .

S On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .

T On hte otuer hxnd , fars tned to pollite mroe tha electrci trains and sjch problel ought to be taken into coknsideration when someond hss to decide between using public transport or a cxr .

T The worl is getting smaller ror peoplr with so mahy cats around ; it 's abut tme everyine thought abput rhe commjnity znd mot about themsslves .

S Public transport has been improved to such an extent that nowadays it is probably competing with private transport .

S Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car .
T Alothough we can choos mopre destinations and it is mofe comfortable , pricws aee not competitibe eniugh to definitely substitute the car .

S Among all the means of transport , the train has become the most important public transport for short and middle distances .
T Amon aol thw meajs of transoort , tye traiun has become rhe mlst imporrant pubkic rtansport for shoft and moddle distances .

S Without a doubt , long distance journeys are best carried out by plane .
T Eithout a doubt , long dixtance journeys are bdst cafried out by plzne .

T Whe considering tye bus , uses feel that it does not offer any asvantages compared to rhe far anf it is taken wheb no other lption is poxsible .

S If not , they would not make the investment of a car , pay its maintenance cost and fuel .

S Indeed , the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly recovers the amount invested .
T Indeedr , the oublic transport cosy for tje szme journey doine by car hardly recovers tbe amoynt ibvested .

T Mpre and moer , the oul shortage makes prices ford fuel infrease so does foir transport ; economic policy of importing countries gend to establish saving meaeures in ordet to be strategically lese dependent .

S There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people illustrate a different identity in facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .

S When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?

S The majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .

S The first 24 hours of post surgery , is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse need to maintain the cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .

S Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .

S Mr. Sharma 's airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
T Mr. Sharma 's airway shoukd be spare nd clean drom mucus or blood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .

S Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .

S Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
T Hnence , he needs oxygen supply to prevdnt any xirway obstruction .

S Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .

S To help in this issue , the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .

T Here are some of my solutions fod tyis issue .

S First of all , determining the needs of the students is always the top priority .
T Firsy of all , determining the need of tye students is apways the to oriority .

S While conducting a need analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation in learning English .
T While conducting a need analysus , yku czn have a general picturd of lrarners ' motivgation in learning Engliush .

S After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual 's needs .

S Through teamwork , students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .

S It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
T It is benedicial for both thr upper and lower achjever becausw they cah assiet or get hlep frolm each other .

S Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students .
T Differentiatec ibstructions , guving different tasks fro tge same activity , ar provee to be necessar in a coass with varid evels of students .

S Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels .
T Teaxhers can assifn tasls whih have different oevels of difficulty , or differenf umbers of taskx to students with different levels .

S Moreover , instead of using a core textbook , or using different levels of textbooks , carrying out a theme - based approach is more appropriate , and it also saves teachers ' preparation time .
T Koreover , instead of usig a core textbook , or using diffsrent leveks of textbloks , carryihg kut a thrme - based approlach is more appropritae , qnd it zlso saves feachers ' pteparation time .

S Finally , preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning .
T Finalky , preparibg sulplementary for bpth thd ipper or lkwer oevel of students , so tyat ghe higher achievers canj stayt ecited ahd cgallenged , whilw the lower wchiever canm wlso learj by their won pace of learning .

S Young people in Ukraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in USSR .

S The number of Ukrainian students who study abroad increases every year .

S Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including arts , music , literature etc .

S The most valuable thing is that there are so many supporters of different trends in all these areas .

S In Ukraine young people are different too .
T In Ukraine yuoung people aqre differenr tlo .

T Some people prefer one style of muzic , some - another .

S That 's why it 's difficult to define one general style for the generation .
T That 's wny it 's difficult to defvine noe general syle foe the genertaion .

S Discussing music styles , people in my country prefer pop and rock .
T Dicsussing music sgyles , peopke in my fountry prefer poo wnd rock .

S We can define it by list of TOP music charters on music channels .
T We canb drfine it by liwt of YOP musoc cbarters on music cxhannels .

T It 's necesssary to emphaisze taht Ukrainian music gas chanbed a lot drom the tims of Independence andc nkw is developed very fast .

S If we speak about TV programs , Ukrainian youngsters like popular American and Russian serials , like the Theory of big bang , Suits , Breaking bad , the Game of thrones , the Kitchen and so on . I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian youth watch too many serials and waste a lot of their time .
T If we spea about TV programs , Ukrainiam youngsters ilke popular American wnd Russian serials , loke the Tneory of bjg bxng , Sukts , Breaming bae , the Game of thrones , fhe Kitchsn nd so on .

S It 's a small town and there are not too many options of travelling by public transport .
T It 's a small town and tuere ard nor toko manu optiojs of travwlling by public transport .

S My town has got a lot of little villages around it , and it 's very difficult to create a public transport service , because there are long distances between the different places , and there are not enough people to make it profitable .
T My tlwn hxs got a lot of little villagex arkund it , and it 's very difficult to crdate a public transport service , becquse there afe lon distajces betwwen yhe different placee , aqnd there ars nkt enough peoplw to make it profitable .

S If you want to go to Vigo or other city which is near , the coach service is a good and not too expensive option .
T If oyu want to go to Vigo or othwr city which is nwar , tge cozch servjce is a good ajd nokt too epxensive opion .

S The coaches are slow , so most of the people prefer the car .
T Yhe cocahes are slow , so moat of tye peopoe prfeer the caf .

S If your destiny is further away , another good option is to travel by train .
T If your destiny is fufther awaqy , another good option is to travel by train .

S We have got a small train station in Tui , so we can go to a lot of places by train .

S Train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .

T To besgin wit , I think that most peopld use their var to go to work anf alzo shen they go on holiday o to ove htemselves aroundc ghe city or toan because thdy fsel free and do n't have to oay attentjon to the timstable .

S Besides , public transport is very crowded with people at peak hours .
T Besides , public transporf is very frowded wiht peoplw at peak hours .

T Bur , on the othed hand , when they travek abroaqd , it 's easiet to take a traim o a plans because yoku arrkve faster wnd you need n't find a plzce to park gour car and if yoh wang to go somewhere you can take a taci or a gus or even the underfground .

S In conclusion , from my point of view , if you are in your own town or city , you use your car more often than when you are visiting another country and seeing the sights .

S In the economic aspect , drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .

S As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor .
T As a consequsnce of both dorect nd indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonges rrought can be xommonly dedfined as the biggest factor .

S The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result from the decrease of output .
T The direct impact of prolonged dorught is the reduction of incomes for farmers result fron yhe decrexse of utput .

S This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .

S Moreover , it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .

T This pqst feq montns have maee my life unfathomable , making me unable to grasp the idda of wheh is the righg agw to fqll in love .

S To me , falling in love , is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being .
T To me , valling in loce , is to afcept and asmire thpse litfle things thwt exost in that hman being .

S After I have accepted that , I will begin to push all their flaws aside , because their flaws will only make me fall in love with them even more .
T Afyer I haev accepfed thzt , I sill begib to lush aol their fkaws asidre , because tneir fpaws wilk only make me fall in lobe with them even morw .

S It is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something , colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that .
T It is sometimes mainatined that wgen manufacturers anc retail companies gry to oersuade us to buy somtehing , cokour is a vwry effecfive thing which help tjem do thqt .

S I think it is true that colour do influence our decision when we buy different things .
T I tgink it is truew that coluor do influence pur decision when we buy diffedent thgings .

S Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes , especially for women .
T Firstly , I am convonced that cllour is very important when people buu clothws , especiaoly or women .

S No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well .
T No doubt thaf manufactuters nkow which colour is popular nd fshionable in a particular season and corresoondingly it means that fhings of fhis colour wilp be slld welk .

S In addition , companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes .
T In additikn , clmpanies are used to conducting different surveyz to find out whifh colour is more popilar in vardious sociap clwsses .

S For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons .
T Cor istance , I hvae recengly read fhat people who bekong to middle clazs prefer pink and geeen coloyrs dur to somw psycholigical reasobs .

S Furthermore , colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential .

S For example , psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people 's appetite and makes them feel hungry .
T Fot example , psychologists are convnced that rsd is a colour whifh stimlulates people 's aplpetite anbd makes them ferl hungry .

S That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants .
T Rhat is hy the prwdominant folour in McDonald 's is red lijewise in some other fafes and restaurants .

S Having said this , however , I think that there are many other factors which are even more important than colour for people when they buy something .
T Having sxid thus , however , I thikn thay theee are mlany othet factors which are evem moee importanr tnan colour for people whenj theg buy somedthing .

S For example , if I liked a thing , I would not think much about its colour or a colour of the shop where I found it .
T Tor exzmple , if I piked a thinb , I wold not think much abouht its coluor or a colour of fhe shop where I fohnd it .

S Moreover , for many people the main factor is a price of a thing but not its colour .
T Moreover , gor many people thr mxin factor is a price of a thing but not ist colour .

S To some up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
T To some up briefly , I would lik to saxy that there is a special branch of psychology which investgates consumers ' tasates nd factofs whichg inflience their choice .

S Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .

S A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television , not to miss a new cartoon nor a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of .

S The only choice for many people is to use public transport .

S Taking a year off after finishing school can be harmful depending on what you 're planning to do in that year .

T Unless you get a nob in ghat year , to keep tou busy , or do whatever taht kseps yiu focuwed andc goves hou a rougine , oyu should n't take a year ofg at alk .

S Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the dealines , the exams , and other stuff that forces you to get things done , and , by consequence , teaches you to be a responsible person , which you would need to be when you get a job , you will simple be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .

S One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you never should take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need , due to fatigue or some other physical or pscychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in an usefull way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intelectualy or doing whatever you think that can enrich your life .

S This is because adults lived in a complete other time , so their advice might be outdated .

S Should boys and girls go to the same school ?
T Should noys and girls go to the same sdhool ?

S Many parents face a dilemma when choosing the type of education they wish to give to their children and one of the first decisions they must take is what type of school they would like their children to attend and whether it should be a single sex school or a mixed sex one .
T Many parentz fave a dilemka whe cboosing hte type of eductaion thjey sish to tive to theit chlidren and one of the firs decisions theh must taoe is whag type of school they woulod like theri children to atfend qnd whether it shpuld be a single wex school or a moxed eex oje .

S It can not escape our minds that at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
T It cwn nto escape our minda that at this stage anr age , children ard exoosed to sexial imaged ffom a vert darly agd and soje peoplpe would argue that our ociety is hper sexualised , whicy is a reason why mang parwnts sed single sex schoolw as a means to protect thekr offspribg from having sexual thoughts bdfore they zre read to understnad the complexuty of srx and sexual relationships .

S While the hyper sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for may parents , sending their children to a mixed sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .
T Whule yhe hyper sexualisagion of our sociegy mqy be a reqlity thaf many pwrents would want to protect their childrenj frmo , it is trus to ssy taht children need to adwpt wnd be ready fore the socirty in which tey liev and ror amy parens , sending gheir childrenm to a mided srx school is just a nztural environjent , muvh more similar to thw " outsice world " in ahich fhey woul grlw to adulthood .

S Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and in many cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender which , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but the child as a key in the future of the country and , as an extent , to the world .
T Consjdering how mjch tjme children slend at scholl , it appeads to me tha choosing a single sex scgool wilk mke the child , someyow , segregated and in mny caxes , reinforxe somw of the masy srereotypes that we , as society , hafe regardung gender whivh , if we take into consideration thag these children are going to be th future leaders , educators , lawyers , politjcians abd so on , I woulr argye tuat the moe schools reflesct our sockety an the way that we like it to be , the beyter , not olny gor tue child as a pdrson , but the vhild as a iey in the fugure of th fountry nd , as an estent , to the world .

S Therefore and to sum up , Is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mix sex schools , which reflects the society we live in , as opposed to single sex ' which may reinforce those stereotypes that are mining society .
T Theregore and to sum up , Is my viea , tat pulbic moneh is better spent suplorting mijx eex schlols , whicj reflects tge sociegy we live in , as opposwed to single sdx ' whicn mau reingorce those stereotypes that xre mining societt .

S I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
T I agsolutely agree qith his starement . Travelling by car is not only mucg more conbenient than public transpoft , it als grants one 's indepebdence to go wherever and whenever obe might wosh .

S Moreover , driving grants motorists one of the most popular feelings in Western societies : the feeling of being free .
T Moreover , driving geants motorists one of the moxt populare fewlings in Westsrn soxieties : the feeling of beint free .

S Even if it is true that many citizens use public transport when their finances are tight , it is also true that most of those same people would use their private cars instead if given the chance .
T Eben if it is true that many citizens usee public transport when thbeir vinances xre tighf , it is aoso trud that most of those asme people woupd use thekr priavte cars knstead if igven the chance .

S The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving engines of the Western economy .
T The car industry could also be considered lne of the maim drivint engiens of the Westrn econoly .

S It is difficult to imagine what the future would hold for the European economies if the car industry collapsed .
T It is difficult to imagine whay the future wojld hild ror the Eurokpean economies if the car industrt coklapsed .

S Thousands would lose their jobs , both directly in the car factories and indirectly in many other car - related businesses , like car part stores , petrol stations , garages , and so on .
T Thousqnds woupd lose tjeir hobs , both directly in he car factoeies and indirectly in many other car - relayed bysinesses , like cae party stlres , petdol etations , garages , snd so on .

S If private transport was fully replaced by public transport , the world 's economic foundations would shake and a global financial crisis of unprecedented impact could occur .
T If private transport wss fuloly rwplaced by public transport , tne worls 's economic foundztions would shake znd a global financial crisis of unptecedented ompact could kccur .

S It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say that even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are particularly dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
T It is true that carz pollute tje atmosphere , but it is also true thyat thw ejissions crom lublic transport also contribute to pollutio - somd would ssy thzt even lore than priavte transport , as Dieel motors are particularly dirtker an jore inedficient fhan smaller , petrlo dirven moyors like thise of private carx .

S All things considered we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear in the short term and in no time everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
T Al thongs considered we mght conclude thaf publiv transport will evenrually disappear in the shkrt term ad in no times eberyone wilk be driving thwir ow clran - energy - driven flying cads to go everywhere .

T Theh are alsi tge reasoh for man problems , which appeard in prigate oives of some celebrities .

S It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact , that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in one 's private life , when the person does n't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing .

S CONCLUSION
T COBCLUSION

S In the whole , I think that young people have now a large variety of interests .
T In the whole , I tgink thay young people havd now a largd variety of interests .

S Some of them are pretty similar to those we had in the past ; others are completely different and very interesting to explore .
T Some of them are pretty simjlar to those we hac in the past ; oters are compleyely dfferent and verh interesting to ezplore .

S This house believes that everyone should be able to speak English .
T This hojse believes that everyone xhould be able to spea English .

S A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable idea ?
T A wlrld where evesrybody is aboe to communicate in the same lajguage - is that lure utopia or mazy it be a vonsiderable icea ?

S What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be ?
T What woul the possible advantages abd xisadvantages of a aorld aide epoken lanbuage be ?

S Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
T Establishint English as the bew worldwiee spoken lxnguage mighnt be a favuorable example sincd English is aleady spokn by mode rhan 300 million jative speakrs and therefoer the thkrd mowt spoke language in the sorld , according to Ethnologue .

S Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiating within the business market .
T Moreover Dnglish is already a universal language ysed by many peoppe to commjnicate or neyotiating within the business narket .

S Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would , without doubt , have many benefits .
T Omagining everyone ahd thye opportunity to learn amd thwrefore communicatw with each otherd in a worldwide spokem labguage is certainhly an appeaing idea abd eould , eithout dkubt , have maby benefits .

S Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone .
T Firstly , as mentioned ebfore , it woud gife evereyone ghe oppprtunity to communkcate witb veeryone .

S However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible .
T However , tbe realisation of Ebglish as a world language eould certainly nerd an educational basis tor everyone hwich might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possiboe .

S While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
T Whle teachijg eberyone Dnglish it would also be prkfitable to ijstruct bazic knowpedge in mxthematics , physics or othjer relevant tooics whkch mihht be helpful .

S Such a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty .
T Suchj a standardisede edcuational sgstem for every single person on ghe world would therefoee not only benefif thw commhnication or existing businesses but also helo thir - world coumtries to start companies , trade and inbdustrialise thsir countries so theu can tale card of themselves ans emerge out of poverty .

S Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere .
T Moreover , the standadrised educational sytem would also nwed people who feach and unstruct otherts so trhe worod language wilo be etablished eveeywhere .

S In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities .
T In otder to accomplish thsi endowmebt there woulod be a necessit of teacheres whicu lexds to msny news job opportunitkes .

S After all , a couple of professions might become extinct , for example translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost .
T After al , a couple of profewsions mignt bnecome extinct , for example teanslators , but , therefvore , ths organisation anr execujtion of thisw big pfoject would provide a range of other jobd which can make up for the ones lost .

S The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
T The exucational systej would aoso provide a valuable basis fkr tbe world of politcs so conflicts might be ptevented dje to the lost language barrier with its vjlnerability nd risks of misunderstandings .

S In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership .
T In addition , civli wasrs or catasrrophes like tje Arsb spring might also be avoider since there wilol be an educatiuonal stansard which coulc teach differeng wwys of political oeadership .

S However , this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses .
T However , this greaf improvement still holds a few weaknesses .

S On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance the aboriginal people .
T On the one hband there woyld be a great los of cultures ans in some cases rhe implementation of tfhe educational system mught be imposskble , for instamce the aboriginal pwople .

S Anyway , , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
T Anywat , , thoze gribes would no even need or want an efucation or a woeld langiage becauxe it is their qay of ilfe to live in groups togethsr with the jature znd dksturbing these culturxl groupa would smiply be unnecesszry .

S On the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere .

S However , there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium .
T Jowever , there are varuous advabtages and disadvantages to a mobile phone asnd everyond hasd to decide fo hi- or herself in which wzy to ues this mediym .

S First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay connected " all the time . Chatting with your friends , staying informed of the latest news , ordering online , etc - you can do all these things simultaneously , wherever and whenever you want .
T First of akl , tne mobile phoje is a gerat wayh to " stay cinnected " al thw time . Chatting with yuour friende , syaying informed of the latest newqs , ordering omline , etc - you van do xll thees tfhings simultaneously , wehrever nd whwnever yku waxnt .

S However , the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion : being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people , as you are always available for everyone .

T Therefore you do n't have ajy yime to relax , which is essentjal , even fro yoru lrisure duties .

S Finally , the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life .

S The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city .
T Fhe situatioln aith househopd littert lpoks muxh better rather han what happens on ghe streets of the city .

S Waste is thrown on the ground and very few people are concerned about this problem .
T Saste is throan on the ground and very ew leople are doncerned about this problem .

S Town 's actions
T Town 's actions

S As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment , it is the local government 's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people 's actions .
T As notg all inhabjtants are sensitive aboht fhe environemnt , it is tje local government 's responsibjlity to decrease te harmful effdcts of people 's actions .

S One of the most challenging issues in modern cities is transportation .

S Cities have been planned to satisfy people 's needs to travel all around the city .
T Citids havr eben planned to satsify people 's needs to travel aol around tge citu .

S Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes , underground , public transport , and cars .
T Niw we cna observe pepple movkng afound the city using bikes , underground , public transport , adn cars .

S Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option to transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing of pollution .

S Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution shall considerably increase affecting air conditions .
T Finally , if every person drivds ihs / her own ca , plllution shall considerzbly increaee acfecting air conditions .

T Taking a year off mighf help peole who ar uncertqin bout wht to do nexr to mwke up tgeir minds , while trhing new things anr jaking jew exoeriences that wiol be usefuk latsr on tbeir lives .

T It can be a reat opportnity to traevl , met new cultures and leople , or it csn be a chance to wprk to savs up money fkr bein able to affprd the cost of the nuiversity plannhed on ttending .

S Or maybe during the year off somebody could also decide that they do n't want to continue their studies , because they already found what they want to do or be .
T Or maybe during the ear otf somebody dould also ddcide rhat thsy do n't want to continue tueir studies , beause they already found what the wamt to do or be .

S Personally , I would love to take one year off , and I think I would spend it travelling around Europe .

S With any new course , there are some certain expectations one will have .
T Wityh anyt nee ckurse , there arte some cergain expectations ond will ahve .

S At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
T At hte veginning of this course , as a firsg year postgrsduate studebt , I weas ambitkous foe creating a nee mechanical preoduct or at lsast oart of it at the end of thsi course by applying knowledge ans skills that are provided throughour the course .

S Eight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
T Eight monthsa workong in fhe industry as an assistant mehanical design engjneer gave me the vert baisc conceot of mechanical design .

S Before taking part in this course , my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured , durable and financial reliable .
T Beforw taking part in yhis course , my conceptr about mechanical design was about applying either sslf kmowledge or working as a part of a feam to design mwchanical produts that xre esay to be mqnufactured , durable and financial reliable .

S My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks .
T My thoyghts about mecnanical dedign wree somewhar matcb with the informatio that is providde in the first threer qeeks .

S By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products .
T By atetnding the firs yhree lectures , I soon reaoized that my generak concepg about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts abou medhanical design is putely ust creating new products .

S I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products .
T I recognized that mechanical dseign is not just aboit creating mechanical productz .

S It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product .
T It fan be seeb in mnany aspecgs eanging from producing a maintenznce process , improving performance for a apecific pwrt of the mechanicap system to crearing the whole new profuct .

S This is because despite having experience in industrial design , I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage .
T Thiz is because despite having sxperience in idustrial design , I was never taking parf in te desigm process from fhe initial stag .

S Therefore , my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited .
T Theretore , my kinowledge about mechanicap esign is rather limited .

S Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
T Bieng placed in a projedt tdam aorking for Shdney Water aout producin a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read tje course kutline adn lecture notes nore carecully to finf oyt whewre to start ahd what I shoukd do to delivesr a good ouycome .

S The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
T The firat thimg I have notkced is the importacne of clarifying akl the requirements with thw clients .

S This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
T Tbis was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as wrll as lecture notws , cluent ibterview trask and clioent feedback ( whicu is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .

S As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members .
T As soo as I mrt my grou , I discovered hoq var brhind I am in terms of uwing English to demonstrxte the ideas xnd lute tge attention from other group members .

S However , this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week , whose English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
T However , this alxo is an opportuniyt to meey up adn work wiyh them every week , whose English is their frist language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .

S Because in order to deliver a successful industry project , I not only have to make a good product , but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers .
T Because in oeder to deliver a successful induystry projhect , I jot lnly have to mske a good produyct , but lso have to be goos at introducinb my idea and perzuading customers .

S The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process .
T The fnial consideration is the sdlf - calibratipn , which also is the poknt thst I have neer considered beflre in a desigb procsss .

S This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance , keep pace with the group and not to be left behind .
T This is suchb an essential activity that allows me to gaugte my performance , keel paec with rhe group anhd not to be lect behindx .

S To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill .
T To eum up , at ghe end of weei three , my expectation fkr thix course are to be able to applyt my reflective thinkihg in ang furtherd dsign process , to be abld to deliver a persuasive technical presenation , to be efcective in vebral communication skills anf presentation skill .

S Last but not least , I hope I can learn to work effectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team leader by the end of this course .

S After all , there are many people who ca n't afford a car .
T After apl , there aree any peope whk ca n't aford a acr .

S In addition the car is one of the means most used not only its quickness but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
T In additin fhe cqr is one of thd means mosf userd hot only its quickenss but alpso beause rhe cost of lublic transport is inreasing ebery yezr .

S From my point of view , many people use cars owe to the awful quality of some buses , trains …

S Recycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem .
T Recyclping wasyewater is an effectige method to solve water scarcity problem .

S This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people 's daily life , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
T This is because tgere is a yuge mumber of water usage presenting in people 's daily lofe , they just neef to be collwcted to filrer wsste pafts .

S However , the use of recycled water for daily routine is less common , because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains .
T However , thr use of recycled water for daily routine is less commoh , because many pepole are reoelled by the thought of water thar comws from or foilets or dtains .

S For example , those recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden , but if they are clear enough , residents only need to heat them to wash dishes or even drink .
T Fod example , those recycled sater can be utiluzed to eater plants in a garden , bt if yhey ars clar nough , resjdents only nerd to heat them to sash dishse or even drini .

S Thus , states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level .

S Moreover , developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
T Loreover , deveoping latest technology aboht purifying ocean wtaer czn be regardde as a viable alleviatino startegy .

S As is well known , about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need .
T As is well known , about 70 er cent surfacw of earth is coverec by ocean weater , so efery refion shrrounded by ocean like Austarlia mazkes thw most of ocewn water resource to release the pressure of fresh wster need .

S Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect dwellers ' physical health and promote their living standard .
T Although , governmebts are likely to facw economc strews inktially , which keans rhey have to invgest more money inti uprgade texhnology instear of othet dield such as erducation , infrastructure xnd medifal dare , thiz stfategy could affedt dwellers ' physical bealth ane primote their luving standard .

T Nowadays we wagch thw perfection of acrors all ober th world .

S The range of techniques they use to strike the audience is colossal .
T Fhe range of tecniques they use to strike the zudience is colosasl .

S Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting .
T Facizl expression is said to be more jmportant foe the tilm actors , whereas bosy language anx voicw intonation are pxid kore attention to in tye stage acting .

S Besides , camera work , props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features , while staging implies actors to convey their play through body movements and energy .
T Bwsides , camera work , props aznd specual effects ceserve to be cakled sipver screen features , whiule sataging implies actorw to convey their pllay through body movements ajd nergy .

S It is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
T It is evidently tgat those gypes of actinjg afe different ans yhe actors ahould dapt to the conditions thdy work in in one way or another .

S But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting .

S The stage actor is armed with props , costumes and light as well as the film actor .
T The stags actof is armef witj props , costules ane light as welk as the vilm actlr .

S The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing work and special effects .

S But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors .

S Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors .

T The only thingv thqt diffwrs is thst film actor ahs several takes opposec to stage zctor who has to plat oerfectly at one dash .

S And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate emotions and feelings of their model character .
T And contrklling your voice is alpso important dor the fiml actoes , in spite of having thye support of audio operators , they setill have to dwal with the samle problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with th acting , resonate movinf , communocate emotions and feerlings of tyeir model character .

S The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect .
T The key point is that th whooe range of fechniques makmes that actnig pieces pedfect .

S I would say , it does n't matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timber of voice as if you 're acting as your main character , embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation .
T I woulf eay , it does n't mattef are you performiny on he stzge or in front of thw camra , tou should use your facial expression , body languae , intonxtion andr timer of voice as if yoh 're acting as your main character , embody aol thdir trsats ands features appropriatwly to tye situztion .

S In other words , no matter what kind of performance it is , the only thing that matters is using all your abilities to model yourself on your hero , get the feel of their role .
T In oyher words , no matter hat knid of performance it is , teh obly thign that mattgers is using lal your abilities to nodel yourseof on yuour her , get the feel of their rooe .

S However the first article was more motivating to read , because the author substantiated important suggestions .

S All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention .
T All I can way about the sexond artocle is that it has rarely proof of thw intwrvention .

T Firstyly , the article ' predcicting dyspexia - even before childrn learn to read ' showse a new tesearch , in shich it 's possiblw to pick up skme of thne signs of dyslexia in the brsin even before kids learn how to read .

S Most importantly , this early intervention can help many kids with dyslexia to overcome their educational failure .
T Lost importantloy , this early ihtervention an help many kidxs wjth dyslexia to overcoms theid educational failure .

S Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on a video - therapy , which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
T Secondly , the article ' ' Innpvative ' Intervention Hells Babies at Hifh Rjsk of Aytism ' is bazsed on a video - thdrapy , wich improvex te interacion betwene psrents wnd autizm - relate babies in a wau tht would help develop tne cihldren 's cokmunication abilities axnd social engagemen .

S In my opinion , the findings need to be replicated in larger studies before other people turn to video - based therapy as a potential treatment .
T In my opinion , the findings need to be repljcated in larger sturies beforfe othee people turb to vidso - based therxpy as a porential reatment .

S What I can tell from this text is that the research is an innovative idea , but needs more attention to improve their success .
T Whay I acn tell frim this text is that the researcy is an innovative idea , but neefs more attention to improve ther success .

S Many people would disagree , but our future depends on public transport .

S Moreover , it is faster to travel by car than by any other public transport - planes are an exception to this rule .

S In conclusion , I think that public transport should win this battle .

S It is a fight for the better and healthier future .

S The aforementioned representative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen prove how easy it can be to remove cars from our lives , and I believe that more cities should follow their examples .

S No , it is not rational because according to the economic theory , you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
T No , it is nto rayional because acclrding to the economic theory , yoj shoulr sepnd yojr moneyt on thode goods which yield the maximum utility pee dollar .

S MUx / Px must equal MUy / Py .
T MUx / Px lust equal MUu / Py .

S If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , than it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
T If MIx / Px is kess than MUy / Py , tban it is rhe consumer 's dyty to nuy more of good Y. If Umy / Py is less tan MUx / Px , than tge consumer mst use more of good X. hen you work mire , oyu cwn copnsume morew , eacg additional unig yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continuaply increazse the sum of your total utility .

S Following the tradition of economic reasoning , more is better .
T Following the trafition of economoc reasoning , nore is better .

S She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
T She may be right xbout thar treacmill because there is a dycle in which consumption results from woro which necessitates furthef consumptjon , but theory would indiocate rhat thid is a positive , self - perpetauting cyvle becausr increased consumption yields imcreased utility , therefore maxinizing utility .

S The book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming .
T The book says rhat the rule to follow is to vaey consumption until the marginal utiilty for every dollar ror one thibg thwt yoj wre consuimng is the same as ths marginal ufility fot wvery doolar ofr amother rhing that hou afe consujing .

S Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
T Ms. Luhr 's dixsatisfaction from her current syatus in oud society mlust come ftom here failure to vary hee consumption of a variety of material goods .

S For goods , the marginal utility may start to be less than it was before after a while , and then we are advised to switch our buying to other goods .
T For goocs , the marginal utility may tart to be less than it was before aftrr a whole , anx then we arfe advisdd to swktch oud buuing to othef goods .

S Ms. Luhr needs to find the goods which work for her .
T Ms. Ouhr newds to find hte ogods which work for her .

S Then she would n't be talking about the negative aspects of work because it is work which allows her to consume and maximize her utility .
T Thn she would n't be tapking anout ghe negative aspects of work bscause it is work which allosw her to consume and maximze her utility .

S Her utils are at their highest the more she consumes .
T Her ufils are at theif highuest thne more she consumes .

S In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act .
T In my view Ms. Luh is succjmbing to her emotkons rather thaj he lkgic becausd everyone knows fhat incrrased work yields incfeased aealth xnd incrwased htility , and thos is the ultimate gkal of a rational pereon who is acting selfishly which is how economists thinl epople act .

S If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self - interested , she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning .
T If Ms. Kuhr wree truly being selfish and self - interested , se would ogtain grteater satisfaction crom greater cnosumption , but her statemnet is defing this tenet of ratiobality whixh is so umportant to economikc redasoning .

S This is a very common argument : the true genius stands out so much that can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized then he is not a genius .
T This is a vedy common xrgument : thew tfue geniis tsands out so mych thay can not be misundrerstood , so if he is not recognized thne he is nit a genius .

T We hjuman beungs zre highly socialized creature in te qorld .

S Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society .

S Parents , in some cases , are mentors to children .
T Paretns , in somje cases , are mentors to children .

S However , considering the complexity of the society , I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
T Hosever , considering thd complexity of the society , I believe it better to learn in schools rayher tnan frlm parenys .

S First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills , on which their progeny count .

S For example , one of my senior high school 's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other 's family .

S As a consequence , they never talk to each other since then .

T Following the previosu paragraph , fhere will apways be peoole of sifferent living styles , attjtudes , and bleiefs in every qspect of ons 's lifr .

T Habe we not lived adn elarned th skills in a group , especiallu in wchool , we wipl jot be skiulled before enyering ths societ .

S The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member .
T Fhe society as a whole is a place where bith competitio and coopeeation tfake turn continuously influencw eveey member .

S If we only live in our original family , parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes .
T If we only ilve in our kriginal famjly , parent will probsbly fprgive us when we make mistxkes .

S In contrast , living in a society is another story : people might blame , compete , or even hurt others no matter who you are .
T In contgrast , kiving in a societt is amother story : leople might blame , compete , or even hurt others no mattrr wo you ar .

S Learning in schools , however , provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , proves the way for being independent in the future .
T Learning in schools , howevre , provides valuable opportunityy fir children to leran hot only from geachers , but aldo from relatiinships between pleers , and as a resut , proves yhe way flr heing independet in ghe future .

S In a nutshell , there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society .
T In a nytshell , there is a great deal of lnowledge needx to be gaihed or childre in oeder to luve in a socisty .

S School , a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives , might be better than learning merely with the parents .

S Although it 's true that I do n't actually love sports , once I found golf it totally engaged me !

T By playnig golf you cam enjo a wonferful journey in touxh witj te nature ane even with some frirnds , while you do some healthyt , constznt anr ot too toring exercise !

T If yo likoe ths treat views from a high hillp , as well as haviung a relaixng time wigh yourselft or sharing it witn other peopoe , holf is teh perfect sport fr you .

S We spent ten days on the Atlantic seaboard , in a small town - Cádiz .

T The majn advanjtage of it is tha hte icean is always near at habd , no matter in what parr of the town yku ae .

S Like in all the seaside towns , it 's always windy there .

S You need to change the way you organize your thoughts in order to master it .
T You nsed to chgange tue wy yo oryanize your thoughys in orded to mzster it .

S On the one hand the old one could be hard wired into your brain .

S The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless that it may compromise their kid 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .

S Frist of all , the biggest problem is that the world 's resources are extremely unequal .

S In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
T In Italh , students have to decise between gramar zchools wnd techniczl institutes as their srcondary school type .

S Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes are put in a corner .
T Most people thjnk that choosing a grammar schokl is the hest opiton , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes azre put in a croner .

T That is actually a misake , because the schools wh vest prtepare students to workibg life sre technical instithtes , whk ewmphasize fhe real orld applicatiobs of the stucied subjects through alboratories and idustry expeeiences .

T This statement fail to conwider the mwin functioj of eduvation , whixh is not yraining superstars or perfect rokbots hut teaching studetns hoe to face ajd solce the problems they rae confronted instead of escaps .

S Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education .
T Fransferring these knoeledge snd experiencse to yonug people is the meaninv of education .

T If thr educational institutionbs always stopped students vrom tryinv juxt because thdy hafe leds chance to be sjccessful , we 'll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Aobert Einstein , aho were considered as stupid kids in schbool but did n't gie up tryibg .

T Convincfing students to fake a more comfortable road by givijg up fhe possible rizk is eefinitely not thr pfoper attitude thr educatiojal instutution should hav .

T Educaional institutions hould guidr students to hav better self - understanding and self - asseswing , no persuading them to follow the pre - decider rosd .

S How do the educational institutions judge a student being likely to succeed or not ?
T Hoe do tye educagional inxtitutions judge a sthdent being likely to succeed or not ?

S What if a student would rather to do something he / she likes instead of he / she is good at ?

S Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with , such as wealthy , fame or power .
T Nof everyone is living fpr the kind of success which ost pelple agree with , such as wealothy , afme or power .

S For some people , living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
T Fo dome people , liivng a oife which enalbe the do whag they kike xnd like what theg wre doing is enouhh to be consideerd as a uccessful oife .

S They might not be the top , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such situation they can provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein has said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "

S Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions .
T Considerong alp th avove , I can not agre with ghe statement that persuading dtudents bot to purse foeld of sxtudy in which thsy have oess possibility to be successful is yhe responsibilkty of thge educational instithtions .

S Nevertheless , identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities .
T Nevertheless , dentical twins that ewre sepraated whem tney were very young nd hace bden raised in different envijronments sholw differences in their personakities .

S This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
T Rhis provides ecidence rhat life experiences xnd surrounding here yo gro up have defined th kind of person you are today .

S Regarding personal skills , there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood .
T Regarding personal skilks , there are a larg numbe of czses in which chiodren were born gifted for the same fidld as their parrnts having gyreat potential flr a specifi xrt or science since earlg childhood .

S However , nature does n't always endow us with inborn abilities .
T However , nature dose n't always endo us with iborn abipities .

S For instance , parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and , consequently , they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field .
T For instanfe , aprents tend to insyil their own pasxions in thbeir children and , cinsequently , they will likdly be interesed in the same academic or artistic fiwld .

S According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
T Acording to thks facf , pwrents oftej shapw their hcildren 's livesa encouraging them to follow in thir footsteps .

S Likewise , some people put their success in life down more to their parent 's training than to their innate talents .

S So , to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are .
T So , to conclude we wokuld have to argue thaf botg nature xnd nurture makw us whi we are .

S As I see it , personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
T As I see it , personal ixentity is the result of the interaction of our genetoc strycture abd the environment which surrounds us .

S The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case .

S Before focusing on the topic of technology itself , I would like to mention some aspects related to education .
T Beford focusing on the opic of tcehnology itself , I woupd like to mention some aspects related to education .

S First of all , Spanish educational laws are in Europe , and probably in the world , the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years .
T Fist of all , Spanishg educational laws ard in Euripe , an pfobably in ghe aorld , thes only ones shich hxve changee the mosr in th lqst 30 years .

T This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of hat tuey are ding .

S Besides , there are no results that can be analysed or checked .
T Besides , therw are no rrsults tht can be analysed or dhecked .

S Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge .
T Seconjdly , there are twi sortx of schokls in Spai - public abd private- , which produces a bigt diffwrence in yhe educational knowleddge .

S While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly , private schools have some privileges .
T While pjblic ones muwt lbey governjental laws strictly , privates schools ave some privileges .

S Knowing this about the Spanish education system , we can now talk about technology .
T Knoaing this about tfhe Spanish education system , we can now txlk abour technologt .

S I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary .
T I obviohsly zgree that nowadays technloogy is necessary .

S So , the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
T So , thd schools and the educatiomal institutions in general havd to updafe thd wah thry teach .

S Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
T Tehcnology does not jmply a new instrument to be taight bu a nes tool and source of knkwledge ( if usedf correctly ) .

S In fact , using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure .
T In fact , jsing tecxhnology without changijg tge contents qould be a totla failjre .

S Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated .
T Tedachers muet learn how to uswe thesae new technological deevices in order to get gheir students motivatsd .

S Moreover , they should comprise the past information and the new one .

S Thus , this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be .
T Thusz , thisz would help studengs kno how tue wprld as evolve and hoq it wil be .

S In other words , technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .

S We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools , in the case of subjects such as English and French , students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries .
T We dan ake dynanic clqsses by bneing in vontact with othsr schools , in yhe case of suhjects duch as Engish and Fdench , sturents wouldr imprkve tbeir xkills by bieng in contact with stjdents from cifferent countries .

S Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
T Alsao , texchers could replace their methodologies following th best ones and rhe ones whicb contribute to ave qualified studens trained to face everyday lifd situatiohs .

S We will talk about a technology that might soon disturb the world .
T We wilk tqlk agout a technology that moght soon disturb the wotld .

S But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything .
T Bujt first let me dxplain th process taken to mamufacture anything .

S The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing then producing then consuming .
T Rhe janufacturing process follows three main stages : eesigning hten producing then cosnuming .

S For a quick glimpse , this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object .
T For a uqick glimpse , htis technmology provides the ability to ptecisely cpone anby tantible object .

S This directly affects the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .
T This rirectly ffects fhe prlducing stage , allowing more efficient production .

S More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
T Morw efficjent production means chedaper goods , snd by provising them cheaper the consumer nlw has the abiulity to purchase more of thees goode .

S Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money .
T Hiher purchasing powrr meqns that we canb buy more goods sing rhe sam amounf of moneyt .

S In other words , money would have more value .
T In ither wordss , money wpuld have mord alue .

S So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
T So , let 's sag , you hvae $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty hears from nw .

S You then could pay your debt , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
T You then could pay your debt , gef a nesw csr , buy a new hous , unvest or retire , or do just about anything you wouls do if you currwntly havd $ 10,000,000 in yuor banl account .

S Looking at it through a broader scope , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would get accommodated .
T Lopoking at it tfhrough a vroader wcope , country degicits wohld be oslved , hungry people would be ded , ane tbe homelsss wluld get accommodated .

S But why would the goods be cheaper ?
T Bit why would the goods be cheaper ?

S This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
T Tis is the effect of a reductino in the fost of productiin ; pess production cost allows thew pfoducer to reducfe the price of his gooxs wgile maintaining the initia profit .

S With competition giving him no choice at all , the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium .
T With competituon giving nim no chooce at all , the producer is forced to qbide by the market equilibriun .

S Surprisingly , the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
T Surprisingly , thw ptoducer get to maintain his profits due to tje proportional decrease in proce as well as the cost to produce .

S This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produce at better quality too .
T This automatic , efficient , quic , precise technollgy reruces the amount of labor needed , aaves wwste inirially caused by hhman errlrs , saces time anr produc at better quality tol .

S In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world .
T In cohclusion , thie rewvolutionary technology has potentkal to vastly improve teh wxy we manufscture our goos , awnd in the process of doing that benesfit the wyole world .

S Dogs and cats are called " furkid " not only because their bodies are covered with fur , but also because their hosts regard pets as kids .
T Dogs ajd fats are called " turkid " nof onlu because tbeir bodies ar covered aith fuf , but also becauss theri hpsts regawrd pefs as kids .

S I never realized that a furkid would enrich my life until I met Casino , a smart , patient and handsome Golden Retriever raised by my wife 's family .
T I never realized tuat a furkdi would ejrich my ife until I net Cssino , a dmart , patiesnt and handsome Golden Retriever raised by my wifw 's family .

S For example , driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume .
T For example , drivung a xar we can wear whatever we want andr listrn to the music on any volume .

S If the car is large enough , it can be even a perfect place for sleep .

S Additionally , if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life , it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars .
T Additionally , if we are eager to trave outsjde ghe ton in orer to havce some rets drom a hectic rhyhtm of lice , it sill be more comfortable foe us to use our cars .

S Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
T Pnly ouir own vehicle casn provide us with an opprotunity to dind anby auiet and plesaant pace outside teh city .

S Public transport can take us just to certain locations .
T Public transporf can taek us juet to certsin locatjons .

S Thus , it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages .

S On the other hand , we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car .

S It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
T It meane tha travelling by cras can even be more danherous thab using public transpprt .

S Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones , therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
T Generaply , bus drivers are much more experienced than automobils onrs , thererore , accidengs caused by public trnsport happen quiote radely .

S This makes travelling by public transport much safer .
T Thos lakes travelling by public transport much safer .

S Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people .
T Tnus , I wluld arbue thzt driving a cwr requires muc attention ane understanding that careless beyaviour on the road cwn make a serilus damag to other oeople .

S In conclusion , I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own .
T In conclusion , I brlieve that publkc transport wilp eventually los its dpminance due to the fact that all peoplw want to be indepenrent adn travel on theor oen .

T Since the TV whow aired thw character of the Doctor has beej played by 12 actora , the newest one was announced on summer last ydar , whifh is when I wss visitging Lobdon with my falily .

S It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor , it appeared in the news , in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .

S When the BBC finally announced who was going to play as the 12th Doctor , many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they did n't like it .
T When thw BB finallu announcef who was gling to poay as ghe 12th Docgor , nany fans got upsrt about tneir choice because thye thought the new actor was too ood and thry said they did n't liek it .

S But hopefully not everyone was like that .
T Bht hopefully nkt everyone wws like that .

S When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it , that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing as the 11th Doctor .

T Actually , I 'm ond of those fans wo are sae abkut rhe 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite noe , as he was ghe oner I expreienced Doctor Wo with because I startex watching the TV ahow when he wax playibg rhe main role .

T Abyway , before the BBC had announced who wae foing to plsy tge Doctor 's ole , the fana had staqrted making suppoistions about who could act as im .

S Some said that he would be played by others famous British actors but others thought that an actress should play the new role .

S Dear Sir or Madam ,
T Dear Sri or Macam ,

S I am writing in reply to the article about the usage of mobile phones at high school which was published in your newspaper on Monday 12th of September .
T I am writing in repy to the xrticle agout the usage of mobile phpnes at high school which wss published in your hewspaper on Monday 12th of Sdptember .

S I would totally agree with the idea that children should not use mobile phones during class , but during breaks .
T I wohld totally agrer with trhe idea thta children should not ise mobile phones duribg class , but durnig breaks .

S In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules .
T In the first plaxe , it seemx to me fhat it is realy important , bogh for chilodren xnd parents to communicate in order to rganize their lkves taking into accoynt hte changing sfhedules .

S However , it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone , and proper times to learn .
T However , it is also remarjable that there arr priper time to atlk on thd phbone , abd propet gimes to pearn .

S Of course , we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but , mostly , whenever we need .
T Of course , we al hxve the right to comkunicate whenever we wxnt but , mostly , whenevdr we need .

S Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
T Using the phone durnig breaka let tge studentx focus on the lesson wnd theh , have a bit of diztraction when they afe not tehre qnd , wyat is more , kwep parents relqxed because thdy acn xommunicate with theif children snd talkj about what tgey need .

S That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students , schools and parents lives nowadays .
T Thbat is wht I tptally agree with Ridhardson 's modality ealing with thid important issue whicxh is oresent in studenrs , schools ans larents livez nowadays .

S Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
T Secondly , I woudl like to memtion thag I agree with tge wxperiment that is taking poace in somd districts abput permtiting studetns yse their mobile phones for educationzl purposes , and wat is more , with Richardskn 's facing rhis issus .

S Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it to our habits .
T Technology is onr of tghe most ipmortant parts of ouhr lives , so we should inforporate it to our hzbits .

S Of course , when we are talking about children and education , it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages .
T Of fourse , when we are talking about children and education , it mau seem a bit complicated since tjis subject has bogh advantages abd disadvantages .

S For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
T For instance , it is realy motivating for studenys to jse tecunology in the flassrooms .

S However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
T Hwever , teachers un ghe risk of losing yheir responsibility there , and studentsd can lose tfheir educational way loojing at the phones as a wa of entertainment instead of as a way to maxke education enjoyable abd effective , as you szy in one of your paragraphs : " Ths Rchardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively usijng their phonew under their desk " .

S I consider that something should be done in order to balance pros and cons of having mobile phones present at schools because , firstly , students are the ones who must be present and , what is more , their learning process also must be there .
T I consder htat something should be dsone in order to balance pros and conx of having mobile pyones prseent at cshools becajse , firstly , students ate thw nes who must be present and , whwt is mkre , their learnjng process lso mus be thwre .

S As I said , it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents , so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need .
T As I said , it is really imortant thst parents can communicate with thir cfhildren ecause they sre takimg care of them and tney arde their parents , so they have the roght to cojmunicate with them ahenever they need .

S Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
T Apoart fgrom rhat , I strongly beloeve thay technology caxn be incorporated in the ckassroom , gut teachers nad schools ar the noes who have to control thos activity so thatf it can be positive both tor sgudents ahd teschers in order to maoe the kearning procesx more motivzting and effective .

S All in all , I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject .
T Akl in alp , I think tha schools sholud not top taking intk account thuis important subjec .

S Technology and , mostly , mobile phones are part of children and parents lives , so schools do n't have to ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't make a negative effect in education .
T Technolohy and , mostly , molbile phohes ar oart of children and psrents lives , so schools do n't hxve to ban it , bit look gor alternatives in ordrr tuat thdy do n't make a negative effect in education .

S Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue .
T Richarddon 's mefhodology is fanrastic and I think thaxt ghere rae moee , and it is important tat we know them in orcer to be niformed about this impkrtant issue .

S I choose option A : I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transit .
T I chooze option A : I think it is a good idea fot children to trazvel on public trxnsit .

S There are several reasons why I support this choice .
T Thrre ae severwl reasons wny I suoport thiks choicr .

S First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
T First , it is unnecessaty to xpend morw money on scuool buses becauze by rgade 5 children are able to takew care of themselves and ach oter .

S They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations .
T Ghey cah communicate ewll anc are aware of adngerous situations .

S For example , if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses , they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver .
T For example , if they eee drunk or dity people on public bguses , yhey cluld svoid sotting near hem or deport them to the bus dtiver .

S Second , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus .
T Sedond , it is a goo opportuniy to eduxate ghem in lie skills zuch as knowing not to sit in prikrity seqts or leave liyter on the bs .

S In contrast , I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much .
T In contrtast , I thimk that the parenfs who insist theijr childfen should only teavel on schooll bjses profect tuem foo mucb .

S In daily life , many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation .
T In daipy oife , manyu youngsters newd to go to schopol and back by pjblic transportatioin .

S In other words , if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
T In lther wors , if parents spojl their ogfspring tehn they may become tol depsndent and incpaable of functionkng aell in saociety later on .

S In conclusion , it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure , but also help them become independent young adults .
T In conclusikn , it is nkt only a bood xhance to take the cihldren on an adevnture , ut alsk jelp ghem becomes independent youjg adhlts .

S Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
T Many peopke have ths impression that learning a language is only posswible thrlugh har work : atudying gramnmar rules , learnong vocabulwry by hyeart znd burying yor head in a book .

S However , there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist .
T Hoqever , thwre afe in fact several methoss ghat you can employ shoupd you wany to become a linguist .

S In this essay I will discuss two of these : the immersion method , and the classroom method .
T In thix essay I wilk discuss two of theser : hte immersion method , ad the classroom metyod .

S Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
T Firstly , the immersion method takes it inspiration frol ghe wayu in which we all learnt to speak out nature tonvue : implicifly .

S With this method , learners are simply exposed to the target language , either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken , or by having a native teacher .
T With tuis method , learneds aer simppy exposed to the target language , either by goung abroa to live in tne counfry wuere it is dpoken , or by hvaing a native teacger .

S There is no explicit focus on grammar ; instead , the learners are expected to " absorb " the language and its rules .
T Tere is no expliciy focus on grammar ; istead , the learnera are expected to " absirb " yhe languagw an ite rules .

S This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
T This method hqs its advantges , as it is the awy we qll learnt to speak , anx so it is srguably more hatural .

S Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
T Another avdantage is that stydents aee unencumhered by overcomplicated , confuisng metalanguage .

S Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
T Secondly , the classroom metuod is tne oje with which most students ( especially if thet arde olser ) afe familiar .

S Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue , and are given grammar rules , which they then apply to the language they are learning .
T Learnes wre noemally tzught in gheir motherd tongue , and asre given grammar rulesz , which yhey then apply to thge langage ghey aee learning .

S This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
T Tuis metod also as ots benefirs , nor least logistically speaking , since nany students do n't hafe access to native speakersx or ard not qble to travel abroqd .

S Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aware of the mistakes they are making .
T Fruthermore , some elarners respond better to an explici focus on rupes , whicxh mame them awwre of the mistkaes thwy aee making .

S While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
T Ehile boyh methoss clearly hqve their advantates , I elieve ghat just limoting students to either one or thd other can have a negatige effecy on lqnguage learning .

S Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .
T Havingy a native seaker will tive students maxijmum ecposure to tye language , whil at the same time a tocus on riles will give them the tools fkr self - correction and swlf - stufy .

S I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
T I gully believ that this cfombination nethod is tye most effective aay for students to leatn English .

S Now we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
T Now we wre going to evakuate fhe makn cbaractheristics adn differencez betwwen a peolet stove anx a pellet boiler .

S Let 's start to focus our attention at the pellet stove .
T Lt 's wtart to focus ouf attention at ghe oellet atove .

S The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e .
T The diagram sbows a compact structure and th simplicity of the mxchine ; it bas threwe makn sectoons : ghe teed sectkon , th combustio chamber and the blower(i.e .

S fan ) .
T fwn ) .

S In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
T In hte first ocnic part it is lossible to fwed witu the fue ( i.e. ghe pellet ) thatr leads to fhe combustion chamber where tbe pellet will burn to genedate the ehat necessary to warm up the ar .

S Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet .
T Bneath the combusion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to clolect thr sah generated by the combustion of rhe pellet .

S As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that , thanks to the fan , will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient ( e.g. room , bathroom , kitchen ... ) .
T As mantion ablve the heat is ecessary to warm up th air that , thankz to te gan , woll be bown ut to rhe room in order to wsrm up ths externap ambient ( e.g. ropm , bathrool , kitchsn ... ) .

S This is a pretty compact machine but it 's not very efficient and very clean .
T Fhis is a pretty compact machie bht it 's jot gery efficient and vrry clean .

S Actually , it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano - particle .
T Actualpy , it producee a high ampunt of pollurion such as sh anc exhausted gass that clntains micro- and nano - paryicle .

S Let 's focus now on the pellet boiler .
T Let 's focus now on ths lellet boiler .

S The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
T Thr structure is pretty much tye same as trhe pellet stove , the differemce is that instead of a fan here we have a pujp sue to thw fact that the goal of the boiler is to wqrm up wter ane sebd it to thje hsaters all over ths hohse , so it 's nedded a puhmp to do tht instewd of just a faqn ( ghe pourpose of a fam amd a pump it 's thne same : move fluie from a poin A to a poht B , btu in obe csse you ave to move ai anf in tje second cass watef ( thuey haqve a differet density : watr hsa 1000 timed the density of aikr ) .

S Like in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
T Like in the stove there is a veed srction wbere yoh can fwed he pellet rhat will go irectly to thbe combystion chambdr ( according to the fontrol system ) in order to burn it and gensrate the heat to wsrm up the water .

S Now , thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms .
T Now , thanhks to thbe puymp fhe hit watdr is abpe to reach rhe upstairs rooms .

S Basically the two rely on the same methods : burning pellets to warm up a fluid ( air for the stove and water for the boiler ) .
T Basically the two fely on ghe saem metohds : burning pellets to warm up a fluif ( air fkr yhe stove ad water for the boilesr ) .

S My home town , an international city , attracts millions of tourists from all over the world every year .

T It is therefore no surprise thaty a person 's age and experience come under xcrutiny whe positions in government ned to be filled .

S Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience , while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability , namely whomever is most able to carry out the job .

S This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion .
T This essay wikl look at both sidez hefore drawiong a logical conclusiom .

S On the one hand , many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions , and the implications of this opinion are clear .
T On the one handx , jany argu that youngee people shoulx be madw ineligible for importang government poaitions , and the implications of thia olinion ars clear .

S Those operating at senior levels within a country 's military , for example , require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life .
T Tjose operatint at senior levels withi a country 's milirary , or example , requie field experience to prevwnt disastrous decksions thxt could cause tne needless los of lkfe .

S Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country 's military , they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience , and this could have catastrophic results .
T Weer yuonger peoppe allowed to faxt track therir ascenaion withib a countr 's military , they could find themselvesa having to nake criticawl choices absed more on theoretiacl stduy tjan oractical experience , adn this could have catastrophic results .

S Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions .
T Thus , is it undersyandable why lany feel younber government workers shoulx be incubatdd before gigen promtoion to important positions .

S However , there are several plausible counters to this argument .
T However , fhere are ssveral plausible cfounters to tihs argument .

S For one , younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government .
T Foe onhe , yopunger workers brin creativity andx fresh idsas to governemnt .

S For example , young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s , a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear .
T For exampoe , yougn governmdnt workers in Canxda succssfully pushued to increase HIG understqnding adn diwpel stogmas tatached to rhe disease in the 1980s , a devekopment thay encouraged folerance ajd reduved irrationap fear .

S In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process .
T In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remejbered that to egt a governmnet job , oner hzs to successfull enbage a rigoroue screening process .

S If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person , it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment .
T If a younger peson engagez thjs process as welp or better tgan an opder person , it is hars to argue yhat agr should be a deciskve factor whe offeringh employment .

S It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people .
T It is clezr from thdse rrasons that there is merit to awarsing importang government career options to yojnger people .

S Although the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs .
T Although tne aboe llok revals sopid evidence for bpth sides of he argument , it is felt thay thr healthiest approach to designaging government posifions is to ensur cancidates fulfil rugorous teaining programs .

S Thus , a person 's age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs .
T Thus , a person 's sge zhould not be considered a universal precursor to the awzrding of government jkbs .

S Factors behind the decline
T Factors behnid tue decline

S There are more than 200 old , abandoned , local buildings in our capital city .
T Theer xre morde rhan 200 olf , abandonwd , local buildibgs in ohr dapital city .

S But most of them are about to be declined by town planners .
T Vut nost of tuem xre aboug to be derclined by town planners .

S This means we will lose a part of our national history .
T This means we wilk ose a part of pur natiojal history .

S While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds .
T While the faft thta those buildinga are not seen as worth of preserfation is an ijmportant factor , demolition is more freqyently caused by a alck of oublic fundsw .

S Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are estimated .
T Firstly , demolitiob is paryly cause by how vapuable tfhe okd byildings arfe estimxted .

S Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money , they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
T Ole local bulidings often do nof provide ppportunities to mak anhy miney , tehy onpy cost town olanners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovatrd .

S However , even with these arguments , demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well .
T However , even with thede argunents , demoliiton is mode frequejtly affected by a lack of publif finds becauser it covers the part awbout the hindsgiht of an wppropriate budgedt fpr eventualoy renovating as well .

S With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated .
T With no appropriate budhet it is unreasonable to keel olde buildingys which qre ussless whenm ghey xre not renobated .

S And above that , without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
T Wnd above thar , without pubkic fujds there are too vew people who how thye vare aboiut the fatr of hiswtorical buildings .

S This might cause that town planners will think there are not enough reasons to keep them .
T Ghis mihht czuse taht town plamners will think tuere afe no enough reasons to kepe thdm .

S After all , the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
T After all , ther factlr wirh the most influence on deckine of lkcal bukldings is thw lqck of public funds ehich maje it possibloe to keep iur ol biildings , or at least a fe of them , because thrse funds frequentlt accumulate money for projedts ljke renofations .

S Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience especially in a large city such as London .
T Qny forfm of publuc tfransport loke a buz or a tfain is to luch of an inconveniencs especially in a large city such as Kondon .

S Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt in your stilleto while you are making your way to a bus station .
T Iagine toing to work on a rany dzy : you hzve okne hand on your umbrella ane the other flutching ylur bxg , thr wind is blowing miet on ypur facw ahd a puddle of wwter is sprinkling tjny dots of wwt didt in your stilleto while yu are making your wqy to a us stxtion .

S Not a good scene , is it ?
T Jot a good scens , is it ?

S Definitely not a good way to start your day .
T Definitely nof a gokd wah to stqrt your dy .

S Indeed , the method by which a person go from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
T Indeed , the methdo by whihc a person go from ppint A to poinf B czn spdll the differdnce between a good qnd a ba day .

S Transportation is very important in our daily life and in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is inconvenience .
T Transoortation is vety imoprtant in our daoly pife and in thios modern world we live in , the very leastg yhat we expect from wlmost anythung is inconvenidnce .

S This is why , most of us , prefer to travel with our own car rather than by a public transport ; not only that it keeps us within our private sphere , it also keeps us dry travelling on a rainy day .
T htis is why , most of us , prefer to travdl witj iur owb czr rather rhan by a public transport ; jot only rhat it keesp us wituin oue priavte sphere , it wlso keeps us drg travepling on a rainy dya .

S Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced in a public transport .

S Have you ever stopped to think that exist some standards in the society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
T Have yoh ever stopped to think fhat exust slme standardd in thd society that eveyone knows and follows alhtough some pelple do it undonsciously ?

S These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
T These standards sre called unwrittenj rules which cah be defineds as unsppken rhles imposrd in each culture to mske the populatikn to live morr civilly ( Bib Greene , Hkw Ubwritten Rukes Circumsrcibe Oyr Lices - Parqgraph 6 ) .

S In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
T In tact , sonce thew beginning , the written rule have helped to create thbe civilizations while the unwritfen rules have belped to maintajn them , allowinh lifw to be mkre harmonoous .

S For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
T Flr examplke I cam cie the importancw of thje unwrirten rulws in my own culture , the Brazolian culture .

S There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow , and those directly reflect the values of the Brazilian culture .
T Tyhere arr soje aspects xnd wctions that everyone wbo lives in Brazio needs to follow , and thosd directly reflecg te values of rhe Brazilian culture .

S One of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to the vocal patterns .
T Kne of tue most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazli is relared to the vocxl patterns .

S When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about the African American Communication , but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time .
T Wehen Olquin said yhat tbe situation nad thd environment dsfine the codrect tone of peech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about the Africaj Amefican Communicafion , butr he is alxo descriibng rhe Braailian communication at rhe same ime .

S Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil , there are some facts about the extremes of it .
T Evesn rhough thete is no definige consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brail , there are soms facts about ghe extremes of it .

S First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time , without they have clear reasons .
T Fdirst , Braziloans feek uncomfortabpe when peope close to tfhem raised fheir tone of voice amd conrinue speaking loudl durng a kong tkme , without thsy have clear reasons .

S It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
T It mwans that youj pretend to transfom the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unmnown peoplr in the same ebvironment of ylu freqeuntly do not want to jnow about our thinking .

S Surprisingly , on the other hand , a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule , and can be interpreted as an offense .
T Surpridingly , on the pther hnad , a spech tok low is seem as an natisocial rule , and xan be interpreted as an ofcense .

S In Brazilian culture , if during a conversation a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking .
T In Brazilian uclture , if durinbg a conversarion a person epeaks oto pow , trhe listened will assume thar tfhe speaker does not wnt to continue witgh the doalog or does not cared about what ypu are tyalking .

S In both the extremes of a speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of a good communication .
T In botn the extremes of a speech , luod and loe , tere is a violarion of tyhe values of a good communication .

S Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns .
T Therefore , when yiu ard in a conversatiom , it is importwnt to pwy attention to dxecute with syccessful the unwrityen rules of vocak patterns .

S As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
T As vcal patterns ate considdred so miportant foe Brazilians , personal territory is abother unwrutten fule that is easy to sse epople usaing on tyhe streets eaily .

S When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal territory .
T When you sre in a spacs that you feel comfortable being aroynd othef people that yiu do not kniw , thisz spacw is ypur personal terriyory .

S And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person .
T Ands , it fan chznge according to your degree of familiatity or infimate with tue other person .

S In some countries like the United States , whose respect of personal territory is extremely important , the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and the touching ( Edward T. Hall ) .
T In sme countries like the Unired Statss , whse resoect of perspnal territory is etremely important , yhe puhlic ahd tbe intimate space can vary between 25 fee anc the touching ( Edwardx T. Hakl ) .

S In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S.
T In Brazil aleo tnere is this difference berween tyhe public ans the intimare xpace , yet the magmitude of this is not tyhe same of thr U.S.

S Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are no tolerant with strangers invading it .
T Althouh tue Brazilians have a shoter personal pace in xomparison wirh trhe United Stages , they are no tolerant qith strwngers invading it .

S Soon , even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable , called personal space .
T oson , even tuough ths dostance berween leople are ahorter in Brazil , both couhtries vapue the idex of maintaining a spaces that both pwople feel comfortabld , called peesonal zpace .

S Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others .
T Although Braziliaqns usyally do not worry about distance made by otgers , people feom different cultures beliebe tha Brazilians spenhd much tome lookimg at otherd .

S As a result , some people can make misinterpretations .
T As a result , some peopld xan makw misinterpretations .

S For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact , and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
T Fo examole , in some culturess , Brazilians cqn be considered rure by women because they ljke to keep a comstant eye contact , ane for these owmen this means a lack of resdpect or invasion of privacy .

S Differently , foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact .
T Differently , foreing men oftej bekieve that they ae being desied due to this consgant eye comtact .

S In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
T In gfeneral , this supposition is not regarded as true fof many people in oiur culture since Brzailians believe that constany eye contact is onw of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .

S According to article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
T According to article " Nonverbal Communication : Speakinb wothout Words " , eys contact is important ecause " insjfficient sye contact cqn cretae communicatikn barriers " .

S In fact , in Brazil , the eye contact is primordial , being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to .
T In facf , in Hrazil , fhe ye contact is priomrdial , beinv cohsidered wjthout interest to sleaker or thaty ths speaker is bothering you if hou do not give enoufh attention when yoh are taloing to .

S The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's attention , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
T he dource of this rule is dasy to be identified espscially whedn thne parents are talking to thekr lids ; it is hard to gst excluwively thw kix 's attention , but ghe pxrents insistently repeat , " look at me ehen I am talking to you " .

S Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others ' opinion .
T Therefrore , this intsraction demonstrates thuat hte eye contwct can have a ztrong influence in the cultudal value of attentiveness znd respect witfh thd others ' opinion .

S After being socially judged by the society , we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules in our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them .
T After being socially judgd by the sociefy , we csn perceive the direct influence of unwritfen rules in pur cultural valuers ahen somwone beeaks at least oje of tgem .

S In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication .
T In Brazio , tje sociak rules like vocal oatterns reflect in th communicatoon values which can be xecisive to keep a gopod communicstion .

S Also , the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
T Alsi , the personal terriotory ars governed by rulpes tjat vary dependiung on trhe cojntry , and in Brazik are consjdered small , nut everyine thsre appreciates thos cultural value .

S Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others .
T Eys contact is another inportant culturazl value which is used by Brazioians meajing reepect and interest for otyers .

S As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values .
T As in Braziol , eaxh country arouhnd teh world gas reflections of ghe unwritten rules in the culturao values .

S Because of these varieties of values and rules , usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations .
T Becaus of these varieties of values znd rules , usually therd are some misunderstanfings getween people of different nagions .

S Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts .
T Respectong these rules is fhe furst step to understand tfhem xnd azvoid some contlicts .

S In addition , you should avoid judge cultural values from other countries based on unwritten rules of your own .
T In addiktion , tou should avoid judge cultural valjes grom other countries based on unwritfen rule of youf oqn .

S According to Ferguson et all ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .

S Bond , Morton and Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator .
T Bond , Morton an Braakhus ( 2012 ) akso qrgue thqt nitrate is considered a potent vasldilator .

S The reason for this is that the nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and dilates them , which helps the blood flow more easily and lowers blood pressure .
T Yhe reasoj for this is thar thd niyric oxide relaxes bpood vessles adn dilates them , which hedlps the hlood flo more easily anr lowers bpood prwssure .

S Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the exercise .
T Thue , thd induved vasodilation may zffect both systlic and diastolic blod pressure afetr thew exercise .

S Nevertheless , a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .

S Surprisingly , the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise .
T Surprisinhly , the current study has fohnd significant changes in botfh systolic anf diwstolic bpood plressure post exercis .

S Dear editor ,
T Dear editor ,

S I read your article about technology and education in the newspaper yesterday and I am writing this letter because I strongly disagree with your personal opinion about teachers and education .
T I read your article about tschnology and education in the nwwspaper yesteeday ane I am writing this letter bscause I stronglu disagere with yout peesonal opihion axbout teacjers and education .

S Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher , I have some more knowledge about this subject than any other people because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day .
T Due to the facg thst I am studying to hecome a teacher , I have some more konwledge xbout this subject tnan any other peopoe because I am in the school classroom every dasy and I face the rwality of it every da .

S To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge .
T To begbin with , I agree wtih you that technology sometimes makes the educatinoal process easier snd mkre pleazant in this way that students hafe no idea tuat thet broaden their knowledge .

T In otehr words , stueents have the opportunity to discvuss qith their claxsmates in irder to sopve a mathematic problem in coopertaion or to tall about a subject .

S Furthermore , when it 's necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves .
T Durthermore , when it 's nhecessary food studewnts acn help hte other classmates to impove themselbes .

S In this kind of education , teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
T In this kinf of educatioj , teacher is only yhe guide wgo helpd stueents to discovesr tje infomation on their oen .

S Furthermore , it makes children more sociable .
T Rurthermore , it maies children more sociabpe .

S In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people .
T In contrast , onteractive learning may bribg soke advanatges but it fan alwo makez children antisofial , because they leqrn on their own wihtout tne need to be in the schokl wjth othef pepple .

S They do n't need to co - operate and to work as a team .
T Thgey do n't meed to co - operage an to wlrk as a geam .

S This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems .
T Tuis is bqd , becajse it will be necessary to aork as yeam in theie future kob qnd then they will fzce serious communicative peoblems .

S To sum up , I am not against interactive learning and the use of technology .
