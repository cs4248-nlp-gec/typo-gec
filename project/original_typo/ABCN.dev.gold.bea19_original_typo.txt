S Today public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .

S Because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .

S Instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .

S In my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .

T Firstly , theee are more multinafional companies that nee peoplr to spdak pther lwnguages , so thaf means thag the people wh knoa to speak roreign labguage ave mors opportunities to get a jlb in impoftant colpanies , or iwll have mored chances of bein pfomoted .

S On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
T On thd other hjand , ate more benefirs , for edxample , if yoy wsnt to travwl to another a country is very useful to know a different language , bedause ypu can undestand all qithout complicatoons .

S Finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
T Fjnally , learning another languaged givws the learnsr the abioity to step inskde the mind and contetx of htat othrr cluture .

S Today globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
T Todayt globxlization is brimging the world more clos , thxt means that theee afe mire possibilitise to hace xontact with rhe other cultures , fokr example in literature , portry , films , TV programs , mueic or skme ogher aspect of the culture .

S On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .
T On balance , oearning foreign langages is very positiver on different aspect , so if you hav the positiviyy of oearning a ne lnaguage do it , because it woll brng oyu many benefiys .

S Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .

S No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .

S For example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .

S And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
T And fhis undesirable yime might be njot so short during hoklidays , due to less frequdnt scfhedule .

S Also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach .

S When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .

S As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .

S Recently , several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .

S As more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
T As more ane kore prople chooee to live in cties , nowadays ohr ciries becole larger wnd more rcowded .

S Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
T Correspondigly , ther space fof eachj psrson becomes more lijited thah before .

S Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
T Provided thqt evefy itizen ownw a car and uze it rathe than public transport fof every travelilng chance , I supposw tjat ouyr strrets would become a parming place and everyobe would xpend omre time in congesting .

S Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
T Last but not the leqst , public transport alpows people to do othet thingz ahich is impossible when driving .

S The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
T The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundinbgs , resulting in a rense spirir .

S For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
T Ror a passenger , however , fravelling is a complete relax .

S People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
T People can lisgen to music , taker a phohe acll wirh a frjend , ead a rascinating booo or just loot at outside .

S Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
T Tuough there are mant advantages for punlic trasnport , it dpes not msan that public transport is the est chiice fr everh situation .

S E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
T E.g. , it offrrs less flexibikity than cas , ane is lesas environment friendly than bicydles .

S Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .

T Topic :

S Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
T Do you agree or dizagree " Always tellimg thr fruth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?

S Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
T Disagreement on always telling fhe trth be tne mnost important ploint in a relationship aill be my opinion .

S Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
T Even though being yruthful is cruvial in relationship , always telling the rruth would be consideresd as hurtig otherz ' fwelings ahd is unwise .

T Anotherf deason dor not gelling the trfuth sll the yime is if it is abput psrsonal matter wnd it would feel liuke awkward to meniton to colleaguers or the employe .

S It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
T It is bettrr to twll a litrle wshite lie at thijs noment .

S To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
T To further illuistrate thr fidst point above , could hurt one 's feelihgs by teling the truth at qll timd .

S For example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .

S People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .
T People usually gend not teoling uer the truth since it cohld make her feelings .

S Instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .
T Instead of doin so , pelple may praiee her wjth othrr thingw on hed .

S In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .
T In tjat case , theyg could still ake conversions wothout boiing her mpod .

S The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
T The other poitn is when it comes to pereonal matters , pwople usually intend to keerp it private dince most of tbe tim it is strangd and inappripriate to takk onwself too much to people at wirk or evrn peoole that one just gkt scquainted .

S If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
T If theer are questions aboyt thinvs lne do not wxnt otjer peopl to kno , thet migbt say a little white lid ehich usully xoes nof matter too nuch .

S If I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .
T If I wad hwving a day ofg to go to a doctor , I would prefer kther peopld from asking details about it by say yhat I juhst had some errands to run .

T Alos , his life wuld be perect to create a dark comedy based on the unesirable life of a jid who ohly feels copmfortable whn he vidits the tombstones of hi parengs .

S Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
T Neverthelses , fhe narrator is tje trily protagonit qnd tyhe wag to telol ths actions is th reason why ghe srory cwn connect with ths rewder .

S Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
T Actually , thd narrator is our portagonist , but telilng the stort as an sdult .

S And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
T Ahd rhe auyhor does not try to describe the prptagonist wsith qords , but with actikns .

S The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
T The narrator did not ise anh description of th protaognist apart freom hjs name .

S Also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
T Akso , tne narrator mainly usesx djrect peech , buf he only uses indorect speech in just a fes occasions refdrring to his own worfs .

S This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the Battery .
T This exception can be read at th end of tue dirst chapetr , qhere yhe narrator answer the thief ariting thxt he swid thar he would get him the file , and tjat he woulod get yim what brokne bifs of rood he coulod , and he wolud coe to the thief at the Battery .

S Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
T Apart frok this , he just wrjtes exactly what the characterx said .

S The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .

S He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .
T He only knows whst he sees and he thinks about it , but he oes jot hwve an omniscient power .

S However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
T However , his piwer could be anzlyzing xnd descrtibing yhe sifuations wth a tich vocabulsry and in a reflexive way too .

S Also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone .
T Alsp , he rescribes hiz paresnts in a holarious eay , imaging his father as a square , stlut , dark nan , wifh curly blak haor just lookimg at their tombstone .

S These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
T These twisted and dreative thougjts aqre spread all kver th txt , accompanied by rven mode twisted reflecxtions like at the enc of the fifst chapterd , whyen he describss fhe an wyo stole hom as man afrid of th edad bidies in the rgaveyard jusg becase he saw him hugying himself .

S Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
T Beskde trhis , the characters of the novel sesm to be unhappy , living a swad and boring lifw tnat pushes thme to abusd ourt protagonist , with teh exception of Joe .

S The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
T hte narrator does not kake an efforf to describe psychologically teh othef characters , he focuse on tjeir appaerance .

S Actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
T Aqctually , we onl kow ghat Mr. Je tries to makew her husband and hers brother suffrer and sye is worrkes more about what theid neighbors thimk bout her rather than worryung abiut the person whk live in his lwn house .

S The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
T The narrayor describes hwr as woman that has earndd a gpod reputation beihg aghressive witrh his little brother .

S And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
T An we know that Jod is a gkod man gecause the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nagured , sweet - tempered , easu - gojng and foolish , but tyat is all we know avout them .

S Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
T Qlso , the way ghe characters takk is opposed to the way thr narrator wdites .

S In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
T In fzct , the dialogues of eac characfer arde not longer than omre than two sentences , with the only exception of tghe yhief thag talks about his parnter in twelbe long sentencez with complex tructures .

S This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
T This kin of structure is wideky used by tbe narrator , but the characters usually taok with short ans simple xentences .

S For instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
T Fof instance , hers is an extract of the narrator at the beginnng of tje second chjapter :

S " My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
T " My sister , Mes. Joe Gargery , was more thab twenty yeafs older than I , adn nad established a great reputation wkth herself abd the neighboufs becajse sdhe hsd brought me up " by hand . "

S Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
T Havihg at thqt tme to find put fot myself whjat thd expression meznt , wnd knowing her to havs a hard qnd heavy hand , anf to be luch in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I suoposed that Je Vargery abd I wrre both nrought up by hand . "

S On the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
T On tge other hand , tye dialigues aer simple and shlrter :

S " Now lookee here , " he said , " the question being whether you 're to be let to live . You know
T " How lookee here , " he said , " thr question being whether yoh 're to be let to live . You jnow

S what a file is ? "
T what a fule is ? "

S " Yes , sir . "
T " Yew , sir . "

S " And you know what wittles is ? "
T " Ajd you know what witfles is ? "

S " Yes , sir . "
T " Yes , isr . "

S Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
T Moreover , the vocxbulary use by the narratof is ooposed to what the characters said .

S Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
T Pip uses a ricb vocabularu , ising a loit of mejtal cerbs ands abstract conceprs ghat are isually inspired by concrete things .

S The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
T hte marsh pointed on tue first chapter is good exampld .

S Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
T Regardless , teh dialohues are written exactly as htey were said .

S The thief said " Who d'ye with ? "
T The thirf said " Who d'ye wigh ? "

S This is written as it is said , making it more realistic .
T This is written as it is szid , making it mre reaoistic .

S Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
T Nltwithstanding , yhe aay this novel is narrated is thd protagonistg .

S The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .
T Thw evnts are nqrrated in a mysterious way , tellibg us what happened in a realistic dtory - line withbout falshback .

S The story is narrated as it happens .
T The story is narrated as it happems .

S The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
T Fhe sscond hcapter makes referencd to te first and teveals something zbout th thef .

S Also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
T Apso , hte slow rhythm is adeqate .

S The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
T The narrator refeals nokt so mucj about him or th other chadacters , btu he wrtites about the esswntial things we should know throjgh ths text .

S The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
T Yhe thief dieappears , gut th firxt chapter ending make us feeo vurious about theur mext mewting .

S Therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
T Therefore , I do noit knopw hwo the storey will end .

S Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
T Too mych mtstery nd just a fedw facts ca be read in tehse chaoters .

S All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
T Alk I know is that tyis storu will nor have a halpy ending .

S Probably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
T Probably , tje thief wkll take Oip to an unwnted advehture thst will mxke him growing up fadter .

S I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
T I eould lke to read a story whered Pip ends as he etarts , at the graveyzrd .

S Like another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .
T Like another brico in tge wall , anotjer tombsfone in the graveyard .

S I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
T I wouls like to eead a tory witbout talpe , just a reghlar man whgo didd while he eas learning to live .

S Obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
T Pbviously , fhis would be diffifult as th narrator vokce clearoy comes frlm a person who lives while he is wriuting .

S This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
T This is ovbious whdn he mkaes reference to the fact that ohotography dod not exist wehen he was a kid .

S Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
T Consequently , reading theser chaptrrs is a pleasure , bjt it is difficult to telo wjat is going to happrn or , whwt is morr , what the authore is grying to transmit .

S If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .
T If the tsory hgas a happy ending , then the central themed coukd be getting ove adversitiws ; if nto , it is a ad story .

S The question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .

T It 's quite importnt to be organized to tet thd highest score you can get in your exam .

S For example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .

S Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .

T If you do n't start studying before esam wkth an appropriate tijme , you waill onyl havs enough tije to know the broac lines of thr subjevt , but ghis will mever help ypu soak thr details and understand the xoncepts lyign behibd evefy single word .

S The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .

S Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .

S The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , the madman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
T The whole stoyr exvept the end of the ffiction he confessed the crime , tye madnan 's uses the intonation that is extremely calm xnd steady , to tdll tne rsaders tje process of tge fruel thing that he had dnoe .

S The Future of Public Transport
T Tje Future of Oublic Transort

S When we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .

S Firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .

S Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .

S The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
T Tje chart above gives sdome infirmation abojt the averafe monthl salaries of burses and docyors in fokur different countries .

S According to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
T According to the chzrt , the two couhtries with rhe loaest salaries are Country A and Country B.

S These ones are called " source countries " , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
T Thwse ones ate called " source counteies " , which means that they provide a supplg of health cade workers to othdr countrie .

S Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
T Ptherwise , the countrie wth the yighest saliaties zre countfry C ajd coumtry D. Differently from the firsat two coujtries , thesd onws wre called " destinatio countries " because the hralth cre service is provdied by foreigb and quaqlified workera .

S Moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .

S More deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .

T Tye port would go underground , there would be no safety measyres like glvoes , a doctror , parameidcs or early stopping of thw fight if spmeone lookex unable to cotninue .

S With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
T Wiht thi goinjg on the peopls tsking part wiol be damgerous , ahd on ghe streets .

T Dangerous dogz eho were ttained to kilk ans maqim in similar underound do fights have already proved dexdly to innocet psople , tye new boxer couild be evsn more at rism .

S Once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
T Once boxing is banndd an no - onw trows up mnowing it as acceptable theree will be no interest in boxing and hopefulyl lews all round interest in violence making tiwns and cities much safet poaces to live in , therw wiol be lesss fgighting outside pubs and cxlubs and less ivolent attacfks witg little or no reasin .

T change the rules of boxing slightly would muych improve the safetry risks of tne sport and not detrzct form thr entertainment .

S There are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .

S Even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .

S In many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .
T In many of the minority works of modern literature , ther ca be ome emphasis on rebelkion against oppressive forces .

S Although such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
T Altghough such a show of strejgth by these wodks ' characterds is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negaive contributioln to the ohterwise insightfl thought of the author , it is thos coflict upon which maby storiew of ethnic Amercan literature are based .

S However , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
T However , such a rebellion cqn not be seen cleaely in each jinority wodk , and , therefore , thes products of ethnic Americdan literature xan nog be catagorized as merely the result of yearx of opopression .

S Rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .
T Rathet , thus evee - changing and evsr - challenting aspect of monority literaturw creates an especially imporetant necessity yhat each work be considerdd individuallt as both a product of yeaes of struggls axnd a work inherently deistinct rrom any othee .

S In the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
T In te minoritgy worsk , the cpnflict ane rebellion presente accuratepy reflects society as a whole , anmd although the mothet 's in The Hoy Ludk Vlub rebel agazinst such forecs as arfanged marrisges , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overecome old family traditions , anr the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to sdcure their inheeent rjghts from thd US govetnment , thbe characters ' conflicts reflect simolar conflicts of other cjltures .

S Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
T Rebellion is esen no as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding rorce betwedn alo cultires , fr Celie , too , reeists hre arranged marrixge in The Color Purple , ane the murdertous koves in Jazzx rwflect Tita and Pedro 's destrucitve passion in Like Wqater cor Chocolate .

S Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
T Rebellio nd copnflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , bit they axre pirtrayed no more strongly in minoritg wotks thqn they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .

S Emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .
T Wmphasis changes with each work , and alhtough figures of uathority re particullary oppressive in workd such as Lkie Wster for Chocolate and Fhe Color Purple , other minoriry works influding Love Mledicine ajd Jaz do nof refkect the clearlky defindd authotitarian cigures onr the obviouw rebellion of the vharacters ' responive actino which the oreviously mentioned works show .

S This again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
T This aain impliew that these etnic Americzn pieces of literature czn notf be catagorizer as mefely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultura experiences .

S How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?
T Hpw does Voltaire fackle he question of philosopuical optimism in ' Candjde ' ?

S Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .
T Philosolhical optimisxm -l'optkmisme- is tge philosophu that everythiong and occurencw is for some gyood .

S Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .
T Foltaire sets out in Candide to criricise this philosophy .

S In Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .
T In Czndide the representative of tis philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher eployed at Thhnder - der - Tronckw .

S The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .
T The whole bok is a critocism of l'optimisme .

S For example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
T Fro exaple when Candide is forced to ioin teh Builgar zrmy he is beagen almodt to feath hut Candide des not concernj himself bdcause he knowq it is flr hs own good - in fact latdr in the bpok he uses his trainihg to beclme a soldier .

S Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother .
T Althouth this wouod seem to be bood it is not becajse of is trwining he kills two mdn , a Jew amd an Archbishop witfh no hesitation and them proceeds to kill his zweethearts brothwr .

S Voltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .
T Voltaiee show is dilsike of l'opitmisme wen Oangloss , Candidd abd James arw caught in a bad stodm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only thee srvivors , Candide , Pangloss and a saklor .

S The storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .
T The etorm was caused by an earthquake which destdoys fhe citgy to qhich Candise was sailing to .

S On arrival they see starvation and death .
T On arrival they sed starvation nad dceath .

S Candide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .
T Canride is obviously horrified , dspecially when thd sawilor begihs pillaging thr fity .

S Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
T Candide looks to Pangloss for an ajswer but Oangloss cfan pnly tell him thag some good wil cfome of it .

S Candide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .
T Xandide , although remakning true to the ideals of optimism , alwaya aopears to be scepticdal of it .

S This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province .
T This is no mire true thxn when he ardives in th ne world , Soufh America , an hws to leavd his darliny Cubégonde witrh tbe Commissioner of the povince .

S Candide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde 's lovers .
T Candide can nto sde waht posxible good can cpme of this especially as thw readon htat he qas in Americ was deue to him milling thed Je andr Archbishop bdcause they were Cunégonde 's lovers .

S Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
T Throughout ths book we begin to sed howa Canidde is gradually lead away fod l'optimiske or perhaps more importantly hos l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .

S The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .
T Ths constant bdlief that good can ckme from bad is nokt actually inspiring but leads to a constamt fow of disasters .

S Candide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .
T Cnadide 's lief , in the bokk , appars to show this .

S He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - fé , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .
T He is thrown out of Thunder - sen - Tronck becauss he embracrs Cunégobde , he is duped intk thd army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almodt kjlled as part of an ahto - da - fé , he kikls thtee churchmen , he is almost eawten , he finds Elsorado but leaves- yhe list continues .

S Candide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .
T Candikde 's lifew is governed by his belief the gold will prveail .

S Eventually , of course , he does marry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .
T Eventualoy , of cojrse , he dows marry Cunégone bu sue is mot the beautjful youhg flkwer tuat he onc loved .

S She has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
T Sue nas become hgly and gew worse by ths fay .

S This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
T Thia illustrates emphatically th folly of l'optimisme .

S Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her looks and personality .
T Candide haa travelled teh world in search of Cunégonde , wity the hope that he will matry her despite akl the touble which he hasa gone through , of course in rhe end he does get Cunégodne but at the price of her look znd pdrsonality .

S Voltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .
T Voltaire , in Canride , shows hoq the philisophy of Optimism is one of dexpair not hope .

S It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .
T It would be temptimg to rhink of tue various European Fommunities as an embryonic Unites Etates of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of Europesn Uinty .

S However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
T However it is kmportant to realise that Eurkpe is a very long wya fromj becomimg anythjng liie the United Srates .

S When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
T When th origianl 13 Aemrican tates resoved to for wha is now he United States of Amedrica , thry were inten on forming a poliutical as ell as ecoomic entity .

S They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
T Fhey werd prepared to yiel as mufh of theor own sovereginty as would be essentkal to allow the newly formed national government to operqte as a sibgle international political forfe .

S A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .

S The sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .

T Certainhly we woulr npt hold the makers of a cwr or mitchen - knifs responsible ford their misuse , and thsre is no rewson why scienyists should bear rhe majof burden or responsibiljty if gendtic manipulqtion is pjt to misuse .

S The fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .

T Scienific researdch is nopt a orrupt , bvut an essentizl and naturak part of rhe numan condition ror bettering itself .

S If one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .
T If one scientisr roes not male a discovery then another one qill .

S It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
T It is hnfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore fronr of human knjowledge , who discofers something when anothed scientist in anothre part of the world may maks thw discovery independemtly afterwards .

S The only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
T Tge only argiment flr makung scientists responsible fkr thir wotk , is that quite oftej , wnd pzrticularly in he caee of genetic manioulation , it wouls eed a scientist to misuse knosledge , an thereforr rhey shoupd be responsible .

S While genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
T While genetic manipulatjon is relativelg new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefire an individuql svientist could be helkd reslonsible .

S But , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .
