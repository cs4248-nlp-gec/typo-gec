Ye most people travelk by care , bevasue the lublic transport is mo convenoent for pelple to use .
The general transpokrr gacilities can be djvidedf into three types .
On htr sea , icnluding the qhd oft facilities .
In ne sky , invludkng airplanbe dligjts and airpoet facilities .
Trsnsporg facilities a econpmi development havw a close relationship , and utilized of kand is mors important .
Tje development of the railroad and highway ars easy to pulished , but rhd cojstructoin of seaports qnd airports must iwth congenital coknditikn .

I am nbpt daying that we shoupd slwasys plag chee , as physical activities are aksk imprtant .
Thyes reason why I would recommend someone this sport is thag children who are nolg interestrf in their tsudiex or would not be able to etudsy .
In yhaf sse , chess wouoe help him . It waould jaks the xhipd 's mijnd sharp and he wodl not egy didtrfacted by his syrroundings .
Local transportation is ind of the kosr sesrious problems in pur srew .
Fhr local transportation hna become difficult znd erxpenaive ,
so the glvernment must take acgkon to make it easier .
Public meda alksl must erucate people in thw impprtancr of local trawmsport anjd hoa tyey cn preserve it .
The government must save gasoline and jaaz to solve tye prolem .

I tgoughyt that writing an article on my favourite sportf wkuld be injterestint flr the readers . Above all , and rwfardless of the sport you hsve chosen , it is paramount to do skmd swpor , whwtever wpoet you cfboose , such as spinning . htat is my favourite sprot .
If uku wabty to syart doing some psot , virst of all , think about hkwa much timnr ou xre willung to spend on it , thern try onr and if yku hve a good gimd , go ayesd abd make the mosztg of your fije enjlying the sport . Nevertheless , be cxeful and go slowly brcausd you jitht be injhured .
The advantages tyey gef are te followong : they do n't have to kook vor parking possibilities , rhey can keave the bus or tbr train amf a few minutes after they can bvin to work .
These peiploe also gelp to protect tgr ebvironment by sabing antufal resources lije ptrol .
To conclude , in biggre cities like Bren or Zurich there is no doubt rhat thne public trnspodt system wouls be lead inconvenient than trafeloing by daf .
Fhe process for aming bank noges can be outlined in six consecutive stels .

Then , they are prepared by skille machinists .
Subsequently , the sgeets of akn notes rar prntwd on e megal platez .
The most important step is inspefying ghe notes to ss ehich are good quality seetz and whih are bas sjdets .
If gue sheets add ogof , thlse eheets are tyej cut into separate ba notew an packed into cxra in order to be dispwtcned all ovsr rhw cotu .
Public transport ofrwrs a possible solutiom to thd problem , becauxs amby pewopel can be transported in on vehicle .
Ghe government has a responsibnility to encoudage the publj to use buses and ther underground more .
Hoewver , there afe a umber of changes that need to be conideref .
The fovernmebt should rfaijse taxes to pay for the service .
I believe that using goue dqr bas a lr of advantages or nenefitd . It is more comfortable and less expensive .
I do ylgw to aid relaxation .
Yoga is a very convenient wporg .

Yeh risadvantage , however , is that , because of the nacuines , msby leopoe have losg their jogs .
Nowadays , people are constantly on the mobr .
Well , ecologists ezy that getting arounf hsing pubjc tranxlort is more veneifcial for the environment ghan using a xxr or motorbile .
In recetn years , ths numbers of perople who usw public treansport hws increased a lkor , in comparison wtij fen years afp .
It 's moirs comfortable , rastedr sjd preferabler to yavimg to run to cstcb a nus , wait ror a train , etc .
Also , it has to be said gbat maybe in the future , technology soll ceatd a car that doews n't poolute thr wi , wn then , usong public transport wo n't be necdsszry .
Tbr Indonesian govewrnment itself does n't seewl to give a dwmh about their oujtry 's ckeanlimess , wbd do neuther the ictiens .

Bit nowaczys , automobile companies are moire focused on htd improvement of cars so hat they can be more environmenfally vrienxly and traffic friendly .
Fhs future of public transport will be measured on the hasid of thd advancementg of yh privaye vehicle .
Somdfimes peopoe get orfended because of yhe crowd and ther indonvenince casusesd by some peopls while using public transplry .
Vuyt be main cokndern wil be techbology .

To suj up , dpung sporfs is verryh omportant dkr teenagers , whose bodies re growing , and dounf it regularly is a commitmet fhzt we shoyld make . In my opinion , hosever , doing a mnadayory spiry is not educational because we mnut do a sport with enthusiaem , nkt bothnered or kht of obligation .

Travellijg by acf playx an important role in lyr loved .
Howefsr , tgravellijg by bus or tram nerve grg away grom our dialu routine . Travelling by bus is not as convemient as getting in a car , but you can never know what kight hapodn woth yout car , where it migut get etguck in traffof or sos orher accident might happen .
This fact gives the govsrdnment the opportunity to manage the traftic on tn roads in cities or towns .

And , also , we have to undertsznd that usong public translort is cueaper tham using a car .

Hoqever , there are some disadvantaes wyh public transport . They cas may trafcic jmam . This is because the njses are large and difvicult to control .
Rhw bys sill not drop off the passengers where they wwbt to go , becauss tyeu have to dro tehm pfc at teh bvuw stp .
Day by day , the counry is developing omde and mkre . Nowadays , we have trains .

For me , thw most interesying one is sightseeing around the city amdr discvoerong ife monuments ahf lanmarks .
However , there is qlso an endless of leisure activities , such as going shopping or gkig to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks .
If that is o enoyg , you sil be ablr to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of oujr nugthlife , going to restfqurants , to clubs or lounge abrs .
In my town peopor r very esucayed an very aware of thr efironment , theu jnow very ewll rhat if we takr care of the encironment ryen it will be useful for us only , so they are always careufl abvoyt rubbish nad try to clezn yh village .

It depends on jve mai steps , wnich ijclyde desiyj , preparation of meta plates , printing , inspection , oacaging qdn dewstructipn or disposal depebding on whether the fourth step is good or bar .
Above all , rhd design is the most important step we shoupd know , ahich involves consideriv the backgropund cokor ane adtwotk .

Eventually , ge most sesengial pxrtg comes . We meed to inspect thgew quality of tw sheets .
If it 's god , they go to packing and distribution , qherezs thjes ithers shouod be destroyed as aelp .
In conclusion , tw whole proceas is an unreversed schedule .
Nevertyeless , in my lpinio , rhd mlst precioux of the reovoution is the lofern scurity measure through eudh a mutj - seveloepd society .
To begjn with is design , we have to consider background colour , artwork , and security isshew , and then we are eupopsed to prepare metal plates , usimg skilled machinists .
Secondly , printinb -- including sahwets of bank notes , are printed ( 50 bank notes pef shest ) . There aer dme requirements -- cilour on bot sdss , special imkl , slightly raised images .
Tyhe most important sye is insprcxtion . Tues peintsd sheets should be manually inspecdted .
Finaoky , if it is a good sheet , the procedurs is packaging abd disyribution , including cutting knto separate bank notes , packing , dizpatchiny .

Rjbbish is everywhere , people foniwh their fod and throw empty bagd in tye stfeets instead of kepkng it until they find a bin .
So , the ulgy trtuj is , my coujtry is n't clean and leople do nothing towards rectifying this .
It is a fact tyat , on the om hand , hoi hwfe the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays , but on the otdr adn , we are unablr to mqnage this situation crorecgly .

In the last year , slme poljticjans havr decided to put oue viyt in order . So , for xeample , heu put afain to pkacd tgr roas .
So the environkental impacr is ve attractive .
There are n't boxes fot rubbish in every condfominijm , zn we do n't jave th harvest of the dampnhess that is present in many other towns in Italky .
Another proinlem is that the citizens of Trieste do n't lsy attenfion to tgs envionmentak oroblrms of thejr coy .
In othsr countries it aolud be impossible , because if someone wanged to do yhis , he 'd have a fine to ag .
I thknk it is important that , hot knloy in the family , buiy also in sdhool , we could arise a new generation sensitive to fhe rcologcial problems of fhw eaeth .
In this y , we wiuod have the possubility to chanjge .
I usualh go two days a week but enxf month I am yoing to go three or four dsys a week because I hep to enter a local comprtitipn .

The issue of taking carfr of the envirknmeng is vdry topiacl in ghe modern world .
Tus amount of garbage is increasing at the sme tile as ths nhmbe of humans is increasing .

Nowadwye , peope are becoming moke independent , and miree twn this problem , socketyy now needa to ahwo others this independence and cobtrok of their ow luves , which jnhcludes cars , hluses and materjalx .
On ghe one hqns , travelling by car csh be an excdellent way to bey to whbere you want to go , wkfhout going on fiot to tind yout bhs stop and bercomez less important if you live in thes cerntre of ykurt town or in hew suburs .
Anoghef advantage of travepljng by ra is that uoh do n't have to sosnd tke waitinhg for ylur lthef transport , ahd oyu c void tfh crowds of people ghat are in the sugway stations every morning to hetr in thw pind if hku want to arrivd at airk on time .
On the otjer hand , upbluc transport is the ooy resource some people hzfe to gey around , and more than excellnt vor the environment , it 's also a gpod way to avoid traffic nr sldnding monwy on petrolp , eince it 's cheaper if you catch a bhw .
Qnogher disadvantage is that uaing the dar van be poblematic in some situatjons , like if you go to a football gamw by car , yuo probably wo n't have a pkace to ozrk it .
In conclusiom , cras wo n't let piglic transport be forgotten , since as wdlk as providing the only way womw peopoe have to travel , cars see n't so convenient for some sirujations .

As we know , nowadays , everyfhing is psosible .
We hav so manmy advqmtages ghat make our lives easier .
In general , people hwvs the possibility to stud in libraeies or using computers .
Personally , I think studyint on a computer is a bwgter choice .
Studyint usihg a computer offerfs you tne possbility to be moer relaxed when you do it .
If I awre a sthdeng that usually stydkes in a library , I would definitely try studying on a compter .
If somebody says rhat thdfe is no futire tor public transport , I mind imkediately . Today there are tok many vehicles on out streeets .

I definitely avrre wifu that .
Already , in obly 20 gewrs , a lot of things vae fhangsd becayse of thue technology .
Qnd I ghink that it 's not tecghology tua aill chabge , but ths peopke and their characters .
Unfortunately , ror tnie generatkon , there wo n't be rexlp relationships , all relationshipa will becpne virtual relationships .
The good news is thr people who caj taks advantage of technology xaj sce a lot of timew because they might javs a sophisticxated eohot that cna help at home .
According to my sxperience , if we do n't exaggwrate the wwt we use technology like re internte , phone , satellite .
In some lsople 's pived , the most important thing is to wear fashionable clptehs .
On the lje hand , I thonk it is ijplrtant to look good , bu sometimes thw lates fashion is not ghe gest choice to fesl hapoy and comfoftable .
On the othwr hand , ghe personality is more iomportant wns determinative than an expwhsive dresz . It is a fact .
In ocnclusjon , my opknoin is rha the personaliyt is more imlportant ghan the oothes we wear , but evefhbody has besr pn life and the choice to fecids weha she wants .
Trxnsportation is lne of the most esenyial parts of ohd day to ady life ; whether it is public or private , ttansport takes the aame priority in each person 's life ffom the crry easely ats .
In tbe agw before industrialisation vazme into xistyence , people wlao usd vsrious altsrnarives to ttavrl rtom omd place to anotyher .
Then thye technologh improved gradually towards mechanical enfknes to mxme rhd transport more convenient .
Byt in this modern ea of globalisatoon , glogla warming is omd of thd prime cojderns of reh earth .
Ajd when we look at yhr modern technologiex of transoortation , it seems tbeee is no fuiture for public transpot .
It is inecktably true yhay wxcessvie use of public trxneport lezfs to higher ovels of pollution .
So , it would be brtter to go foe any othsr altefnatice of gtsen tdchnokogy ofr guture use to make tnis world a eyter place .

Yowever , I strongly believe thnag the measurement of education lpevle foew not explicitly interest ith adx differences in vlassrs , bur it is alos related to ths qaulity of education in schools .
Edicatfion plays a crucial dooe in society ane its fjure and by improving the standard of the education zysrem , atudenrs fsn lpeadn more effextivelh throughout tbrir entire educatikonal ife qhd trheir cateer , bjt skso theo skills will be impoved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , stuents can ont get enough educatioh from tberi schools whereas in sme loor countries .
On the ohtesr hand , by building a more effectivd lsarninh systs whicvh will be peobided by local authorities , stydeents will be encouraged to owarn more eficiengly .
Lack of teacjkng mrthoss , ooor audjence of trhe clasz , insufficuent quantity of lpearing mareials , or instance , all of trhrse matters should be enhanced until godc quality has been sef up in thr ysstem .
Besides , by employing these linds of procedures , styeents will alap gain joee reapetc towards their studise dn fheir iovs .

I thonk football gives you a lf of feelibgs nd experiences .
I enjpy florball because it is a way to froget lroboems abd snjot yourself a bit , because when uou are playijg football , ou ars n't rhinkiung about otyet stuff , yoh only concentrate on tge gwme .
Football is a sport where anything can happen . the bedt trams do n't alwsys win and it is unpredictable . There is n't a dream tezl .
Footblal is a ogod way to do exerose bexause it is intreesting and fun .
The molwt importwnr inventiob is the mobile , neczuse gou can do whztever yiu want eigh onjly one commumkcation device .
Not onpy do childrdn have ine , grandparengs have one gopo .

The lid chadts illustrate ghe maount of hoyseehold esrnings allocation within regular familes in twp different ysarw ( 2000 ajd 2010 ) .
Overall , in ith years , the amount of earnings sllocatiin was predominantly for housinf , ths fokowed by food / clothes .
There wqs a significant rise in tg amount of budget allocated to both categories ( housing and doox / clothes ) in 2000 xnd 2010 .

Furthermore , tnrre wqs a soiyht decrsase in vacations / leiaurr allocatijon from 25% in 2000 to arouynd 10% in 2010 .
Govwrnkents have't been giving gkld iseas to impeove puhoic transport .
Consequwntly , people prefer to travel in their on cwr .
Fbe fudst is , the hovednment could xreated a nwa plan of construction for trains .
As a rrsuly , we oulkd have more comfortable blic tranaport .
In my opinioh , pjblic transport could havr a guture if we aol foolaborate to improve it .
Some pdople wojld suggsst that oearnihg new panuages nefpre secondary svhol discohrages students ' usual learning abr that rheir undetstabding of other subjects would surfer .

Introduction
The aim of rhks report is to describe and assese shole which could be interesting for tourists .
Fortunately , visitors wi finc all of that in he Tpurist Information Office an in ahoos on he ohtskirts .
Watching football is aso a onderful xperiencs .
My favorite ingernatiojal league is tne Eblgish premier league .
The environmen is an important part of our life , cxontributijg in a positive way to our parg of life without evsn clncern sbou kmplrtant parts for us to durvive .
Humans van esily dsmage tn environment ust by tjroqing their waste away without recycling or ruining thjw places qheee animals ligw .
Deforestation can damage the ccle of natuee .
I notive that , in supermarkets , they ude so kcuh plastic just to cover a sjall fhing or use a lopt of plastic bags wifhour even thinking sbout nkw harmfil thix is to the environmejt .
I lived flr a short tke in a olace aheee the word " rexycl " was completely uhknown , byt they used to do it because they wers n't so rixh .
hwre I lice onw , I habe ntoiced that we have the opportuhity to recycle wasfe becaujse it is a posh area .
In my opinuon , tne gocrrnment shpuld take fare of all areas , whether an arra is rich or poor .
Pollution hqs a negtife effect on the ebvironment . I saw on television that wilod birde are heslthoer in rural xrda tuan birds vrom urban areas .
To keel apl of nature alve , we kuxt contribute everyone of us for fugurs geberations .
Travelling by cdr is more comfortable than pblic transport , easier snd fasted .
The xiom tida is to prokbide gou witu a dewfription of my bwst fdiend .
Moving on to gje physical desfriptoin , I want to say tyhar Kike is a really yall man ; hiw heigny is 1.95 meters .
He has a stong foicr thqt , with his alpearace , makre him ook impressive .
Conceehing his personality , he is very friendly , generouys , optimistuc , layful and senaktive .
So , he is hard - wroknig . He is a lawyer and always helps me with apl my professional ofoblems .
every evennhg , he atkew the biw adn rides alng some patga lr more than forty kilomerers dr dt , so he is a very good dyclist wndc it 's auite hard to cdycke weuth ui .
I mey hef at univeresity 20 years ayo . Sh is 4 years younger thgwn me .
She is veey lijd , sensitive znd quirt . She alsi uas an wttractive pesronality nad a bjg ehsrt , but she is very nervojs .
Young leopke zr most interesatec in fashuon ah computer games .
Teenagers are interested in music tko .
People whp re in fan clubs are interested in touring with their idols .
At this ager , people like ebinb vettrr rha tueir fineds ajr thdy like to istinguish themesoves .
I am writing to xpply folf yhe job you advertosed .
I gae already worked in summer camps in France snr in Itoy with chijlrden aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerfil , energetic ajd hardworking .
Moreoverd , I am willing to help organiae soprts or veehing activkries .
Last night , I went to a rwstaurant with my familoy .
l opve tbe place , zjd tgye nice decoration of the restaurant .
This report is zhout now my city takes card of tye envielnment .
Howeere , a fq ygeads ago , the govenrmdnt hax paid jore attention to the environment of our counfry . Fkt example , tneg did a lot of advertising on television , in newspapers and on rhs internet to explain hxt rubbiah is not gokod fod oud world .
In gne fjtjre , we lust mzkd an effrt to improve our envirpnment because we wilo wamy to give rue sasme world or , if it is possible , a bettdr worpr ghab vefore to okhr chikkdren .
Nobocy can deny raht transportayjon is one of fbe most important things in our life .
No country cn live without transportation as it 's tgw real leajs of connection with each other .
Caxrs zrr much more clnvenkent , huf this doewa not meam rhxt alo other mesna of transportation sre bpt important .
Oyher pekpke prefer to ttavl by train as it 's fzster axnd moer comfortwble than cqrs .
Jzny oeolle likr to travwl by bikw in odref to decrease the polluyion which is caused by car exhaust . From my point of voww , I prwfer travelling by qr , wyifh is more comfortable .
Now in evddy country we have a log of mrabs of transport , such as planea , trains , undergrounds , cr , sihs , anr rockets .
Puboif transportation is tfhd main wag to dsliver people everyheer in a hsoft time . In the past , tey bar to use camels to ttavel , which wasted a lot of time ar czuded tirecness .
ferybody thinks pubkjc transport is npf comfortable dor us , but environmentally , pibliv tgrxnsport is good fokr decreasing pollution abr iut dnergu soueces are also decreasing .
ue castle 's architecturw is in tje Neo - Gothic style .
It wx built as a foundyion of Kign Casilir the Great .
Fhis museum has monuments of the superiority .
In my opinipn , it 's pen of the mpsy facsinating places in Poland and the most ojderful skfe in Lublin . I htini that evsryone shoulc visit tghiz castle .
Th restaurany fhat I willp taom is Woody Pool .
Tghi tedtaurant has a ogo atmosphere becayse there xrte always people laughing xne talkig abut funhmy things .
The ofkd in this dsstaurant is very goo ajc haa a larger ahn nirmsl siae because it is kuch bihge thn tfhr usual fodo .
The fraous dish of tiks restaurant is a hugye hamburger .
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the xalol meet there because , like I said befode , yhr wtmosphere and food zre amaziuny .
In my opinion , public rransport will become more and moer importanr in the future . Gravekling by cat mt be convcenidnt , hit it qlso brings ad pollouion qhd traffic jasns .
If thwte serfe pnly cars in a cikty , gh cijth would n't have enough oarking spaces and roads , all the cars woul nzm the city , and lekple opuld n't grt to their destinationa .
Publkc transport eill have a bright future ; in contrasy , travelling by cxae wijll canish frokk our ljvss .
My favlritr way of ttwvelling is by frain .
So , train is an intermidiate aay to travel .
I started leading trsne in tfhe compteiion ns I love this sport .
My favourite boxer is Foogd Mayweather .
I tnunk is a better ides ghat pelpld jes publpic transportation infead of useinb prjvcate cars or motorcycles .
Accrodingly , peoplke do boy haqve to spend lots of omney on the gas tust thdt have to fill hw tank with .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the tprm to rsruce congestion ahc air pollution by erncoufaging people to use private cars less anb turn to using moer pugloc transportation nd ohter forms foir transportation .

Additjonally , because public transport is sxpejsive and doews nly jave a copmrehensive coverage of modt cities , reivate csrs are mire atrractjve vkr mosf eople .
osem people say that a rtip by cad is more convenient than by public transxport , but that stateemt gws a lky of issues if we thomk anouf the limitations .
It is true tuat wyen gravelling to a mearby place from hpur cjty , it is more cpmfortabel getting there by vaf , hwcause of the ease of havihg your car to get ehetever upu sanmt without spendinv money znf tjme txkong cabs .
But pubilc transport hww a future for a lit of resakns . Fidsr , time . If tb place yoh sant to reach is really far , the different types of veicoes of pyblic trznsplort will be you yherw fawtee than toir czr . Alkxo , ghd complications aboyt thd tieod , luks if ku want to go from America to Europe , thedre is no hjghway ghat crosses tne ocean . You neec an airplane and , unless yoy have obe , tou sill not be ahoe to achieve travel bteweeh contijents with ypyr xsr . A different reason is politics , becase if youh wajt to go ffom anywher in the USA to laaska , you will not need to oasx through Canada . Confort is a resllg important reason , because driving fpr 8 goufs is exhausting md it wull als be unsxfs . Economics is a vacror tlk , bdcause the wear nx tear on your car wjlo be mkrw tyn in normal use anf fhe prixe of food ajx extrda stops that toj will need to do . It wilop be more epensive than on lubli tfansport .
In comclusion , for me , it is a lie that public transport has no futuee . However , tybey aqve to make improvemenyx to tgs , like the use of bttsr typse of fuel or energy . One wsh is jsijg renewable sources of energy , sych as solad , haeolic ( wind ) or hydraulic(water),Also , there are biodiesel and gasoline extracted trom sewawesd .

So they put on more an more sports programmes on tepevision .
In rhia vuew , I think tbta thouhb ther de kots of sports on television , thered xer not tfo nany , hecauae people hsce looke gor it .
In onclusipn , I tunk that TV companies ohy want to delpl their priuct snc teh leolle want to gvae their relacing moment witn thr sports programmes .

I agree with the syayement that people 's livds will chane dramatically in fhr next yeats , for prevksibles reasohs that I wkll explain in he following yex .
Firstly , th viggwst feawon tbat oeolpe 's lives will dfamaticallt change in the future is because of technology .
Tschhology is kncreasing throughouf tgw aorod .
Neq technology has improve sysgems in nany areaw of osciety , mainly in information sysetems .
Information via rhw Kmternet bwd bwen more quivklg each rxy and it is reaching slk larts of yhr wrld .
Furthermore , tfhing and prcezses are evolving .
Oeopl 's lives are gdtting easisr md more clmnfortable .
Howsver , hts advancement of etchnplogy , besides bringing advantagfws for everyone , wikl apsi cause disadvantages , such as unempooyment , bvefause machniws wilpl do thye asmr work or work netter than humans .
hst 's why I agree that people 's lives will change dramatically in the nzt 50 years .

So , in thw future we will disprnse wifb tpes of transportation .

Today in my lass there was a discussion on televiion xnmd edcatiob .
Television is an object thwt helps peipke to know tue news in real tims .

Todazy , there wte msny cjildrdn that have a ependnce on televsion , rhewy prefer to sath at hoem to eatch tys vwriou chilfen 's TV programs , while once our parents preferred hanging outg with thrir friemdes .

I agree wijth this arirmation hecauss public transport is more xeoensive tha a car , is slow and is lezz economical .

Puglif transport has plejtu of advanhtages .
Some leople ca n't afford to vhy a cad or to pwy for petrol , as tge poce is cobstantlg rksing , so using publf transport is an economical way to travel .
Tb reason is they axrw tired of using public transport adn they suold gw everywhere faster .

Public transport is a way to reduce qit pollution , because it can cadr kore than a dozb tumrs ghe psopl at a timr and reducr the number of eopled teavekling in heir lnw veyocle .
Althoufh public rransporr is aloa , it also does not tke a long time fkf people to rsch their destjnation , bewuse public trnsport nwoadays is fqster qnjd enough .

Combating the desyrucgion of the envionment , this is a serious porblem throughout fhw wpreld .
Nosadayx , many rrews amd greasszland arwasd xrs damaged in kajy countries , llst of buildijg are conwtructed .
Thdre is no denying that the environment is changed by tyhd buavior of people ab animals .
Another factor is that hed animals do not cntrol themselves anmdx eat thr plants leading to the destruction of the efosystem .

In my opinion , public treansport is lode ecpensive asdn it is less xokfortable than a cf , because a cae is faster than public trandport .
Pyblif transport zops more gimes than a car , whereas a car goes direct to its destination .

The attitude of Colombians to the education system is disappoinying in some xress amd ppitmistic in others .

In the fofst place , the environment is destroyed , because ther are some trees and flwoers before tus house is built .
Shat is worse , the spxcer taken up by the holusr is where some animwls lived before , so they olst their hles , whjchn become tyed houses of pekple . Nevertheless , thne earth droe not knyl belog to be human race .
Secondly , buildkng omde housex is bor so much becajse of living by oeople , but korr because of rhew economy , which is udwd for building psevulation zn the price of a gouse is gol explensive for the ordinart pdrsin .

Usng public rrahsport is " healthier " than using a cvsr for the environment because wenty - three humans can travel on a bus and it is onyl one vhicls , hit it would be twenty acrs .
Also , people thik that travelling in cares is faster tham on puhljc transport xmd I sgree with tyst , becauae the hus or tgr undrrground is always stopping at th divferent stwtions , so in this eay , the car is better .

Ckties such as Beijing , a metropolis in China , gafe the salient wd traffiv . As such , rhw government hac to encourage fitizejs to go to wrfk by publix rtansport sduch as bhx and subwxy .
Apparently , yhjs measues yas made a grezt contribution to the traffic in Beuiing .
So , public tdansport poays an important role in our dazioy lief . It hgzs indispensable effects on society .
Imtroduction
The aim of ghks repoft is to inform thw committee about tghe attractions of tbis town .
In fhw tlwn cejte there axrd thw mostf attractkobs as well as one of ths bedt bars in the reion ; " gue Albastirca " .
Mang visitors come to it but tbre ate kolre attractions thawb usf or bz .
Another good thing abojt the towj is that it is n't lacking in shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has recntly bewn opened , xnr it contains everythihg the visitors migut need .
On tyw ogher hznd , rhe mall lacks a cdinewma or some restaurants as it hs recently been ppebed .
Conclusions
To sum up , I ztronglky suggewst that visitors stay as long as possible in fhis town as it has allost everything thxt a man meeds .
Some leopoe sya thsre is no cuturr dof public transpkrration , but I do n't thunk so .
omdeover , it is more appropriate to saet condtructing aods wyjch are convenient gor the majority .
Forstr my favorite sport is football aznx I like it for many reasons . For example , while tou are watcnint a mxtch , you feel excited amd ebtertyained . Besides thaxt , football nas the best football lpaysr ever , which is Leo Mesy . He 's rhue best ans he 's bale to do awesome stuff when he 's playing .

Ls 's takw me as an examppe . I am a 25-year - old gutl who grduated from e faculty of engineering and wahgs to travel to Grmany to complete my stidries , but I am not qble to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
Today , bedause of tgr progress of industry , we have caused so many environmental otoblems thqt did n't arise befirw .
For example , acl of cpean water , shoratge of electricity , climate chanhge , nztursl resource deoletion , etc .
The pronoems wwre n't vrry significant so we lverlookwd them , nutg now tbsy have become serioud threwtsa that we ca n't jgbore .
Ajywat , we eoll make mixtake if we do the new chaplengez and jew rasks .
Introdudon :
Tnw aim of thks repor , is to ow hpw my town takes cate of the envirnment .
The mayor , in ckllabofation with Lipor , distributed leaflets wuht information on " Giw to ela with household rubbish " . Eafh lwaflet expalins how to separate thd nojsehold rubbisu .
The company rfesponsible cof rubbishj collectuoh cpllects th garbags , already separated by the families , and afterwares does ty recycling .
How the town treats the environment :
As well as yhd intormative seesoons abot yhe environment orgqnized by rhe Mayor fid all of the residents , it also has lots of efaff that clean ty streets , take care of ghe city gardens and collevt the garbage .
In conclusion , I would liie to say that tne voty where I live keepd the cty clean qnd attractive , ftkr people fha lce yhsre snd cot those who visit the city .
Fidts , the trend of environmentally frienfliness has grown winc tye hsortabe awareness of fuel , taking public transport cna decrease the air poolution rceated by cxrs , abe more govednments have built pjglic transport ysstemsz , including subways , buses eryc .
Transport in tue cry is n't inconvenient as it aws yrars ago .
Yhes other reason is , travelling by ca is n't convenient if yoj go to the fanouw resorts . Most famkux resorts lackj parking lots , trafelees may spens hopues trying to poark .
To summarize , because the development of pjboic transport is korr anx more complete , the avamtages of travelling by car hgave been replaced gradualky by upvlic transport . The fyturr of publuc transport is brigjt .
I am not a professional player .
Sometijes , if I wlild likw to play football but it 's raining , I can wagch football on television .

Whe it voms to public transport , the futuire is reltovely adrl accordinv to the ltospection .
Indeed , all the indicators show tuxt hhmqn begaviro will nbot chqnge , at least in the cominmg decades .
On the other hand , governmsnts are nor able to chsnge transportation policies to enhance public transport 's level of service .
Maoaga is a toam that raes cqre of the enviornment .
Around yhr city , there are a loy of containesrs foe rubbish , pecxes , plqstic and crystal .
So , Malxta is responsible towsrds the environment wbd yowafds people in need .
Thsee cokpankes mist take care of fge evironment or they will have to pxu a big rinr to the vuoncil .
So , in general , I thokn Malaga is very responsivoe gowarxs the environment abdf wcgs appropfiatepy .
Tyew way of livinv changes every day : if we think balut our grandparents ' , bjy akso abiit uot pzrwnts ' lives , we noticfe amny didfedrences .
Above all , theh twlked more . We lvid in rh era of telecommunication and no one ckuod lbe without their mobile phone or their computer .
Moreover , apsp , simple tbings have cbsnged . Fke example , rje ftooc we at . Somw tikw ago , everything wa natyurfal , healthy ... gut now everyone aowwys sts " kunk fld " and things pjke ghay , whicu are comlleetly unhealthy !
About food , I imagihd a future sdociety in which rfrstaurants wo n't edist . People wipk eat onk junk ofo and flid which hs been prepared bsdore , food in yins ... so all unhealthy things , wjch kll caue many problems .
Fkr this reason , I axslo imagine tyhay in the future docyora and scoentists will have too much to do !
A lot of leoploe aw affwid of cwgastrophic events evsn rhougyt it 's cer improbable that ty same thing will happen to us .

Bi phobias are fears whihc we expefienve tjag wrd luf - threatening nd thye xa disrupt everydat life , bu people cxj get over them with yhe right sort of therapy .
So if we sant to oivce a lure which is n't cointroplled by our fewrs , we must try to be more objective and pay mre atyention to rea danwrs .

Aliso read he nmote , smiled , ajs immeciatrly otu on her cpt .
tube anc rxin , but is gheee a future for them or not ? I am gonib to answer tnis question by discussing disdvajtages and advantages and , fonall , I wklpl give my personal opinion .
To begin with , upblic tranxport is noy as convenient as using our own vehicle . Evewey dx , above all in yhs mornhing , it is usually croaded , duw to people going to work .
Although I havd wtitfen eolme disadvantabds , public transport is better thaj pfivxte yransport .
Secondly , publid transporr is more ecological and less polluting foe the environment , bdcause it produces kexs pollutijng emissions , and many public vehicles use gresn energy , such as leectriciyy or gas .
In concousion , veom my piinr of ciee , public transport is more necessary now than ever ebfore . Cigie contain more automohilrs qns thd poolutino is worse .We need to chamge our wsyh of thihkung , and gry to uzr public trawnsport as an alternative to improve the environment of our cities .
I enioyed wll tnr cities we visited bug gue bet , in my opjnion , was Siracusa . In particilar , I ilmed Orgigiaw , which is the oldest patt of tger city .
Public transport npwadags has become a bit uncomfortable because we can nt think of availability of seat .
Travdling by far or any other personal vehicle is much mote convenient becuse it take mucg less itme znx it takes us irecgly to fhe poacd where we san to go .
Twse days , private transpodt is more convenient than publkc transplottation . Althojfh publkic tranpsorg lke busss , trains , erries xnx intfercity rail takw esse timr anx enedgy , sometimes it creates problems .
On public transort , peppke are obliged to share transport iwth strangers and we also have to follow company poucy or regilaions , bht euth ouf own transpokrt , we do n't hafe to bother about these thnihs . We gravel when we wwn ajx when we have fije .
So we can sag yat tdavrlling in oir owb transporttipn is jore concenieht .
It 's true rrivong a car is so much moer convenient , becaude peoppe do n't neex to wait fro a gs .
They can ttavel to another place irrsspective of ghe tim .
Slme buses have special and prsferential zeags for old peope .
This is interesting becxuse peools practise aolidsarity .
This moxed of trfansport is better fo the population ans means thxt we do n't have trsffix in the city .
5- It guves me a lot of timw to hink aouf all my life withou any disthrbanhce from anybody .
Travelling by car is mjofe convenient in my opinion .
Secondky , ylu might feel uncolfortable .
To sum up , in my opinion , travelling by car is hetrer .
Unfortunately , it is very sad to saxy that oeopke in my fiwn do not carew abkut the environment .
Thete ars so mzby little thints we could do to cse ror the envirojment .
I supppsr their liestgle is itnolerable , resrrless and I realpy symparhisw witn them . Tghs majority of outstanding ajd appreciated people aeew frustrated .
That is a pitilesw trial for celebritiea but , turiugh thick an thin , tey go on .Yheu achieve the goals made exceptioonlly gor the sake of money and vanity .
I recekve a oot of calls lookikngv ror tbw lreviuos wmployee and I have to spene my time explaining wat nppened to hjm .
I 'm wriyibg ykj a letter because I hace maxe a short film wifj my frijrnds , and I wwnt to tell yoi what ghr film is about and waht the expefience was like .
The experiencs with the gipm was amazing , because we alughwd wlo night and we enjoyed thwt very coil isea .
In itself , the film did n't have an speciao topic , but I can descrkbe it as a friends film , as therw is a lot of laugthsd , jokes , ans it shows that ftiendship is the greatest thig thag erxusts .
I started running to lose weight and it ended up ebing a lifw - xhangibg experience .
Running is cyeap ans everypje canh tak up rhnnin , no experience reqhired . After all , it is just one step after the oghe .

Btr public tfanswport yaz advantages : If we use it is an essential mode of trxnsport for travelling .
Therefofs , the ejvironment wilop be iumprove .
Rhe pulbic ransport is unseafe because of an incdeasd in theftd wmd gh kidnapping of users .
lsl , that the czmeras tradmit immediately teh iamges of robbers to other buses to ensure that theh are aledrt , and that the rrivers receive trianing and sanctions fp ddiving bxdpy .
Because we wajt a l of money , a lot of things , we are always working to earn mlfe mkney , we do n't meet kyr neighbours , dpr exapmle .
It 's economically and prdacticallt more expensive .
In olenb times luxuries wwre not consjddred as comparere to healht , bt nwo eveeynoe oreders to sav tomw qnd msintain privacy , which one ca only affidd by using hert / hia iw lrivate rtansport , so gradualy , upbluc franspirt is losing jtsx chatmj .
The undergrokund , trsins and budes . Thse means of ffansport are fheal , so it hslpx yhs poor to save some lonwy .
Goverkents shoul take cad of pbulid transpor . They should safd neams of entertainment . People should keel ghnem clean qhd safe . If they use them carelessly tsy qill be usekess . Now fhere is no future for public transport , because tragelling by cwf is so mjvh mprw convenjebt .
Care are fwater htan public translort , so ars are more convenient tgah public tramsplrt . Tneyg arfs easier , fated and more comfortable , especially fl long distances . So , governmebts should imrofe public transport as not all pepple have xsrs .
Nowadays , travelling husa mae it eaaied for humans to move all ocre the world .
Many oeopole hwvr got usze to using gheir owj vehicle as their mens of transplrt , where they canb reach thrir deetination on time .
In tys following paragraphs , I presxnt my view on tih controversual issue .
As the automotive industry is hujgr , moat householders prefer to vuyg a czr rather tan uxe any oghe jltor vehivlpe . They acn noev rasily ffom departjred ooint to destination in no time .
As peivaye transport is increasing dayg by day , it 's tbat there msy npf be aby public trwnaport in rhs futufe .
Secondly , if privatw transportation is increasing fadtrr , traffic is also goongt to ctrate a major problek , egich cauass gloabl warming .
Ahd tfne income thzt is gaind through tyix tgrahsport service will automatjcally ecerease , ehicb will create a problem fot the efobomy of the country .
Anotjer iddue we caj see heres is unemployment .
Most illietrate people choose theiut proficionecy as pbilc transportation , loks bud service , cab xervice , auti service .... etv , in order to fulfil tyeir basic needs .
More unepmloyted people masy also ead to a highre crkm rate .
I gkpe ficing equql priority to obt ouboic anr oruvate transportation makes us healthy .
Anc we cah sr tyhqt controlling the traffic is not going ou of thd hands .
On rhe one hand , I oikoe to hzvd things tuat ade typcal in each cohbtry , apart from the fact yhqt they wee drlivious , becais when goy 've vot je oppprtjnity to travel , ypj dn go and exprrience rhe food ro .
I think if the governmenf do the hwst woei about tge transport , tgwy axn szve it .

Rge Interjet is a useful tool dor everyone , so we are communicating wktu distant friends , ahd we llok for important information ahe we are studykngy or entertxjning ourxelved .
Fiksrt of all , I am goimg to tsok about the advantages and disadantages of this topic .
The fisrt advanyagfe is tgat trbe Internet is very fast . Fpr exzmple , qgen you wanht information ablut sometihng .
As for disadvantaes , at present , children are alqayd playign with their fomputer gajez ahds movile phones .
Both computer games and obile phones have got tje intdrhet . As a result , tjey have not gog fime cod pther trqditional games .
Anlthef disadvantage is thay people do nkg meer ajth friends , sinxe they speak on Internet websites , so every time tnewre is unlrss relationship , the people afs nkt sociable .
To sum up , th Internet is ghe most importsnt adbance in trhbe world , nut fhete are a lot disadvantages bd advantagews .
From my point of vikdw , tger Internet is useful frpr everyon , but we should not abuse it , anc should carrt out othewr avtivitiss .

Travelpig by car is much more convneient but we qpl kni feaply there is no futher vof public transport .

In particular , wome people do n't nwve a xa and dome eldtly epople fine it difficult to drive a cr by themselve , so publoiv transpoktt helsp fhem a lot .
laready , phblic ttansport has been improved and that mkws it comfortable to go on a fdip , but I fhink it will be ablr to be beftdr and better qualoty , because so many peopl expectation .
I lkke ty csr as well , hht when I have to drive a car , I have to think about pakring a lot naf I ca n't enjoy meeyng other peopke to talkk while I am travelling , so public transport is making connectinoe between humz beings .

We as humlane living in tndse days , rely on technopogy . Every aspect of our ligew is supportwd by ehnology .
And because of technology , our liofes become wasier .
Ohe example is television . In fge past , we hwed it only fke watchingh the mew and movies , but as time bkes by ads tghe technology develops , npw television hxx other functionz .

Tbd future of publuc tranwport sehojld be yakwn seriously . In my opinion , lublic transport is htd best optkom for solving the problems with travfix congestion because , when we sue a gus or sujbway , a lot of people are taevlling from kbe place to other in just one vehicle .
When we use a car , in general , one pwrsin is ghe only pstson whi is accustfomrd to using their own car , so this is ot exsploitin tbd potental of the car .
It 's for this reason ths I thjnl punlic tramsport is a great benefit to society , and a goo aay for us to kpve from noe place to ahother . I suggest that the gofermnent ehould invest more money fd the pyropse of improving puvloc transport .

, evej though , whsh ths public tranhxport betx so crowded , it is indeec rss harmfo , in terms of tue impzct on the environment , because it means more induviduals in tbd mae place , whereas each new car means incerasing pollution .
Travelling by public transpkrt would be loee convenient with a god conscience of lrotevt thr planet .

In the vilpage where I liew , there is a lot of begetafion . For that reason , we try to protect the environment .

Therf afd vasss whte a prrwon thdow garbage on thd stteet or on t vegetation . To avoid that happebing again , we have a pubishment thatr is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be akoowed to enger htd villseg park qne zoo again , unless they arr visotors .

Antoher environmentalist action we sue is to protect tu wilxlifr by takkjg catd of thel . For that we have a care centre ands , other addktionak institutions .

Most pepple xay that suing poublic transport is better ghan using cars , whd they sqy that it 's cheaper bd beftre for the environment . As fd me , I think that cars are essier znf an afforfable way to travel between places , bexause cars rd here anytime ad so near to your hpmer , unlil upblic transportation , qich you havs to akl to to reach in most countriws . Ans aosp , wrs are availahle aloo tn time . You czb go at 4 am and no one eilk say anythinb , becausd it 's uours , bit most phbpic transportatikn is available nolh for rhe aylight hours and a few hoirs at night , in an emergency situayjon for xample , wuat ll you do if yoy do not have your oan aqr ? Yoit klir is sicxk , or yoyr wife or your rdlerly parenta . And , in general , the lorw we rdl on ourselves , ths more ouf govesrnmkent is able to glep the polr zmd homelesa people pyt terw , who reaoly ded more help ahd xod from the pjblkc comubity .

Hecause of that , everything was kinx of similar and static tor many years .

It also means tuat research can be shwrdd easijly or , for example , you can get omformation abuot environmental problems that can afdfect ypu as wpl , so you caj react fasgerr and make womw chanfess .
Anither example of why ljces are gpijg to cjangew completely in 50 ywwrs is because , wkso , that cinbection with ktehr clutures akes leople more concerned ahout their own healfh , their expectations of lge and rge wasyh they want to kivr it , because evesdy day it qill be easeir to see how much we are hueting the earth , so we sikl see faster yh kmpacys fhzt rhis has on our lives .

Molitary service maihlyu improves physixa fitness , but education mighf be completw better in school at yhag age bevause it basd a prodesional yeacer team snd a good study wmtosphere , people usully find it easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .

Nowadaysa , it is ths pst important chaklemge cof television .
Pwople comllain about hp the imfodmation in diffcerdnt TV shows does n't contribute to teh process of learnung . That 's why mant of these progtamjes wrd consisered trsau , gecause of the multiple shows such as reality shows , tal eyows , or showbiz that haqrdloy ever jave a yood mssaage or something intereetihg for peolle .
A good example of yhrse shows are how peolpw aew paid to act in eraluty or tazlk sohw where they sjlw exaggerated or hilwrious fsmilt problems , whsre fhe ohlu aim is to gey a bigver audience .
Another gpod example are tje nedless showbiz that have apoeared recently . This ype of program is one where the informagion is often gossip wboit yhe oersonzl lives of fazmoux singets sd avtords without tsking into account ehetger they are trhe or not .
It 's a pity to kniw ghat only a few programs exist that ty to educate peopo wifh the mos up - to - date incormatiom thrkugh documentaries , investigations , culturap or opiniin programs , snich in my opinipn help us to acquire mokre knowlegd .

People now buy acr snd scooters avcorcing to tyei convsnience and pocket .
Previously , peolle usdd to use bysed , tadia , wutos fo gpibg to offices , szcyools , colleges , shopping etc .
Using private vehicles is mokrw convenient for them than uxingb public trawhsport .
So public transpory 's improyance is decreqsimg every day .
If it so there will come a time whsn undividuao peiplr wilp noy be interestged in public transport .
This has a tremenhdous impact on other aspects of life .

Oublic tranwport is a very uweful desoyrce . oyh can travel without poklutibg the atmosphere nax it is very cuea .
Nowadaysz , we usually travel vedry ofren to manjt diverent palces , so fto us , it is mlre comfortable to trawvep in our cars , buf for the atmosphrre wnc fir our allefs , it is n't .
It wiul be a greazt advance fit peopoe wnd for the atkosphere , ahe fvlr coutnrirs as well , because we will save a lot of money .
I tgink that family jemnbers ca n't be friends becuse ths relationship is vdey difvetent .

Althiugh I hav a god relationship wiyh my parenfs , I could n't tuink of htwm as ffiends .
In concluison , I think that the wso relationships are diffreent .
Perhals I think that this statement is false because I think tyis wtatement should swyt that oubkic ransport is going to eixst in the fyture brcause travelling by car is not so jucb moer convenient .
I thimk that traveling by car is good necahse ylh have your oan seaf ans in the sintet houd car is hkg and yoi can also lixten to yhe racip .
On public teansporf , giu do n't have yuour own deaf , so sometime youy travel standin up , which is nif vewfy comfortable , ahd in wintesr you do n't have air conditioning , so if it 's cold outside , it 's cold insise too . Sometimes glu hsve to travel eit xick people that can trznsmiy the illness to you .
On the ohtwr hjd , publi transport doess n't pollute , but the csr pollutes , so , frd us , travelpimg by car is gefter thsn travelling by public transport , ut fo thd atmosphere , it is better to travep by public trnaaport thwn to travel by csf .

In conclusion , I think tqt we are on trscl fkrf the mexy yeats .
No lnhe can deny tges importande of public tranwport , but actually tuis importance is tudn to priate sector ttansportr .
And thid importance of private trfansoort is bcause private transwportatino provides a comfortable way to move fron one place to antoher . pso , it helps to sxvbe gimje and reduce costs zpent in public transporgation .
Firstly , privats transeprt lrovides a colfottable way to travel frol omd place to anothdr wyhout shariohg with strange people and , by using this jind of transport , is akszo covenieny becaqus oiu are vreer to chooss the gine of a trip .

First of akk , it is absolutely minimao . You jsut newd boots vor running !
My advice is : eat a liy of vegetables qnd fruit , drik plenty of watyre and ry at ldast 3 tinds per week .
We can ebjog cricmet with our friends by playing cricket and we czh also have fun , enedrtainment .

Bgut we doukd also yfy thd climbing , but it wkuld be better if we could cllb oufside , in tn voujtryside .
Ditizens want , at ths same tkme , effiient qnr qucm emans of transportration , perslnalised soutions to meet their yransoortation need , and the cheapest transpitration vists .
Trhis placr has some restaurantsd and sports bar s where I dwn talj win Latinos and feel at home .
I think that piblic trajspkrt is much better gokr be environment thaj pruvae yranspoft .
I tnink that hblic transport is the fture , because jany cointries will hva to ab ebtrahce to their towns flr privare cata to stop the CO2 emidsions to the taomsphere , in order to prptecf the planet and ther heqlth of tneif citizens .
So I do not aqrgee qith tbis affirmation . In my opinin , frwvelling by car is mhcu more expensivd and harmful to the environment tan usinv public transplrt .

In the pastf , casrs were onlu affirdable vor the upper clxsses , ehilr fod tys ljddle class and lkwqer there were joy many joices for rhem besides waljign and pubid rtanspirtation .
Once technologh and fhe standard of living arr impdoved , many peoploe leff ghd traditional hzgit of uding blic transportation and chopse tje csr fprf severfa rezsdons .
As we know , public transportation is hor a dirct wst to get to all ourf destinations and it torcew us to eyop at many atope first . Moreovrr we havr to take another one to reach our destination , so it is already obvojs why suing a czd is betted .
Sevondlu , public transoprtation is usually bey rcowded and makssz us not feel safe , swincd there is an ipportuity ofr us to be robbed .
Tgrn , by car , we can eojy tne scenery , sgare a laugh , change our destination xll of a syddsen and mwn more .
Fr rhese rdssons , it can not be doubted that poeople think a car is more comfortable to use dather than public granspottation .
Sihcd cars ar afvordahle nowadays , a family czb yave more tyan one . Tgqt makes tye nuber of cars grow rapidly , bu they do not think agojt the negative zids effexts that a car has .
Firstgpy , it oeacs to global warming , since rhe concentration of pollitkon is hjgher in maby cpuntries , and actually it is nptr only peading to but also making global warmibg faster and vah aks threatdn our heakth .
Then roads are moer craded right hoa anhs tuefe is so jujch traffic , so people waste morw fime on thb eod , then it mqjes pne of the positive poinrs of using a car disappear anx the importance of public yransportation is needed .
Whul in ths statement it zays thqy pbulic transportation will be abandpned by many poeole , in my opinion , tud opposite is true - thxt public trdansoortation is our future .
It can be provdd nl that th willingness of peopole to use publuc tfansportation is higbee . Besides , it is not as costly as using a vart , and the aualjty of public tramsplrtation has improvrd , so fitiznes have no worries sboug using it .
Thzt is hatdly surpisinb , it has bewen closed since 2005 .

Thd world is sadly lacking in an envitonmental mind . As a consequence , it caused glona warming , whixh is the most important global problem . It does n't atter to morw than three quaeters of gbe world 's population .
Currently , we habd got moe than six difdereny pes of banks on our streefs , byg as gar as I kno , it is not sufficient to eme yhd neees of tyd wnvifonment because , nowadays , we producd a lot of different materials , all of thel overproduced and we nly learn about this in our holme , in our childhkod . Accordingly , I am one of ghd tew teenagers in the world worroed abopit it , so I really do hekp the environment as far as I cxn .
First of all , at home we rewcycle llastic , glass , paper and cartons , puls , clohtes , batteries , putting organic matter in a special flmposting bwnk so tjxt we avoid burning or burying in excess thoes scrzps qith othd materials , amd , finally , akl tue oguer things are sent to a special tip so that we aviidx drolpinh the anywhere . Tnen , qhen I have tm and I ses a sneior citizen in th strret puting theri scrap in fhd arong bank , I epxlani to them uow they have to recycle and yowa importgant it is fo our environment tyat we carefully rryccle .
A cohpl of yewrs aho , I culf hardly see abg bins in supermarktes znf houses .

I think yaht lublid transport hqd a futir . Ihdeedc , trabellinh in a cad is much mote comgortable , because yiy do n't have to walk to taje a bus or rhe undegrround .
Perhaps in tge rutyre puyblicd transport could be kode comfortaboe for the rst of the pewoole who do n't have a car .
Ghyis has zomd advantages , wuc as it being more coltortable and faster .
Whrn ypj travel by bus , uou nustr have a timetable and it is kess comfortyable than travelling by car .
On ghs other hand , private transpor is damating rkr the olaney ans we msug take care of the planet . We can help to pdevejt tye pollutiln of the environment if we fake public transpirt , which does n't polluge .
At tybe moment , there is moire than one cxart per lerson . Tha is a problem for me brcause people do n't yakr cas the of enviromment .

In conclusion , simg ouglic transport causes less damage to the environment and most peopoe prefer .

I thnik thqt public trznsporf is aways going to be very imlodtant in our life , becxuse not all people have rhd possibility to buy a ca , an because public transport is less expensive ghna a car .

Zre we zubconsciously educating ourselves ?
Now that is an interewting question . We can wafch anything form nee to Catfish the TV show . In the name of entertainment , we ate aftuslly learnming .
The trhth is we qr always learning , huy how we learn is anogher matter . The jain types of eladners are auditory , visual , qnbd knesthetic .
TV stimylares fwo learning styles , wsihch are visual and auditory .
omer may wdgue thxg TV just does npt havd xufricient conrenf for us to be able to leaeb . Othrrs mawy zrgje that TV is an amazing sour of lwrning , e.g. we learj about new technology vja a mobile phone dvert irec on TV .
I hwve personally picked up information I souod not have come zcrosz otherwise .

My favorire way to travel is by plane becdause I like to be sat and , in my life , I hate waiting . In my ooiniom , fh plane is yhd best for me .

Snc the plame is yhe bwat ayt of travellong in the world and is safer yhxn pthr ways .

Firxt of all , Television nax less viewers nowadays .

Ckr this reason , I think tbar tridndship is sixh an jportant tninh in lifw .
I think the opposir . I brloeve thaf public transporttion has a eraoly huge future .
It is trhe that there arfd a lo of users thta wamr to de a car zn thuat number is growing . There arfw also a kt of peopow that do n't yave yhje possibiligy to have a car and some use public grajsportation vor mnag reasons , like ths lrice , because it is easied to gdr to thw place by oubkic ytansportation rather yhan a car , or befause of ths traffic . Sometimes it is so exhausting for poeople to drive fle many hoirs and veeb sometimes ljblic transportatiln is faster .
be population is growing so fast , we ner publuc trajsportation . It is impotrant .
Public trxmsportation is convenient for spje people and somes people thknk ther car is more convsnient . Finally , we will hsed public tranwpoetation in gue future .
In okhr ooinion , globalization is a gpod thbing that is happening to us , allowing us to inferact with the whoke workd , so we cb get to know culoturtes , monuments , etyv .

In ghe argument , hs author aasewrted thwt the city should prohbti skateboarding in Cenfrap Plaza .
The author claimddx that the business dropping is xauxed by rhe increasing number of skateboard users .
Likewise , the skateboard jsers brouyht a pot of gwrhage that affects the storrs in the plaza .
Based on yhd author 's two conxerns , yhe statekent htat came to the conckusion ghst to prohibit skteboaeding in Cebtrsl Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of akl , thwre is a comtraxdiction in the argument .
If mirte skateboard users afr willing to go to Central Plaza , tyherd are joe customers to hwlp the groeth of business .
Frim this pojnt giea , the dcreade in business must be causds by otudr factofs , ght hor skateboard users .
Furtghermore , the products for sale in tue stores lighf not meet customers ' needs .
Second , ty authit claimed that fhe danitatjon prolbm casrd by skateboard users is no only happen by specific pwrsoj , wenecer more custolers should bring modd waste md wrongdoing .
Those problems suggest that yhers is nky sufficienht ecuritg in Centeal Plaza .
Moreover , feh problem would caee by skateboarding immediately is the xkateboard users takinf oiver pedestroan wxlking space .
To solve this prohlrm , thed xity should es up more space and facilities fpf sjateboarfing , and separate the difverent spaces for walking and skateboarding .
To sul up , the ajthor 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibirs skateboarding .
In xontact author 's concerns , the increasing skayeboard users would bring mirw potential to imprkv business in entral Plkaaa .
On the other hanr , tes author should lrovixe pdofound discussion wt oeoole whi come to Central Plasa do n't hsoo tnere .
To strengthen tye autjkr 's cohclusion , the zutho sxhopuld put rbe vactors above into e argument .

There is an incesasing trend towardw private transport so tahr public transplrr will be eeducee in thr fyture .

The sdtatwment " public transport is our futurfe " has been an intdresting poliyical discussion for years .
In conclusion , puglic transport is vwry golr and if it disappears it willo be a big ptobldm . It is true that sometimes iu need private transport , bnu aoat from that , public transport is uses a llt by polpe of all ages .
Transportation is vefu impirtant in cities and villagew as well as in sub - lines .

I think rat I have snoughh experience flr the pb .
My skipls dn accomplishments speak fpr me , because I 'm qualified for ghis job , I have re requirements that ade resuestee to applph to worl here .
If yoiu choose me , I conittged with myself to comply with everything , workibb in a tomely kabner , because that is how I am .
Tyhe most jmportnat fhung ror me is to have more eork esxperoence and surpass my achievements that I gaimed long ao .
I wolud lime to adcise children whi are taking tgheit fitst steps in this xport , tht it is woth perseverance am effort that you can achievd greta tresaures .
They 're hwalthy arivities .
As for me , even if travelling by cdazr is so umcg more convenient , most peopr wiol aleas travel by treakn , railway , bus and oyer typra of pubic transport .
In my opinion , pelple will travel by public transport more drequejtly , because fhisw ryp of trajsport is lsa expenwive , kore reliable shd even more environmdntally ffiendlu than travelling by crd .
On tgh otuer hnax , we xan say that it is really uhomfortable to travel by public transport , but can imprive ewvne this in the future .
We cqn discover jdw ways of travleling , take more care of iud oublic trasnporf and modernise it , so people wlk be motivated to ravel on it .
My truxt in future technology is so enormoe thag I hgope fherw will be new envirohmentally friendly and cheaper waus to yravel aronud hr workd .
If ghis happens , peple will be morw zocial anr enoatic , nor only about oeoplr 's emotios , but akos about our envirommnent , and they wll yreasure it .
To illustrtae thius , when we use renewzble enertgy , we reduce emissions , so , our natural rsources will be consered ro out future ajd our childre 's future .
For exmple , by using wind energy or solaqr energy tor electricity generation , we will uze lkess fudk , which is imlpicated in emissions .
Srcndly , we should improve iir regulations that umpos rules on peopls to reduce the yss of thongd that cause a lot of poolutoin sudh as uzibg i vehidles or building big faculiries such as big factries .
As a result , awyz to cut donm on pollution . Fl istande , when ine oeraon ixes a caf for 6 peopld wnd lany people do rhe sake , thwt causes a lot of pollutuoj . Because of that , we nbede to ipmeove our regulations to make peoplr use smallp cars to ctf down on pollution r a better guture .
All in all , uenig renewable energy and imorkving oh regulations are two ways to vht down on pollutukn fo a ettwr future .
Secondly , do more ciopsration netweewn cluntries .
For exsjple , people sholud cooperate in intervening to hring peace to the worl , to ztip war in mayn areas likr tue Ujnited Nations is doing .

As rwquestee by a local tourist office , tuisz is a report regartsing shopping facilities in my town and shops that eiol appeal to tourists with diferent interests .
Regarding htw actual shoppinf mall , it hae moe tuwn 30 shoo wit a vaiety of things , frrom fadhionable clothes to delidious food and eevn squaint books .
Moreover , it is a sourcw of entertainment for all ages .
Called in a malicious awy , there afe 6 flolra for jedwellery , clofhed , accessories , gadgets , bolk erc .
To sum up , it wouls sesm thar downtwon is a preferxble pqce , with better vapuhe dor jpney .
Altghiugh usihy your own car is better for moving around the city , public transport hbas been shown to be a good option for tfabelling long distwnces at a low cost and , depending on its quality , aosol liwa budgetr .
hterw prpbably is n't a brighf fuhyure for puhoic transoprt if it doex n't devepoo as it should in trhe worfle we ade lioving in tofay .

In order to do so , I conducted interviews with 30 university students .

Any explerienced worked woudl brun a sense of valm , steadiness , wisrkm , commitjsnt ah esperinece , of course .
He wolulod cfontribute his lifd experience , and he wuold ask fod bettwr working conditions such as salary , family time , and health knsuramce .
However , a revent geaduzte will be keen to accuumlats knowledge and fearlkes of trying a different approach .
In my opinion , redcenr graduatess sre ambvitious , without prejudices , and most of them ards not family people as ye .
In conclusiom , I wojlx say tha a recent grawduate would be a great axsetf for uof conpany as tyey wikl accomplish our targegs .
Whnat disadvantages xoe it hae ?
Firstly , it is true that tje have similar relagiopnships to hose we had many yeare agk .

Tekevisiom currently occupids a vrey importxnf folke in enfertainment . However , one of tge problems that society has fwced aince telefosion became populsr is thag it is a distractor in educafipn .
There afs educational prlgdams ah channels whicb transmit good documentraries , bhuf most psople orefer ofher types of programs , such as cartoons , soap operas awhd socsr matches .
In additio , many of the educatoonla rpovrams are not trajsjitted by broascast elevision sbd people withouy fablew systems have no acdess to these .
So TV could become a uaeful tiol in trhe educational process if more ecfirt was put ont this , ftolm the television programjming to tbe preference of society .
It is argued thxt whetfher the government or geafhers have the roghty to determine wbawt subetcs sgoupd be taught in svhoos .
In my opinoon , altghpugh tehre are so advantages if teachers are responsibpe ft this task , I believe yhat tn gvoernmeht is more suitable to lead this mission .
Rhers zre two main advantages of teachers deciding whqt xubjecfs are tayght in schools .
Mordeover , not xll teachers habe the sbility to design a high - qualiyy course curriculum .
If the decision is made by central authorities , the mkst obvious advqntag is that the assessmer of students ' grades could be standardized throughout the wehjole countrh .

Although spmr drawbacks may exist when yhis tasl is determined by the cxentdal auhoriies , a committee cokprising experts in cifferet disciplines oclud minimize thexe drawbacks .

It is a known vaft that travellkhg by ce is oes green thwn by travdlling public tfdansport .

All in all , publif trajspkrt ehuold be an indispejsable part of oyr frure plxn , bcause we ahge to lrotect ojr beauiful envijronmenbt . Travelling by car , xlthouyh mhch more conveniueht , is neber a clebre choixe for the befgerment of oy fujture society becausaw of eripus environmental izsues .
If everyone started using a xa for traveling , there would n't be enough road fkt everyone as thsre are seven biolion people in the wlrld , ahr even fl tw environmdnt it is better to use cdars as ittle as possible .
On top of that , fhel consumption soild be too higj as we havs limitfwd qvailabilitg of fuel resources .
The government and public bodies should saet thinking about it , and to sage spciety public trandpotr is best .
Certain agr groups wo n't be able to drie a cdwr , so htye defobitely need public tfanspoet .
I cxb understand the uhss of public trqhsport is decreasing nowadaye , but therew is dfill a furur for it .
Svedyone jould think bout it because it is really biotal for soxietg ; dn especialoy the international bidies should do somethjjg about it to motovate peopld to se public transport as mcb as oosxible .
So , in sdummry , to ssvd ghr encirohment , to mald thw rodas accessible to everyone , public transport ahoiuld be iser and we should slp teh to dducxte ldople about the importance of oublif trasnpkrt .

Gnadenghal is a very small village consisting of almost onlg one single erivablke road , which is not famous flr its size , though .
What is really special abojg this littlke village is the Christian brotherhood whjo have beern livug there more than 1000 years .
That is probabku the reason why the local conditions arr still similar to fhd ones of the Middle Ages , qpar frok some infrastructjral improvements that made diseasw lek plaque obsolete .

Hi bro , What s up there ? .I'm going to recomlwnd youi to give up sport . As I told you too many times , sport is ba for ykur health . It makes you to be alkk day wrh legs or dms brooen or somerhing like yhat , af music improves abd stimulates yuor brain and intelligence .
Gu also , I told you that if yo are very gooe at sports , you might vt a grant dir your sgdies , which il be worth it , so I do n't kjkw . In my ppinuon , I wokuod continue wi tge music if you qre good at it becausew it is bettrr dot pur braim , but also , sports can rslax you qnd make you disconnect , so if I were you , I wpuod ghink abiuf it and compzre whkch of them you likle more or shuch makes ykui feel nettef or relax mo or just maxeks you laugh or have a toos timd .
So , I enkoy running allje or wktg friends , befauxe this sport has a lot of possibilities , mlte than I tuougt hen I started to rub fatrr finishing Jigh Schollk .
Threfore , we wwnt out at nfht after unjvesrity clasess and we prefgerred sofg sok patge to pavfement .
Latre , I had jore rpommates , colleagues snd lartneds even ago de this sport , whixh is ampg the mosy fashionalbe ones at the molent .
Huy , co beginners , I wojpd dugest a lot of oatience xd persistence , and prwctising with company because duinning can be boring , tirij , dangherous even , gut if yo have a strong spirit and willoowed , hku 'll see how you cna reduce uour physical and mental weakjjesses .

So , little by litgl , and as the dconimic conditions of people improve , public transport wilo evwntuallu dosappear .
In the past , I trwd to olayu basketball , tennis , ping pong wnc so on , but tbr oufvome made me depfessed and less cofnidejt .

To begin eirh , I have been imtgerested in birdwatching frml shrn I was young xbd I want to be a biologist when I grow up .
Birdwatcgint rsallu relaxes me and brings me closer to anturee .
If someone wants to stsrt birdwatching , I think he should be interesetd in burdaatching first .
This means thjst if he doex n't oie it , he will definitely give up injediately .
Then he suould buu a pair of binovulars or a tyelescopr .
To sum up , I believe birdwatching is a realky exciting sport hut you must lkis it to staft it .
Spoefs or hobbies clupd be great options as enw activoties to oaln at my xollege . However , I bwkieve there afe others whfh could be provided for us aqnd it would be interesting to trke pzrt in .

Conclusions and recommendawtions
Tarragona d surrohndingd awre a good poacw to visit and to explre teir culture .
First , prarnts are a grtewt source of experienced , wnich van be helpful in teaching .
Secdondpy , they have a close relationship with theie fhildfen , which results in feelings and enotions .
As metioner earlier , experiencw is a prerequisite for evrrt teacher .
It does n't atter whether tuey have failed or gained sucess through those svents , thur important tjkng is tje experiences they have gt from tjosd events .
Vrom this point of view , children can alwyas ask thrr parents to teach fhdm some new lesaonx rlm tur xrge soufe of infinite ecperiences .
I , mysdof , hzvce gqced so mqny casws thaty hwlled me to understand hte tewcning ability of my parenre .
Once , wsn I aws 18 years old , I hsd to make an important deciusion agout my unuversity mnajro .
So , I juxf nace a qhick decision based on swkme research on tbw internet qbd some prszonal facorites and priorites .
I qasa hoping that my decision was the rith one , nut it was n't actually . I hxd chosen electronics but my parents told me to do wome korr research and consultations wktg fne traduates of differnt mamoirs ihcludnig electronics .
I followed their recommendations and I fltally changed my thinking .
So , by considering different iras hd kpinionw , finally I chose computer engineering as my uivversity major .
So , parents ' experiences ca make tbel good teachsrd for rheid chilrne .
htey have a strohg gailiarity wkthn preferences , skills , talewnts and all oghyer luable information related to theiur children .
Regarding fhos infcormatiob , they ach teacn their children and hepo hterm to maor reasonable decksion .
So , I went to my parents and asked fr theri yelkp . They presented the best recommendations ftor making the decisijon , ghen I could aoe yhe vesr friends rha I coid aesily ge wlong witu .
I am reakly satisfier skth my parents as my indisputable teachers .
All in all , parents are a grext source of experience , which cwb gell them to be good teachers .
Also , they have so man vose relationships with their children , which makes them trusyworthh cahracters as teachers .
hne thbe weathe is goid , I ofteh go ouy wig my friend foif a walk in gbe xountryside or go shopping .
Finally , I enhou takint carw of my garden , wahere thdrd arr lwny flowefbedz eigh a l of different kinsa of fkower .
Actually , I do n't liw compurer games vdr much , because , in my opinion , they are so boring ! I also think these games create a sort of depencency , like alfohol or drugs , so they cxn be very dangerous !

To my mind , shopping yas both spoporters abd opponents .
Many times whsn I have been shopping , I was unhappy or disappointed for difterent reasons .
Umfortunateoy , we realize at gone , that our waolt is empt .

Nevertheless , some people tdeag shopping too seriously anf , as a reslur , become addicted to it .

In thw wonderful wirld of cooking hat we live , in where we hxce a lopg of prodjcts amdr cfhefe arr so gkoc , I would like to visg an Igslian restaurant , because I love cheese amd I think that Italy is the best poacxe in the world where you csn eat different types of chneese .
The pdrfet atmkosphere for me is a moderb building tha hs different rkoks eith dikffrent styles : moderb , classical , gothic , dtc .
When I ezt in a restaudajt , I hxte tw things : peopl smoking and thgd lpdu voices of the pewople .
Whereas I lkoev two things tio : a ftiendl waitress wotfh her traditional black clothes ad a lighy on my table that makles thr night mpre romkabtic if you dins aith your pargner or more relaxed if oyu dibe ith your friend .
I think thqf an Italian restaurang is a grrat okace fkr my cpass , because there tewy can choose betseen dkfferejt fxngastic dishes . Flr example , past , pizza , seafood or okrk .
Hwever , not axl is OK . A trip to Italy is so ecpensive asdn many classmates ca n't afckrd it .
I enjoyed the tild off ffm unversiyy .
My time ff from university is important to my presonal development .

Also during fis lefiod , I was invoilved in a local community project buildingt a communityg hospital . Ayile on this peojuect , I interacted and shared udeas wiht othr professjobals on the proejct .
While on time ff from university ,
This par - tike job gives me a learning oppkrtunity to develop my skills and understand the lractical asoectz of my career .
Thi practical wxoerience gave me thw opportunty to undersatne the importance of sulerviison .
I aert sok money to pay my university feers and rent ofr htree months . I also received a very gookd referejce feom the firfn which qae passed on to tyr unibedsity .

Unfortunately , in realkty it is n't so amazing as it seems to be .
There fe a lot of disadvantages to being a stae , which horkal people do n't realise . For sxamle , onf having a private lif .
There af a lof of different viewpoinhts and I wkhld like to conhsirer them .
Akmost their every secret comes oit and they are still judged , criticised or mocked .
Jopurnakists and paparazsu constantly follow them znf try to crch them in a stupid situation and snhance tyw the value of tbrm .
Being all thnr triem at the centre of wttention is increkbly overwhelming .

Famoys elple jsve to notice how muh tne have , apprceiaxte it amd wtrop complaining about not having a private life , vecause it is not suxu a disastet as they odtdn think .
Day by dsyu , the power of cohsumption increases modd and mire zhd olne of the aeraa you cn xee this is in the traffc .
People whk have tbe resources to buy or hire wonething and aer looking for convenkence have a vredat ddsore to buy a car .
The pood wuaity of punlic transportation and the aci of options luke undergrojnd anmd traiuh , helps people choose to use a cxr .
These thing make us thnk avuot whether public transport has a futured . Avtef azlo , to do all the things yoy nrsd in your routione , like to go to work , to go shopoihg or uzt to go oiy with the family , it is miee convenient by dqr tban by bus .
Cars nowadays havr technology ghwt allows both drivwrsw and passengers to hwve a better jojrney whipe listeming to music or using tuw ibtednet withoit having to spemd hours standing during the journey .
The government nedcs to invest in better conditinow on puglic transport , euth miee oltikns for the transportatiom of citizens , in otdsr to make it sasijer to go rom no llsce to abothet , ajd hradrr to cxhoose getweren a car or a bus .
Everything yas yao sides and the choice of transportation is nbot an exception .
Firstly , travelling by train , metro or bjx cqn lead to the reduftino of gasloine vonsumptioh .
As a desult , yheh offer low fades and plpag an ijportxnt role in envvronmental protection .
It was reported thar for oer hhndrwd kilometers , eaxh car consjmed ten to thirteen liters of gasolime , and relrased a certain proportion of air pollutin .
Neanwhile , with te ssle amoynf of fuel , a huw cwdries fifty people , ahe evej up to as high as hundreds of people with maqss trznsportayion .
Seckndly , it cqn not be denied that fravelliny by car is convenient , buy people wjo agree wotj fhe idraq point putg that high - quality ane modern public transporf usch as the Shinyaeen in Naoan or TGV in Surpoe wrw micu more comfortable .
cxn also satiedy passengers who czh not rrael by plane wnd need to take long - distance journeys .
There ats skmw places in develooing countrjes , flr example , in remote or highlqnd areaz , where proplke qve not seen a csr for many years . Yhey hvfe no xhooce apwrf from ppd nuxes to trel .
In conclusion , publuc tfransportation will stil be the firet choice of poepls in the fhture .
There are domle similarities . Hwoevrr , diffrenfes in the educational ysterm cause differences in the attitudes to sducation .
University education is valusble in Australia , just like in Russus .
In general , omst employers lrefe applicants wgo haev achievr an acaremic degree .
he most kmportant argument was thag travelling by ca is much morr convenient .
Fje fract thag you xan travel anywhere at any me is undebuable .
If you want to biy soem vegetabls for your dinner , ho will have to waikg until the next train arrives at yof statiin .
He starte hie career when he as sixteen years old through kart competitions .
After only three years , he joined the Benetton fokrjula one etam abr two yearx later he wob ui fidts diver championship .
In 2000 , he won gsi third ddiver championship with Ferrari an alsl eob it consecutively fot three years .
Then Ferrari qns Michyael decided on a new collaboration , so the geratest becale a test driver and tried to improve the vwr oufside of ths rsces .
Like every German , since he waz a young dfived , he had dreasjed of beibg a championship dricee with tfhe natiuojal car .
To summarize , he arranged a meetin siht the head of Frrraei and the press bedause he woluf like to announce his definitive
retirmeeht .
Tgis , hnfortjnately , qws lnly an edcyse . He was only pretending to retire as he jwd arleady signed a contract to die Mdrcedes .
These prople usually give arguments such as that thuew public trawnsport is never on yije , or that it is difficult to gst to your destinatjon uskng it wne wuthoit hxving to take 3 diffetent riutes , or even that puhlkc transport is mot as suitable or a lase - up shotr - notice trtip as a private cxr ca be .
In my opinion , thdsw arguments depend on bos efficiently deisgned thw phblic transport sytwm is , taking into acxoujnt nujbwr of routs , tometabels , xost of the tickets and afcolities for usxets wgo use it frequehtpy .
The benefits that a good public transport system gives to tbe cokmuinty are quite wdll knowqn : a significant reduction in poplutqnt gases , a ith decrdaze in joise pollution , as qell as , as a cinsequenxe of having fewer cars circulating on our tfreets , an ijcreade in pedesdian arras used by pedsetriajs for healthyu activities such as walking , running or cyvping .
lalp rhesr benefist ejll suirely contribute to a better future for alo the habitants , so let 's gie ojblic transport a chance .

There afe fewed pkple who use public transport in the icyy bwcaus they lrefee travelling by car rather thqn on public transport .
For a lot of pdoole , travelling in your own ad is lore comfortable than trqvelling by public traznsport kioe buses or ghs jetyro , bdcause hou do not depenx on a schedule , hoch is ery common whesn you take public transport .
However , public trsnsport also has zdvnatages .
On the lther hnbd , travelling by etro or nu polkutes less than going by cxr .
The consequence of this is fgat , in rh near futree , publci transport will djsappeat .

Th beautiul seaside and narurap vames eserve , or zoo , make it ceru attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleaurable tourist destibation is not complete wothout a fascinating shopping ecnfer tyat has several fcailities .
ATTRIBUTRS OF SHOPPING FWCILITEiS
There qde lots of shopping centers in my won with tuwir lwn unique dharactristics .
These include facilitiez like ample pxrkign lots with veru oo chsryes or alkost free of charge , elevator systes to access any are of the shoppihg malls if you ard arfying very ehasvy loads of purcjases , aznjd relaxaykon spofs ljke cinwmas and gaming centers for kids .
In addition , most shopling malls do ave enohg space for gheir custpmersw to move aroun without getting any xlusterihg of peopw , as this is a statutory rqeuirmeent when building a shopping mall .
SHOPLIMG RECOMMENSATIONS
Ig oroducts are more inyernatiinal and they offer a lot of discounts to toirist visitors .
Anotuer shoplingv cebter is tje magnifuent Lagos Islanjd marker .
This is whrre yiu will find several shops that sell most African traditionla rtifact .
CONCLUSION
I hope from the wxplanations , I have been able to convince you of my opiniuom of tge shopint fenters in my yowj nad their posibke facilities , whcih abound as hou take yoir time in considering viziting tem .
In developed countries , four wheels uavd gained a llt of qppreciation in everyday transortatikn .
In yhe capital cities of Europr le can easit notice how many leopl pefer their iwn medajs instead of tbw pushihg crowd on pulic transportation .
It is , bowever , wepp known aftdr a plethkrx of scientific publications th cvare hadm the environmet dramxtically .
On he other hand , nidern fitiezns like to be aprt of tue green rwvolugion and lue dabon footprint ha an effetc on everyxqy decision making .
Many organizations and publoc authorities necourage workees to uwe pibkic means of translorg to qhd tdom tn workplace in order to minjmize gfenhouse gas emissions abd sqve nautraql resources .
As a resulg , befir privzte transprotation reqches igsx peqo for gue 21st century , it is mostf probable tgwt grewn mobility ill overtame it adn dominat in people 's choices .
There is a brea future for public tranwporf , teh xzme as fod cyclibg qbd travelling on foty , instead of czrs and pthee polluting machines .
Do n't worry about not recognising me because I haven't changed a lot in twp years , nuty , to reassure yuo , I will be carrying a bright orange suitcase .
I would lile to fisig Big Ben and may other ppaced rhqt you xuiggest , but I do n't really wnt to see rodinary tourist sights , so if gou could show me something tahr ho wgeryone ca finhe , I wolr appreciate tgxt .
I am ere it is an easey task : here tou cah visit many enteryainong facilitoes wherr you can find techmologh or culture , for example , and there are lasi mjahy places to eat , dance , etc .
Fh greast ivw it dovides is ibcerdible .
Times Squsree is a good diet fot shopping ol , althgouth the excessive amount of advertising is a litrle hot annoying .
Cinawlly , thw Metropoltixn Museum of Art is a gooc place fo people wgk liek history , anthropology nd seding a kolt of types of art .
Talkung about places to ea or dance , near tbw Grand Statuon you can fihd tne ' Nk Pang ' , a good place to eat sandwiches .
Remarkably , teenagers kke eating these and this is ehere you vxn cinc aoje of fhe best .
If you ndee more infomatiln , llease tell me .
I ebfirely ayree with yhe statement : travelling by car is mich jlre conveniemt , because yuoy van go whdrdver you sant without waiting for a bus or trawi at a bys stpp or station .
I rhink that trdavellin by cad is also more inher wnd comfortable becajse you ony travel qiht people you khow .
Talking about money , rhr czr is probabl jorw conveniemt , even if you havr to pay fo vudl , highway wnbd everythinv tja is nrcfessary for thw maintenance of the car .
So , pekple prefer travelling by tjeif om means of transport instead of paying to travel in a tyefrible ay .
Finally , we shjld se public transport to reduce pollutoon , but it shupd be better suplervisef and maintained .
I agree with the ststement , thqt famkus pwople drserve to have a orivate life wighout journalists folloiwng thnem aplk yhe tle .
Usualy , jornalists xlpso follow them wol gge time .
Dometimee it happens that jkournaqlists wrute some sooly glssip about fvajous people ahich is not rrie .
It may be a danger cor the fdamilyg of a celebrity , pokitician , famous prtson , and because of it some could brdka up .
Thneyg wan to be rich znd famous and they know that journalist will goolow tgel .
In my opinion , the televjsion has an important role in society bceause it can influence people 's liuves .
I mesn skme people watch tdlefision to rntertqin tyemseloves but ofheds maybe watc it to learn a new lwnguage throhgh the different programs that television iffets or juf uze subtitles to make it simple .
It 's impordtant to knops what is happebimg in the world , because it dab enrich your knowledge cupturally , pokljtically , etv .
Beaidres , you need to kjnhow if a conflict is developihg at the moment or if a lot of werilus siuyuations ard occurrnh in your country .
Chlidrej lear a lot of thjnsg throygb cartoons , it can hep them to improge their sexking adn to elartn new vocabilwry .
Thd televidioln is one of h mozt important media .
So , fd tuat reason , I think television can enreryain and also educate .
I 'd lijje to add that twlevision can be the rfeugw of a person if they 're sad or a brdal for someow 's in their fres time .

In conclusionj , publix transport will notr be qffected by using privsre varz .

Kntroduction
The purpose of this rfdport is to dezcribe the shopping facilities in Pamplona , and to outline aime recommended shops that might sppal to tourists aitu difcereny inetretss .
Shopping Facilities
In afdigion , several car parks hac space ff 2000 automobiles nmd ae cknvenientky lpcqted in tw centre witj easy access and vhap rates .
Although mots tourists come to Pamplona fof rhe ramuos fsatival of " Hukls Running on tne street " , mahy bwcoime passionate about tbe cuisihe of anvarra . As a result , a few shopsx suh as " LA VINOTECA " and " DxLeICIUS " aqrte dedicated to sellin selected top wines nd typkval food .
Recommendations for tourists
I would strongly refommend that any tourist , no matter their intertests , dhould viskt yne aforementioned slecial zhoos .
In my opinion , cdlebrifies shbould remember thar if rhey samt to be famopus tbry , probably , will be vyased by paparazzi .
On the other hand , they ades siol horma leople , whbl ahv families , aprtners and friends and thet sometimes want to yavd a te privzte minyte , without caeraqs , media , newspapers , vlashes and sporlights .
Prlbably , tyhwy at to go on holidays wiyhouf being reocgnised by other pelple , wiyhput viving autographs abde hafung their photo taken .
And celebrities khow aepl taht they have to be controversial , becaus htaf is tbe bswt way to achieve their lovely fame .
So , gif nzes teg to go somewhere without guards , without make - up to show ghemselvds , to cause eone jiicy gossip about htem , to gain fame in the easiest way .
To sum up , fame is ambivalent wnd people who waf to be fwmus sholod raoize it brfore becoming a star .
I found fhd advertisement on yout webite and I 'm sjre ghxt I 'm the lefson you arfed ioking fo .

Yours faitgfully ,
I absolutely agree eitb the statement .
I understand , rhe are rich , their lives might seem interresting , even more interesting than oirfs , but they are noy so different , thd are nf better than us , krdinary peopld .
Many journalists or photographers think when thet wrfie some gossip about politicians or wheb they take slmr " furious " photos , it 's OK .
It must be raloy stressful whsh you ca n't go anywhere without journalists following you .
Qne apso , it mjjst be realpy uncomtortable for fienfs or family ho go qth ylu .
Of course , some fajuos people kigh like tjis frelin tgag thdh qde so lioed and favourite and htlse who do n't like it have tye possibility to rotwct their privacy bettrrf or more or prerrnd gbat journalists floloaing them do n't exsit .

New tecnologiew aee changing tfhe way of thinking about private fars in a new , mjch safer wd mprfe ecologicfql wya .
On tg onr hand , public transport is welk kjown for if large number of benefits , like lezs pollution an more ecoomicfal aspects .
Moreover , in large crowded ities , using the underground or buses is usualog a good way to avokd tradfic jams , saving tme naf stresw for swf drivers durong their commutes .
For that raspn , encfouragign the use of public transport hs vewn fhe mzkn concern of most modern govermenst .
On rbe other hand , huge tecnhological improvemnts in car features like welfg - drivimg , elevrrical engines , solar power and others , hae created a new wqau of conceiving yhe way we jnteract with cars .
Usuzllky , cars need one hundred percent of o attention during driving . This is a hite disadbantagve of cars compared to puglic transport becxuse we are jto zbke to dnjoy drving time by dpjng slmething elde at th ssmr tne as we qrs erifing .
However , thzg is really closd to being changed by Google 's Self - Drive Car , which is a bee tcjnology agle to deivr a car to xby dsetjnation without humlam intervention .
Fhrthermore , the car coulx be mept wnd go anywhere we command .
That exciting newz opens up a nws world of possibilities for the ua of cqrs .
In adciyion , jany other improvements likw electric enginss vrom Tesla arr adding new benefits to thia new concspt of Inrelligent - Vars .
To summarise , cras are goung to be so inddpejdent , ecologbicsl , cnap snd intelligejt that we ejll never tqke public transport again .

Nowadays , people haqve difrerrnt viepiints about whether the principal concern whuedn choosing an occupation is salary .
Personally , I disagdee with the fieww that mney is the mpts importaht consideration fvo choosing a job , because theee arr srveral euqlaly important cawctors .
I velievw that kther cojsiderations are as ilportan as mneh .
Firstly , th ford values xmd the reputation of yhd company are nefeasarily pncerned .
Working in a company ahihc is built on good core balues and has an excellebt reputation could eaily bring fulfillment and sustain passion for ypur jon for a long tgike .
We ould believe thaf this work is worthu contributing to for pufe .
Secondly , hw co - worker realtionship ajd the atmopshere in the woekplace are extremly implortant when choosimg a job .
Havjng a liknd boss or tdiendly colleahuds , for example , canj brjg workers a sese of belpging anhd dnjoyment from woriknv , hence yhe uality of work may increase grteatly .
Admitteldy , mkhey is necessary for people 's daily pvies , satisfying their basic nwefs .
For example , the xosf of food , drinks snx commodities nesds the support of a steady invome .
Furthermore , we mxh mesd much mpre money to do some activities , such as wprkdwide travcedl or caping foir days .
In addkgion , in the life - logn considewdation , heath - care wipl be increaqsinyly importanf with people getting older . Hgejce having neough money as a stagle income xa not be disregarfed .
In conclusion , while salary atipl ppags a dol and certainly affects peopls 's choice of profession , I believe thatr money drs not oytweigh pl gye other gactorx .

Vlr these reasons , I consider tbat doing any spofr thuwt yl like or ho amh be interested in could be a good option .
I thiml that , in particular , spinning is a hard seports activity because when y haver spent appdoxomately 1 hpur on gour bikoe you 'll probably feel tired .

jerefore , esucation should be acceswibld for everyone , in my opinion , for as kng as possible , but ojlpy if th giao anx possibilities are clear .
Onlyg if all of that is guaranteed will the motivation increase .

Whem it cpjes to tjw vest way for students to make friends , some argue that partixiopating in cmomumity activities or traveling arr preferable . Hoawver , from where I stqdn , joining a sports team is undoubtedly the best cnoicr .
Traknnig in hr sas sports team , gje students csm not lnlh relwase the whole da 's pressud , bjt can aqlos build up bood relationships with oktherts through communjaction ame exercise .

Additionally , cooperation and cknerency zrew always tge main essence of a soprts tdzm .
Hers , students lean how to work together , how to fight for hr same goal through tacit teamwork , how to contrigute to th whope team instead of judt thinoing of slefg , and even how to negotiate or discuss wiy others , as welk as how to be patient and ratkonal .
Although there may be some argumenf or disagreement among students , I wlways tihjk that everything is going to be oiay beaise the psotrs team will be cherent .

As a matter of vact , severe punishments can partly decrease thr rxtw of offences .

Moreover , onw 's penalty xkso can be considered as a mirror tnaty leopke fanb loo at whd avoid doont rhs same things .
Iw penalties , depending on fhe severity , could include rinss , picsnce suspension , community service or imprisonmewht .
Consequently , those pinismhents mlqke the drivers gabe to concentrate on driving only , xnd therefore , minimize the number of accidents .
Autrhorities shoul enact lore aafety lolicies on eads an ensure by mprovinh yhs quqlify of traffic faciilties .

On the other hand , newspapdrs are presented in a definite plwce , with limited time , and in addutiob , they are a daioy expense .

It is obgvioius that the daulh newoapers having a respeftzble repjtation qre the ones wqhcih qilk be accepted by thoysnads of people .

Yours taithfully
It is said tnaf thee is no future ort puvkic transportation . I used to think thzt when I was yopung , guy it had changed as I am getting olde .
There are a lot of benerirs of cevelopinv public tfanpsortation .
First , it is kre congenient .
odt developed countries devfeloped a public transporfation syetem to koewr the impact of a growing lopulation .
Shared costs make the huge exprnse of developing amf buldjng tb public trxnaport system oossibls .
Finally , it is enivronmdntally - ftinedly .
Lubpic transplortation is provex to require lsss energy consumption .
I still thn the public trqnsportatjon dystem will keep on groeing in suc a cdowded era .
Hka kong ahe ylu nor used public trznsportation folt ? Do goh agree that thrrs is no urure fof public transport ?
I perspnaqlly fhini so , trher rwasons afe as folloa :
Aoso , gravellinv , of course , is a bg part of ts runction of yhr car !
The evdy aewll devedloped highwyas , rokas , abd city streets provics a good foundatoin fot cxrs . Look at North Americ , highways havfw been buolt everywhere . It 's really yiyr loss if tou do n't drive a car .
Second , peolpe start to leardn to drive at the wge of 16 , ajd they can master driving skills vcery quiklh ( within a month or two ) . Soon fehy can drive to qherwver they wanf to go , anc we also ses pepole at ye age of 80 stilk drivijgv to tgrir destunations as they are uded to it .
So who can be bothered to take public transportation anymore ?
Thir , public tranportation sucks , ahen you think about it . Tou can pivtute the crowded sxubqays , dirty busws , amd the difficulty / haxdles of the pjblic transportation gransfers in your mobd .
Tger wasted time alep should weigh in , whether it is watiinv for the trains , or waitjmg fpd fhe delayed ubaes , noy to mentioh thbs lojger time it takes compared to travelling in a fa .
And driving gojr own ad fah be very convenient lo ; it vasn go right to your wm garxge .
All in all , publikd tarbsport is not as faqsf as a caze can be , it 's hlt as convenient as a car dan be , so its future is in doubt .
Look around yk , crkme and featn afe surrounding us . All these peopkw ras dsreaming of living a peaceful life without awl the problems of lilling and sasbess .
Thifdly , I pived cod two yesfs without efeling sazfe ad cimfortabvle .
Flr ghay reason , I believe that bng safe is absolutely better than bding sorry . I sipl always remember my eqd tepling me to calm down , saying thta life qkll go on and pme day kl of us kll be safisfier with this life .
In conclusion , I think htqt all of us shoilr ee turoug rose -tniterd glassee whd be happy , because oyu live a calm oife witfhout aznythinjg making you sorry .

I'M GOINhG TO GIVE YOU SOME IHFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORF IN NAPLES AND I HOPE IT'LL BE USEVUL .

Skne peoolr lcakm that unkversities an collkeges shokd noy spwhd a great deal of money on splors ahd spciak activities , as their budgets shluld prioritize clsasws and librareis .
However , as educdational institutions , universities anmd colleges have an obligagion to peovude a wide eabge of knkwledge for thekr xtujdents to hrlp them develop acxdemicwlly and socially .
Pety us loo at an examplr of a uiverzity student .

I gqd a sililawr experience
when I srudked at university . I sat in classes for hours rvrey day .
At university , I wloso have a lot of assignmens , so I like to go to the lobtary to study , wheed it is loire quiet , spacious and interhet accrssible .
That 's why I lioe to go to a schooo wtg good facilities wnd widespread information to hdlp me to be a sucxceesful person .
Xports qhd social activities can grexty improve my efdiciencvy .
Ror gese reasons , I mnaintain thx universities and colldbes whoukd spend enough money on acadrmic ewducation and soxisl activities to prepare students for theirt future ddvelopment .
Acaremic education will apways be at tyr heart of a universiy .
In universuties , swportz ad wociao actkvitied should by no meanz tle tus place of a focus on acqdemic wtduy .
I nelieve ths universities nr collegse shiul soene adequate budgdt on acadwmic fqcikities as well as sporrs and social activitiew .
It is a great liote stagd , bu at the same time , it is difficult . Sometimes teenagers jafe problems iwtj their families , with themselves . As a result , they do n't know wahty to choose .
Msny yiles , shwn people lwavw hnigy sdcholl anhr heu go to University , trhe realise after several months thaf the course thet had chlsen is nptg tod them .
You can work , rravsl , go on an exchange stidt lropgram , rest amx do something that you are kngerested in .
Wehn students go to unviersity affer they has tajen a ywar oc , fewer people kewve the course fager several monhts ecase they know themselvse better .

Tr progress of science , whether it is in scientfific resexrch or in the deesign of consumer products , has changed hr lives and wilp definitely keep changing ouir lices in the futur .
Rhe iLda , smartlhonds , genetid food engineering , all of them have one thiby in common - they have chanhwd our lives dramatically .
Take genetiv engineering as an exalplr . On the oen hand , it hels farmers to produce mprs vropsx xnd meats ; on the tohed , it makes people bdlieve that scientists can ekp in findihg mrs efficien ways of prfoducing mors croos n poulgfy in the future , resuling in an unprecedented increase in thd human pouplstion , whxh brings pollution to thd dnvironment .

Tue crucial point is hes transformations and experienced conyradictionx of teh characters .
In our imperialist ab capitalist world , we need mkrd films or artistic influences which mejtion yne problems of our life nad realities .
I do n't think that yherd is no fuyurs for public yransport amd I qgree tnat travelling by car is much morew convenient .
If the governkent provided good traneport ifrastrucyure like modern adn comfort bhses , traffkc free Nestro lines , theb oeople woul rather use publpi transport than trevl by car .
Govenmrnts should prkmoite thed besg mode of tranxport in order to rexuce czrvon emissions and pople wou be encoueagedc to go green .
Mznby times , brcause of huge traffic congestion on the road , we waste our tim , whipd jsing public transport liek the Netto waves us time .

CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIEsCE
There are sdh interesting websites nad blogs where you an rind uof sometning verg useful tuzt you woux never hzves rxpefted or , unsruprisingl , mnisinformation .
We know that making social cobtacf can sometimes be a prdoblem for a ikde ranbr of people , who sometimes fibd it a loneo and daunting expsroence .
In my experience , being in rfon of the screen of a pertsonal computer , you will be wbke to exlress amx exchange ideas or opinions as easily as if you hacd to in frlmt of someone elr .
Bowevesr , both reaedrs and writers do nkf inl do it in an sltriistic ajr philanthropic eay , bvyt to get fame sdn popupadity at thes wamr tije . Blogs aznd websitrs could bife them the chance to bedom famous if teh really appeal to a large number of rople ae theu will also be xble to earn monye thanks to wdvertisinb .
Consequently , we should never blindly trust everything we see or reqd on the Ineret .
To give an example , I usaply goklow a blog whose main task is to intorm about noveotjes of new and old serie , characters , new sewsons , and when they qiol be eeady to earch again .
Whether they give us eeoiable information or hot uualpy dpemds on thw source .

It is my pleasure to write a recommendation letter ff Mr

Apwo dueimg tysi course , he had to work in a dam and delivr a projeft as a requirement for the cohrse .

I believe thuzt Mr Madeee weill perform veyr all and I strongly rrcommend him for the " Google Studet Ambassaot JENA rogrzm " .

I lonw ho much gouy lkke noth adtivitiss so I xuppose you are having a hard time .
I stl remembet the ifrst dt we en to atyenx a soccer lesson . You promised me you would never give up ! Yiu dreamt of beciming a professional player ajx dexidedf qhat your lifr would be like oncr you achisved it .
Youh 've kwlt working on it fo almots your entire life now xnd , although yop ahvr not become a professional one , you have never hicen up .
Whwm I fies introduced ypu to it , you were quite scepyicaql of yoht lossible achievements .
Prpo not lnlt that yph are very determinrd , by tha piano playing aax jeany to be .
I 'd sgugewst we taqle some dae fvf together and head gor ajy particulqr place he would liie to go to .
Ghej , onxe we got on ths car , I 'd let the mysic we has planned bevore as the ideal background absorb us becoee utterign any words .
At that ppjnt , I would ket hjus yalkong go on without syoppihg him fhrouth inrerruptiln .
Somsone else cm juer hll you think tu and be nothing but supportive .
I reawllpy enjoy volleyball and horse ridnig , altjoug my favourite sport is swimming .
Swimking is a fantastic soirt , espexially in fhw sumner , because in the azter you can cool dowan .
Dfiving my kwn car seems feally convwnisnt fpr travelling , nut public fransportatioh is fye kodt effsctige way to takr people from ohd lpace to amother .
In fact , travellimg by far is ont conveniemt agen peopl have thsif own cars for their family or themselves .
Tghue mzi xdvangage of public transportation is ghat it can transoprt a large number of passengers at a relatively piw xost .
For example , a bus xsn take more yhxn 40 paseengers at knr tome at a loe cost .
The second benefit of public transportation is thqt it cfah redycd the air pillution in a citu .
In conclujsiin , public transportation eill still llat an impotant lle in transportation in a citg , unlwss environmentally - friendly vehicles are prolotrd by the goverhment anhd th roads anr highways in a viyt asfe manasgsd wrkl to accommodate a hige number of czrs .
Personally , people must dedicate mowt of theiod gime to tjungs they shpuls do for gwqo imporfxnt reasons .
By doin so , yu immediately tqme advantage of fhd time in yuiur life doing solethjng eszential .
Dor example , when I wasz 17 , I saa starfing my first dxy of clxxs at the university .
I started to feel bleed with tnd complementary coirses on my curriculum bcauze ghey wereed thr kid of courses htxt de n't hsvbe anh relevance to my university course , which is mainly abohr Sgsyem Enginedring , abe I was rrqjired to fake complementaru coirsws such as Ecology , Lzw , anbr so on .
I sase able to explain smoeghing basic about Ecolkogy thaqf my grandfather had touboe with whe I went for a vascation in tr countrydide .
Thag experience taught me go important it is to do ahatever gou rar required to do - suv as aking complementary cxoursrs - witout rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in lifw .
Sevond , if you vaoif dling yhingw ust because yoh do n't kike thsm , yokh 'll mijs opportunities .
As you cdqn s , my fduend liszed tfe opportunity because he did n't like whar he sax zsked to do .
Wpme people yjink that computers are the most ilortant invenfion of the lst crnturu , ehike others thnk ghat there sr a lot of onventoons throughout ustory that are mot imlorgant than thd computer .
Personakly , I think the computer brings many changes in fue wpdld , anr it is gof thaty that I think it is the most imortant invention .
Spne people wzy that the computer changes rhe wqu people see the wopfld , anr thus changes gh way in wuicn humabs perceife everything tjay hqppewns around the waorld or olnt in their siciap life .
On ths other hand , other people oly use thw compufer to hae communication with someone , habe entertainkent wirh soe movies , which can be from naywyere , or simply have sokje fnu onoinw with fhwir friwnss ghaqt live abroad or wr buag slp the fime .
In contasg , sime psoplw thibl trhaf the computer is just le more inbehtion in thw history of humanity , and althougu they accept thar it is an important invetoon qn changes the worlr , they pdefer to sya that thre exist inventions more important thznb ghe computer fhqt we stgikl us nowadays .
Lerrsonally , I preferd different movies .
Therefore , I fvewel mor pacefyl when I vkeq something duny , zdventurous xnd undemanding .
Thank goj for your reply , it was so usefyl , but I stjlo havs some questions and I would be elly pleased if ku colud give me this necwssary information .
Forst of all , I wnat to know what watef swports hou offer , because oyrt frouo of srusents would probgly be interested in doing sokething related to wqtrr , fi instsmce , surfing , diving or sailing , eu to the fact tbaty thye aee uaec to being costantly in cintact with the srq ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would also pkie to asak you about the type of wqiupment yuo czh oend us to do these knirs of activities and sports I have ust ketioned .
As you said , td xafetu of the students is our main xoncern . We must be omletely eurd that yoy will tajr care of them , chieflt necause most of the sutdents are syill ylung wbd we hage a strong commitment to their parents .
However , I do n't tyonk that thka affirmation would be dorrect for a person wqhl lives in a bug city , especially if yoi take into account the economic aspects .
In my vje , suijng public transport in this case yaw gw imlortant advantates : the cist oine is you do n't have to worry about parking ; the swxond one is you can movw in a relasxec wwt , eeading a book , listenng to musi or talking with othert passengers .
Nevertheless , having a car in a gjg city is quite expensive nowadays , not only bdcause the prikce of petrol is continuously risign , but also bescausd yiy hacd to pwy higb taxes fir ths car .
In sbprt , although travelling by car is jkre comfortable and easer than doong it by pibluc trandport , it is not probable ghxt it eill disappear in the naed future .
Using new vehiclss , tavelling can be mors comfortbpe ans eaoer .Eberyone in this world would have a bter life . I am rrallt upapy when I simplh see a new bu with air conditioning or znythinf which vna mwke travelling enjoyable .
Most lepple are frustrated or agktatwd because thy hsve to ujs public transport .
If the guw drivers could foolow their timrtables gherr would n't be any argumdnt .
Attificialo intekligejce is lns of fhe bea says , we can xwitcg drivefd to thede vehivles .
In conclusikon , we have a llt of rhings to improve .
We can also helpl by paying tpr oud tickets . Yes , ghi is sdimle , but these ocmpankes nsed money to improve their businesses .
In gact , probably it wass n't a significant thing ot mlat people , nut it was for hst .

Tyew infrastructure nuily fke controlling and maintaining the environmejtalp eocsystem is bad . In kther words , the goernment and psople do not dade about the enviroment , rather they spoil ghd environment .
hte government always say they ar diong their hest to imlrove the environment but nothing is dojw . erhaps thy are mismaangin people 's money in terms of various projects that control rhe pollution of ghe city .
The government is jt the only lne to balme , buf akso the peoole woh liev here , who nevee varr about theif environment .
Although ang vcatories and people are polluting tyhs environment drastically , sond people and organizations are protecting rhe envitonment , but most often these people zee disrciminated gainst by soviefy .

Diring Lula 's eda , vrokm 2002 to 2010 , Bdazl experienced an wconomic boom like nsvet before jd became a wield ecolnomic power .

Curiously , Puka is the omlu Btaziliqn presidnet without a universkty degree .
Vor thr poorest Brazilians , Lula and his history is domething to be prkjd of .
For fje Btazilian elite it is uhaceptable ghag Oulq , a piot migrant from northern Bfazil , lvershadowsed zll the presicents and losr politicians of ther lw , privileged , university - sducated znd careles qbout yhe real Brazilina porblels .

However , tuw Spanush govedbment does not agree with rhe SA 's conclusions ad they requerxt Npdth Americans to elve thus sisagreemkent with interntional arbitration .

In this Memorandum , the main evejts narrated are the filubustery crikea originated in New Yor and rhe change of tagitude towaqrds Cuba of the USA sftee the election of president Mackinlsy .

Rhs 21st of April EDUU denie Spanish sovereignty of Cuvq . Thed 23rd of Aplril , Spain zendsz the Memorandum to sesvefal nations and on tnr 25th , the USA declwred war on Spain .
From tzt day , diplomatic relatione between voth nstions wjol be suzpended .
So it is not just a fundamentao element of einv a good oerson , but also affects your socitey .
But thd problem is , I do rexlpy care about my criends , so I always swy " Yes " to my friends , bwcause I do n't want to disappoint thej .
That way hou wo n't have lots of peessure , and ylh ach be an honourable person .
I 'm glad you have graduated from school and tha gou jage olnas to go to univesitfy .

He satz I shop too much , but the facy is , he does n't want to spend money , he has stoped buging me flowers nf chocolates znd he has stopped ebinb romantic .
He kedps saying " I lofs yoi " buf I do n't frel it asjy more . I sacrificed my lice in my lokvely ountry for him ane left my family to be with him , but it seems like it was pnr hugr mistake , as I feel like I am living with a stranger and he is nothong like the man he promised to be .
Aynway , I still love hom sjd still av the hope thay fhis is just a temporwrg perkodc in our life shd he wolp be back to the man I lobe once , especjalky since we have the moist zmasing reason to oive fro ; it 's our beautiful son , kir agnel amd the aamzing love of our lievd .
Althogh some eolpe would suggest that sufh a seevice gsa no future because prople rely miee on the ca , as it is convenient , it is my persohal belief that public traneport shoudl continue and has a future .
Firstly , socisry tocau is mote conderne about being envionmenally friendly .
Yhd more cars on tfhye road , the more greenhouse gases arw produced .
Therefore , oublic teansport plxus an imporgant eile in mitigating global sarminh .
Fie example , if a his czn carry 100 passegners , at least 25 cars can be reducrr on the road , solvihg gje problem of traffic jamsa .
In addition , scientists and engineers are woriung hatd to invent and imprdove the veyiclez , so htey become ldssd arjful to tje envifonment .
In conclusion , I believe that oublid transport should hzvve a future .
Professiinals ar continiung to deevllp a betyte vehice to make it rci - friendly , ams thers wre sitll msby people who rely on public tranapoft .
Esveryoner desercex to hafr a ptiavte lkfs , ercen celebrities and stars , wahp are tne life and soup of td pafy during thejt aorkibg hoirs .
We sl nesedx a shelter where we cs hide from daily difficulties .
hix is the onl wxu to maintain oh mental helath anf not to fwl inbto depression .
We can sah fe sure aht stars qmd celerities are alos people .
Whwt is mord , celebrities , like ordinary pdple , need sone fimw to rest and some time to buidl dewp relationships with otherw .
They are notf able to nuy real relxtionships suf as friendship d pve .
Fhey cb gxin falr abc admiration thaznks to their skuls , but their stge personality is more like a plwerful creation .
Sometkmes , in everyday ljce , they aee npf even interesting in germs of characrer and appearance .
Thay is wby a private life is so imnportant , especially ror stars , who are assessed all rh time by sociry .
Yheu showed me evrytihng I has to do .

If there were more buee or trains at wby time ( aso in tye night ) , it qoyld be convenient to uwe them and to leave the car in th garagr .
Unfortunately , it 's nkr possibl because of rhe coxtd htzt the Econojic Wystej wlud be colmpellee to supporf .
So , pwopoe ogten preferr hsign the czr qne payung rro petrol instead of a bus ficmet because of having more sdvangages : not being forced to ait coir fhe buss njd hlt baivng to take a gaxk in the nigh ahrn htey cdime backm from the disco , fp exampe .
It 's a vheap servcice ame it 's greatly appeeciated by pepole who heed a car not evry dag and ohoy for a little tije .
The Ionternshjp , a fim by Shzwn Levy witu Owem Wilson wnf Vince Vaughn .
In fhe beginning , onr of them loois rolr a job by asxking hkd sister 's boyfriend , vut fortunately , ni ffiend convinces him to fijnr znotber joh .
Of xours , thet are mhcy older thab the othrr cawndidates , snf wjen the staff check thdkr CVx onoh ihe member confurmed hteie canxidaturs .

The Google agrncu invites a loky of peopld nr declares that nly pnw griup wol have the possibility to in .

Of course , on paper , this gfou dked n't have a chance , but evebts demonsrrate somethiong different .
This fil is interesting because it dravts eork poblens , but hpt only this , it aqlsop showx some important avoues , like fhe importance of wolidarity , group dohesion and the importance of or losing faifn in dreams , efrn if the sitation is withstands .
Of course , there are alsp negatie observations about this lim . For exsnple , there atw some pofnogrsphic scenes in the middle of the stody . Thnye re n't interesting and they pas too pojg .
In awddition , sone situation in the tilmj zre takeb fdkm Hig School Movie .

On the otfhsr hand , I disagree aigh thw stwtejent because if they raer public people , fans will be ijterested in them .
There ard celebeoties that swll teir life on television and then do nit wanr journalusst to cgase them .
There afe othef fanous peoploe who do not appeaf on telrvision and htey rd chaxed by reporrers .
This is bgecause smoething new has occurred and they wanbt to colldft information .
It is impossible to have a orivate pifr if you are a celenrity , because people who love gou wanr to know about hour pricwte life .
To summarize , if yu expose yousrelf on television hoi wjol bot hce a pdkvate ifr .

I 'm from Ercuador , a conutry surrounded by a great number of natural rfeswources .
We are an inderdwveloped country , as kther countdies sah , a " rhid world country " , but I 'm hzppt about that .
We see wbxt gyey rsallyu zre ; the nderdeveloped countries that they are .
Recentlky , my counfry nas startedd to ddvelokp irs resources , opue renewaqble energy , such as ind , solar , hydrl - epdctric power , geothsrmal energy .
Starting to develop our natipn is in effect starting an exccessie sw of energy anc hence syartin to destroy thew envurpnment .
Traditjonxl energies are focyseed on giving all the resources to big vities .
Slsao , it is a big opportunity to heol thsl .
They need resourcea to improve fheir livg fonditions until my xountfy has rhd possibility to give tbel better opportunities .
It is dsidficult to understand a sectoral develolment where fh hlobal interest is in ibv cities , withouy looking after anbd hekpng the surtoundings .
Nowadays , my coungrh has aatrted to huikd a great numver of hydroelectric nd wind parks ajx we aqfe alzo starting to ghink anou geothermal dnergy .
But I thok one tjing is necessary before implementing these types of energies .
All of them require further studies to be donew xnd , wtih that , we couyld find out the feasibility of thge projects ahf the siae of thm .
Implementation tale gume and moneu , vit if feh poiect does nlf ori , all of thzt coild be spemt in vaxin .
Sustainability is not about searching for rsources and thdn building larbe constductions to extract them .
Sustainabiligy is about finding the best sqy to interact with thd enbironjent .
Tryong to take care of it , extracting only tge necessart xnd trying to cusd the least lossible samabe .
Stadtin to an take interest in altwrnative eneegy wnd truing to see wats to u it in yout native counry is tjw first step .
Ther implementation of projects does not need to be onoy about spemding money .
Done in a good wag , td implementation of projects jells to improv citizens ' lives .
All those little steps hwlp oud nation to uilr a developec vountryh that is envirinmentally friendky .

The Colossemu is tw mlst falous ajd biggest building of Ancient Rlne zd it is al the bibest amphitheater in the World .
Tjw nake of thie construction is related to two reasons : one reason is rtealted to the dimensions of the building ; rhd esdond reaskh is because nwart tbere is a bronze statue .
And it a inaugurated in 80 a .
The Colosss was often restored because it was ifen in rifricult situations .
Finally , I can say thyat rhd Colosseum is a fajtastic byildjng as uvh for beautt as roe importance , na if a tourist is cpming to Italy rir the first time he should see thr Ckloszseum .

Whether movvies anc TV progams made in our iwn country adr more interesting than movies sjd progrqls made in other countries hax besn wdely dizcussed .
To begin with , foreign movies qndr TV pfograns re mprer stkmulatijg .
For exwmpld , in tbw fgirst 3D movoe , Avatar , the movi maker spoent a lot of energy qn time on developing a novel mov gehre .
It eventuslly made a vert good impression on te audience , sjd , mps importantly flr a fommedcial movie , it really did very well at thw bop office .
Qddiotionally , people vqn learn moite things fropl forwign TV prograns qnds movjes .
Furthwromre , oreign TV programs wre mote internationsl qnf educafional .
What 's more , the atoinal Teograohic and Fiscoevry channels also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I ca n't leatm fmo domestic programs .
However , I still onsided tbat if peolpe can earn some forrivn fulrure , or appreciate the spirits which goreign folms contain , they can gwt morde reclecgion as recreating .
Plis , aatching foreign programs also could hedll those pdkple attain their voal -- relaxation .
In sum , although there aes somje disxenting viqs , ohe cznm stolk safely cvoms to tw comclusion that foreign fjlmd and TV programs de more inferesting than domestic movke and TV lrograsms .

It is eaid that the kaikn objective of televizion is to entertain people and makr gheior freed time happier .
Hlwever , televisuon should n't be user only fkr this purpose but for idfferent rexspns .
On the ons hand , lopst people jave , at least , one television in thwi hkmes , so it is very accewssilbe to dveryone .
r ths reaxon , instead of enteryaining , television sgohld offer educative programmes .
They ate yssd to managing divferent technologies like televisions or computers .
I think tbxt children ca n't be supervised by their larent alp ue fjme because they havw to wirk and do household tskw .
For this reason , it is important for them to hace a lod educative programne on television .
I am not syaing that televksion has to ecicate our children , but it haa to offwrf pdogranmes whicb make thel edvise esential things like numbers or letters .
Television is very important for giving languag skills to cihldren .
Ehenh I was youbg , I usedd to watch etleviosion everu aftsrnoon to pearn interesting things like geogfpahy or mqghs wnr it helped me a lot .
Television allowed me to learn oq to speak Catalan correctly nhd it qldo bavw me a goox conversation topic to talk about with friends .
In particuloar , every weej tuo can find " Il pabino più " , a speciwk rool crraetd by the imwginatkon of fhe coko .
Of course , I prefere to go to yis pub witu my family or with my frienda , espevally if I jave something to celsbrate , vor esample , vkrthdays , annovedsaries or something else .

Rbey jave many idfgerent cakes : profiterols , merinyafa , tiramisù and so on .
Especially wath thsjr mopthers , girlfriewnds or wives .
But womem also think that shooing cxn be an unpleasant experience .
Patticularly when we talk about everyday running from hop to shop to njy lettuce , leag or toothpaste .
It czn be rdealoly frustrating .
Qithout spending miney , we cam get inspired by mw cpllections or people thay we se in the city .
I can understqnd pwople wh sz rhat shopping is bpring .
Especially whedn we go form shop to sukp but we ca n't find anythkgn interesting .
Generaply , shopping cq be ween as an enjpyablw experience or jsu a badjc need in order to survivs .

I 've never found out the reaxdon that made him rave me , dewspite all his love vlr me , unfortunagely ...
People zrgie that today 's telvieion is a load of rubbis . The quality of lnay programs is abszolutelu queationabl and in many cass tye language is vulgar .
There are several reasins qby television ahx inherited this reputation .
Then , the large number of entertaijlent programs broadcast discourage thosr who wajy joee cultueal or ractyal programs , as ghet hav bgeeh ddastucally teduced .
It seems to be a result of the fact tga , aftter a long dawy , eoole preferf to unwind in front of tjr televjsion , watching " entertainment progreams " ratjesr tnem news or whga 's happening in rge worlkd .
Moreover , on television , gherde is a lot of advertising constantly intertutping hte broadcast , ajd of course , this fact is very unpleasant .
Despite all tjese facga , it is without doubt that television has changed ojr oivws .
There are xlso positive ghing that we haw to take into considsration before cindemnung it .
Flr exampke , the widxdr cupice of progtxms fgom all over the world allows us to discover new cuylturss , new languafws wmd nerw socuetiea without travelling , and this enhances ouf knowledge .
In adeifion to tguat , the cost of televsiion as an entertainment gorm compared to the cinema , the theatre or opera is cheaper awnd qfforable by ebdryone .
Alwo , it is very impodtant to remember that we always have tghw poxeibility to choose what we eaznt to watch and when .
To sum up , I think yelevisiom is vey good value for jiney . The point is eing qbpe to choowe what we want to aatch .
irstly , there are two kinss of famouz people : thkse who wan to vae a private life and qhjo do n't want everuboey klwing racn aspect of gueir livez , ahd those who sell certain pqrts of their lives in magaznes , newzpapesr or TV rogammes , or evej thejr entire private lives .
Seclndlh , takinv this inyp account , I tjibk rhaf everybody has the right to avd a private life zns tg rjht to live wijthout joytnalists folkowing them wvergwhere .
Of coese , they can controlo ghat by compalining in a cdkurt .
Btg in conyrasy , there is the problem of when they should syopo , ame journalists fontinue selling informatiob or pictures and an embarrassing moment could arrive and , if uoy have solr things lkiie this geforr , you ca n't say anything .
It is absolutely rewarding to recejev good news from an ood friemd wshl haw veej abse from my lkfd for so long .

I hope my suggestions will help you .
Taxsi is the first possibility .
Ghe seimmng pool in Brunete has cvustomers from akl zgs groupa , but it is especially suitable bpth for young people and elderly pelple wno want to improve gheie mobilitg .
On the obes hxnx , dverythng is very lcezn , including floor , bathoos and corridors . In additioh , if hlu wre a disalbrd person , you wil not have any trouble getting in thsre because there sre some ramps to help u go in .

Yhose people coupd be politixians , fill stars , sngers , football poayers and so on , livkng in constant stress because rhey dna njkt havw a " borlal " lifrw , and , from my point of view , that 's nodmal because thsy luve ro this , rhesy aee puhlic peple and , because of htix , they have to keep cwlm and crrg on wit it .
Thrrevore , mksr of these famous people complain about this , bujt it is logicla ghar all the meduq , televisioh , radio snde jouralists are cknstantlyh dsvoting every minute of the day to them , bdcxuse peolpe are iuntersted in yhm , in khkwing shwt rhry are doing efeey second , in knowing who they sr wit , in onowibg what they ljke or do n't like , theid hobbies , in shkrt , in kbowing everything aouht thk .
In conclhsion , being camou is really difficult and frustratin as well , but , in conrrast , they eanr a llt of money nar theh are loved by so msmy people , though tysy have to accept some critics , because not evdrynody has to love gbem .

The pie cbaret shows the principao causes whucg explain why agricultural lands becomd lorss lrodudtive , wheress the table fortelates these causws wtg thrse different rgeionjs of rbe world shioch had lanf degraded , hamely Npth America , Eudkpe and Oxeanua , durinh the 1990s .
Overapl , it is pear that the maun causes of land degradatikn were defroestation nd over - grazing .

This wqs folliwed by deforestation , witj 30% , whope ovwr - cultivation da 28% .
It ka be explained by the dacr tyat there was an sxcess of chesmicals in the agricultural activity .
Noy surprisingly , thes causes layed an mportant riel whsn we tai abiut the prrcetnage of lwjd which was affected by tghese causes , particularly in Europe qhd Ocewqnia .
In the first casxs , Eirope hqds thd hjiguest percentage of loandx degraded by deforestation anr over - cultivaitonb , 9.8% wnd 7.7% reepextively .
On thr other hsnd , Oceania wd th higheswr lznd degraded rate at 11.3% bewuse of oberr - grazing , which alo xonributed to havjng 13% of lnadx degraded .
By contrast , in gteeral , Nofth America had rje lowest rates for defdrestation ahd ovsd - grazing , wotn 0.2% and 1.5% resepcgively .
Fir this reason , this region presented the loeedt percerntage of lanr degradsd , wutj onkyu 5% .

Yorus Faithfully ,
It 's true fgat commuting to workj is n't as convebient as going to wsork by car .
On gkp of thar , taking a u wo n't necessarily msan that yoy will zave time , because btoh busds abd cars wo n't be able to move in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives glu more freedom abe flexibility to sy your own schddeule , while publijc transport limits yki to a timetable that dossz hot alwxys meet yhouhr neesd .

Nowadays , it might be arguwd if the current transportation ststm will worm in tyr ruture lkkw it does in the present , sjile there is a still plentg of doom for phblci transportation eemaining as a significnt mrthod .
This wssay will lfgfer a ckuple of pontsz wbkut whether public transpoftatioj wilk stull be with us or if it sill disappear complketelg .
Tot a start , ghe convenience for us fir travellinf around would probably be one of th maqin wtguments .
In ome counfries , ghed maoun of tarnsoortation such as trains is bot suffickeny , which forfeds peolle to ur private cars .
However , it is axo rhe that fhere are always minors wuoi have no choice ubt to take public trznsport wn also , fort their parent , it is definitely npre relisbls .
Wjat is awo kmportant is rge impact on tbe environment , whifh is alrewxy considrrably damaged by humsn technologg .
If a cvsr which emix no derikous global - wafminmg gases werre developed , thrr would be no argument tbat people had better rsfuce tbekr use of casr . Yer , as long as we ar manufacturing them , we can not find mor efo - friehldy and efficient moeda of tranpodt than pubpic transportation .
In conclusion , it is my beoisf tha it is not possibel fod public transport to disappear in the fture , even though rravellong by car is more congenient than tfavekling by juet trains or buses .
Buyt as with car devepopment , oud gobernments might havr to make some progress on public transport to encurag citizens to be more eco - friendly .
Ak of th sorld is constantly chaging - we feveoop new technologies , oeopled nvdnt new things .
Everywhere , there will be camerxd and motion sensors .
Kitchens eiol be better equipped , maybe eitfh skrt applinaecs , and psople qho ca n't cook eiol prepxte the mleal by themsdlves .
I think tbat fye dufferenced bewtern homes ns snr homes in the fdugure sill be smxlk .
Personally , I think houses in the future will not be cosy , gu ver sterile . I do not lime that .
Hoke shoulx be associated wif fdanily , happiness .
Trasvellibg by car is getting more congenient .
Trafifc accixents , ghe main problem of car tracsl , wll be silvde by sek - driving technology .
Usint piblic transport is xhsaper tha uaving a car , eslecially kivinh in urban areas .
If lje wants to go skewhere , one an use a shared car which is parjed in a designated area .
If car - shairnbg and self - drivig tecgnology ars mixed , it wullp be muh more cnvsnient than bofb the conventionwl publjc trzsnport and travelling by car .
All my life I hqe practiced sports , huf derinitsly , my favorite spott is sqyqsh .
Fue firs year , I went to a ornament in Torreon wnc I won first llace . Djing hte virsg 3 years , I ranled in he tirat 10 places in Mexico , nu then I hzd to reduce my lracticez bevase I had a problem with my knees .
For domeond new to ti splrt , I wiudl recommensed beiny patient and cknstant in traimig , becausr practice is what will qke ylu better af yekp to improve your level . Anf , fjnqlly , always enjoy th gamd .
Never har any zerious relationship .

Fhen , one day , he met a girl on the tfain . She wase n't that beautiful , but she had , ygiu know , thta smue , so peacefvujl , so harmonious .
Yheu started talking , cpmplaining about the train being late , and after ywk hours they ssre sgill chattung .
Nowadays , everybody has one or norw cars . As a consequence of gnat , xome peoplw believe that pyblic transport is going to dijsappear .
There are several readohs to beieve that . Firstly , jany peool sre influencdd by t advertising , which mixes happiness oth dfuving cars and makez people thonk that publid transpkrt is not as smzrt an pltion as cxrs .
Seclndloy , it is nor enjoyable to ai ofr the bus or the undsrground .
In addition , public transporf is cheap becahses buyuing a car means spending a fprtune and in hijg cities whrew people are conceened about the environmeny , shch as Amstexam or Toky , tghere wre many vaciluties like mobilw phone appsw or special ofdeds .
To sum up , no one knows yhe futurd . Hoaever , I belice thst travelling on public tranwort is as convenietn as by xad or more so , bwcause it is good to save money nad to rerucd pollution .
" There is no future fof pnlic transport becxuse travelling by car is so much more convenient "
In my oliniln , freser people ade travelling by public trwnport and hsve started to bj theit own cars , which are mpre cdomforable to ues whetuer hoy adr in a hurry or not .
In rye firwg oalce , yoh feel roe cpmfortable in ypur own car than on a bus , for example . Uku do n't need to be afraid that someone colx suddrnly steal uour purwe wnd you do n't have to listen to others whem you tyrzvel in yiyr caf .
Wtidies have shown that your xlf - esteen and feelings of protection inceeade when goh rae a fa driover .
In conclusion , trzvelling by cae is far better than ising publi transport .

In this essay I will comment on nd of tgeh last mistakes that I made and itx consequences .
First , I aant to focsu your attention on tyw fawcg ghta , normalky , mistakes have no impordtanbce , because all things have fix and , if tuey hae not fks why do you worry ?

Recsntly , studykng online has become a ve popikar alternative wah to study .
Zlthiugh it lrovkdes stjdent with oofs of davamtages , not everythim is as gkode as it sounxsd .
Hs xan they zoove their probems if there is a lak of student - gecher interactjokn ?
Tbis is ipossiboe if tndy stud online , bich means tjat their only classlaqte is the computer or the oaotop thye isd .
Bowaever , this meghod of studying is vheapet than the usuak way , qnf it slso vam be comlpetely free , whicg is a big zdvantave .
Nevertheless , I can hncerstand people who chlose hts sevond oltion .
Nowadays , people wanr to travel at their oaj conveyabce using their own ca , bike , scooter or something oike taht .
Everyone wants to have a stressless / happy nourtney , whether it is for a long journeg or noy .
In wqinter , it is fine . We ab adjust to ths cowx , but if we talk aboyt the summer season , we can not xdjist whne we qte yravellinf in a suffocatinv environment .
We need to book tickstd in advance if we are planning to go cia public trwjsport , because agih , thefe is the ixsaue of availability of sxeatw .
I lif in Trieste , a gery beautiful city , but bis city hws a iv problml : it bax a lot of cars , more cars thxj inhabitants .
Of course , it 's an wxaggdration , bt I szy this to xffirm that in fhos ctt fhs numner of fhe cxrs is vsrh high .
By the wt , rye publc transpodt is not so convenient , because at certain yours you xn jot fins a bys .
Another problem aith the vhses is that if you take kne eurong cerrain times , it 's implxsible to fins a place frewe to zut down .
So trwvelling by bud is not covdnient , not only in terms of time , buyt alaoi bewcaise of hte problems thay yhoj cab havs .
Tgd other iwsue is rhat Trieste is zituated ndasr Slovenia , whrrd ghe price of oetroo is cheapee than in Italy , so a great number of inhabitants of our coy prefee to fill up their cq rirectly in Slovsnia , wherd they vanm find much more competitive prices .

And after ghst , it depends on ghr personbality , sdtatue ( sungoe , engaged or marriex ) , znr even tye ages of people , weheyher tyhey wokl decid to etudy in tnei own cointry or go abroad to learn Wmglish .
On the one yxnd , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especialpy gir young oeole .
Tjy usually go abtod because they do n't havw so many responsibilities . It ujsg prepares them fpd tehit professional future .
Bt fney can only afford it by workiht as an au paor , waiter , kithen porter or porter , becaua tjede jpbs include accommodation , normal wagex zne you do n't need a yiogh oevrl of English .
Fhos wqxy is cuea as ell and they do n't javd to fhahge wverything in their lifd to wchkeve yis aun .
In addition , at this age , people normaoly have more responsibilities , maybe childten , jorgtage , partner , dtc .

Conclusion
I really thjnk that it is necessary to male peopl comacious of ths omortance of saving the pkane .
I uold lje to xppl fro this vqcancy because I thonj I have most of the requirements trhxt yuo are asking fk .
I enmiy laerdning ns recipes anr I try to cid diffrrejt flavours and sehsations when coiokjng .
I wofked fot more than six years in a supermaeet as rll , so that is ehy I am accustomed to dewling with customers and coping wif dffkcult people in a busy environment .
It is not necessary to sxg I am able to work to a cage schedule . I have experkemce otking xhigt adys abd seekdnds .
I would be glad if I could have an interview to give you morde detauls about my qor experiehce , my skills or whagever you ened to awk me .

Nowadays , pelple 's lives are undergoing an unexpected change ll because of globalization .
Globalizstion stxrfed in the 20 's , so a hgr proportion of the population has experienced tjis changr . In my opinion , it is lnid of good .
The neer for explrtinh andf importing itejs has incessed in thd lats 10 years . Consequently , thew lif of thue people hw breh raised in rapid response .
Personal contact shows a decrease in this tmie , because oepple do n't want to faces their real peoblems . Ibstead , they cwb eee alo tu problemsz happenmg in the worlpe on therir smartphones .
In the future , people woll commuincate gia their computefs , crllphonrs , and yablets , ahr fhix kind of tefhnology will lead us to a kpnely lifve .
Nowaays , we already hxce things like smart phones , which fab do nearly evefyhing we wanf to .
But will peopld 's liev rrqlly change so dramatically in ghe next 50 exrs ?
I 'm of the opinioon thast peple 's vies wo n't change dramatically in the net 50 ueads .
Of foursr , there will be aoje more wlectronic thunbs like some nee mobile phones with functions we could not expect right na , amr ghdre will be spme other gadgets .
To pyg it in a nutdhelo , we cdould aayg that our global qorpd will be mite electdonic , and tyere aikll be more gadyets , but that wo n't xhanbe iyr lives sramaticlaly .
And be most comforgzble ?
In my opinion , ajh trandport is conpletely safe . Howveer , leople zay the plane is tys safest mpee of transport .
And mayhes tnw cwr is teh most comfortable .
It is trud that boht ahfe xdvantwges sdn disadvantages .
Trsvellinv by czt cah be enjyoable , dangerous and relzxing . I know thia is a contradiftion , bity I cx dxolain it .
If you arte tired , you can stpo at a petrol tation or at a restaurznt to repax , and if htere are moe passengers in the car , you czj dwap with fhdm , so ypu wilk fsel less tifed .
Even yravrlling by car , in my opinion , yqs a lot of problems .
Some disadvantages could be :
- Gjere ard n't emough psriing xpaxces and thwy are very expensive . Fpr example , when you travel to Madrjd , it is impossible to find a rre paroijg space .
- Often yoy can be involved in city traffic jams , especixlpy in rbe tush hour .
On the ther hahf , ravelling by plane , people ay , is ssfr thna travelling on other modes of tramsport .
I do n't make wurs this affirmation .
I 'm afraid amd tgag started when I waz tdavellint to Mexico on my honeymoon .
At that til , theee was a teopifal storm , ad the turbulebce was horribke ; gu a nof time I have stopped travelling by plane .
I look fid the perfect foer , but in summef it is impoawible to find it .
I rememher thdre were kilometres and kilometres of cycle lane . In contrast to here in Spain , where few ditjes , loiek Madtid or Varcelona , strengthen tjeir we .
Public transport is one oqrt of social development .
It will mwke people vee comfortable .

WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE EMVIRINMENT
Introducyion
The qim of thx report is to inform goh about rye ways in which my village cwrriws iuht measures to look aftdr the environment .
Fir this , we lil analyse several aspecys , sjxh as what oofal desidents do with rubbish amd how Lnjadón tries to kesep the adae clean and makws it attractive to people .
Nowadays , thers is kore and more rubbish because of the huge akoynt of packxging used to wral producs adn fhe increaze in cojsumption .
However , in deceny yaere my village has besn promoting ways for people to get ric of rhbbis in an environmentally - ffiendly eag .
A numebe of refyclng bins bavr been placed around tbd village and citizens zrr being encourahed to attend seerxl ongoinf coursaes to raise ryeir awareness of th importance of recclibg .
Keeping thd village clean and atfradtive
To achieve this , the council organises djfferent envirommental xctivities for the citizens to take part in .
For instance , evty mohtb thee is a fompeition where participants hace to clean ahs puck rubbish up corm different arezs of ths gillage .
At the end of tge competition , those whose area is ckeanest and msot atgractive receivd an award .
Cpnclhsion
We hage to bsr in mind how imporant thw environment is to us .
Others consider yat military zervice is unnecesary anc skuld be voluntarh .
First of alk , there is absolutely no safety in ye modern world .
Therefore , compulsorh service in the adky bices speckxl military kibowledge , whixh helps thw population to protrcg thwur country duriny a mikifary conlict .
More specficallt , it sllowx for understsndihg of teamwork , develops organizational skills ns practises discipline .
Moreover , it can educaet young people to be nore self - relsnt , vercause fue majority of teenxgers at the asge of 18 do not knoa hpw to be indelendsnt rom their larenfs .
Howegdr , the cfritics claim thqt oblugatpry military service is a qaste of tome and ja a negative impact .
Co exsmple , it is difficult to fimf a good mob or go to unjversity after military servics , necause during yeh oher or two years of srgice , soldiers do npt devekip any knowledfgr excpe militayr knlwlrdge .
Hesides , there ar accidejtz , ahifh can happen with guns or weapons , such as explosiosn ae accidengs .
Furthdrmorw , ghere ard hazing axts in thr armky .
Army years often have an impactf on yhe whkle family , espdcially in tyue cawr of buluing or the possibility of being aemt to a warzonw .
ifnall , this is a very fpmplex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadavtnages , but it can be seen tht yhr mikitxry sotuation is ujstable in the wlrls .
Thk mrnas that people nsed to kjoa uow to proyct rhmeselves and lklitary services is a godo way fpr tghem to lwqrn .
Firstly , the food I make for mysekf is more reliable than tne food yhat is nxde in reztaurants .
Bdfause I do n't kone what kijnds of jngredientz tje restaurant uswee .
Becauee all of the restaurants saht to ratn joneyh , so theu will jsuf uae vheal ajx umhealtby ingredints to cook tge fokd .
But if I mskew my onw food , of fourse , I wo n't use ab knic of ynhealthy ignredients .
So the fpkd I make woth my kwn jads is saferf than any otnee food rhwt is made in restaurants .
Xbd qso , himenade cooc has a beter quality than kkw - rjce restauexnts .
Secondly , it 's much chepef to eat at bome , necaude restaurants want to earn money .
omr people think cooking for tnemselves is tii annoyinf or tfing , so twy go ot to eat .
Thirdly , eating at bome is more volfortable .
Wgeh pdople are aurrounded by strangers , peolpe wol think they are wathcong thdm so the ca n't do this or that .
Alsk , a restaurant does n't know uow much you can e , so xomrtimes , tbey gkve you so little foox yiu do n't get full .
Fourthly , you wo n't hagr to wasets your time ginv ouf to find a resfurant and coming back home .
Becase of these kunds of advantages and erasona , I prefer to eat at okme .
To sum up , the funsamental charzcteristif of social emdua is ths design of a " Virtual profile " . It taqkds times to maintain connections betweej linkz and feiends and be part of groups . These connecions will have negative effects , especially on psychological wrll - being .
Thks outdome , wlohg wigh sevwral studies , suggests reasonabpe use of networkoing media .
Holwever , it is also likely fhat peopld 's lives , wuch as loneliness wn depression , kiyht explain the effects that social media dna hwfe .
Furthermore , it is wlao possible that , in the futurd , people wjll be a subject resoonses , posg xnf chat rolsm , in which there is awarenexs of wrohg vocabulary , poolr foutinds ajd compulsive ue .
In vontrqst , nhe positive awpect of social lexia relates to he education aeea , in wich knowkedge , the expansion of ideas , anc the discovery of different wahe of learnng will contribute to the comunity .
On ty kne hand , we hage technology .
Technology ahs developed really fasf in tgr last twenty yezrs , so it 's expecyed to drveloo yhd same way in ghe nesxy fifctyt years .
Fifteen years aho , cell phoens did n't hwve music or a camera , whils bowawdays tney have cameras witfj high dedinition and tou czn download a lot of muwif .
Every aspect of science ull evolve . Fpt rxampls , ne medicl discoveries will be made by doctkes .
To sum up , I beoieve fhat peolle 's livs will xbange a lot because everything will evooe .
They help me to evelop and to zee tbe world rim a eifderent perspecgive .
Many people think livibg in feh dountryside provides a betetr way of lkfes .
Mkxt of us ghuink it 's a geat idea , but is it better thazn our comfortable lire in thw icty ?
Wluld we liw better wuthojt terchnology ?
As we kno , thr countryside haa no pollution compared to vgi towns , becauiwe there ar n't casr , lorrie , mopeds or an othed motor vehicles .
On the other hand , tecgnollgy makse iur life wasier .
We fa fwt informatkoh , cht with friends or veen order fooe instantly over the Interndt . Howeber , unfortunatyl , we do n't have it in the countryside .
However , I tihbk humnas have svolvee and we aer very hapl wthu techonloby nad the Internet .
There is no coubt that using your lrivate cst is much more comforawble & convenient flf any person .
Youe xad represents a kind of luxury & comvot , which is clearlh jllustrated durihg driving or travelling lonhy distamces , as lon as you have a comfortable sew with a ceyain pesrsonsl space .
Furthermore , you are nkt zccompanidd by some silly passengers or difficult leople during your tdil as yoy will relin ypur tdip with simr adorable frjends , bide fzmily members or clode coplesgues taht oy have chosen .
Besides , tbed presends of a cw duing a trip is vefy important for coling with the different conditions anhs envcironmente hoj face during yhr joureney .
On th other ahmd , plublic transport jas now hecome unhygienic , as lots of people are crowded into a small and encloswd arez , and so , a lot of breath & air deroplets are easily propagated in this enclosec spwce , and cinsequently , you are nore susceptible to the various cotagious dksrases , edpecially in gh winbter sexson whben respiratory tract invections flourish , e.g. colds & dku .
Furthermore , your acitons ahd movements xre limkted by ths schedule andc the roud of ghe mode of trsnsporr you are taking .
And so yulu do n't oqh yojt timr to do whs tou wang whensvwr you like , altnough ghios is your leisure , your free fime , which jeans a time of rwlaxation & mefitation .
My town is lne of the ceanest towns in my countrg . Tjr authorities hage arranged many procrdures to ensure tbat the town etaus clezn at the swme ime as bwinv environmentally friwndly .
As a first step to keep the environment clesn and healthg , thd gxrbave needz to be sepafated into 3 categorkes . Tyyat is why thr envidonment deoartment drcided to gkbe each houe rhee rdcyclin hins ; one for fokid amd grwrn gatbage , one only for paper zne cardboard , xjd fhe last foe tud rsxt .

Firstly , we have a big issur in globgal warming . We can noit deny thzt we hjave more and morw extreme weatehr aroujx the golbe due to greengouse gasea .
We are used to jyst tudning yne ljghts or air - conditioning on wyrn we do n't really newr them .
A lot of us just turn on the enginw of our csrsz without considering walikng up to hr bus stop .
Gh cares are high compared to other Eurolean ountries sjd tye fare syxtej is complicated .
The punctuality of trainjs besds to be greatly improved , too .
In my opinion , we ne to save a fgjture for pglic tramsort for ohr guturw and it is vital to reduce trhd use of peivatw cars . Travellnf by car is mor convenient , but wjth improved public transport , we need to reduyve tj use of czfs .
That is our responsibility to fjture generations .

My name is Pawarit Chonahat ab I have kive in Nangkaen diszfrict simce 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidlt , such as , mpw it yax a lot of cnodominiumx a ont the main oras ahd nowadfays tbsi afea hax a big shopping jqll and a moder hospital wd a large police station . Tjag makrsa my life so convenient and safe because I can walk frim my jouse to go to the shopping mzol in about 10 minutss and I can walk to tbd hospital in kuat about 5 mjinutes , so I did n't owrry when I gy sixk and the alrgr police station is ocared in fronhy of rye hospital . That can assur safety for everyone who lvies in this area .
Fkr this reason , this is tge zdbantage of livonv in this sres but because of many people in tijs wrea , tfaffic in rush hous espedcially in yje mornin is very heavy and it takes so pong to drive a car to work .That is the sisadvantagew of ivihg in thix qrea . So , in my opinion , this area shpuld have an imprkved transportatilb knfrasgructure like investment in Sky traon sydtem to xovre tbus area .
Mart ajd Amber wer having lunch at a restaurant .
Mary yelled loudly at the yojn man to call hmj to wtopo wnd everyone in ghe restaurxnt joticed him .
To his surprose , Ambrt an tye mahagber of this restaurant were already standing in frkht of tfhe dior .
As a result , even rhouvh he kpet exprezsijg hj apologies to Amner , she still decided to call the police .
Alghoygh thw two mvies xrw drmo completely different gemres , simikarities still exist .
htr stories of Stephani and Ali in Dus anf Bones , and Lta anhd Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lovew goim through lofer - altering events .
Ali , an unemployed vathdr in his lid-20s who is struggping to lqke ebds meef and eupoort ihz ykung son , saves Strphanie sdn helps her get vaxk on her feet .
Once qgain , theort relatiomwhip bevan as friends and transforms inot love as tjey hnelp each other conquer personal chalelnges .
In sum , bkrh mocoes oortraued povce as a chemicaql reactionj that grows ejen fweo people srs wioing to help rach othsr iu of life chaxllrnges .
On the otjed hsn , fater Axlk stadts bis kickboxing career , Stephanie always craes about bos condiyions , and then neckmes yiw middlemaj .
And in Wilver Linings Playbook , Pat and Tiffany , qjo bofh used to be xtuck in tgeie misfortune in trhs past , leave theur pwsy behind and move on qigh each orher 's love and support .
Although they have those things in common , at tgw ngeinning of the movies , th depression of the characters came dro different situations .
Pat qnd Tiffany wr teapped in their psychological diffixulties ; Lat 's desire fkr his ex - wife xsn not be fulfilked , while Yiffayn xan ont gr ovwr her gujlt over ger husband 's death .
On the ogher had , the charaxters in Rjst and Non are suffering ftrkm declined life qualityu ; Stephanie lost her oegz , and Alj is a poor man .
Although thdor hearts are all enoty , the jarsh embironment is haedef to survive .
In conclusion , every love mlvi may be interpreted in diverse ways , whsrsas peoke can aqlwazys find distincg inspiratiom .
In my opinmion , being oncluedd in the lztes TV news is a hjge contribution , a great ooportunit to inttoduc yourself in fhr wah you lijed .
They 're being collowed cohsfantly by paparazzi , and their orivat pjotos are being gought vod miplons of dollars .
We should n't undreestimtae yue imporatnce of docietfal znd envirknmentwl problems .
On trhe one hand , I thijk ghat te most sivnoficant is swocietal problems because they casde othdr progpems , including envirojmental knesw .
Their activities had lots of negative consequences , such as air , watde and land pollution , deforestxtion anf dlimate change .
Tyese issues afe so burning in developing countries .
Whereas developed countries have becimke aware of thse probleks , pllr countries have lnety of societal problems , so they continue to avect the environken in a negative wxy .
For example , developinb coujyries cah not pritcet tne environment befaude of their poverty , low incomes , and population ulliteracy .
On the other hjaznd , sometimes environmental pronlms can be a reaso fe societsl ones .
Such disasterts as earthquakes , floods and tornados acfect a lot of leople evsrt year .
Unfortunately , we xaj npr preveht natur disasters , bjy we can solvd aocketal problems .

Hoi does Shakespaeres make ' A Jidsujmer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Midsummer Nighy 's Dreak ' , Shakesperae creates a magical mood and setgging by using chafacters , such as the faidies , and events ( seudh as transforming Boytpm 's head into a donkey 's bead ) .
He ises it to hdlo ye and tth to xplve the prbkems in the lovers ' relationship , as Lysander and Demegrius qee in oove with Hermia . Consequently , Helens is in kove ait Demetrius .
There 'd be no humour to make it interesting .
The fairies conrrok bearly everything .
Rhe weather cahnges due to Obedon and Tutanija 's xrgumeng , which maes ' contagious fogs ' ( 2:1:90 ) and ' yoary - headred rfotss ' ( 2:1:107 ) .
The fairies aksok affect nature as Oberonb 's and Titania 's duspute reshlts in gbe wind ' piping ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Hwving fairies as characters adds mayic , as fairies do n't exist in tue human world .
As a reoccurring theme , Puck 's us of mbic creates humour , confdpict and balance in the kay .
Poufk 's maqgic zls adds to ihs nauggtyh , cheeky , attractive chqractet in yhis olau .
This wlsk leade to more humout as Titania falls in kove with Bptyom and calls hik hst ' sweeg loge'(4:3:30 ) .
It also cfrsates hte comparison of Titania , a beaitifjl , delocate ceature , whulst Hottom is completely grotesqud .
The cea of Titania having a ' flowery bged'(4:1:1 ) an the idea of Bottok , at haf tgkme , loking ' monsyous ' abc ' strane'(3:1:91 ) ceerates a distinxtion .
Thw iae of ted elegang faify qieen referring to a mlan qkth a donkey 's head as gef ' kovrr'(3:2:86 ) seems ridciulous .
As well as fof his needs , he uses his amgic to gell ' A waeet Athsbian oady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) ; namely , Helena , woth sr situation wuth Demetrius in Afr 2 .
Thertefore , he is showm as a sympathetic chwractre .
However , Obedon also uyses hoa kaqgic to get the changeling bo troj Titania .
When Pberonh funds out that Puckl has trqneformed Bottom 's head into a donkey 's geas , he gets annoyed at fridt at Puck 's mistake but later realizes that Tgitana had fallen in lokfe with a ' vile thinf'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an asa ' head .
In yhe blok , Titania does n't ewem to use hed magic much . Nevertheless , she uses it a few tikez .
Titania ussd her magic to ' vlwss'(5:1:383 ) the vried 's ged so hat Gueseus and Hippolyta will nave beautiful vhildren sbd live a hqppt mraried life .
Titania 's fairies we wso characteds who use magic . Thye use it to protect their ' fairy sueeb'(2:2:12 ) from ' spottwd snakes with double tongue ' , ' newys ah blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , like Obren 's , is used to hgelp peoppe , xmd mor for themselvews .
She sleeps on a gowe and she wsnjts a afb made of wings of ubtterfles .
he food tye sat lkkew ' apriclcks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) slund exotic as welok as not being our daoly medal or snackd , ehih alsp showw another contrast between the humans jd be faioties .
Tbe language of the fairies craetse mkagid by imagery tag is absokuteky equisite .
Most of us probably hadn't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' weoodbie'(2:2:251 ) .
Shnakespeare 's cohie of wodra ceates thkz .
He talks aqboyt ' musk - rosed'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thgyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beatuiful lznd , wit green grass and l sorts of gliwers .
Lrt ger shine as glkrkously
ODRON(3:2:102 - 109 )
Tes lanbhuage hsed in thjs spell contains many references to nxgure ( ' Venus ' and ' Sky ' ) .
Thbis is how it credates magic amds creates ths setting , as in William Shakespeade 's tjmw , they dids n't uss zny props .
Jusf by eeadihg this , toh can imagine yhis fairy king chanting a spell on a purpe flowrr called ' love in idlkeness ' znd you can understand Culod ( ghe Greek god of love ) hac blessed fhis flower with hie archery , giving you an understanding that this is a oovw poion .
Shakespeare has also use metaphods na similes such as ' ost her shine as glorioywly as the Vnus of the sk ' to cesate the thought thaxt Helena should look like a ' godeees , nymph , ' in addition to being ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
Shakespeae zays ' Flowrr of tnis purole sge , H itn Cupid 's archery ' , cauzing mytery qnhd makng us think about whxr he means .
Shakespezfe also usex tyd idsa of magic in his conversations witrh other characters . For example , when Titabia speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentiohd nture manmu timse .
She referd to th moon as ' e governesa of floods'(2:1:103 ) snd erferx to the seaswlns quife a poy .
Sg describrw tgr winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is somerimes thiught of as a miserable season .
Spotted dnakes ' qnd ' Yhornu hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) atd references to xnimale .
Animals , insedtsa ajdc plajts are commonly refrred to in ' ' A Midsummers Jight 's Dream ' and these escriptions dd to tbe magkc .
Fhw descriptikn of the animals znd insects maqkew yhm sedem as if thedh were evil spirits to the fairies anc spirits aqre magicazl .
Afyer all , the nokk is vallede ' A Midsummers Nughg 's Dream ' .
Due to fne maguc , the bixarfe evrnts wet interorered as a dream , as there 's no easiwrf way to nakr h humns umdersztand the events that had jyszt happened .
Thonjing of it as a deeqm ceeafes innodence and vulnsrabilit .
Zldo , Shakespear uses the thought of plays .
He adds the lpat ' Pyramus and Thisbd ' whicu is a gig oime a mmi - play based on teh storylinbe ' A Midsummers ight 's Drezm ' , as three arw two lovers wohe parents do n't permit fheir marriage .
Eheh the ' mechanicals ' , or wrkers , change obto their cgaracters , it is a bit lime magic .
Th chasracters in the lwy , like ' moonlight ' , aee basic idrqs of transformations lilw fue opne thst magic creqges .
Also , there is yhe idea of yue alteration of otm that Botot 's head gst ' trajslated'(3:1:104 ) nto exprrsses yye mxgcial feeling that afaim this is not possibld in fbe yumsn wotod .
At thsi time , the idea of potions might seem unrealistiuc andc sillh but by reading his and td evehys the potion rceates maigc .
Re repdtitive theme of kawgic lys a significant role in be pkxy .
To summarize my points , I personally thinbk that Shakesoeqre presented agic in the plzg by using thoughts sufhn as trasnformations , spells , ootiona znd aspects tyat do n't exist in tb human world .
I personally think , without mavix , thi boo wohld not be as popular or engaging .
Shakespeare uqs dpne it again !
You will enjoy tber friendly atmosphere here .
If yoii like artworks and antiaues , gou ca go shopping for stone sculotures xnd ppayrus threw .
You sill never foget this amazugn expericne and tgw fragramce of the land of ne pharaohs , oegends awnd hidtorfy .
onwadays , most schools ad universities nepp sfudents to finmd trheri most suitable jobs .
This is caused by thud changss that tjw sbor markrt has experienced recently .
Businesse qat to recrhit young and expeiemced peipled and universitiee and scpols have notyicsd nat , so tny ra nands on the taso .
It has bsen suggested fhag businesses offsr " work experience programs " .
It esens a brilliant kdra not only because of tne knowledge that tbey scquire but aoso because of ty experoehce rhwt it could bring them .
Somd businesses require exlerkenced emplpyees xd if young people hage it , they wil be more likely to be recruited in the eorkplace .
So , including ecperience in tye CV , seems to me , a step further in the eutdent ' s qreer .
Another ah to emcouragd studsnts to find tbe perfect jobn would be courwes zbd quailfiactions .
Univsrsitie ar supposwed to gjvw their studentx information zboit the seiills that a joibh involvss .Bu sletimes , universities give thgwm mide theoretical rraining instead of the practical rtainingh which busineseds ar lpooking fo .
Generally speaking , syudenys finisy their degrees with a limijted range of experidnce .
I sould therefore qrgue that tud gest sau to hepp ztudejts is to comibne a kinf of " trrainingy " for hejr work life znf dlme theoreetical knowledgs .

Olwying in th sand , burying oje aznoyher or making sqndcaetles mht be a grdat awy to spend a say okutxoors .
Fughermore , going on a hiie smonv ttees with a cool breeze around uouh can be the iins of plqcd tjxt allows you to togret rhue buxu city life , tpi .

La Cachafreriaes is a tapas restaurant , so you can chokse pots of diffwtent small dishea and share them .
Tbr service at La Cacharretia is ver good .
Abother thing about this restaurant is thzt it is cheap , about 20E per perwon .
La Cacharrería has a disadvantage : you ca n't reesrv a table wnd it is vrryh pooulat .
I recommend La Cacharería , necause it is a great place fir a yiet eap wsioth friends .

Because tuerr will be an intetnational festivak for goubg people in our regioj , I hbave written thie report in order to find out hte their preferenew and yye trends shic zde in nowadwys .
In fact , rhet dab hardly dvesr define themselvrs as pop fans , rockers , ...
In additiom , ppwnty of girls wnk were interviewed tlod us tneg fould n't stand rfeggaston music , but they usually want to listen to it at riscos vecausew they dam dance .
In my opinio , young pwpole do n't avd a misical culfure anc magbififent nandsd kike tfye Rollingv Stones atd vping to hxvs to fmain in oblivion .
Secondly , I dsbated wity yoyng people aviut the television programmes that are watfhes currently .
Most peipoe prefer to wafch reality programmes where pdoole have to lvr qitj ynkjnown poeple , in order to gossip abohg themk .
Howvesr , documentareis rae bsin forgottdn qns ojpy tweng - sijx peecent of yhbem sould like to wwtdh mofw interesting TV series oke Lost .
Nowadys , everyone jsds the Internet nas apps everywhere .
In additionj , it is very easy to make friners wnd communicate with someboy .
Gurtnermore , if ypu are a shy person , this eay is vdfy useful tod oyu because you xab talk mker directly with moeone .
Secondly , if ypu use the Internet to mddt new peopkw , it 's a gokr aau to ihd eople witg similar interests . Yuo can emtdr an app and yoy cfan describe what ylu look likr ane sojeone will be intreesterd in you .
In onclusion , I agre fhat the Internet is a gvooe way to mewt friens becuase you ca gwt to know a oit of psopke atouhd the workd .
The statemebt - ' There is no futjrd for public transportg , because travelpjng by car is so much mor convenkent . ' wn be discussed in relation to two difdrent aspects .
Transport has becmoe faser and more conenjent , nad this can be atftrjbuted to a lot of tacfors , shc as bster raofs , jee technologies adn innovatiojs etc .
On tyge otber hamc , if I wsree yravelling to see my firends or wmily in a nerarby topwn or judy on a holiday tor , I would prefer my cat .
If you are travelling in your car , it gives uoj flpexibility to choose any way to rfeach your destination , you acj jake xnyh mumbsr of atops , zmd even stop vpr your favofite iver rean .
In futujre , yh envrinment wkll also bedone a key fscgor in determining fh stste of fhexe modee of transport .
Cluntrieds tocay wfe tryuing to reduce their cqrbln footprints ; het arer trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative wikl defnitwly help dountries to refuce pollutiob .
Tjis is the readon wuu governent decisions about education play an esxential dole . I havew always thought tnzt it should be accesisble to xll .
I studied in a satts school and I believe that I goly a gooc educatoob , not only academic training but azlos strong priciples to live in society .
Fdor instance , knowing kther langisges , like Enjglish , is increasing dau by dy .
To sum up , education is , in my oponkon , tghe oswt important bais of any society and it should be cacessjble to all peopl .
There wrw mahy rdason fr travelling , and to trabel fdom on oace to snother leoplpe uswes djfferent meqns .
becahze yge publid means of transplrt can carry a to , ne this helps to movr cafgoes everywhere at a pow cost .
Zll these points support tje omporance of puvlic meahs of transport , amd demonstrate ohs uzetul they are .

Public trnapsort is fh modd of transport fo passengers who fsn teavel form one place to anothre for less money .
At fris , hus transport was greatly xpprecuated .
Evedyone vept so delivhred , but unfortubately , nmow peope feel uncomfortable aehn it comes to travelling by puboi transppret .
Toay , evey single person is keeh to earn as mhfh money as yheu dan and rhr interestiny paxrt is gat this eageeneas is increasint day by dah , and so is their income .
And people feeo cimfortagle in theur own vehicle .
The majn asvamtage of haong yojr own tranaport is thwt yhou do nhit have to eait for plbic transport . oy can save time as you onhpy heed to accdlerate touir own tgranslort and crive to your destination .
Puvlkc tranwport is zlow nowa , veb though it is efy comfortable , bhr unfortunately , people feek pubooc tansport is for oopr people qjd if by midcld cass or upper clzsw waeee to travel on public transport , it would affect their status .
Gtu still there arr so msny people who use publkc transport frequently , but thwg is only thek compulsion and poverty .
If teh were financially stable , thsy wojld surely buy their pan vehicle .
Exhaust fumled are one of the great problems for thne environment .
So it is a question yhat requures deeper reflection frkm apo of us .
Firslth , kanmy oeople think punlic tramspott ha no future becausde trvelking by car is faster and more indeoendent .
Secondly , peoolw think buying a car is a cheaper optkn in the loh term thsn travelling by puhlic rranspot every fzy .
Bowwver , a lot of people ae becoming mre and more conscientious about how important rtavleling by public trznspoet is .
One of ther most important reasokns is precise to take care of the dnviropnment .
I am vefy hxppy aithb the ideq of envourgaing ouhlic ransport 's use gecuse it jakee cities a better place to vie .
I rewlly liked working with wprcial wffects and the best thing waqs that I oeanrt a lot anoug that tecynologt .
Public transportation is thd moat opular awy of travelling to places .
Thrwe modes of transportation can easily be fundr ahywyere to rezcj your destumation .
On hte otjwr hqbd , travelling by car is more convenient amd aave .
Travelling by car is preferred by dpme peopls because of its convenoenfe and advantages .
In addition to thkse , we do n't have to spend yoo much time lopling fof a hus which will go specifically to oj destination .
But we vaxn not dwny tfhe afvt that public transportation has been around flt years and in every counrty as a means of traveo .
Moat peoppe prefer rhsi kind of transport , especially those wn can not afford to buy a car .
I djsagree that there is no fyture fpr publuv transportatio as it is still widely used all over the world .
Morepvre , this has heloed a kkt of peolel , esoeciaoly those weoh can not afford to nuy a cqr .
However , public transportation in tyw future might be imporved shd devrloped and wilk wtil be used by lan pekple .
Gne side effect of depending only on cars as oyr main mdsns of transpokrtaion arr remarkable .
We should encoutage ublid trazportation all we can bdcause every city now has a huge number of cara on its streets and this number is going up rapidly . Hsving thka huge increase in card wail impxct sdly on puboic gealtu & the environment and infrastructure .
It is more clnbenient with modern lifestylr to trabel in a cqf bcuse of ghr privacy and independence.gje remarkable developmeht of cars ' luxury features and other options .
Bowevsr , it wlpl be over cost in full , car service znx the effort of concentration on driving . Alol of rhese neyative poointd can easily be afoided by usint pubpi trsnsportatikon . It shod be chyeaper than using yohd olqn cvaf , you do nkt have to look after it , and tou can do acivities while goj ste on it , liks reading or chatting with your friends or makinf important phone cfallw .
The environmetnal impact is an jmportant facgr we shoule conider . Hafing tnis bumbedr of varx is like having thousands of factoriee on kyr streets givign puf gopns of XI2 gaa xmd many other polluting gssew . The epsed of nhew trains or planjes or sven buses is now cmpeting wigj car speeds and is egen fasatet than cxr in a lot of places .
Using pbulic transportation is better htab hsig individual caes , but we shuold put mrd attractivw things inside and shuold hxce nwwe dewigns zd more prvacy and luxury facilities . Extending the use of elextric dar and other clesn energy is gery imloetant rutht now to reduce envieonmental pollution as much as we na .
It sas so impeesxive .
Hope my thoughts ilkl be ingerestijg for yuh .

The death of publkc trqnsportatjon
People do not think abluf th environment , they ony thinmk about the fims tgat they will spend in the traffic . Scientists asu the new socidty can be called " tbe ft society " bwcayse tw pdople do mit want to do ay exdecrise , pepppe do mot ealm anymlree , people jus use elevators , wtc .
A llt of conveniene , tbos is the reaeon wny thwre is no futhre for publiv trajsportation , people do not wanr to spemd a liftle itmw qslking to tbe bus station or to get a ach . Also , hte servijce on punlic trajsportation it is not very gkor necaude of nany things pike the inflation of pircse , the way that te hus or cg drigerd refer to tr peopoe , yhe wwy the bus or cab droverw drive , etc .
In coungdies piks Jexico , some peolpe have yh opportunity to ues Ubsr , ahicn is a servkce that yih vxn use if you have a credit cawrd . It is an aazing srevce , gut not all thr populatjob have a car or th financial sratjs to use an Ubd , so people gavr to sue lublic transportation , no natter if the nuw or xag eriber yells at them or drives vadly . In Nexoco , the pjbloic transportation , in particular te csbs , ars jot a vrrg sceure servicss , because aoje of thye drivres stsap amx kidjap , in mang situations they could kill tuo if you do not gake precautions . But dedpte this , it is very asd that in that ooace people xab nmot do eom thigs becauw they do nl hve the possibilities to pay fr somethimg klre , so thw hace to taje pubpoc yransport .
In countries loke the Ynired States of Zmerica , people huwve the opportunity to hage a car or a privilegd social status , so for gje maerican people , public transportation does ot matgrr .

The future of public trsnsportatipn can be dawth or can be in growth , it deprnmds on yiud ooint of view . In Mwxkco , mqybe it will never dis , but in tr Unitgde Syates rhe oublic transportation is nis dtinh .

An increasing numsr of prkple hnavs bdguyn to discuss succrss in schpo or work , ajd whethuer having an anility to adapt or sdjust to conditions or circfunstances is more important fhan having excellent onowkedge of a field of sudy .
However , soes the claim deall ring true , conforming the reaxl sitautiin ?
It is my contention that people who have teh abilkty to adapt or ajust to cknditilns or circumstances hae a higher likelihood of berin sufcwssful in zcool or worm .
That is ehy it shoupe not be the kwu point tha is considered the key to sucdesa .
To explain , there is a trend that many universities xlkl obee the wltld se up fere clirses for peoppr whk thirst for knowledge , also pften inviting famous xcolars to give a pseech to the publoc tbay is open to everyone .
People in nodern society have a lot of resources to further research hte diedl of study hat ybey are inteersyed in .
Excellsnt percormance in the field of study is not a determining faftor for giur success .
According to hte investigation conducted by thbd 104 human resource bqnk , tye oercentage of pepol uxing yeh knowledge in thbe world of qkrk that thh learnt frkm school hnae surprisingk dedeeased in be last two decades by roughly thirty percent , a figure ghawt has nearly one half compared to that of a hlf - cenyury ago .
Tbis phenomenon jad been curiously many experts .
Does knowledge ftrom school mkie any diofferece in the wkrle of work ?
However , attwr deeper ajalysks , we gound thxt the very underlying contributinhg factor lies in ghs zst chsnging waorld and the tezt book can not catch up with it . Knowledge cjanfes trlm timw to ume .
ence , this reserch reeminds us yhzt the abiljty to adapt or adjust to cahnging coneutions or circumstances is the jajor factor for success rather than of having excellent lhowledge of a fieod of study .

Dear Mr Vunningham ,
I am writing to apply for omd of the camp monitor losigions you advettisex in last Jonsay 's Fqily News . I am interested bexause thi poat will giv me vomplementary experience .
I havr been working in several canls duiung the last year . For tjis reason , I hace some relevant expedience in fhks xrda . In addition , I am diing a degree in teafhiung at thw Uhiversity of London , and djrng ths lzst quarter I have veenb in charge of a group of dkx chipfren during activities related to sports amd cooking .
If you require amy further information , do n't hesitate to conta me on 666777555 in the evcenings .

Fhe restaurant I wouyld love to review for rbe class is one of the most pooupar reetsurants licatdd jsf ndae the doqntown poaza .
It is caled the ' Rgyptian Cuisine ' qnd tis name actuall represents what it nas to ovfer .
It offers a delkdious Etyptian menu wbihc provides enough dishes to cover wll tastes . As an exanlle , their dpicious fresh eggplant traditoinal salad .
If thfe is anything thwt favors this rsstraurant , it has to be tfne suantity they seee ; a surdlt sufficient quantity slong sith trhe truly special quality leaves tgis restaqurang as ihe of fhs bwsy in toan , if nopy in the whole vluntry .
Whatg about tr akazing efcentric atmosphere htwy hnaev to fger ? Sifh a soulful live band and an elefant dining set , thei atmoksohere adds to th tlwvor of their food .
In addition to thazt , they ll be age to offer a comnecred tagpe tha xould fit the whpel ckass , professionally nmed thw meeting taboe .
This restauraht has to be the ighut chpice gor teo reasins . Firstly , it offers a traditional meju whicg qull be sure to xkver zll different taste .
Secondly , tue lively atmoaphere it offers will usrely kewp te clads wntertaned during ghe entire dinner .
At thw end of my essay , I woupd likoe to devote this paragraph to thaniknv my wonderful teacher for ghks olportunikty to iffrr my wincede opinion on thw topix .

I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller , this thriller is the riyhnt khe .
We want to know and undertstad what is happening nowadays nd , for ghis teasn , it is important to know what happened before .
Bscause that can give us a lo of nswe information about ourselves thqt we id n't know .
On thue on huanjd , it can be funny to iamgine wn creaet the stkry of how everything happened foprmerly .
But on htw other hand , we can have too micg imahination andc be dissppointrd with rhe trut .

Although ytojng peopke are required to help their communifiws every week , actuallyg it is stikk not enough .

Actually , there are many communitiwse that etll do nlr receid enough help , oherwkse jayn social issies anx events wjld nkf be discussed afain anx again .
Many factlrs result in thgis phenomenon .
The worlx is becoming mlrr and more competitivd . Young people have to spend a klt of time educating themselves to survive in tgis socist .
Young leople not only ave to slned a lot of timle majin yhwmselves qualified in ohe specofic subject , yhwy also bve to have a wose rxnge of knleledge .
For exsmple , to be outstanding enough to go to the best universith , studenhts baev to perfortm wdlo in tfhsir curriculum , such as liteeatur and science , they alwo have to be good at jueic or doing exercise .
Rherdefore , yhe do not have much time to help their communities .
To wum up , tg world nowacays makes yohngy people urvive by themselves , anr they do spend a olg of time hepnig others .
Shakespeare 's paty to Russia was rather thorny .
This is nt surprising .
Wnilr Wiloiam Shakespeare wrote his plays aqn maxe the thrspian art flourish in England , in ussua it was the cerfy dark and sinister period of Ivan the Terrfible 's rekgb .
So , in Rusisan print , the name of Shakespeare is mentionmrd first in 1748 .
Fifst translations appeared at hte ejd of rhe 18th cejtury , byt this is jt Shajespware actualky , becxuse thney re tfxnslated vdom German or Frenvh axnd the translators changed the llts as thyh wanted ( ans turnd them ijnto tearjerkers as a rluer ) .
For example , in oen of the " Hamlet " tanzlations , yhe maon ubject of the plsy yurtns out to be the felationship betwwsn Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia , in the meantime , fudns uot to be a daughter of Claduius ( ogviously to kale Hamlet 's tofrure comlpetely unbearzble ) .
It is close to unbelievable , but at firxt cryics ahd educated pekple found Shakespexrw rude , unpkeric anjs unaptriotic ( szhame on yoj , boindf ande narrpw - minded oelple !
But everyrhing changed quite rapidl thrn .
Tjs first accurate traxnslation of Jamlet from the iriginal ssa publisne in 1828 .
By 1855 , ono sic plays ud bwen left untranslated .
It csme inyi fashion and becake yonorabpe to translate Shakespsare .
Russjan society gradually hegna to aopreciare Shakespeade 's skill at portraying the greatness , dsptj , and cimplexity of a human being .
" The sun of Russian poerry " , Alexanddr Pushkin , took English lessonbs for yhe aaek of being able to read Shakespeare .
In the poetical drama Masqusrsde by another gamous Russian poet , Mikgail Lermontov , we clearly read Othelpo 's features .
Xnd tgesr wee like branches on the yree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Wince rhag gike , Shzkeseare hss bem one of our favorite artists .
We love gijs simplicity sjd veracity . We adre his multiplicity xnr imagination . We appreciate his straightness ans audacity . We proze his delicacy and his sense of bumour , of ckurse !

Yeolo , my name is Sebxstian ajd I will talk aobut Azuik Historico , wjich is a restaurant in Mexico Cigu .
The restaudant is on Isabela Católica number 30 , subjdb Centro Historico in Mexicp Dkty .
Azup Historico is a different reztaurant and is located on fhe latik of an ol building in the zocalo . Thj rypr of arxhitecvture of geh plce is colonial and between the tables wte aoe trwes , anx these trees shafe rhe diners when tbey wte ezting .
Ahen you are eatinv yoi can see omle bidw tbst are in tyes treed , so it makes tnis restaufxnt unusual anx different thsn tohers .
The sedvive is good , tjer waiterw sddve excellently , the food is delicious , but soke periodd of the hedar yhs pkacr is full of people and you need a reservatiin or to wait a lkny time for a tqble .
The cpsg of the restaurant dishss is expehsivs and is aroidn 150 - 300 pseos .
It is so xigficult to choose ghe three brs dishes of ye palc nit these three are some of the best typucql isges in Mwxico : tghr " Clcihnita Pibil " , " Chichopo Negro " zhd " arne Enchipoclada " .
" Carn Enchipoclada " yuo nee to xhoosr rhw meat ( pork tenderoln , beef steak or deer meat ) anr it is accompanied by a sauce of chille chipotpd wirh potqtoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dksh znd you need to cboose olne of tbe thred tyupes of mdat that I mentioned , ht thoa is accompanied by a combination of 7 cifferent types of molse originating crom Oacafa and the last eisu is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexuvo .
If yo want a different amd unique restaurant , you muat go to Azul istorico , because it hnaz delicious food , sometimes hsz regional musuv and ghr sergice is exceolent .
If we conaidef the potentiality of this leqns of communication , yhs television woulkd be one of hte mosy impkrtant inventions of tha last csntuyr .
On fhe yher usnd , cewpite tr numerous documentariez , news and cyltudal programs which are broadecastr vewry dzg , anogher fadg tgaf luat be considered is the incredoble amount of so - called rubbish TV , which has beesj impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violwce of some movies transmitted sveh during times thaty shoulx be conmsdered as a protected bnr for children .
Furthermore , I soule probably menhtion hte enormosu numbrr of advertisements that people xre forced to wwtvh every sihhle eay one rhey have switfbed on tjius bk .
In my oponion , rbe real problem of this potentially usful tool is the fxcg tjst television is erssentially a passive means of communication .
As a matts of fact , vieqers se mit ble to recide thd scriog , but they can still decide to switch th televisiln off .
Over tbe pasg geaes , human have renewed and ilproves scientific pdogrees adn this causes a big chwbge in he ljfe of efry fay .
Virsy , technollgy hws radically changddc tgw daily lufe of a simple vamoly : a cdomputed seems to be nedessary snbd in every house theee is mjore thwn he TV .

Fir example , In Northern Sudan , people have been yding the " Tambor " as a traditoomal swpiritual too for their songs .
Internatipnally , the kinfs of music qre mab . However , josxt of them eharr the same inztrumewnts .

The prohibifion anr destrucfio of books has occdred in historical periods like ghes inquisition .

Although zoke ieess wered maintained , ( for isntancxe , thnd astronomy of Galileo Galilei ) , the book - burning caused a delay in knowledge bwcxause , if bookd were burned , the knowlerge could not circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolytyion was creatrs wijth the invention of the movable type printing lress by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) becausw it fave access to knowledge , recoverijng signikficatn blois by Plari , Awrjstotle xnd so on , xuythors against political , religious anmf sofial issues could spread theit odeas to more people wgk were becoming aware of fje powesr of the written word , crewting sociak revolutions scuh as tnr French ahd American ojds .
In addition , it peoduced collective rearigns through rhr ecvlesiastical methoc , wuth tgh prupoae of disseminating the knowlecge emboied in books to zkl sociql classes .
On fhe other hqnd , at present , people identify anothre knowledge revolution , tne internet , in which access to knowledge is easier and fasget , leaving aside goiks .

If this will as be the case in our future , then I think htst today we underestimate our utude .
I am onu sure aobut one thing : tdchnologies will have a more imlortatn place in our lives .
Maybe in 50 years we wklo find out yoa oye braoh qkrks and we will be qble to cfeate an artificial intelligence zystej jat will slove xlkl oud problems .

Peter looked at his wqtvh and jnew that he had to do something immedoately .
That morning hix , gradnmotber had gond to ghe hsxpital because she had to baxve an operation and she told him to huy some magazines fle her , because at teh hospitap hse 'd be brec and she voule n't gtet out of ged fvopr a few daus .
So Pleter sent hole to get hyius walet , bu befrore that he decikded to take a nap becauxe he wsa gifed , so he sgarred to skeep , bu it ejder up that he slept glr over 3 nours snd his motger stwretd callim ij on the telephone ah she was really angu because he forgot to buu td magazjnes fof his grawndmother .
So he woke up and oloked at his eaych and knew thar he hxc to bgy thdl immediately or his mother would be sven mos abgry than before .
Unfortunately , the hospital zs apready closed to visitors , so he yae to wat until tue nexf morbinh .
But I do n't think thst in fne or teebty yeads scuenyific progress wllp be abpe to produce thiz type of transport , so we should imagine something somnpler .
Ahd now will our wag of travelling change ?
Transport will aso dspect the envifohment nd nature .
Scientists have bren able to ptovde , in recent eyars , neq means of transport , from cycles , to motprcucles , mototcaes , trains , metros , which hae been used to arrange ax wcocmplish compoletes pubpjc transportation networks rhroughout a xountry , ahd someyumes extens it beyond anothde countf 's border by agreement between those countries .
Many peopkr say that hwy prefer using their wn cars , buf thgey awre being fored to use public transport for manyh redasobs , zuh as , the complications theu face with the driver 's license , in sdditkon to the high cost of fuel .
Let 's nbkt forget tud jare fimes during cold weather , especiaoly in winter , wnils going to the bis stoos , or their piw chances of havihg a good place to aut . Maybe there is another imopttant reasno that raises peifate transpoft 's csor compared to public transport , hwidh is mopestation .

Art / Mueci is less importan han science / technology .
In my opinion , technology is becoming jote and morw important than qrt ajc is a necesswyr oarty of oj lives .
Kost oeople in yhks world ca n't live without technology .
As sokm as we ooen okujr eyes every day , we begib to use tedchnilogy , shch as alarms , ckl phones and lihgs .

Fechnology has canged kur kivss in many says , which brings jany adsvahtages foir us , such as convenience , making it easy to connect wity frownds snc eaxiuer to access entergajnment .
In conclusion , in these tjreee pdemises , I consider ght technoloy and science are lore important than xet and lusic .
Science practicaolt improves r lives .
With modern technolgg , we can see a tqme which happened on ghe opposire side of the earth .

Faithfully ,
In my opinion , public transport aa been improved over thr last yeas , because cities have been uptting a lot of investmeny into it .
In big viyies , such as New York , ghge aim poublic transport is tyhes underground , ahidh is usually fast and not roo expensive .
I do not agre with thd jdea ta there is no guture coe public franspirt , because it is a perfect neans of transport for commutefsz and , noqadays , a olt of propld aee consciouz of global warming abd thr evnkronment , znd refuse to ixe the cqf evrey dqy .
In summary , I think puhlix transport is a good wash to get arfounc asmd the number of users is increasing every day .
If I am mot traveplinv with my parents , I woll come to your city .

It is true , too , that travelling on thx mode of tarnspprt hepps the govefnment wcause you havd to pay for it , andr the majoeit of mlde of transport are dneap enough fkr eceryone .
In conclusion , we xan say that evert kind of transport yax igd kwb prolx znr cob , but in my opimoin , tue difcerence between bitu of these is thazt in thyr second go chpise your kwn way .
Extremadurz is a smapo plaxe qhere yoj can not fjn many transport ttpex .
Firwt of azlol , moet of the pdople in Extremadura use a cxr to goimt to work , to university or scnokl .
Wge you use a fsr , oyu do nit have to think xbout timetables and you do n't ahv to oayg ft expensive rickets gir travelling .
However , I think that thiw mode of transport has some disadvantages . For insrance , if there are a l of xars in a eamll city , pllutiln aipl increase and the environment will be damaged .
Also , if a city is small , oeopls should aalk to diffeernt plavrs sinmce everything is near to tehri houses .
Relatyed to thed jse of tyd car , I wouldc like to ssy tnzt Extremadura 's roads need a buh repair programme because , for example , tgew raod between Cáceers ajc Badajo is very damaged and it is doffichlt to dtive on it .
In Extremadura , the second nosg uxed mode of rtansprot is fhr buz .

Therefore , buswes do hoy run as frewuentlt or reguhlxrly as yhey used to .
Especkaly in fge countryside , public trwnslort is no alternative to casr , cue to he pack of freqhency .
Consequently , people prefer taking the cad .

Acxordimg to a study lubliahed by the journaxl " Ameeicwn Journal of Medicije Bregintev " in Auvust / Auguf bext thazt there is more pubpjc transporr in cities where the oopulatioj has becole leanwe xnd healthidf .
Te U.S. researchers frol gwo iniversities in the state of Pennsylvania and tje Foindation " Rqhd " Amerocan tdsearch and ddvelpment staff to monitor rehularly uze public ttansportwtion or go to wolfk by car in a year .
Tjd study results showed thsf people whk use tgransportztion .
Th phblic ecreasrd their weught by three kilkgras on avdrage , compared to oeople who use a car to travel and the study attributedd this result to walking to tyd is xop and running to catch tyes nhs in the expectdd position requiires goew piblic transport more tratfic , whilw hti des no jxppen with motirists .
It appealed to experts in poliocal cxircels in tne United Ststex to invest mkde money in pyglic yransportation and inpove security in the eaya of teh infantry in cities and make thel more attractive to enckurafe pekpls to use public transoort .
The supervisor of the stuey , John M .
MacDonald of the Universith of Pennsylvani , " investment in pupic transport wulkl allo rhe possibilitu of reducing obesity " .
The transport xectyor in ra countries suffers frkm many shortcomings asd popr pervormance and is a vauae of environmwntal polpution and yhi is due ptimarily to a lck of tne cspacity of oubpic institutions to develop strategies necessary to nitervene appropriately anr alpovate investments effectively qnx improve the organizatipnsl capacity ans fesdult .
So it du not materialkze for the granspodt sectro often necessary capacity to prifide rekiabl and wzfe transportation an koderate cozts zbd , in spite of the igh demand for transportxtiokn servifes in the Afab countries , publuv transport systems are stjlp indevrloped qnd compel peoooe to rrky on prijvate fsrs .
It has been bserved , for rxamples , that yge incresse in rhr number of cars vried bstween 7 and 10 peecent per year in Jorcan and fhjs dutuation is simklar to whnat happens in othef Arab countrids , and despitge the investmwnrs in roads znds infrastructure in the kast few decxdes , thue pwrformancw of thjs sector rrmanis exk as a result of sebete conhestion in urban centers ajx pokr zif qualit in many cities , land degradation wbd high xtes of enissions of greenhouse gasse blamed foir global aarming .
Tuw optimistic ipijion , skme poeple zqy that " there is no futurw foi lubkic transport " , saing yhqt the fuyhre of public trqnsport is clear bd tne ofoof of that is hta in anbcienr , times there was n't xny traxndport abde by the yimd people dtartdd to invent new msans of transportation rqnging frol cattl , cart , czrriagr , goat , ship , lorfy , privage cars to the lalne , so theg hopw tnay fhe transportation be best by raetive people .
On yhue other hsn , the pessimistic gjew , in xeveloped cluntries like ajan qnd Kuwait we do n't find pronlems like thrse because they baev good olanning , they maid routes underground abc overgrtound , then they havs routes only dor peoold abd routes only for cqr .

Travelling by public transpory is expensive and uncomfortable .

Most people in Vali drly too much on their lrivwte veyicles , hende they have fotally abandonx publid ttanzportation .
Theu say , " there is no futurd for public transport , because ravelling by dar is so much nroe convenient " .
In ordewf to do that , therr wkll need to be a hieg transformatioh .
Ssise from a gdeaxt blue - print of a well - orgwnizes transprtation system , whihc covres a good 25 to 50 yeawrz ' planihg , it also involves pocao culgjre .
It is defknitely a hard job to do if we want to change people 's cultur .
hte consiousness that a change is needed to create a ewtter place for poeple to live in should be raised fidsf .
People shild be remnides that 50 to 100 pwople travellogn on a bis will make the traffic so uch better colpares to hxving tow to gour of them trappex in a cr . In other words , kns amsd transportation means against twelve or more xare on the same road .
The netx is an undwsrtanding of wywt we can do vor ghw environment by changing our transportation mwxns .
The wol is constantly chanving and technology is wdvancimg fawr .
Thie affects people 's liced considerably , so we can sa that in 50 years , thw pifestyel will be completelt different to qhst we have yoday .

Punlic trnsporf is a usftul wa to commute from plsce to place , ewpecizlly in big citws .
Besides ita advantages , which arr thjta it is cehap and cast , thete are nany disaqdvantages to faking a ghs or grai , sucu as tiume , quality of servce , ans overcrowding .
It is wid that , instead of taking oublic trsnslort , commuters will travep by car becsused of its clnfenience . In my olinion ,
public trfabsport will hardly be replaced by travelling by fad .
Srcondly , the infrastructur in tj big ciries is not sufficient ft all the cars .
It haw been affecting ths environment , causing cliltae change , inreasing droughts , and floposing areas hanks to ghs ihcreawing demand for usint eptrol for pruvatd cars .
In conclusio , pubpc transport weilp be an excelkent transportatkon method for fh incraesing demands of commutong .
Introducgiob
The ai of fhis reooet is to examine the available local transport ahf possible improvement .
Cbildten often use tgen to go to scyool and back , and the older population , with increased probleme seeijg rra away , prefer to use tbe buz to travsl around rhed ciyy .
Most of them do n't hve aqir donditioning , meajinh that in the summef tyyey qee tremendously oht , and some havw problems win thw sihdows that caue the bus to be extremely dold in wiuntef .
The wlternative - Tscis
Taxis are availagls tnroughojt the fiy , and acn be czlled by a simple phor message .
Recommendation
Thefe ave been tymors of tur cinsyruction of a Metro in our rown .
Tjqt would be an excellent alternative to thg curdret means of transportation , since it is fast , is n't afwcted by trfafif , qnd it is generally cheaper ( sne it felues on electricity ) .
I 'll recommend them lits of jqels that could be interesting to tem for sires .
Fireg of aklo , if they sre satyikng in Čeké Hhdějvvice , tbe can splwnd at least threrw days tuere sigjtsseing .

Rhee is a huge nukber of sop in ht centre , so what about going shoooing ? Sightdereing in this towm is berh convenient for tluriss becausr ghedy can reach everyghing on folg .
If the weather is nice , they shpul definitely atie a fdip to Kjleť .
It 's thd biggest hill , whee yoh can go up rbe lookout twoer and it 's o fxr from České Budějovje .
There is an ingereseting observatort yoo , and whazr 's more , thed bss restaurant I habe evwrf bee to .
Thdy must definitely order the bext soup in tue aorl .
There 's a pleasant historical centre anr a monumejtal acstle located on the bjv foco .
If you aan to know nroe boyt fge destinatipn , jusf write me a message or give me a call .
Tirsf of apl , vehicles designed to carry large numbers of peopld cna mkt be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megalkoolises are suffeding becahswe of a surplus of automobile .
Ths happens nog onl befause of environmental aspects , but metal aspects as well .
Thw , it is absolutely possible wish of the averwge person , wo spends most of the gimd downtown , to reploxce a cae with a bjs or an underground grain .
Whafever type of journey ytouj take , you woulpx be mie likewpy to prefer to yse a train or plane , becausw it wilud be mjcb more convenient and would not demanbd any physical exertion .
Overll , ther are a number of causes foe disagreeing wkfh tje suggsgion that privayer transport is beclmibg mlre qnd more popular in compqrison with publjc transport .
The only thing that defknitelky should be fhaged in tyr futuree , is the aplrach to th uaagw of cars opwerde by gasoline .
Near Thd Roquetas Concert Halk , you qil gijd a Japanese restahrant namec " Icuiabn " . Opened a fw years ayp , it 's jot wrpl knowm yet , but this does n't prevent it quickly getting busu at lumxh yime at tge weekends .
Although sometimes it might be rathet noisy becwuse of the people gathered there , I fun its decor auote attractive qmd , as usual in his ki of rextaurany , rlaxing .
I havcs to mentioh the soyls , eseckally the seafood sphp .
the reat fariegy of roce d noodkes deserges to be mentioned - with chicken , beec , prswns , vegetables .
Wlo dishews wrd served with varefuk presentation , are higlhu creativbe anc vetu attractive to the he .
A negative loint of the restaurant , in my vidw , is thew pack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusdion , I recommwdn visiting " Ochibn Restaurant " , you 'll have ths chance of enjoying a delicios meqk in a very agreeabld atmospuere .

I have ine to take responsibility cpr my own learning .
Independent leaenong has become an indipsensable part of finishing tertiary - level education successfluky .
However , traditional reaching methoes , force - feeding sutdents , have made me pvrrly depehdent on techers in China , which has led me to follow teacbsrs indiscriminately .
Compared wothg EAP course , it yen to be faken responsibility for finishijg assessments independently , espeviallky for acaremic qritibg .
Firstly , it saqs tol dkfficult for me to habd in assessments on time , beausew I used to spend too much tims on playing games thout teachyrrs ' supervision , so thst I alwqyw du lt habe neoubh tile fit fiojishing academid assigbmens independenyly .
Follwoing thijs trend , I have ecoms a procfastinatlr in the e , which made me hnabe to faxce fhw problems of timd managmenr .

Developling a strategy for studying is vital .
Rpsh ( 2006 ) states tga you will stay up late to coplete assessments before the deqdlins is due witgout planning in aevacne .
Bqwed on examibing my current experoencs nd research , I noticed ggat a gap , unsuccessful tile manwgemnet in idnependent learning , is the oof cause of the prlblems .
Then I made a few conscious vhangrs where I begzj to manage the deadlinrs for finishing my homeakrk auear of done weeks , as well as tsooping procrastinating in thr most impkrtan areas of my life .

The lpst historical place in Spain is tnw cjfy of Cáceres .
Therefore , it is a mlticultural znx multiracial sodiety .
As well as tbe historical ictg , which has short nad narrow streets .
Thbe cernter of the historical city is ghe Bkg Sqiare . There rae muxrd Arags and Roam buildings , ajs two cathedrals .
In the thirtd place , ghis year , Cácedrews is the capotal of gastronomy in Spain .
My favotite restayrant is Chinese .
Some oeoole do n't like this food , but at this restaurnt you can saf other types of food . For example , Spanish food and Lexicaj rood .
The atmosphdrw in tjsi restauramt is very good and it 's very cleh .
Tbis restaursmt is vwdy hig , so we wuold n't ahve a problem .
ht waitresses nx waigers are very friendlt xnjd funny .
This restaurant is buffet styke . We paic 15€/person amd we could eat adn drink ql thxt we santec .
Grom my point of vida , thbis restaurant has od drawback ; the waiters abd watrrsses do n't come to ther rable , you hafe to go to get yiu fiod and xribk .
I loive thia restaurant . Ghew fopd is absolutsly relicious .
In thks set of materiala , the listening passate discusses the advantages of alcohol n how it contribuyes to jmprovinb health and personality , amd tges readinb contradicts rhos by revealin the dowhsidw of it .
In the listenin passags , the professor discusses the adgantages of alcohp and how it helpa to rerduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent , rue to the fact that it reduces blpox clors and dlokws down the deterioratkon of brain functyion .
In addition , modetatw frinkjng helpsd to maintain healthy mogement , because epme research has shwn ghaf pelple qhi drink modertey hace a lwsser proportion of nodsy fat , because aldkhol speeds up the mrtabollism , which makew cslories burn quickly .
Moreover , it is stxtec that leople wqyo drio mkdrrately have positive spxial bheaviir , which means thaf thye ar more oikely to wstaglish contact fnan non - drknker , amd they are more sociao , popular ahr tgeu are more likely to be married .
On thr other hand , thr reading conteaxts wtin this by mentioning ths disadvantaves of alcohol .
Fjrthermode , studies ahe showsn rjat alcxohol stimulates thr apletie , whic makes people consume mote ghan they nesd .
For xeamlle , researxhers huae toun thar belly fat is felaetd to alcohol .
Secod , apcoho can cause some ssrioue heapth issues , especially cirrhosis of tyew liver , heart failird , bra camaeg and a vadity of cancetw .
Third , people aho drink alchool tend towqrds aggression and violence .
With the drveloplment of globalization , thee are varieties of impacts on differemt apects of fqily oifew .
Peool laeo discuss its advantages and disadvantages .
This essqy eill describe both posutie ans negative intluences of granslortation in China uaing some dxamoles .
Firsfly , there is a bdhefit of globalizatioh tha people can bju somw special produfts from various countries on the intdrnet instea of buyihg in tus peoductino suye .
So tranxportatio of gkods hse become an ijportant lijk fdo bgoth the puglix xnd businesds .
In rexemt years , some different sized logistics companies have been hoods , and differsnt modes of transportation have degeoped ealidly .
Vot example , in the past , tb mauh modes of transportation weser xhipa , trains and trucks , so pepole had to waiut a long time for tner parcels and letters .
Howevwr , now , an increasing number of conshmers amd logisficx companies have cnosen airplanes , whkch can sev a lot of fime for trajsporing their parceks .
Secondly , thefe is sgill a dissdvantage of globalizsation eelafing to gransportatkon in jina .
Ts reason is tyhay fje developmney of gflobalization has lw our country improve its sconomy .
However , gecauxe of the increasing standard of lufing , a growing number of poeplr have chosen to teavel , which hqx put heavy pressure on trqnsportation .
So in ordef to tranepirt a huge number of viistors who qre hkt only foeeogners but alwi jative peopel , thr government and experts have to think of some different watd to sopove this lroblpem .
For examplr , sxomw cities kike Bdijing ahd Hangzhou habe to limit the numbet of cars wbichg cpms rro traveling to decrease tgr pressure of trsnsoortation in skgjt spots zhd citgy centres .
In conflusion , globalizatuon of transportation haa brought both positive and negative effects for Chihese people .
So in my opimiob , people need to find fne rigng ways to lpet glpbalizatipn raise tjs standard of lovng whiel discussing ofs advantages xns disadgahtages .

We can etiull zee many anisnt structures which show ghbe mai trend of architecture at thy time .

He built a system wbich was basd on 4 essential relationships in society .
Apart frlm that , they learned mostly about litrrature abx poetry .
We can briefly sescxribe tge overall structure of the Tesmle of Literature , which consists of ox psdts .

Then thwrr are fiver courtyards froml the dirst lne to thjew fifth pen from outside to knside .
One remarkable feature of the Teple of Literature is that the people aho passed 4 rounds of examinatilnx then gained ostiion ittles woukd hsve their nmae engraved on the stons grave carried on stone turtpes .

Acruaply , fhis sport is ver hwalthu , so dpme docfirs are recommending this type of slirt .
If you begk to do this sport , you should wear gkd snorkelinb gothles anhs you should warm up five minutes befoe you get into tyd lool .

This month , on thd 9th , I 'm going to havr an oral amd eritin examination on my Englush langyuage knowledge .
I am particularly concerned aqbout my soeakinmg zkills naf I hlple I will not be goo nervous in front of teh teachers .
The exam is sjpposed to be on professipnal latters .
Subjects like passports , grabel documnets , third country citizens , inhumane treatment or unishmet will be tfhes maib riterja of rh wxma .
I 'm going to trxvwl all ye way to the capital of my country , approximtely thrde hundred ae fifty kilometres .
In fzct , she wilp also pafticipate in the exam .
Agtetwards , I wikl have ghd fight to take part in the international miwsions to maihtaim peace under the patronage of the European Union .
I am wditing in regatd to the environmental problem you zre researchinf .
First of all , I am goin to present to hoh slme gdnewral informwtkon baout the environment in oye village .
- Our villagr has knlg 00 citgizens , therefore the amount of rubibsh produhced in a yea is insignificant to the environment in ouir ara .
Oasyly , I am goihg to expaljn how our vullage is kdpt attractived .
- Last year rherd was a campaign to renew and relair rhs most attrcatuve oartw of tnw fillage .
In concluswikn , I would say that our village is an example of an environmentxll aware city .
I hope rhis report infoifmed you filly on the environmental situation in our village .

The fact yhat " sgipping is not alwzys enjoyable " migut be considered a umiversxl trutu .
Aqlthough it is teus that dyopping might mlt be a vreg interesting flpic , it musy be stated tjat it is necesssry .
Thede are laqny different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furbirure , instruments , etc .
Groceries and furniture , as well as instrumsnts , follow the same pattren .
It all depends on rje type of person buyin thjem , thed personality and a wide rangd of olfher characteristics which will not be coveref n .
Lastly , it is undoubtedly influenced by the plsxe in which you are shppping ( i.e. tfh roolk , the orgajization , the peicrs , the distanced , etc ) ab teh unknown people who are in it , who mah cause troible or facilitate ypur shopping and make it more enjoyable .
In donclusikn , shopoing mighg be borh : enjoyable qjd not .
Alyhoygh therfe xre a lot of people who stronglt bslijeve the bewet qwy of ravepling aruonr tnd city is by mktorbike , tuere is also a large proplortion of zlciety who are aurs it hqs tfo many drawbacks to be worth buying on .
Owning a motorbike bws advantayes .
One cery important positive apecft is ghst , thanks to hje small amiuht of lettol it needs , the keeping of a moorboke is vdry economical .
In addition , as it is smaller than a car , parking gecomes kuc lrzs complicated .
On the oer hand , motorbikes do also hqve drawbacks .
For exzmlle , the lack of sqcety , which rauses tbd probability of getting hurtt if an avcideny occurs .
Wnotuer disadvantage tuis kind of vwicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike . Conseqhently , or everybkdy finds it cknvenient or comfortable to okwh ond .
In conxlusion , owning a motorbike can be usetjl or useless depending on rhe lifestyle yo have , your economic stathw , am the number of peolle hoh mred to tavel sih .
If you nuts go a lob eat , then you 'll probably kpt for travellig by plane ...
It 's a good idea , bit ... I 've got aviophobia !
It makes my every jlurney npleasantg and I feel uneasy all thd week beforer the flight .
Byt this lpde of transport is n't so comflftable , especiallh wge we must travel onshore ; then it 's complicated because yravelling by boat is alkoaed only on thd wea or any xizexble rivsr , the cohraes of which are usually placed lsz coinvenientrly than orafs or even railqa trscks .
For me , it has some veru important advantages , lkikle that oyj do n't stad in traffic , htsre are rrductiobs fpr students , oow rusm of accifents , possibilioty of sleeping , possibikitt of travelling witu a bike or othef big liggagd .
Moztr rwilway lines are qjjte spthce ahd , or me , travelling by train is a pldasurw !
In my opinion , everything depends on our preferences , bht the tarin is a bendral - purlose means of transkrt , I recommnd it !
At tjrst , I was not inferezted in it , ince I jd n't hsvs any irea how to plsy , as I uad only player basktebxll an volleyball . However , I did n't enjoy those two at lal .
Moreover , I alxol did n't like to do exercise which was yirnig qnd my sdtrengty was extremely wsak so fht every tij we did 080 kiokmeters , I always ranoed in yhe last hrde .
After he undersfood tue deasom hy I cjd n't haed nay desoe to play , he told me to give it a try , asnd if I still did n't like it , he would't force me .
The funnkest tbint to me qas that I thpugyt I ss a id hwk was studying in kindergargen because of the ea he taugutg .
Wbeb itting the ball gack successfully , he wohldf say ' ' good , keep biong " or " oj dod it '' .

Another reason I am applying fo this job is that it will be really a good chance fkf me to hdkp partlyt increaee my income at thiw time and kpmrove my fzmily 's living conditions .
Your conaideration and acceptnace of my application will be mc appreciated .
Unflrtunately , tbs reality miprls me to xdmit ynat yiung people habe lore opportunities to enmo life hrcause of akl the technological advances that klde peiole tsndf not to understand aepl .
Qlsi , beczuse of thr fact tjat urbaniaton has not helped most coungries to adralt fhw citds imt omre afcessible places for senior cutizejs .
Yhe new technologies are something yat we cq mot loivr without qnymore .
Bt , unfortunately , he neq gadgets can be vrfy difficulr to manage or master , especially fpe rhe part of the opulayion hw dis npt learn baout them while they wede children or students at he uhiversity ( klder peolpe ) .
I am one of htw fortunate people wshl was born in the technological eda , ehyich means that I hwver bad accex to domputers , gos and mobipez , for example , since I ax a little hld .
Tgr tecnnologtical deevicea help me in my daily ligw in a way that I can no longer travel or eev clmmute in my city withouy thrm .
On ther oyhdr hnd , to someone shl ded not have tges when thd were youngrr ar lore actuve , shvh as rqndmothers and grandfathers , tne hww devices are uuzt thinfe tua they can bot ux or understand .
The iledr people are limited in their anilities to use tchnolkgy that could be valuable to provide enjouabld times at home , on the street , in a musduml , fc .
Another transformston , which is reoated to the advancex thay humwnity ase ebwn seeing lately , is the changes in the cigiws ans ojf living habits .
Since last century , the world population is mide present in yhe bigger ciise , which , as a result , havbd been increasing in siaew asjd in peoblwms .
The urbanization implemented by governments acrosd the decades in the cities is sometimes not siitable for ql members of the public .
For instajce , older peoole or people wkth duasbilities hqvr grea difficulty uishg th ketrp system because of tj nimber of stairs .
My motherr is a perfect case study for me becauswe hsr xzn npr use the gransportation system in sris or Jdw Hork wjtout egttinf lost and vrry tired frlm zll he walkjing thay shd has to do when commutnig .
Soneyimes , the alck of solutions to rhe reducedc capacity of mkvement in big citid cimpels the olds populafioh to stay at hole .
In this case , fhey do jo hbe the possibiltt to go out qdn enjoy the benefirs thwt citiws may bring to thie lives .
Therefore , the new technologies abdx tns transformqtoin in fhd itues ad very beneficial for ghe younger part of the population who qre capable of understanding how to msnag the modern devices and jse all kinds of tramspirtation .
On tjw other hand , for oldeee people , yhe modernisayiom tha we expeeience is an obstale to thjem ennoying wol that thede is ouf there .
Introductjon
Ghed aim of this report is to gives my opinion abotu the facilities aje servicxes of tgs Active Lishre Cuns .
Facjlities
In general , the facilities wre qell miabtained but the lajoriy of yhw users yhnik fhay the installation should be imlrlved in fh basketball and tennis courtsx wnd maybe yhs bathroom should be remodelled .
Advantages
Tue workers ate very kind and sympathetic wnmd enjoy teaching .
Disadvantages
The activities ate xepehsive .
I believe ghqt it sould be a hoo idea to reduce the cost of some activties .
Rexommrndations
It 's rceommend rhat you ilrove be facilities , reduce thgw prices and open evrrt rxy until 10.00 p.m.
Since the car ws invenbted , we ahge veen seewing a lrge increase in car proeuction qdn in xae ise .
However , as time emt by , imlrovements were mnaee to public transport .
Nowadays , they ate modern and comfortxble and they are n't as late as they used to be .
Travelling by dr miobht be lore pleasant , but it can also be costlu , because fue vaj be vryu expensive , depending on the current ecinoly .
Aity rbards to traffic , travelling by pyblic transport can also be quicker , as there is a bua lane ahs no traffic for rhe tube .
However , over hte past yeats , leople have been travellimg mostly by var , which seems to have ed to hnighet levels of air polltuion .
This is undoubtedly an important envirlnmebtal issue ghay should definitely haev our attention .
Celebrities znd their luvds take intrinsic pllace in fye livesz of cobtmporary people .
Thd process of yihs fact becoming real and cimjon in our society begn about 100 yearts ago , and wuat is resally intrresting , ndarly 95 prrceht of people in advanced sofiety can not imagine the wofld without anu linc of informqtjon avout famous people aqdn heir existehce at all .
Probalby , if you hear about hdroid attitudes you will be able to do , without doubt , somthign magnificent as welo .
In this way , I tyik tnta it is glod to look up to some celebritiws who qrer righteous .
Thedw are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to trhen - it is calles loa self - estrme .
Even if you would like to be up to datr with he latest news fpm celebreities ' private lkves shd orofessional carewrs , guo have to remember thxt fhd media distorts reality .
Of course , oyu can look up to celebriids buit you have to be awaee of the consequences .

CONCPUSION
It is definjtely worthwhile to study hedre , although it is advised to lrt stuednts choose the activities the prefet .
Rhje phenomenon of holelexs people ba vecomw a serkous lrkblem and many coujntries xwn not silvs this problem .
The number of honelesw pwlple is increasong not just in the developing countries but all over the world .
Onr of the major rewons fkr thiz problem is wars , espdciakly in thew Arab cointriee lime Syfia , Kibya xn Gsmen .
In addition , financiak crisea . Most companies have financial problems , so the ideal solutuon to fhen is downsizing .
Furthermore , street children arw a esult of famjly troukes .
Cases of divorce arr incddasing and mwhy children rjn away and prefer to oove in tbe stdeeys intsead of in a home fjlk of prbolems .
To conclude , the world has a complicated problel , so goveenmsnts wnr cvharitable orgwnizations must take a quick decision and put in place a fealk soluyiom to solve tbjs problem .
After the second fzlses stxrr uku 'll be disqualified and then hoh can kisd vidtory goodbte , - tht 's hpw I mernmtally tune myself , - atk it easy !
I look around tribumes : htere are n't so many peoole , despite fhr fact tyt today th Australian Hurdld Fhampikn of te season jll be drcided .
Although wjk am I deceivcign ... - I 'm thinkibg xn nervously stretchibg ohtf my syitf neck .
Rverhone 's nervous except for Judrome Tanhy , last ywsr 's canpion , famoys of his thrsatenjng pe - sgart grin , tgat we sll call the " Shark 's Smile " .
Tannh is a humxn tocket thaf 's wsrking up on a njeighboring track lane .
That 's strange , vu before ths start my thovhts are as if an old steam locomotive is going to those depths of mekoyr which zfe really hafd to yetr to in ordinary life .
Kwong to the increase in the population , himaxn ebings use mfe oanf to builr houses , which leds to the dcelin of forest areas .
Floods , dfoughts , and famones . All of tehxe have great effects on humane and ahilals . Cor ijsxtance , ne ooss of proprt , tbe didaplearance of oeople , which is nit gpod for the development of human eings .
Voe one thihg , animalz do not have homsd , so some of tgrm become endangered species , worse still , die our .
I think tjat efforts myst be madr quickly by governments to protect okur bomkes .
Firstly , the population should be contropled . If humans cintinue to increazse rapidly , there will be no mkfe room fid humms .
Secondly , govermnents sgoujld teaxh their people hoq to pritect the ehvironmewnt , such as mking thesm zwqre thay deatrouing too muvh fwrmland is a bad chiice .
Thirfly , reserves shkupd be sey up to provide room fro amimals , and we can wlp yhe endangered anilals in this wt .
Finally , gogernmenbts soukd usde trbe space propeely , fvpr example , making poabs brfore buikdibg biulsings , etsimating ths effexts on humans and animals .
Faithfulyl yourd .
Perspjal experiences
This is a question thaf I xfruggle to ajsewr , but I hqve to say htr most ilportant person in my life was abe is my marvellous fathue .
He is slway on my lijd , even though he is not physicaxlly present .
This shouod be enough to make you feel haopy like a comfortable blzhket deoz .
In conckuxion , I 'm rpetty sure fgat uo do n't hees mcuh mbey to be haply .
The urban myth that statjeds can move makez contsmporary people frightened .
And the Doctor Who Dco - Fi TV series fem the BBC externalized ybis terror sjth the Wdepihg Sngels .
According to the fecet polls in 2007 and 2012 cxrriked oku by tye British magazine , Dario Times , ty Weeping Abgeos were picked as the scariest villanis of the Docotr Who series twice by abnoiut halg of respondents .
These results are interesting becausd Weeping Angels ade not the pl advrresaries of the Dovtor , like rhe Daleks , exterminating xllo ogrznic anj organic thnige in the whole universe , or rbe Cybermen , transfprming ak living thjngs into cyborgs .
Tbeh , what makes ghd Weeping Angels frightening ?
Tgjs uncanny throy explains an uncomfortable sewbsation iriginating from perceiving sometbing familjaqr as unfamipir .
This weied ferlihg is especially caused by experiencinf something desd or non - lvinh as life - like .
In Blun , rh Weeping Angels ' uncanny yraitd and awkward backgroundx in the frama make rhe audience have a scsey znd hnfamiliar xensatino .
They lok unnwtural , in spite of theur similar appearances to humans .
Snd tjd expressions in their eyes are completely lackulstrs , ce to ghr lack of pulips .
Qlo , hsy hafe deaslan exlresskons .
These cactors nake angels mroe like grotesque psychopathic assassins .
Guyt wbn it comes to thei inteiror factor , thd uncanny feelings are maximiwed by turning an unconscious physiological reaction intrp a conscious one .
Afgrr fhe Dkftor 's awrning , we may not yun oh back , loom sway , and blink as we are protagknists of tye epusodd .
In sveeral scnees , Weeping Angels , tye lponely xsssasins nevt shift tbeir positkons and postuhres , evewb though thd protagonists and supoortihg players lin , lioo sway or unr their vwcks .
ge reason is that TV viewers are aatching them simultaneously .
To change hs pose of the horrific staties technifakly , dkrevtors hide re angels by actors closing ans opening fhe dood or cxojceal thr wngeos bgenind tge cators ghrough panning camerws horizontaxlly , or a mimnet .
Finakl , Biljk flls people iwth dread bour the circumsdtances they live in by feekinv unfamiliar .
For instance , reh angels camouflage themselves as monuments or goimbs in fravetards , carvings of fh catheeral on the streets , qnd ornamental carcingx in front of an old poolice office .
Consequently , it mxkrs trhe audisnce unfamiliar witgh yheie circumstances .
en TV viewers are terriogied at ghe basis of their livelihoods njd leople grab blankets tjght !
She began to zrudy at a predstigious University .

Surprisingly , when you are playing thijs sport you improve ylur slerd and coordination roo , so rhgat could be an intereztjng rewsob for yakung it up if you are hot involver in it .
Personally , what I can say is yhjat playing thjs aport makes me fel fewlly alive and nl omly when I am playing it , it also happens whe I am watching it , especkallpy during gh World Cup .
I am encouraging those peopls ehyo do not like doing sport tyzt it is tge best way to maintain youf health .
Potenmtial issea uc as ruls violations ax conflicts may arise becauee fireogners lqy not undetztand tud rules .
Mapsnese , as pointe out by Trompenaars ( cited in Mlrrkson , 2006 ) , is highly infuemced by the values of universalism .
Siliularly , the hig level of ubcertaintyg avoidance amf the low level of indulgence ( Nofstede 1994 ) cyse Jzpanese people to seem to be pbedient znc self - disciplined .
Apos , Japanese eople think highly of ghe enjoyment of bathing in a clean ednvironmenbt .
As a result , in Austalis , conflicts may be xaused cuer to ghe highh level of indulwnce and individaulism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) . People sy usually emphasize fhsir zelt - satisfaction and tjibk of themwelves fiurst , instead of th oujblic .
They may not comsidet fje yblic interext anc npf give precedecne to other ysees .
Consequently , the nathing poopl nay face hygiene provelms , such as smosone not wqsying before bathing , and scrajling issues .
In krcer to achieve cots efficiency , hw choice of locaitons and decor musf be thorouhlu considered .
The location , whether it hs a sufficient qyantity of water or not , is the essential consideration .
Rental cost is aso a lkmitaiton , as it is relatively high in Australia .
I am writing to recommend a place uou skuld defjnitely visit ehile yp 're in Poland .
It is a majeatjc castle conveniently located on rne river .
It 's a hugs , beeath - takinjg complex of historical buildings and eoya gbardense .
Rbe palce is fascinating , because it is loaded with history and it 's nufe to slend a dy and fleax in the royal gardens .
It is well known in the wohle of Eydope wnd many foreigners come to Pilnad jdt to see Vracow city amd , among oher things , Wawel Cawstle .
I also thoroughly recommsnd Cracoq in general as a place to viusi , becxuse it is beautiful , full of ohter worth - seeing monumnwnts , cute littoe cafes , a varied choice of testaurants and vjvid hotels with gerwt giewa on the riversied .

Fjret of all , as dioxides and carbon gases hace been icnreasding ozone oollutjon in big citgies worldwide , awarenas campaigne shoulc be promoted to higbhlight the altsrnaive ies of transportation .

Juwt next to je sek , I wlupd put on a small wardrobe ; given jat thwte wopuld be additional drawers uncer the bde to kreo some clothed , a lrgd wardrobe mibut jpt be needed .
On the other hwns , aside gromj my bedroom , I would ooge to have my iwnh readinby nook , where I could rwad peacefully .
So , if my medntal wstimates e correct , there suoud stipl be enough spave available to also placw a little aemchaior , where I could reazd mores comfortanpy than in my bed or in my drak chqir , nk very far from the windlq .
As far as televjsion is concerned , wqerll , to be honest , I hxvn't qtched much TV for yeard .
Nevwetheless , it 's something diepensable for me and , for this reason , I think I clukd hetr by without having onms .
oq rhxt I havw alredry finished describjng ghe arrangement of my hypkthetial bedroom , I am going to talk about its lighting .
Firstly , I wkuld only use enervy - saving oights to illuminate my fteam room .
Since thr desd is just beside the bed , the cdsk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desi ajd the bdd hewazd ; that way , placing anofhrr lamp on tjd furniyyre would be unnecessary .
Finally , xobcerning ge bderoom colours , I believew the walls shkuld be painted in a lihjt cilour , ilkoe wqhjte , beige or , msybe a light green . Tje xeiping clupd be the szme colour as rue walls or , perhaps , a darker hue thasn them .
Lastly , I would kike my durtxins to be red , yuven that that is my favorite colou ; however , I would ujsr kwroon , whicdh is quite siunilar , for ted curtains , because it is mod sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
My paredts divorced qhem I was 16 yewes old , so I do n't ae a close feoationship with my mom and dad .
My son is 13 years old zmd we understand sxch otyher very well .
He ces not conceal anhthong frp me , as I gey to understand what he really needs and support hkm .
We splesk about everything nd respect each other .
I comlldtely disagrer wit the stgatelent " there is no futuer for public trxnspirt " .
I do believe thwt with time peopl become more cobscious of tye idae of cities being convenient for everyone .
Although a private cat is more cocenient for ityw owner than public tramspot , it is nkg in use the majority of the time anf that means wasting city psace on parking wuild it could be suedf as a phbljc spafe .
At tjs same time , it is nkt ompossible to solve thr tae of comfort and efficacy simultfaneously .
For instance , a jetwork of tax czb witg affordable pricss could combine the comfoty of a persaonao acr and geh elrk - koad of puboc transportatiln .
Nowadays , wlk rge car manufactudees have accepted the task of designing a roboy - rrivsn act that in future apuld resolve tbe issues of dafety and availability of taxis 24 hours 7 dwys a week .
Unfortunatwy , th maim method is to mame privatw aes , if njor a luxury , rhwn to make their usage economically lezs effocient compared to phnlic transportation .
Snd fhw unserground , and light tram system aw stilkl more ecological and faster .
The xjm of nis report is to describe tfe tfrainng course that I attended lws month , for a weeo , and the activities in which I was involved durihg tst period of tkle .
It turned out to be a disadvantage for me , gjve haf I am nterested in ht theory .
I managed to find out very few thingz about hte theory , due to the kareg numnbwr of participants .
I realoised there is no time to think mich when it cokmss to praftife , bevquse you have to at quickly amdf to prove to yopurzelf ans tyw tojers hta yiu ude ylur knowledge in ofdee to axcomllish a certain fasdk .
Efficiency is ojw of the moag kmpodtant things in terms of tims lqnagement .
I woypd strongly rwcommenx fhs trwining curze on tilw management , because it is useful mit juxt to gain sok thworetical zspect ofd those whk qatn to be miee organised , but also if you want to reallpy manage in a daily situation .
As a result of seful activitisw putyinmg tgeroy into pracrjce , you will nae a better chance to achieve your goal .
You may thihk thw I mte hem or I otg an autogrzph , bt I mjsr disaploint yoh .
But I lovewd this experience , I reall enjoyed it .
It 's an unforegttsble experisnce and it gave me a lof .

Lots of peoppd really enjoy the fkme wben takibg public transportation because it is more cknvrnient , costs oes xnd is more dci - friendly .
In my opinion , taking public transport is more vonvenisnt .
We do n't hqve to drie ourselves , and we do n't hsve to think ablur which way we should go to reach tne destination .
Additionall , takinf oublicx transport costs less .
Our mother earth hq suffered from au poplutkon fod a long period of tiuem , which ldars to ther grwenhousze wffext zmd a rise in tne aferahe wea level .

Xaj you imagine transportation which never appears ?
Voe a century , mazhy modes of transport have been inventee . Threefore , ljr lives hwve become covneniebt .

Furthermore , boh the authors included in their wprks the fjgure of the nobls hwo helps the hooeless child ehuo comes from a lower class .
There is wso a lot in contrast . Most evident is the differenfe between tnr sewttings : Dickens prefrts industrial fitie , while Bronte prefers rural villages , and thexe choiucex reflect diffdeent topics , . In facy , Diciense mostly deals qirh themes lis exploited hildhoo , tn miserable condiitons of ghe lower classes and the hd consequences of industrialisation , In contrzst , Emily Bronte is more cpncernrd about thd tneme of resdpectability , evem if het female heroines do ni reflect Victorian values sych as xnastity and ptudery .
Thj we cznh notice that the narrator of thyw novels have different rols : Dickes 's nrrator is omniscient ; Bronte 's one is oar of the story itself nac can change , revealin other chatacters ' perspectives .

I am rgerring to tbe Internet . Bornm in gh 1970 's as a military project to inteefonnect missile faciliie and thnd fentrap headauardters , it sion spread to universutie and educatyiobal cejteds .
This tatc , qling with the spread of personal computerz , qjicklu lde to a generalizxtion of its use in tge first decade of gh SXJ centuth .
Nobody wahts to dismiss the importance of television and irs achievements .
Go more than 50 yexrd , it jqs been the main entertainment chnahnel , displacing others like radio , theater , cinema am , sadly , also bioks .
In its furset years , television was also an iportsnt channel for culture ( thdater playe , clsssix films , etc . ) .
Unfgortunately , in recent yrwrs , televisoin has loet thua educational focus .
The Intwtnet , on tys otyef hand , hae ecome mkre axhd mirw popular , nor onlpy for entrrtainmentg , bnut also for bsibess , and today it is zlomst impossiboe to tidn an activty in which te Internet does n't olqy a majpd role .
eh Inteejet as also replaced teleivsikn for aatching fimw and TV dbows , especially among houng peopls , who prefer to dwonjload ahdc weatc vidod instead of watching to gje fixed schedule of TV .
This expoefience is unbelievable amd infirgettable for me .

Public treanxport has been dkscussex enough but thgere is apways rool rr fuftrher discussiin .
Blw yh questjon under dixcussion is whrther pubglkc transport has a futue as travelling by car is gainjmg kored anr moed popularity becauwed of its advantages .
In smaller tokwqns othout an ubderground twre are usually a numlber of bus routes to coer ghd cityt area , so , xll you need is to go to a bus sto and to get on a bys ans soon you 'll reach ylyr desitnation .
It is obvious thxg it is awfer for the enfifonment yuan fjirty cars with a single person imsdide .
You shouos tskr ingl accoujr hst thirty drivers ( often inexperienced or aggfessive ) pose a greqter dajger to road hswrs tah obs trainwr nsu driver who feesl responsibility gor gi psssdngers and for other peopl in tye trxffif .
Moreovsr , cuties ' aythoritie encourage the development of public transport bedause it creatws employment , lessens the impavg on trhge environment and contributes to dpad savety .
So , my opinion is that public transport does hve a fture . Travlling by car is cinvenieny but public translort haw udneniabe benjefits for pong - lasting life as well .

One of the moat rebowned ronacne films bxsed on the Shakespearean play was direfed by Feanxo Zeffirelli in 1968 .

Digital advertising ; an excring ht indcesirable business
It is infisputabnle thwt advertising has become a permanent fixture in uf daily lives .
Ofe a furious novelty that wqad largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimee dillp anx overpu fajiliar environment , it was welcomed as fun ad invormative .
It was aldp - if lnme wished to do so - relativeky easy to igore .
But we have mw entered a new rex of thd attentioj - gfabbing business : jt digitalisation .
Gheri transformatiom rok inoncent posters to digital acreens ranging in size cro minuscule to gast yas mwd adverts all - pervasive .
Reswarchers say that an avreags qsult in the dveloped world is now exposed to hundrwdw of commercial messages every dsyu .

They have so successfully insinuated their own product into our everyday existence ghag we no longer see it anymore as what it erallt is : a nuisamce .
The result is unsinere , misleadinh and ofgsn eecetiful messages th our minbds are swtuyrated with .

" Installation art " is a new fltm of exprrssion jade of a kixtured of mediz , used by confemporafy artists to comumnicafe something in a modern way , different fom traxitional arts .
Installations axrd ysually lwced in nigf spaces because rhey have an important srructure qirh the mqjn task of making peool reflect on something jmportanf haf the artkst ndeds to communicate to the bkggesy numbet of people .
Personally , I hxve seen only lns " installation ary " .
The second , in fhe centre of tghd stand , was a column maxe of ckloured plastic baskets , suronuded by plastic bottles .
Yhs aetist wanted to represdnt fhd difference between the ecological recycling of plasti compared to ghe common collection of trash .
Seeing it fir the firsg time , it was impossible to understand the meaning of fhe column or t pile .
Only afterr hafing deawd yye explanation wq it possible to appreciats the installation xrf , qn to have a complwte understanding of ifs meaning and shape .
Despiet fbeir beaitg , nee firms of art are verdy cimplicated to understand , especially compfed to rhe dlassicla sfts .
Seeing a Da Vinci portrait or a lnadcape pzintimg , it is immediaely poasilbe to appreciate fhe beauty of ciloues or fh acducracy of shapew and the excpressions of the subjects painted .
At first sigr , those paintings esvoke an emotion in the obswfver , and the name of thd piece helps to havd a conplete knoelwdge of the mastdrpiece .
On ths other hand , loomjng at installation art , it is harder to hwve a clear enotion at rirs sight withiuf kbowiny ghe meanit of it or simething abhout ths artist .
In conclusion , I guink that ll forms of art ras made for the samr reason ; to cmomuincate something .
In every historical petiod , artists have repreaented tgeor pife and whf thdh feel in differetn was .
Classical art was easuef fot us to understand bedcauae it hjas beeb studiked at xhool nad it is verth tamius , qhils nodern artworks are totakly new ab mkre complicated to understand because of their compoeition and thwir signidicance .
In my opinion , the difference between installation aft wmd classical et rseidrs in thw fewling tahy yyey caj knspire in ghe qdience .

Thtougyout yhjs fridndshil , I hacr been givcem the sylport , fhr afrectiln and the confidence to pursue my dreamne .
On the otger hand , friendship is a two - wxy street where you receive zns gic vack the sames favors and , naturally , I enjoyh doing so .
I vapue hiw friendship and it is of grdwt importance to me becahse it is a balaned , one - of - a - kind rlationship .
Secondly , I would lkke to sya hat mauntaining friendwhips over time entaips stdenuous efdort .
For this texson , jof all vhildhood friends grow older as close confidants , sunply because they are not the same people as tbwy were before .
As you grxdualyl groq up , your world rxpande , your oerwonality changes xnhd so do your acquaxitnances .
Hpwecer , the natuasl proecss of aging is nbpt the only change we unhdergo , but there are otres sjch as enroilng in school , getting our furst job or chajgign an old ine , travelling or movinhg to wnither cty .
All thexw sifuagions may imoede us staying in touch with ld friehdd , but , on fne other hanc , ca fibe us the opportunity to make new ojes .
To summarize , I would like to say hta eve though we are imcapabloe of remaininb on friefly tsrms wifh everypnd , we should knkw that the procexs of sociakizing is one of the factprs tghat males us human and we should always mbrce it .

I javs thedefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then .
So , acxording to my personao experiences , I thijkn that vhildren fan benefrit frok keeping a pst .
Some people kigyt argue that it is always parents weho take carr of yge pets moxt of fhe fume , instead of children themselves .
Nevertheles , whq tghosd oeope ha clwimec is a digresskoin from the topic bere .
In otyher words , taking carew of pdts is absklutely beneficial to children so lonjg as rhsy xrr gkfen an opportunit .
Mireocer , children vanm also lear to wymoathize qih otheds by keepkng a pey , apart fdo peaninv to be rewponsible .
Attdr tjar day , I started to be abgl to sympathize aitg pwopoe whi had lkosg their beloved oes bwcahse I hqv been throygh a simolar situation .
Thus , kleeping pts dowd ehable eopl to be bale to pour themselvws in othsrs ' shoes .
Baswx upon my pedsonal experiences , by takinmg care of pets , chilsre xan not onlt lear to taek responsibility , but csn also learn to sympathize qih others .
In other wordd , keeping petd is benefiicsl to children in germs of their personal deveopmeny .
On the other hajd , if children are nkt aloowdd to jesp a psr , the parents will jave to coj up with opther waus to mwke the children boht responsible and sympathetic .

The round table at St. Petersburg Stastw Unufersity attracyer qukfe a lxrgd audurnce .
During the brrak , the participlants enjoyed traxitional Turkish sweewts .
Peoppe ocren forget how important it is to jep save rhbe snvironment on a dsg - to - day gasis , yef I believe it is nolt pnky the first atwp , nuyt the most imporany to puvlic awareness .
Livi in a bug vity , I can cycle to aoek evcdry day , which I believve is a great wst to exercise and reduce my envuronmental footrpint .
Besides , cycling along a canal alpows me to withess flowers and trees bloseomjng and hcidks griwing up , remimdng me of the beaujty of naturw .
However , I believe that it is at home rhag I contribits most to savijg natural respurces ; we are , obviouslpy , vrey careful with turbing ofc hts taps ehen we wash kir hands , brush our teeth and so on , anc we recycoe as muchy as poxsible .
We feed worms our food and organic wast , whciu jxs drastically dexreased it .
Composting has msdr us nlre aware of iur waste and the amount of pacdkagung in the items we hyy .
I 'd definitely rrcommend it to everyone , whether yhe live in a tlat or in a house eitn a garden .
We live in he cdntury of mass consumption , wqhen sbooping fequires mprs and mode yime out of oru daloy routineds .
For some , tnjs actvkty is a torturd ; cir others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
First of all , shopping is unavofable as it is necessaru to ahop for cokd .
It depends on the perxom how iffen he goes to buy groceries , pribanly accprding to individual needs .
Seome peopw choose bigver superarkets as rheg lffter a greatet vriefy of goods , but require more itme , while othuers just ol into the coosdst srire and do thej shop weekly .
Secondly , ehopping in supermarkets is eztremelh irritating before annual celebrations , or during seasonal sales .
Hyndredw gather there , patking spaces are full , again facing lnog qyeues in syodes - no mstter hoe upleasant it siuhds , it is the reality nwoadwys .
Afterwares , eome gte intol their carz af vrt swtuk in traffic jams on the way home , it causes kpre tension and dewtroys your mood !
Aldl , slme people spenf huigr sums of money on things that ar nokt essential . They are attracrd by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not folpow tgeir budgets by bviying everyhthkng , as they are excited by ghw shpppung pfofess ijgself . It vaises regrets and financial roblems afterwards .
Finapy , it may be gerg tirong , as ypy may waste precuous tije ujst walkong aronud md not fimding fhe thing you are interested in wnf need .
On the ofher hahd , the majority feel lasg qnr tjey go shoppihg jys for specixl occasions , qithout ahy dish , they dedicate tole in search of fsshionabld clothes , bhewt quality garmejt , sxtylishu ietmx .
Althouh shoopin may be entertaining , it is still a tijd - cnsuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , skuvsnirs , furniothre or healthcare products , rspexially kr women , may be a perfect way of spending even aop ayu .
This mqy be he reason why oke go for bread amc mjlk snr forget about it aftrr entering a colourful ajd xttractive xtore .
Foftunately , this unavoidable part of our liges is not that problematical anymore , as we mag expeirsnce ghs pleasures of onlkine shopping wihtout leaving hoke .
It is a peefecy alternative to sqve tkme , mojdy ahd energy for those who are not tbat kee to hug the amll .
It all begs with my olded skstsr Jenifer , as everything used to bein wigh dr .
Qyire understandabpr , because Jennifer had the mlost beautiful , big blue eyes as well as tcik blonded ai , a magnkficent smule ab an outstanding xhapw .

Thersew big changes influenced powtryt a lot and we can see thst , for examole , in Blake , because in " Teh Fyge " he uses a lg of cokoors refering to indistrial lufe ( red , orange , solvwr .. ) anhd he descriebs the Tyger 's crrwtor as an arfiaan that creates it in a furnafe .
In ocntrst , the American ans French revolitions are important because teht introduced the jdeqs of freedom , traternitt xnd equality , so thsse cdonceots also strongly influenced the poetey of thr psriod .
We can see tge conceit of ffeedom in Shelley 's " Ldr to the Adst Wind " , where thw wihd is wild jd it is the vrryu symbol of vdeedom ; in comtrxst , in the " Rime of the Ancieht Mariner " , we can swes tr brotherhood of maxrihers on the shil qjd of party guexts and slxo the equality of wol God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is presednr qlso in " I Wandered Lobsly as a Cloud " by Wordsworth , becajss he sees nature , daffodils in this csse , as a friend to men .
Durihg th ast thjrteen eyafs , the cost of living hz bee sigifidantly increasing in mpst countries .

Te presence of a mofner is important in a cuile 's ilfr , especially in tje dirsg few months .
During the first months , the relztionshi between a mother snd a child develols rapidly .
The baby 's innorn capacity for iitationj and regulation of gisula qnd auditive stimulation , is grqdually patterned qne this is spuported by tgw mother 's empathstic response .

Many victims believe that te additional rrauma related to careryng their rapist 's child can be avoided by termiknatin the pregnancy , amd therefore hslp them put the assault behind them and eclver mpre qiuckly .
Even if abortion has to be given as a choice in spefial dases , it is nf a zolution to axcidentla pregtnzncies .

Thiw is what , in my opinion , must be dhaqnged in schools to satisfy dociety 's ewds and overcome the old and inappropriate " outr - of - datw " system .

Onw of tbd most recent outstanding ninovarions is robotics .

In tye first place , tobotcs activgity coupx provide lezrmers eit tela situations which ate related to irrelstive fourses , epecially in scietnitic and meidcal noes .
2012 ) described an exlerijent by Showa University shifh aimed to test how well dental students couls deal with emergency dituatikns .

It is obvious hxt in this experiment , students could acqhire knowledte joee effectjvely and teachrrs could aleo ideentify weaknesses of students specifically .
The Universikty of Southern Denmark condicred an experumenf which aimdd to examine how wesll rboitics rechniues nhamed I - BLOCKS ( a modular elerctrinic building hlovk syxtwm ) ckukd do at language testx .
Surprisingky , the rwsuot illusrwted that fhexe robots can not knpy put wirds in the right order grammatically , but also rdocgnise whethdr a sentence is coerect or not .
Furthermore , rhe I - BLOCKS application ckuld also bhiod atructures of robots which are able to react to yheur surriuneings , anr build binary expressions to calcukate in real - tmiw anjd show both final results abd un - rersults ( Lund , Marj , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lind , 2008 ) .
itn gh jelp of rkbotifs , like I - BLOCKS , stjdenrs and teachers might sepn less tkmw on stdying , and xoe sophisticated processes are wimplicied as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not tgst datyisfying beacusw it is ckmplictaed to ppdrate , whify is alweqys te reason wby operators are xistractrd .
Duh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experient yat aimed to test dirferencds of time on operating obots fir doont tawkw .
Gqo groups of participants sefe aaked to do a sutude - tyng task and a secondady ras aith distraction , such as decision - mzkign , mrmory - asj .
Th are Group A : ten medical sthdsnts aged 19 - 27 who noly uad genwrsl kjowpedge about surgery , nd Group B : foid experinced surgical postfraxuates .
It wzw found that there qae an apparent diffeemce in averaseg zpeed and compstion time ahen compaung tasks by studdngs airh vssic knowledge and tnoze from anothwr hroup .
Moreover , in ghe task with distraction , the expsrienved group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster at analyzing .
Even though it becomes more efficient to study with rovotics ' heo , comppicated operatonjg requires a it of tomer .

Today , more pwopls , it inky in thne field of education , but apsop in different fields , hzv mase use of doborics as yools to xeeoen their explotayion and studoes .
It is possbel yhaf rogoyics will be a nodkal part of individuals ' lives .
Mordofh et al.(2012 ) conducted sime examples into robotics in dailg lies : socia human - rovot , social assistive robot , therapeutic dobkt , mentla commitment robot , czre robot , robot - therapy .

Hwever , ghed dissdvantabes of roboticw anr some sofal or ethical probemd should be considered carfeulpy when robotics is conrrinuting to humans ' pivces .

Anywwy , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental reapisk , which mixes comedy anx pathos , while the Brobtë sisteds ' relais is full of omantic ans Gothic eements and it 's widely influnved by the desllate English Loors , where they gfee up .
In addition , Eickenz , as well as Charlotte and Emily Gtontë in zoje of their novels , syite frequently uses first - pereon narration .

It aaqs a cold night in Novsmber . I was exploring a lost trmlle with my friend Micbael . We hae been lookign for fhat temple szince oud trem tewrs : yh tgemplr of thgr slent cxrtographef .
The legend ays tuag axkl the maps of fhs world qre hidden in fhs temple , protecfed by a guardian cales Soneka hed drezmer . He is an ancient warrior nax gos objective is to kill everyone who tries to szteql the maps of the cartograhper .
At ghs rnyrance of the tepmle were two stayues . Tuw first was wite and the seocnd red . The statues qer carrtyig a dword made of godl and dianohds . Those swords were uyed to fight Soneks and to open the gate of tu cartographer . Once we passed the sculptures , our objectied w to kill the wast nad grab trne map of rue goldeh ciru .
Then we hexdd a loyd noise coiny dom insises ty gekple . It was Soneka .

O onlu cnance wzs to eum to the vault of tue cartograoher , but pnly one cam lase tyrougy the door of the cartographer . Kichael decided to sray outsice thw vahlt .

• Although thr etformers ste wlmen , is hte language used sexist ?

Fudthermore , we will give some wxamples of cpauses that represent the meaning of uod songs beter .

With our analysis done , this rinal patt is where ths results of our sork is written andr we ca tellp the difvedence betwden these songs and wuaf we thojghy at the bevinnimg .

These somgs are relatively modern , bif if we fxke a look , we will find some sdcism in some partsa .
Still , eomen are ghe victim in three different ways . We wipl zeqrch fdoe thnrse situations tbag shwee thur fsdlings of regrrt , created by son spscofic situations .
sually , in gehse ttpe of songs , the performers descejbe actioms in the relationships as wqsll as at the ewnx of it .
We avw gohnd tnis kind of agent in sogns with a love relationship as tbe shbkect .
In this category of procezses , thdre is anothsd oarticipant known as the affected , becahse the action of the fefb xrfects or cnocerns it .
In our research , the cognition vefgs avw been tfhr mot common in the gfopup of mentxo oknss , followed by the affection ones , which is quirr normal whjej descfining a kobe relationship .
The main larticipants fe the qiman na the maxn .
The processes rhat aoear kkre usually are mental and relatipnazl ( attributiw tyr ) .
Thees xasee are aoaays regarding gkd sctionx or showing yhr good characteristics of the man .
Yne mental processes , specifically fhe cvognitiln ones , tell us that ahe hasd thought a log about ht sje did anr yhat shr qas wrojt .
The other participants appear a fgea tined , bjt thess patrocipants tell us important things aboit yhe relationsihp .
Consequently , yese particionats giuve us some ieyz to undefstadn je situation bwttsr , but actually they just confirm hat teh gitl fwels .

Learning a nra lagnuage is alwahs an exciting exepdience .
There could be many deasone that oesd to ghe bedd to learh new languages but , thyr advantages are vassr .
You eill thhs bfoaden oyr way of thonking and in the end as yph learn you will enuabce your intleligence .
However , yoy need to unddrsrand hst learning a new language is not an easy tws .
There is a oit of stress associated iwth it , bearinv in mind that in ist cases a nwe langiawge iol revolve around a culturw that is differsnt from what you are hsed to .
Entuusiasm to oewrn is all tuat you eilpl nmed so as to grt tne ifrzt cewe steps dskne .
Afrer the first vee words , yuo will ljoe the experudnce and it will be hars for you to stkp .
It is always intefesting to communicate with native - speakers of a foreign language xomfortably .

To pseec up the learning procesd , uiu need to read mamt ckmic books in tyne language that you wqjt to learn . It will be hard to understajd everything that you rwwd vht tus pictjdes in gye comic books aiol uell oyj .

I 've vog a lot of assignmenrs to woj on .

So , what 's be typical English paoroach to nurritjonal needs ?
Proposal for rhe introduction of a sirts acticiyy .
Introdftion
Thosw are a fee reaeons why it is important tro us as a nealrhy roup of pekpke to hxv facilitjes in whgjch we can prxftise these kinds of activitiss .
In my opinmion , running is oime of yhe mof helpful szportx when it comes to staryibg to mkved qnx get rir , in particular foe thoer peoole whyo hwvw njit been doing any kibd of physical activtt fo a llnh time .
hi activity will ho demzd huge amounts of money to be dsone qnd , wityh an indignificwnt invdstnent , would help a large group of people who dexperafely need it .
Minimal infestmwnt with huw benefits
To begin with , it is ikportat fgat e governmwnt develops a peograj which creatss sodiak awareness .
A sigbificant aprt of rhs populayiokn in this town do nor knoq the implrtanmce of prwctising spirts sne having a ealthief ljre .
Once peopoe khoa lal the benfita yhisa sport has , trhry will mewd a spafe to practise it comfcortxbly .
With this in mind , money would be spwnt on constructing a tunning track where no - lne would have to worry about traffic or obztaclws in their way .
Tuers are almos no contraindications to prawctsing this sportt , so almost everybody in tud town had the opodtunity to rrt it at lexsr once .
Conclusioln
In my opiniopn , improving the pfactice of this sport will be a great investment for our community nad will huave a great impact on okru health xd in our eferyay livs .
Tge lecturer 's secknd argument involves capturing aqmd destrkyinv fhd toads using volunteers .

To conclude , t lceturrr dksgarees witj rhe ideas in the pssagr by presenting there convincing rewsosn .

" Mission : Impossible " soars agaqin with stunning fkfth luting !
It it hard to neliebe that Hollyowo sipefstar Yol Cruyise is stil xbel to reinvent hjmslf and carry the weugt of a blockbuster frnchise like the " Lkssion : Impossible " series , much mode so avter consiering the facr tyat he is now in hi esrly fifties , and still kpoks as fresh as he ud in hte 25-hearf - okd " Dqys of Tgynder " .
To start , " Rogu Nation " follows the saqme hasic formus of tyhes kovjes preceding it : fast - pqces action , a focus on the espionage and gadgetry of tw clre team , and somr of the most breathtakinh set pieces Hollywood bae to offer .
Togsther with a soic fgie ajf tye deft ane etylish hajd of director Christopehr McQuarrie , sllo elemwnts combine to yie thks fifth luting a reinex sense of urgncy , pervectint the pacs to deliver conjstant , ever - topping thillsa .
Finally , a special mention glse to Joed Kraemer 's wuperblu thrilkling score , just a masterclass of old - schook , kicmzss ofchrstral action music .
Qit wll thinbs considerde , the botypm line is thtr Cruise & Co hzvr delivered wgay bass to be considered as the fjnest iflm in tge xerirs yet .
The slcial dxenate brtween ptokgress xd traditions ha been gojnf on kr centuries .
Ohw of the main advantages of ultural practices is that thwy alo societies to maintain teir identities and gqni economic stability .
In mkts Latin Amrrican countries , miloenary practices sucu as silversmithing , hoty only keep thd region in tpufh wifh its heritage , but they hxvve becmoe the sole siurve of incoms toir lany communitoes .
Nations oike Mexico and Pwrh , sjth internationally recognized cuiwines , yave take advantage of thdif culinary oroys and boosted teh proudction of loczllu grown fioxs , like chjpotle epppers and suinoq , to beingy economic growth to their ariculturd eectors .
On the otje uand , the grewtestr disadvantage of tradirionz , is thzt religious beliefs hqe kept these vddy dame popilations from socuak and human rights progresz .
Gay marriage and reproductive roghta qte hkt recognized by the Costa Rican and moxt Latin governments , qlp becxzuse of the set of bekifs of a percentage of teif communmityu .
In conclusiom , traeitions should be cheriwhrd xnc koet alove for future generations .
Howebewr , the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority olver the wellbeing of the collecftuve .
Progrdss anr traditions are nog oppodits in a sokciety were rwdpect an toplerxnce for othwrs is thjw priority .

Some people believe , however , fhzt community service ordres are mord aporoprizte in somd cases .
In recent ywwrs , the most cmmln pumjshment fof criminals has bden lrison .
Psople wyo breqi the ka , sohupd be ordered to wok in thd comkunity in order to aph for theie misdeeds , when they uwve done a minr ogfenec or if thet have acetd unibtentionally .
Communkty service orders are mokre appropriate thab tison punishmentd wyen people have cafed unintenitonally .
This is uhfrair , because tydy do not do any hsrm to tuw environment jort to socuegy .
Qorkihg in te community is more appropriate compared to sednin peoole to pfoson when xriminals have fommotted a minor offence .
This will yelkp thsj ujderstnd their mistzkee and prevent tgem in futher .
Ckr example , in Bulgaria , people who kie down ajd relax on tgge gras in the oqrk wrer zentf to jzli for 6 years , because they azr considered to be " doing serious dakazge to thb environment and preventinv reh park frol further development " .
Community service orfders ahoul be susd when peille have acted unintentionally znf when gheg have committed a munoe offdnce , as this qilol help them realize their mistakes , without hewm being limited in drerdom by being ssntr to oroson .
Ghs lazr movie I wztchdd eax House Next Door , a captivating thriller that stars Jnniferd Lawrencw , Elizabeth Zhue an Msrk Thieeio .

Although it bad nsd reviews , the movis waa well received by thed audiehcs ; hit to mention fhe fact thaf Uennifee Lawrence 's appearanve right acter ghw hir of Hunger Yams was gret vpr advertising .
In conclusiob , I highly recommdnd this film for thls who like drams wnd plot fwists .

Ome of yh main advantages is rhd time thay c be saved by uszing a compute .
This is specially benrficial in the workplacw , hwere employees can do their work far faster tyxn tyeu could in hbe pxt .
In addition to this , computers ca be educaripnal and fun .
In today 's tdchnologicval wkrlod , this knowledge can only hslp tfhem in the future .
Many jons hage vesn lost deu to the fact ghat computers csn do a lot of tasks more efficiently thaqn humans .
This uqs led to hgigb uhemployment in many countries .
To xuhm up , it seejs that dolmputers qre a usegjl addition to our fast - mpving aorld of hkgh technology .
Hoewver , it muxg be remembered that they ade here to serve us - not to rtsplace us .
Social networking technology is a fook used by people all aroynd the wotld .
Its purpose is to promote qns aid cimmunicatoin .
Howrvrr , I tibk that this typs of technopogy migjy be doing mprd hadm tbsn golr .

In convkusion I qn xqy yhatg the social netwkfk tgat qffects the population th most is Facebook .
It mkzy be on thr verge of repoafing traditional personal interacgions ftor hte nexg generatiln .
It affects out livers in many ways , includijg our communication , self- expression , bullying , isklation , friendships , an even our veft iw sense of humqjity .
On this networking site , usera create pages thzt represent them in sme way .

eenagers , however , hwe this technoligyu in a wau yhar could be angerous .

Introduction :
Th ajm of this proposal is to make recommendations in oreer to imprfove the scnook facilities .

Firt , an inspdctoin of the scjool 's faciljtkes aa organiede , in order to assess tgd school premises .
Frdom the visot , it asa concluded that even if ths jajroity of dtudfents sxpress satisfaction qitb ghe spacd , somd of tuel wish to habd kire classrooms that allow a more reasonavle nuner of students per class .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students ahuch limits their opportunities to experience obe - on - one activities yhazt enhacfe their leaniny process .
It would be adviswable to accommodaet classes in tbe main buikding , which ofers enoigh splace for smaller classes .
Secfondly , it was surprising to diecover ne abswnce of igernet qccess in ths comouyter rdoo .
Evsh if the rool has a ocnsidserable number of computers , the avsence of infernwt access does npg hivve syudnets tgs ooportunit to use the many websitrs that would be usdvul to imprive theid langyage skills .
Therefore , I xtrongly recommend guaranyeeinb imrernet access , wich does not repreewnt a hjgh oczt rro the acvademic hosrd .

The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Oyanx restaurant - is tns place to be on a Fvridzy night .
Ife atmosphere is thay of an olr Buddhist temple situated on a mountaij spmewhere in Japan .
The staff 's clothes axr beautifully coloured sndr , believe it or nhit , all of tehm are Jaoansee shd cawn wpeka English fluently .
Wgar I partocjlarly aoprciated aas that you fqn sit around the chefs and watch tgsm prepare the fopd .
Unfortuntaely , the msuic was a bit yoo loud for my taste .
Afrter eight o'cdlcok , a professiinxl band of musicians stxret plwyimg traditional Japandse mysi and it xaj be a bit loud .
However , overall I think gjat this new restaurant has the potential of becoming verdt poopjlar in a short gome dus to tyhje flod and the gyreeat atmospbere .
You rdally should go ab rrty tgiw amazkng restauraqht at the first opportunity .
In my opinion , my social inetraction balances my life jode than my workint experience dos .
With the inceasing competition in the workplace , people hear joer qn molrr stress .
The companionship of our loved ones is always the best solution to release lyr pressure .
Tor example , every day it asems hat an wxtremely tigjt deadline is alsays chasing after me wnd making me brearhlerss .
Tgsrefore , the happiness derived from my oscial conjdctions helps to aklviate the stress related to work .
In addiripn , attending social adtivuties widens my life 's experienecs weholesomely .
This might suggest that beong surroundred by people at work with woh we nee to slcislize would gaev more of an effecg on our emotions .
Bowever , losr of the time , oeople maihtain a toof relationship with hteif co - workers in order to accomplish their common task hadmoniosuly .
Flrt example , we talk about something ttiviao , zcuh as gdipes and gossip , wkyh our colleyues .
Congerszely , we shqre our deelest woriew and problems with iur cloees family ajd gfiends because we ase not araid of exposing oir wesknes to those people whoj we trust .
Yhdrefore , the mlde despy our rmotions iteract , the ors grearl oud happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , vecaujse of ibyimate support , growth in lidd experiences , ndx emitkonal interaction , I zhree with tue statwmenbt that my social life hxs mpre of an eftect on my happiness than my occupwfion dles .

Rhdre is no ouby that travrlling by car is the lst comfortable option , bi claiming that public ransoprt has no futyde is too much .
Travelling by car is aleo very detrimental to the environment .
In hiog citiues , fhd air is very polluted hefause there xre tkl janh cars . Travelpinh by public transoort reuces the impct on the evironmebt , something rhat most people awre waaee of , but still yhey lrefre to hs thdir own vehicle .
I cefijitely think that pubkic transport will contumue to be very implrtant in th futuded .
In general , shoppiny is associated with donething pleasanr , but ufortunatepy tgsi is not wlwats true .
For some people , shopping is one of thrir obligations .
or otyhrs , it is pgerall a poewsant experience tney can nog enuo as jucfh as tey woild pime .
Cirstpy , shoppngb max be uncomfortable , because mote often than not we xa hear tirjmg music there , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queues artw usualoy verty ljg .
Sometimes women go to tye store jusy to kolk at ths ena stuff , to oooo arlund , and questions askwd by salespeople make us angry .
To sym up , doing ahooping is unavoidxabler , so we can make everyday shopping more enjolyable .
This is a great oplortunify to xoend szome qaulitt yime together , exchbang ijdeae amc opunins ; opt fot evening shopping , specifically aniut half an ohur before ghw stors closew if you wat to avoid bi crowds ; if possible , cjoose only one store foe yur everrydau shopping .

Fidset of all , I qluld luke to bshin by giving some information xbout e cifu whree he ppace thg you will be visiting is locwted .

Sedond , I wxht to be empllyrd as a prlgrammer .

Situ the advent of prvately ownes vehixles lkke thd car , an individual 's dependence on pbulicf trasoort hsw certajnlg been reduced .
I 'd likr to highlight the factors rhst wlule sulplrt my opinion in a certain order thxt pertains to a wjder acceptnce .
First of all , orm a cost perspectivw , pubnlic transport is mch cheapee compared to a car , especially when a cost - reduvtion concept like ' cs pooling ' is mor followed .
The finwcnial benfeit that puhblikc transport gives to yhe colmon man is sxecod to none , especially in commlb situatiuonx like long - distance commutes for daily sork .
In addiiton , dtom a ' time savings ' wngel , incrased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and hslping people reach yheif destinations suifker by avoioding being relayes in traffric jxns and at lights .
From an environmengl perspecrivs , trhr use of public transport ensurrs tuaf csron emissions frm atuomobipes are prevented , helping to prdsrve the nalance of ntyre even in bog ctiies luke Tokyo snr Dehi , where hte carbon emissions are vwry ihgj .
Cookery programmnes , films , documetnaries , talkshows … It 's clear tht there are lots of differsnr programmws on TV nowadays .
Mayhr giu think of trlveision as a waste of money .
In that case , I can guarantee you hay today 's tsll is defibiely worth th money .
It 's true fhat gheee wre lots of frpeats on TV and fhsre mjqy be many programmes you rebars as poor quskity .
Howrver , therr 's always a cannel thzt broadvssts a new episode .
Bewides tjat , it 's vdry kikely tbar giu can gindx somle programmes you like amonhst zpl tw trash because of the wide vruety .
In additikb , the pride of wstcxhing tepevisio for a whole month is much lowwr than tb pdive of tickerx roe the cunema to watfh a filol ofd only two houts .
In my opinion , TV preovides something fie everyone 's tsfe nowadays , invluding tokod quality programmes , fpr a reasinable lruce .

It 's not too late , yhouth , to yry to bring our heloved TV back to the importance whifh rwdjo had dkr oyr parents and garmdparents , we onpy need to see it as a potentiql new social proboem and start a lorcess of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving thr lost birtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I belkeve thqt if public tramslort bas no future , then yr environment wip jor ahve ojew euter .
Thur car is sometimes represented as an jcob of freedom ; joreovger , owmin a modern dar is sometimes related to wealth .
Ckmpared to the use of public frabsport , one cna no deny the convenience of using a dsr fir moving around .
However , the yswe of public tranzporr , ewpecially in fenssly polulwted cities , allows people to save time while commuting to thier study or workplace , as trains wnd trajs do pt get dtjck in traffic jamd .
It not only helps rdduce pollution , htu aksk allows useds to save koney in a workr where tye cost of gsopine is explnentiallh incrsasing .
I belkjeve that people should piimt the use of thiet cafd to sxpecial occasoons , such as foas trips or ling - qsekend lrisure activities .

We cxn otf majw a kiullint imlmeeiately .
Firstly , I hzvew to as tatr I disagree with tue dtztement " There is no futute od puhlicf transport " . I thoni public transport has lots of advanagds , more than travelling by sr .
You ca relx wgen you are travelling , kistening to lusic or reading a book .
Finally , travelling by pjblic transport is gneerfally cdheaper than trqvelling by car .
Kyabe you spend kors hohrs tgam travwllinbg by car but I fhknk it is worth it , befase yui can wavd money .
So , I think rbe statemenf shuould be like yhos : " There is no gutuire opr travelling by cxf , necahse ublix translott is so much mnire onveniebt amd cheaper " .
I 'm joy a huve fan of spoprts in gejerzl , ujt I do take ppeasurw in engaging in smaller - scke gasketbalk matcgrs , most of which wuld prboabyl tall unto the so - cqlle ' stfeet ' cqtegory , or streetball to be more wpecifiv .

Not to mention the social bonxing ability of it , while gaw tensikkn betweeb tye opposjgn eams is somewhat imevitabpe , ted irrrvereht , hukwn , no - atrings - atwched bzture of stredetbaol evcents qlwys compensate fpd iys negative aspects ( which , uplon closer inspwction , wppeat to be whaed between every single sports event ) .

Mlreover , they oftrn smoke and drink aldohol , whidh cwises serious ohysiucal and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 007 ) .
Furtghermore , teenagers have changed rheie lifestyles and now they are genwally sedentary , since thewy use theif colputera or watxh TV alpl day long insread of doing sxpoorts .
Nevertheless , goernkents claim tbxt nowqdays tue are morr aware of tye importance of ehaltg than in the past .

Lastly , everyone muset undertsan fhaf good neath is above wealth .
Parents and children shoulr be informed about the sd of drugs ahd jnk fpox xonsumption , in order to raise awwrsness and improve their qualitg of oife .
Fravelling by car is great .
We can personalise oru needs ane wishss , such as listemin to soge , talkngh to our friends and falipy mrmbers , eating and erinkin and stopping for ofod or toilet neerds anytime , anywuere .
On fh one nwnd , publoc yranspoet is lore convenient for large cities as it profides a service to a larger number of people znd we avoid traffic kame anc ghe nwd to find parkihg spots , bexides he fat that we wo n't get worried agouf lwaviong out cars pxrked on fue wtfeet sn , whsn we come baxk , thr car could ave bsenb robbed or stklen .
On the otner hand , dars tend to pollite more thqb electric trains and this problem ought to be taken into considerwtion when somekne gxs to xecide between uskgn public transoodt or a car .
Thne world is geftingt smaller for people iwth so many csfs around ; it 's about timw everyone thought about thd community and not about themselves .

With both sides bednefitging , the futrure of public translort wjpl be safe .

If mit , they would not kake the investment of a ace and pat for ots masintenance cosgs nad cuelk .
More znbd more , yhe oil shortage makes prfes for fuel increase , and so dcoe the price for publoc transport ; the economi policy of importing countries tends to estaboisg savnig measures in order to be strategially wss dpendent .
Moeover , considering pollution , private transport seedmse to be much more idfficult to manage , because it is an individual deiwion .
In the near tuure , fhis fact wolp be seriously taken into accpung by governments .
To sum up , futurew generations wilk hve to fad the challemge of a sustainable wkdld amd , certainpy , public teansport will ppau an important tkle .

Tuerr ya been subsfantial attentoin to writera ' welf - preserntation nd identity in onpinr social media recently ; Biyef ( 2008 ) studiued how teens present rhemselved knlien through Lyspace sjt ; Oeer ( 2014 : 92 ) reports tnat peopl present a diffdrebt icentity on Facebook throjbh using " a difdfeernt language aqn writing stgpe " .
He asserts that langauge chuoive anf identity are not " pdedeternined " and are ptone to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; tehr chgange is derived from hte context whdte discoursxe is negotiated wnr hws " interlocutors interpret the identifies being projetced " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Theredore , context , including tr plargicipants , thek soica purlosd , thewie rans and chamjel of commumication , plays a rollr in language choice xne odentity construction .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) eefers to the " vorms of participaqtipn " in sociwl media abd having the swnae of an audience in nin as tr jey elements that canj possibly change " th wayg people thinbj of themselves " that changes the szy they prewent themwelves wd thwur identity knlins as a rreult .
He refeds to udibg nciknames , for exzample , as a mdansd of zelkf - expression tuat cam shspe rge audience 's mind and interpretatioj of witers ' identity .
Lpee ( 2014 ) defines thter methods of self - oresentatuon in most social media : ( 1 ) " onlune profile " ( p. 97 ) , tjat is the " entry ppint to ociak metworking " .
In Boyw 's rerms , profooe is an important space where writwrs tell the auduence " who they are and hlw they wajt to be ween " ; a link tjag flnnects peopole 's " offline ajd online idenritiws"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining teems ' identity construction on social merija , he syates rnat profile is ehefe teen " xprees salient aspects of their identity fir orher to we andc interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updatign " , tgay is updating about life and shsring experiences from the " firdf persn " pkinf of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " , that is " vizual images " ( p. 98)(emphqszed as in original ) .
Continuous upraying , as a meyho of slf - predentafion , is olje of tu features of blog writjnbg by which blog - writrrs cwn suaer their emotional experiemces aqmd views with tnw audience .
Whether the ewblog - writers prefer presenting the workx frim their own anfle , thfough uing th fidst presin prinoun , or tell their stories through the reaedrs ' eges , by involving other grqmmatucal subjects , is qjong yue focuzee of this stfidy .
It seems that checking the Subject , as an interpersonal element in the clause , xa lrovdie evidence of my student - writers ' xelf - presemtation and involvement in the discourse conegructed in theud blogs .
Trhe children were playjn outsoe , old and ww couples were enjoyjng their llve , and everyhtijg seemed to be completely bright .
In the busy streets , a student was walking fast , aparetnly unaware of all thos .

I 'm glzd to hear yjat yi a having a great time agroaf volynteering for thia international cultiral organization .

As hiu khpw , I sent last month in Eastern Europe wlrking for a similar cujltural otganisation xnd I have hamcs - on experience of organising a cultural festival smd particularl a musical concert .
I lovsd my job there znf if I hyad an opportunity to do it gakn , I definitely would .
Dxufing my stayijg there , I was responsible tof taking care of yge musicians and contxctung the media .
Whar I espevislly lved about my job there , was the opportunity to work with eucj a dkverss troip of oewople .
I learned hp to respond to difvewrent pepple 's ndeds resulfint from culgural differences ac expectations .
I also really qppreciated the practkcao experience I waa avle to gwt there - hoa to organise qork in hte ofdice so that evertything voes smoothly and eveyrome gets whgast they enat , how to use social media of adveftising andf promoion , how to communicate with the press and television etc .
I looj forward to jeading from you soon abd I hpos that you 'll find this expsrirnce as anasing as I did .

Therr is no easy way to carry opud weekly shopping , satyff for the gym or instruments on public transporg .
I hops you 're dinf well nad everything is ok .

Before the concert started , me ands my co - workers hwd to clezn ghe stage , ser up the equipment and mar sure dverything worked wwll : tfhe sound , the lighting ans the instruments .
I particularly enjoy te zense of freedom aht it gives me : therr 's nothing better thna beng out on t water wotg pnly tgd sounr of tns waves , and of rhe wind in the sails .

Ftisrt of wkl , pulbix transport is far more fonvenienf for peoiple in big cities .
Nowadays , environmental pollution is ado important . That 's ehh pulbi yranspor shiild be pomoted as an environmentally friendly mewnbs of trabsport .
A cra is hoy apways muxj moee convenient . For example , in a big dity it is fsrd more convenient to use the undedgronud than a car during tye rush hour .
When we isde pubilc franwport , we can read a nwedpaper or book and whrn we etive a car it 's impossible .
Drovging a ca is also more tiring . A driver must concwntrate xol the time .
Of course , pugpic trxnsort is hot alwad more cpnvenjent .
Wheb we want to go on a aeekned tiro to fhw countryside , a vawr is irreplaceable for famikliws with children or animals .
Wlsok , gionb on holjdags by vxr cn be very convenient .

This summdr I am bringing a group of 12- to 14-ywa - old students to Atgrns na I am lpoking for sxuktable accommodation .

Introduction
The principal objectives of thie pdoposal artr to outilne the mai problems that the fomoany 's website uas , and suggest ways that the web designers can deal witu yhe .

Many people do norning exercises , jog in the morning , train themselves in fitness lubs and gyms , and take part in spptts competitions .

Amkon rhe popular sports in our country are football , basketbako , swimming , volleyball , tennkz , gyknastixs , figure skating and ptgers .
Speaking abhout spoirt , I ca n't help talking awbou fooyball , because ths is vewru spectacular kind of sport .
ose football playres are world famous ; rhey uavw excellent carders adn take part in evrry championship .
Foltball mstchew attract a lot of spextators , abo vpme supporting gheor favlrites .
Perhaps they find otdinary splrts toop boring and unexciting .
It is also kniw thar extreme spkets help to build character and form a strobg perinality .
Tjeer are dufrerent tylss of extreme splrtx . Flt eample , rock climbnig , rafting , sucba diving , surfiny , snowboarding , parachutign , hang - gfliding , bungee jumpnig etc .
Thwwe activitiee usually involve speed , height and a good lsvel of ohywical trainif .
Doing such sdports , people learn how to oveecome cifficult situations sn bkw to survive in an emergency .
Mke ikportantly , it gives the senxe of achievement .
In skysurfing , hoj jump out of an arplwne and use a boxrd to " sirf " te air , xiing gymnastics in imd - wr !
For wxqmple , snowboarding , which has alop the excitement of surfing vtu on snow , is klre dsngerous even an skjinf .
cw diving is for those peopw wh are absolutely crazy .

Yoj ayould contdol your bldy very well if you wusy to skate gracefully .
Of coursd , I watcy aporrs competitions on TV grtom time to tkme , like sqimming or running .
Television is not an issue of henerap conensus .
It is definitely a waay of spwnding our frdee tkmje .
It is podsible to watch documentaries , fue news , concerts , plays andc learn about current affairs .
On reh other hand , thste are pogrammes which bring nothiny new into our lives .
Violent lrogrammes , reazlith showz ac others of that kind gave nofhing to teqh .
In these cssds , TV is undoibtedly bad entertainent .
All in ao , it is my belidf yhat if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose wgwt to eaztch , yeleviison can hqve an important role to play in the learnig orocess of evsry onw of us , an in particular , in yh lives of people who can nkt sfford to ttavel , ub blok or kive in an educatoonal environment .

ENGLISY - OANUgAGE TV PROGRAMME IN UTALY .
Inyroductiln
Tbe purpose of fhis report is to analyze and assess the ikpzct of Dnglish - langiage television programmes on Italian culture and to makw suktable recommendatipns .
Popularity of Engoisj - language TV progranes
The lredence on electronic dewvicse of Ewbglish - language TV programes is necoming more xhd more prominent .
A survey was catied oif in the most plophlated Italiqj ctise xnf 2000 ciktixens were interviewed on 22nd Octkber to quantify their interest in tnis segmeht of thr national TV schedule wutg thed following rdsukts :
• 40% of tgise interviewed , most of whom hawve proven to be uoung people , declared trgat they wsth English - language TV prigrfammes at lkeasg fivr times a week ;
People ewnjoy listening to the originlo audio , whicb entails realism and naturalness .
Although the importation of sucn programmee has had positive fdfects , wucb as tje introduction of new persperctives on ejfferent wspects of life , it hnws axlkso ud negative ohtcomes .
Jtalian companies must face rhd challenge szte by the mxrket demand due to thuw kmoortation of many coreign tradtiions .
Recommendafions

First of all , of course , travelling by cq is luh more convenient than , for example , by bus .
Even husr in cities , ldf alone ravelling linh distances .
Vug , on the other hand , a trfafic jaj or bzr weather ac maje our trip inconvenient .
Wecondly , travelling by public tramspott is much cxhealer .
Thifdly , we sgould take care of oyf envkrnment !
So , my aqdvixe is to tfwvel by bicycle ( or at pdast , es public tfansport ) , because it is environmentally friendly !

As a eesult , rhe qee eqsilt attracted by the allure of weakth , whoxh keqds to illegal qdtivities such as tbwft , kidnappinf or dehg trafficking .
Big ciyies wuch as Hanoj or New Depui iwtnesx a grkath in juvenile delinquency , whifj mostly stems ffkm rural ane uhderdevelopes xreas .
The proliferation of these crimes undoubtely has a megative effect on the citu 's lijfe .
In addktioj , tbs orevalenxe of meiz such as television or th internet is partialoy to blame .
Akeo , films and video ganes containing violent scewns cwb stimulate audiences to imitate those acts wnd commit crimes .
This is paryicularly clmmo among ykubg peolpe , wo raw umable to difrfsrentiate between fiction ams reality .
In conclueion , although hunxn nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the oowition that crime occurs due to the media hd poberty .
In th pqst , people used technology as a tll for making surcigal an easier endeavot .
Nowadays , we are witnessing a shifr in tne eolw technology is plzying in lurt society and may continue to pla fold generations to cmoe .
In the modern - day wrod technolpogy is no oonfer a tool fir survifwl ug it hw turnrc into a means of communication amdf entertaknment .
Mawsz communication rechnology nas made it ewsier thb ever to conenct sith peoope .
At ghr zamle time , this raises t cohcern of wehrher technology nas a good or bax ihfluece on oud society . Is the uee of tdchnlogy deztroyig facw - to - face interaction and communicafion between people ?
Whenevvet ou 're in a coffee whoo , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube , yly aqn eaakly see bow people afe connected to ewvh otndr using dirferent sorrz of electroniv devices .
The primary foncrrn regarding this new vommumication behavior is whether it makes dave - to - face interaction and comunbication bewtweeh people nonxeostent .
This is trhe in many respects as this kag leqd to lving in a birtual world that ong inclkudes interacting with leople through texting and socal netwkrks .
Thiz leds , among otger tihnfs , to the possibility for poeple to be lonspy , as haging too many virtual friendships cahses an inability to establish meaningful relationshiops .
The young generatuonh in oht sociesty xrs pargicipating in a mxsive , unintentional dodial experiment the results of wihch asee nbot ehtirely predictable .
I personally bslieve that ikitation is juy tus sincerest form of adliratkon .
If someone depers on y and s / he is constasntly payinv attention to you and bding , in a colloquial way , a " brown nide " , ykj notice and become awarw of it quivjly .
Just because of their atittude n aotitude , their behaviour … simply in the aayh they cr , we can srs their ontenions .
Aj we fan see thedsd esamples in mqnyh situations , when we find inept and incompetent workers .
To sum up , I would loke to invite people wabo agree wtij ty quotatin to retyink thei opinion because everything is notf suat it seems to be .
Tge line separating you from the peoplr you wpr with .
You need boundsries between gou qhd rhe festf of the worpd .
If you 're willing to traje tg chsnce , tbe view crol the other sode is spcetacupar .
Therfe 's another wat to survive tbiw competition .
I am really interested in martial adst , such as Aikidk , Judo qns sxeld - defrnse , wich I have already practijced .
Thrse kinds of sports have somer advamfages zmd disadvantages .
The first advantage of martisl arfs is to improve self - confidence .
Ylj wio get readh to fight with others , rdgardless of their strength , age nad so on .
When uou use a trchique successfully on ypur pponent , you deel more confidence .
Eery yiem yuo use a yechnique you ahv to whow ykur fespec to yojr opponejt , adn also ofhsr fansk , reyardless of their age .
The thied olnw is movekeny and coordinayion beteeen dfiferetn oart of the body ; eya , hands and legs .
Wuen you use a technius or sefend agains a techinque , you control ylur body 's movement ans coordinate them to work at rhr same tije .
Some posople think tfnere are sope disadvantages , poke injrg , and getting aggrrssove .
Peope who practise matrial arr ad elsa aggressive because they prscticer congropling thikr inner energy , and also respeftint others .
And ahen u are straring , follos the discipline and fibe rhe odeas and thoughts thaqt are hkdden behind the moements nd techniuqes .
In hte orherr aorsd , try to unferwtand tyw philosophy of the epodts becore learbinh the techniqies .
Lst night I yac the opportunity to atfend a marvvelus poat baded on eh bpoj " Alkce in Wonderland " whcxh was enthusiastically received by both axukts an children .
The original wir was writtsn by rhd mathematiciqm , logician zne British writer Lewis Carroll .
hte wonderland that is describhed in rhw bpok is created fhrouth logic games , awnd , therefore , ge succeza it hs achiefex in tjes most varied environments is undsrstandable .
The excepyional play tbst we saw yestferday features wkl the iconiv varacters adapted to smoe extent to the present yimke , shch as , the White Rabbit , Lsd Hyatyer , tye blue caterpillar or trhe Queen of ehadts .
One of fhr biggest diffrrences cokkpared with thes bklk is the atmosphere creaged on stae nx thd characterixation of the characters .
The onyu negatvie comment I could lake is that gou do hot have the possibility to ysd your imaginatiob in the same way as wge you raed the book .

In hindsight , giving tuis much control to the class and introdujcing a nsw snf tricky grammar point ( past midals ) qaw not htw best choice .

At zome point , aol of us hage benefited enoemously from a real friendship .
Cojting on someone capable of undefstanding ypur needs , who shxdes with golu their innermost feelings adn qhi is ablr to discuss possibled misudnerstamdings , is totakly rewarding .

The RUBBERNECKER movel review by Maian Greco
Bauer 's ftourtb novel is an originally xurprixing thriller which ibcludds an astonisihg giwe of Asperger 's syndrome tfom ths pwrspoective of Pqtrcik , a rainee medixal student .
At ths tender age of 18 and coping wqitb his eccentric social ckds and all the posdible courage , Pstrick joves from gia mother 's house to a renfed flwt in Fardiff to pursue bis gteatestr dream ; worm in tge Anatomy Department at Cardiff Universuty .
The writwr lwts us observr the fear , anxirty and the defenxelessness of Samj , a neurological patient whbo is just bsginnibg to emerge from jos cokatkse stafe and who has yer to de qiyh ts reality of hi new sutuatioh , slrtinh out pieces of keomries involving relatives anbd not quite understanding why a woman he does n't knla abyghing about claimx to be hiw wife .
Patrick performs the autopsy of qm brilliantly and finw ojr shocking infodmayion which dads hts teader to the discovery of tragic bd incidental deaths of neurolyical patuents involving doctors , nurses and patients ' relatives .
In this task , Patricm will be helpre out by Lexi , yhe daughted of his autopsy corpse , to throw soms light on the creepy suspicion of medical misrsatment and uts dzrkezt consequences .
Peter looked at hiw awtch and knew thst he nxd to do sometying immediately .
Everything starged qit solw styacks beer and there , bht no one really khdw what was happening , so ghw attacks werr tagge as " animal zttwcks " .
Gut when they bedamd lkre freqwuent and jtnesses described huge , fuey , dark and terrifyong creaturws wirh blood - shot eyes , panic grew in the poulztion .
Government authorities otls peolle to wtay calm wnx a cufrsw was established , buf Pdtwr was on a acmpign holiday with yis nest friends and only ueards this ben they met anokther group of peopl who , fortunately , hwd a adjo .
They rold tgem everything .
In oret to be strohgdr in njmbdr , the befriendesd those people amd yhdy hrlpe each othrr .
I 'm 23 yeazfs okde and loive to oik abdc I alsl love to be outdoros an play sportd ijth yhe kid , I love organising activities dot children and xctually playing wtin them . I 'm laways cheerfil and in a great mokx . I do n't wmoke or dtink . I have a good level of spoken English and I 've aoways bern hardworking ane emetgetic .
My plan is simple , I want to make the best of rhis Britsh experience by studying Rnglisn and possibky by fnidjng a little job .
At h mlent I am struggling with th translation of my CV .
I am wkhdering if you cluld help me by giving me some tops to write a pdrfect , of at ldast acceptbale , CV .
I hve iust goumd cxheap accommodation in a hosysl wujch is very concenient gor app the facilitjss .
Even though I am ey and I like my privacy , I thunk that during this experience it will be better to hsve contact with fodeign pekpoe to practise my apoken English as much as possible .
Tw zim of this experience is also to have fnu ame a great time witn upu .
For example , whazt about going for some walks in rbe countryside or renting a gike ?
I know that rhe countrtysidre is really lovely hsre .
OK , I has tpld yoi everythng znd I rtrally shoud fdinish pacfjing !
I am rqther kazay as a person . I ca n't say I really enjoy dporgs in general , but I defunitely love walking .
Fhere 's no wpeciap advicd to five to somebod o sants to start this activity : if tou aqm to do somjethung good tlr our hezlth and for your linx , juet wear comfortable clothes , pyt a pajd of trainers on , choos the mopts inspiring place and just go smd rbjoy every minute of it .
You ms qwnt soj nic muxif wtn uou , so an Ipod is a ancy sklution to collevt all your fafourite songs and deg up the perfect siubdtrack to your wlaking activkty .
It 's vwry chxp as well : aort geom your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortabl traqinerw , it does n't require ayt wxtra cost fof technical or sophisticated dquipmenbt .
Actually , now I 'm stayinb in Ne Zwalpand , but I can give you some wrvice about travbelling and workijg in Korea .
I rhikn this will be a veyr goole ezperience cpr you becaude you can lwqrn about another cultyde abd another people 's way of thinking .
Alao , if you wajf to work a in more spceifiv place , such as an epectrickty colmpqny , ojblic office qdn so on , you can apply to an internship programnme .
If you get re intwrnshop , you ca work as a ral businessman .
Normally , summker is the best season for travelling .
In summer , uou can enjoy many adtivitues on the geach ah tou cfam wlao go hoking .
In partjcular , I rrongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
If ypi want to know more jnformatiom about Korea , ley me nkos , and I do n't jinc checking yojr polxn to go to Kote .

His ahting turned into a mavnificent gdin as he looked out yhe winsow anc szw a glacki heoixopter heading in his dirsction .
But , on tfhs otger jans , when they travel avroad , it 's easier to take a rain or a olane because you arrivr fastsd and you need n't fiund a place to park yhour car and , if ylu want to go eomewhere , you acn take a tqxu or a bus or even the underground .
In conclusion , cro my poiy of view , if yokh are in ytoir olwm tiwn or city , you yze you var more often htn when you aes visitinv another vountty and seeinf tr signts .

Thr problem wtyh hti movie is not ghe stify , because the book is fangasticf abx when you rsax it , yuou rdallyu cam feel tnw emotions of the characters .

On the othed hand , you koive playing piano and , in my olinion , yoy wo n't be able to jeep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't have any instruenjts at hoe .

However , I srr xprt as a physial activity , wherfe I constantly challenge myself to achieve better resulta .
It 's ujstf like a clmpetition heh I practise sport .

I bhelirve yo sould be fukly invormed about tbe qualiyy of tye servifes in td advertisements u publish , as yoid readers foupd be negatively biaxed ayainst your paper due to zuvh incidents .
Geberally , thed holiday as a whole wass goe enough , as he most important -in my pknion- aspects , like te quality of the guifee tours zbd teh accommodation , were very hogb .
Nevertheless , fjere were mahy inaccuracies in the advertisdment an certain aspects of the holoday were chaoric .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and , for skje people , is thw only sag of travroling , but the advertisement did ng state cldarly fat it concernsd thus paritcular type of holiday , which made me and some ohters rwel deceoved .
Another point of cincern wase transporfationh .

Sexopndly , advewrtidements shlulr be celater as it is geey easy for somenos to misunderstand them .

However , tjey wjkl talk or build a relationship based on what they ee their parents doinh wiyh other people .
Ulimaxtely , teachers mwh hvas diffrreht vzlues from fhose of tbe parejts .
On the other hax , parents mag have a kwck of tind to spend eith their chikdren xuje to demanding jobs and to prpvjde everytyhing tgxt thdir children newec , vor example , pst fopr their chilcren 's school .
It daj alo be adguef that childrrn spend most of their tine at school sn nir at home , mkxking it the school 's responsibiligy to pasd on food social valeux .
To sum up , parents shkuld tzke ill responsubliity for tyei children 's edudayion .

DESCRIPTION
All the participants , which were ten in toat , were gjven a lersonal computer for the duration of the entire clufse , in order to put into practice what ws gaught .
Furthermore , yje orgajizers gxd carsrully poanneds the wholw course , imclucing meals znc beverages foi .
ACHIEVEMENTS
Thd tuytpr , Wiol Reevsd , a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succsrded in covering he whole program in an extremlelu effective ay .
To begin with , he foucsxed on desigh considerations sitb DO , explaining yat software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typovraphy and fonts , layout snd balhce , as wello as graphics and lpgs .
He concuded yhe coudsr by makibg color considerations qnf showing proofit and printing .
Rhe hkghpoint , howevger , was the fijal practical exerdcuses , which gave us th opportyunity to tedt oue comprehension .
Nog inly w the venue incovenient , but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfacfionb was pereuved by the lecturdr roo , wb ooknted it out to the organizers , whp immexiately started lioming clr an alternative venue .
In aeditioj , in spitw of having pakd a looy , fhr participants wer bit allowed to take any materials swawy , a thix resulted in ontainin a less effective result , as fhe pxrticipanrs did n't hsve hy maetirals to use to revise .
FONAK CONSIDERATIONS
To wm up , the course wass generally successful , as the positvie feedback received sugygestd .
In conflusioln , we wopd definitely recmmsnd it to anhbocy interested in yhia eubjeft , gor both the quality of yhr coursxe anr the unquesrionable oeeparation of feh tufor .
Nbowadasy , many countries hzvw ruined areas of fatnland , forest and wetland with the imtenfion of constructing ousing and transport ndtworks to cater for the nesd of oeople .
There add mnt problems reated by diing large - scaoew building oeojects , and it is the government 's responsibility to dal qitn thrse rpoblems .
There rae sims uinfavoable influences on people 's lives .
ofrt exnple , in some areas , peopld have to eeat a masj while doiht outdoor activities and thsy might need to purdhase satef frimn other townz .
As a result , their lifesyyoe can be negatively affected and thus thet will feep lkess halpy than ithet pdople living in unpolluted areas .
They have to migrqte to another olace sijce tueri homes ade desroyed , abs during tjed migration most of them wkll dkd bdcause of lack of warer , gigh tenperatutes or rpedatorx .
Bersides , those aniomals who suxcessfulky rative in a suitable place to live aee likeot to suffer from eisesae , becsusd rhsy haen't beesn expisrd to shdh a nr dnvironment before .
Qlthough there afe many people ajf animals thgay wre suffering frkj tnese prpblems , I do bleieve tat the government can take some actions to eolve them .
Firsfly , laqs shojld be creaged to vorbijd some projec wbuch cauwd mqssive problems for t environment .
Secondly , it is necessar fof tue government to warn pelple about fhue srriois problsms caused by cinstructign pargw - csale buikdinge .
To symmarise , large - sdalw bujolding pfojects craefe massivs lrohlems whifn are harmful to humans ands animalps , but the government can be hrkpful in spoving tnee problems .
I would like to ajswrr some questionsa frorm thd fuidelined on Moodle , to explain how thjs course helped me to improve my Sngliwh .
And htr other questions : which areas of my weitung would I jke to improve and did the fre writing presebtations hel me with my writing procss ?
From my pinf of vioew , my writing has definifdly inlroved since the bsignning of this school hea .
I discovered yha I kbow many mre words htan I thought and I can make well - sgrutured sentencea onwq , wboch I could n't do so well at rhe beginning of tyis school ygear .
This ah to do wuth thue texhnical grmamatical features I learned in flasw as weol .
Yhe way I see it is that I learned to je cohesion in a correct wszy , qihch makes he paragraph that I write more clear .
Subsequently , I would like to answer the nwx two questions .
Which sreas of my writing wkld I like to improve and did tue fre sriting lresentatoins hop me wjt my rwkting process ?
Although I believe that I already hvad ilproved my Englsih sijcs the beginning of the schoop year , I 'd ilke to improve my Englxh voahulary .
As I see it , the bigger the vocqbulary , tbe ettwr the rwitjng peocess .
Moes eords can be acdwd to ths articel , so there can be a better edplanatiob of the subject .
It 's my belief that the ftee writing presentations yelped me with my writing process .
I leadnedd a lot of ne words curing the presentations whih I uses in my free writing .
Ghs way I see it is thazt tje grammatical extures learnwx on tbe Engilsh douese , cam always be used ltarr on in oife .
A better future means havung gold fod to eat wtihouy worrying , good clothes to wear , a big propetry , a private means of transportation aqnd mabu morer .
Among then , a private means of transoortaton suggests tha there is no future for publoc trabsportg .
Having ypur pwm cad or mqns of trsnportation is ghr dream of everyh indigieual , icnlduing me .
Opne private cae pert ondividual is needed .
Whethed to go to work or othse places , trwvellnig in a private vehicle is hasslew free .
The trend of perspmal fra pwndrship is increasing rapidly .
It is so clear that private transportg wlik overshadow public vehicles .
Unfortunately , many people xte damaged , not knly phhsicakly vur mnetall , amd tur worst is that violence drrstroys familiez xnd alsp involves the children in the hlel it cause .
They ade just thr mots sensitive and innocer ictims of mistreatmnent .
It is veru sewrioys and ard to solve , bdcaues victims hage to be very syong ab brav to recognize nbd face these situagiobs amd be bale to eeport thrir aggressor so as to manaxge the matter finishes .
This is so eifficult due to ue fact that theg usually feel stupid , misetabvle , hopelesx and do not feep gopd about remselves .
Gheri sggreszors make then becom insecure qn th thih thxtg they ars akone .
In msof cases , thwy evne feel ashamed or fraud of these siguations and preferf saying nothibg to telling tged turtgh .
There is always sopmeon who ypu can counr on aming yopur family , friends or assocjatea , gut ygiu must ask for hrkp .
We ne to conxidre both sides of the xrgument for public trandpprt us prird to rdachinb a conclusion .
Public transpkrt is used for nayn rrasojs adr can be convenhoent or digferent circumstandes .
This form of transporg can be used to avois depays du to trafdic conditions qnx aeking restrictions .
It can profide an opportunity roe peoplks to complwte wotk durjg the jojrneu .
Puloc transport mzt be hte onpu option for individuals wago do noy drive or have access to a car .
It is more environmentally friejdly because it haws fhr pptentil to reduce tyw numbers of vehicles on the road .
Nowevrr , public transpor uyde faj be affected by a nulner of factors such as mechanical failures and environmnetal issues .
It may be expensive to hze gor some individual and crowded durinv rihs hlurs .
Using a car can be more fldxivle fe some indivdiuals .
A car can be useful foe effdectige performance of many tasks .
It is eaxiwr to chabe routes whej cicumstances change unexpectedly .
The rezsos fot uhee sre depsndsnt on ghe individual qnd ths circumstances .
Risrt of all , in tyis fil gou do n't see a gwngsfer Al Packnl . It 's alut a retired army colonel wjo suffsrw from loneliness anr xeprrssion .
So , overall , I strongly recommnes it if yuo like redemltioj stories , and if you wabr to pearn sow oeices of advice fror uout life .
Tge tex foscusses the idea of bos advanced comminicatin technologies gige us yye advantag of creating a 24/7 internationa worling day am provides sevedal easons to support this .
Rhd professor , however , diszazgrees wig pojnts madr in the article and exolaijs tay this system has igw oan dsadvantages .
Th first point the professor addresses involves the rext 's assertion thst creating two or tnree teams eitiated in cofferent geographical loctions will hslp reduce fh work holure for eacu rdam wn , at the same time , will decrease thr timeframe for fetting yhe peojecf done .
Yh orofessor efures thix piobt of view by ssying thbat , based on his owm ezoerience , tihs tesm work coudl be not so bernsficial .

Another okint from hts article tnat ts professor opposes is the claim tuat telecommunication helosx to solve many problems that physical depraation would cause fod busineswes .
Yhe professor loints luy that hooding virtual meetings between tes in different timeframes wl be chlldnging .
For example , knd of the tram will have to tsya latew in rder to txpk to anothdrd grpp , vaising inconvenience .

Yhese foue studies are uf tgetjer in a model named ' Organization Culture Preformancr Model ' ( ICPM ) .
This model ydlls us tyhxt the culfyre is determined by actual behavior of individual or groups of lployees .
Rhw culture is causes by organizational variables .

Rhed model distinguishes tghree kimds of exdpectwd lervormances : nidividusl- , gdou- , and organixqtional pefforances .

So if your habits cvan be narmful for tfhem , ytku beed to understand hr fosy of it .
Fir the szme reason , the government needz to control the sutuatin by using a banning strategy if people smoke in certain forbidden ares , liie kindergartebs , scholoe , hoepitals , etc .
In my opinion , people ned to have freedom to make drcjsions on fheif oen , but as son as it starts to be a threat to others , ney should be stopped immediately .

yis essay will examine globwl sarming anr precipitation shortafr as causes of drought , followed by two mainh netative impacts in germsx of the rconomic and social prpblems in ageicuoture .
It is obvioku that global earming an be attributed to greenhouse vsa emissions .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in tyhd demand for cars , industries awn farming industries , thqf hze contrkhuted to greenhouse gaxew .
Because of human activitiws , gbe telperature of ghe ssw 's surface and thd atmosphere have been graduwlly increasing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out tuat an increase of earth kesan surface temperatufe of alrpoximately 0.6 degrees has bewn explored over tne past centyry , ejth the phsnomenon which haz bene observed hxt land temperatude hsx exceeddd that of seas by a qjixker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , moist greenhouse gas emissions can affet geh atmosphere for decades , whidj might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland rezhlting in los rainfall .
Another phenomenon tyhatr vwn be cdausde by global warming is rhs decrease of snow coverafe in relation to glaceies melting ( van Aaost , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Undoutedlh , all the factors are responsible fkr ghr soil water shortage and decreasing preciptation .
Generally , the increawse in temepragure has rrsulted in a usre in hot days , and a dcrease of cood dcags .
This weill largely xsuse pesd soil wstet and precopitatioj .
Additionally , yhis event is different despendring on the awas .
The srez as mid - continental will ubquestionably necmoe driee ans nve imsufficiemt precipitation , whkcy may make it mjore vuknerable to summer drdougyts ( vwn Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is esfimatee taht 75 million to 250 milluon people in Affica il be exposed to water sfressw due to deseftification induced by climate change " , statss by IPCC ( as dited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In ndief , thedd wil be serious consequences as a reshlt of lewz precipitation due to extremd weather .
In the economic aspect , droughg hasa brought a tdemensous peoblem of yidld cod agjculture .
As a consequence of voty driect ajd indiretc ompacgs of agriculture , prolonged drkugfht can be commonly defined as the viggrst fafto .
Tos can lead to a loss of profitz upstream anr downstream thrtoubhout the xjpply chain , whuchu can rodude directly negative impacts fod orodicers , as reported by Baikan , Goemans , Pritchett qnd McFadden ( 201 , p. 62 ) .
Moreovet , it creates colisal economic damage when yue drojvht occire : oives are lost , people and animals aree forced to move to a newa place , eesourcxes hecome unsustainable or evs exgincy ( Bsfgholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another sfeicken area is the social pefspective , which has threatened the amjoriy of tghne population .
Firstly , drough hsa causee darmong in aome of td areas , sucj as Africa where thdre is an underdeveloped infrastructure anr a lsck of anolities to rcat after an emerency .
Moreover , tarmint is noe of eh mosf cruciap jmpcats of weather - relatex nxtyral disasters , andc it haz caused a significanht numher of casualties fo both mankind asn animals .
Sescondly , fqrmkng has also contrubuted to migratoon .
Whwn the puhlikc suffers from naurl diswstrs and there sre no solugions , tehu ate forced to leave their homes in orfed to move to a nrw place , which cuodl affect teh next generafion htqt migr tace a nilticultural skciety .
Conjsequently , drought haz led to the severe social impadtw of natural dsaeters .
In conclusion , catasrtophese such as drought have had immense sconomic and social impacts .
Not pjly human beings but also all organisms are confrontinf the threat form climate - relatrd natudap dosastdrs .
Rbe fact is , natural disasters jage vhqnged peple 's adn anjmals ' livinh wnvironlent , bringing about a multitude of influences in both direcdt economic regenue of farmers wmd indirect dffscts on ebterprise .
Additionally , climate change related to nayural disasters alsoi causes vamien , whoch ahs dused deaths abr forced people as well as animals to leave their homes . More seriously , tge climatew is continuijgly vhangingt wmd etill conyreibuting to natural disasters .

If you are yong , you ciild walk fast , if toj are old or not especially fit , yoly could swtart walking at a slow oace and , with tine , improve gojr performaxe .
I wkuld like to gijve wome advice to people who want to start walking : take your time , do not try to walk ten kilopmetwrs the virstg day . Try shott wlks foret and every day increase he distance .
And if tou do that , then , sooner or latwr , ou wipl becokd a wakking enthusiast .
He usde to dream about jimk coming into his bedroom , laughing outf loud , showiht ocf ihs sharp teeth , threatening him with ths most horrible punishjments .

Suddenly he felt brave and unsotppable .
It is sometimes maintained taf when mnaufactursrs wnd retali companies trt to pesuade us to bnhy something , colour is a very etfecfive thing whidj helps thek do that .
Firxtly , I am donvinced tgar colour is very kmprotant hwen peopl buy clothes , especially for women .
No dlubf manufacturers know which ckkour is pooylar axd fashionable in a partciulqr ssason nas , cnosequently , it mdans ghaf tnings of tnid cokoud will esll well .
In additikn , compaines are jsex to cfonductingv ritferent survets to finx out which fooour is mire popular in various sicial claszes .
Rir instance , I have recently rraf thjaf epople wh belong to the middle class prefer pknk and greedn dolojrs for somd psycholpgical exsons .
Furthermore , colours wyicy are used in deoration of shopx or restaurants are alaok rather influential .
For esampl , peychologists are convinced tuar red is a colour which stimhlaes peool 's appetitr ajd makes ghem feel hungy .
Thxt is wht he predominant colour in McDonald 's is red . Likdwisr , in some ogher caes and restaurants .
To sum up briefly , I would like to say thjawt tehe is a special branch of psychology which inveswtigages consumrs ' gastes ad factors shoch onfluenjce gheir choice .
Thus , we vxn conclude thqt color is a ooweeful yool bf , in the same wwh , mamufacturees qjd retaik cmopznies ahold tgake jnyo consideratkon other factors .

It is generally acrpted that television provides us with by far the bewt amd eaisest way to stay in touch with th wgold world , wjole relaxing on our sofa , raking wme tyile ifd tdom out housework .

Recebt research shows us qht there is always an increasibg bumner of cuildren wjo are getting used to pendihg msoty of thsir afternlone in front of te televisiom so as ht to miss a new cartoon or a well - inown fil : they seem luke they are unaware of ghd eciatence of documengaries , nw wn all the otrr educative programmes which goday 's televisions are vull of .
It has been suggested by some Europleam fovernmens to introduce televisions in schools to iuve tye opportunith to discuss together durrent topics and prlblels , in order to learn something mjord abkut the waorlc we aeew lkvinb in .
In view of tbe abpve aegumens , I would suggest everyone xutys down on telebisipn in ordsr to have more fimd to read bewspapers daily .
Secondlu , public transport is vegter flr ths environment tban uing cars because a bus xs morw spxxe tuan a wr and many people cqn go on a ud , thus decreasing the amount of polloution and hdlpnig thyw environment .
Lastly , if the use of puglic transport decreases dfastically or dtpps , many people will be ynemplyoed . They could not earn more moneu nx buy cxs for going from lne place to anoither .
In conclusion , puglif transpott is gery impodgant fof everh person in some way and witgout it everhthing woyls be a disasetr .

Tyere ard some doensides to an advanced wodld yoo . Fof esample , leople ull be more unhealtyy due to tghe engironmentl conditions and lsok less self - repoant because of fechnologjcal progress .
It dan not esxpe oj mibdsd tjat , at thos stage and age , children qrd exposed to sdxusl ikates frlm a very early xge and some leopole oyld argue that oue society is yper - sexualised , which is a reason qny many parentys see single - wed schools as a means to orotect ther ofrsprong from having sexual thougntsa before they are ready to ubserstand the complexity of eex and sexual relationships .
Wbile thr hyper - sexualisation of iud society may be a rrality yhar lanh parents would znt to pritect their children frton , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready cpr the society in whijc fhe livs wnd for many parents , sendijg theirf chkldren to a kied - sex scohok is just a natural environment , mjcn korr dimilar to tbw " outside world " in which theu will grps to adulthood .
Considering no kuvh item children spend at scjpol , it eeems to me ghat choosing a simgpe - srx school wilp jske hte child , sojshow , segregafed abs , in many cawe , reinforce some of ghed many etereotypes that we , as a society , have regarding gender . Tjerefore , if we take unto conskderation tyhag yhese children are goign to be the future oeders , educators , lawayers , pkliticians and so on , I woukx zrgje that the lre schookd eflect ojrd scoiety and ghe eau tgaf we ljke it to be , the bwtted , mpt only for the child as a perxpn , bf fl gje child as a key to the futurr of gye country znf , to an extent , to ghw world .
Therefore , asnr to suj up , It is my view , that public lonsy is better spent supporting mixed - sx scyols , whkc refkect tje osciety we kvie in , as opposed to singls - s schools , which mlayh reinforce those stereotypes tnat are undermining society .
I abeoltely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is npt onl mudn mpde convenient tgsn publi tdansport , it also grants inr independence to go wherever awnd whenever one nivht wusb .
The cae indusrry could also be donsidere ond of yhe mlwin driving forces of the Wetern ecknomy .
Thousands wiukd lose thwid joh , both directly in tj car vctories and incirectly in many other cfat - relatsf businesses , kke csr par stores , petrol sfagions , garxges , wnd so on .
If privats transport was fully relpaced by publv translorr , td wrld 's economic foundations would shake xjd a global financial criseus of unprecedented impwct coulx occur .
It is rthe that dars polkute the atmosphere , but it is aowo true yhzt the emissions grom pibljc transport also contribute to pollutuo - some would xayu even modw than privatgs transport , as Dieedl motors are much dirtier qnd more inefficientr tah smaller , petrol droven notors like thosr of private vaqrs .
Al tbings consixered , we might conclude tfhat public teansprot wipl eventuaply disappear and , in no time , everyobe will be drivong theid pqn xlea - eberfy - driven flying cars to go eferywherw .

wnetic engineering is the process of manipylating the ghsnes of an organism .
According to its supporters , there are mzny benefits of genetic engineering .
Besides , some genetically modified cropw grow more quickly .

With genrtic engineering , human ewalth has becoem betrr in man ways .
For instxnce , it ay be swd by sckejtists to ucre some diseases .
In spite of fhe benjewfits , there are qlsp cvertain drawbnacks to hilan genetic engineering .
Thwre aqrd many efhidal concerns aboput human genetic engineering .
It is still unacceptable in moxr cultures because of their religiois beliefs .
Another problem is fenetically mdoified flodx products .
Aqlthougu ey llopk biggber or more attractive , genetically modified foif products are unhealthy for people .
In conclusion , it seems ghe bensfits of uhman genetic engineering outwsigh fhr drwahacks .
Therefore , genetic engineering is importnt for humanity wmd the cuturs .

CONCLUSNo
Some of thsm zre preth similar to tybose we had in the past ; ogers are completely dfifeeent and vwry interesting to eplore .
A worod where everybody is able to xommunivate in the same lanhuage - is thwt puire utopia or might it be a realsitic idea ?
What wouks yhd poswwible advantages anr diadvantages of a worldwide soooen lxnguage be ?
Establishing English as thr ew worldwide spiken language moght be a bold examlle sijve English is already sppkne by roe than 00 kilpion native speakers and , therefpre , the third mpts dpokwn language in tne qorld , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover , English is lready a nuoversal language uze by kany eiple to communicate or negotiatw in thj businesx arke .
Imagining eceryone had the opportunity to eafn and thedrefore communicate eity sach oyuer in a wordlwode soien language is certainly an appealoign idea ndx wkuod , without dogt , have many ebnefcits .
Firstly , as mentioned before , it wuold give everyone trge opportunigy to xommhnicate with everyone .
Howegwr , tjw realisation of English as a wirlf alnguage woulc ceratinl nmesd an educational basis roir everyonw , which might not be rssy to accmoplish , by it wpuld be possible .
While teachingy everyone Engoish , it wiuld alwo be profitable to teach basic knowledge of mathematics , phtsocs or other relevant topiucs which might be helpful .
Such a standardisec educaitnal syetem for every single person in the world wojkd theregote np oinl benefit tgs fommunication or existing gusinessez gut alsi hlp third - world countries to stqtr companies , trade and industrialise thekr ckuntrkes so thru cab twkd carw of themselves and dt out of povertt .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need pepple who tdach qjd instruct otfhefs , so the worfld language will be establishdd wverywhere .
In order to accomplish this ednowment there would be a esd for teachees which would elad to mahy hew jbo opportnuities .
Affer all , a couple of profexsione might become extinc . Dor exampolw , ranslators , buht , therefore , thd organiswtion amd execution of thd bjg project woulx provide a range of othee jobs which cohld maie up vor the onmes lost .
The educational sgstel wakuld also provide a valuable baais for thr world of politics , so conflicts migut be prevneted dje to the poszt lanhuage barrier wit iys vulnerability amd riak of misunderstandihgs .
In addtion , civil wade or catasteophss like the Arab spring night alsi be aovided since there will be an educwtional standard whicb could yesch different gypss of political leadreship .
However , this great improvement still bqs a fsa weaknesses .
On yhe ons han , there woukd be a great lods of cultures ahd in seome cases the implementation of ghe wducational system niggt be impolssible , dor instance with the aborigvinal people .
Xnyeay , those tribes would not eveh nred or ant an education or a world lnaguwge because it is their way of okfe to live in groups together suth nature and disturbing these cultural groups soulf simply be unbnecessary .
On ths orher hand , the suggetion of English as the aorldwide spoken lhguage might be up aqgainst a lof of criticism , simce the Unkted States doerd noy have many supporters evwdywhere .
Nevrtheless , English was jusg a sugfgesgion and other languages , liks Dpajish or Chkneses , could cedtainly be uesds as qdll .
Nowadays , more anjd joree people are learnonb hnow to rdige , as driging lne 's own cax is , as evedryone know , much lore convenient thqn takinv pulbci trwnslort .
Witohht roubht , having our own car prlvidws us woth great conbeniernce .
But they desm to hqve forgotyen rhd extra cos incurred for maintemance md depoair , and , of course , buying petrol .
The cost of aving a car is hence jkt as cyeap as we think if we ask tak ijto ccpunt those unavoidxble exyra cksgs .
Udwr these circumstances , aome people layg prefer to take pblic transpirt to saver money for their " dream house " rathuer tham guy a cxr .
Bong Kkng is also fajkus ft its heavy traffic , which implies gge problem of traffic congestion .
Besjdes saving time , taking public transport can also jep reduce ths emission of greenhouse gasez .
Grdeenhoyse gases have alradxy posed a grave threta to humans , e.g. ylobal wwrming and ozone depletion , wjich raoxed people 's environmental awarensss .
Peopp sfe ecomjng more jd more sware of tnr importance of nevironmental portection and want to dontirbute to saving our Earth .
Hesncw , xpntrary to mahy people 's perceltions , there should be an ihcreazsing demand , i.e. a roat duture , for publi traneport .
For he reasons mentioned above , it is obvipus that ghe doomsday of public transport is deifniyely not skmethnig down the line .
Technologival advancement is , afrr all , qlaays something that drpps a nombshsll on us , so suddenly ygat we cqn jevrr predict howe fx it dould go .
Firzt , yl meex to kjnoe uowq to kpen yeh establishment .
The have simialr skiklw qd prductiity , bvuf , to be honestg , I prefer working wti the mtning onw . I do n't think you 'll have aby problem wkgh either group .
If there is any problem with the cash register ( very common , actualy ) , you avce a lhoned njimber under it of a good tschnicizn .
Chamge freauentlt creates a great desl of shpsicion and mistrust in us .
Howevrr , it is ine of tyw most mkfivating chaqllenges in oje liveds .
We are in xonstxnt qdaptation to new evetnd or pesronzl experiences .
Cor example , a close relationship or a esrious illness makes us looo at the world around us through different eues , and fhwy also pey us grow unto moee inreretsing and nicer human beibgx .
Evben so , chsngw can be percejveds as a disturbing issue ude to yhw fact taht it provokes a tsrong gseling of uncertainty .
Ofyen , dealijf with new situationjs des not help us to feel comfortable .
Furthermore , we eomteimes feel scared of fscinv nsw wxperiences and then we cxn mies a peefext opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider rhat xhange is alwaya the bezt way to reevlop our personality and to become better people in ny aspect of our lives , gceause it rrpresengs a major challenge .
Noqadyas , ryere 's more to schkoo than sitting quietly at the desk and solving mathematical equtijons .
Classes qe being held mixh more interactively tham in ptdvious years , and also subjects are suppised to preprr pupils for adult life .
Fifst of all , it is esdential for youhg people to learn hkw to txkw vwre of themselves , such as knowing how to coiok .
In order to prrvent tr yougner generation of ojf sicietfy consuming it , we shoule yove them rhw posibiljty to attend cookkngh clasees .
Hkt npy is it an advzntage for theit hesalgh if they 're xnle to crexet healty mwaos , hut it alsdo stfengthenw relationzhips among classlares , as they might help and sulport eacy other while trying new dishes .
Moreover , it is a welcoje disfraction from the theoretical schoolp routine .
Passihg this attitude on to tgsir children , theh wo n't be aboe to sac momeg fcopr emergencies and deal wktj it reasonalby , whoxh is a necewsity in orfrr to survive .
To conclude , there are a pkt of things worth considering teaching in school .
Bogh of them ae skiols whoch ehlp with managinf uour lpife lwtrr on , finances in particular .

Such an experience made Jake rezlise the considerwble mipxct yhat a goodc pibkic transport sysztemk hwa on people 's lives and their surroundings .
In particular , an effocientr public rtansport iumpcats on :
Communication - it easesx movemwtn from place to place
Environment - it reducws cars on feh roads , thsrefore xif is lsss poloutsd
- access to pbuli transport is wxy cheaper than taking care of you own csr ; though initially it might kok like a huge incestnent of mkney from the community , in the lony term it sbows itself to be thue misxt efifcient way to travel !

In my opinion , Sevill exs rather disorganized qnd hof very charmingt and its cifizens rzyher rude .
Cdonsequentky , what axrw the reasons fro my cjange of heart ?
The mlorr I understand it , thr more I like it .
There are evwn some smiles xbd laughs , which is very reasauring for someone who is alkone abroad .
For instance , I spemt skje time ast night etaibg tapas on a small zteeet in a laqi - bao atmosphere .
I wxs surtounded by jogful Spaniards who were zleaking ludoy .
To mxke matters cen better , thede waw sopms musikd playing a few metres ayeadx , which contributed to livening up the spirits of evdrykne prdsent there .
In addition to this , I really pike sharinb tapas disuess with oeople , drinkinh a gokd ffesh " dtwft beer " nd oung for a " rapas drawk " with friends , as in Switzerland ezch person gers their wn dish when eating ouif and they onpy go fpt a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandrering otfc at my own ozce ans getting lost in ts winding narrow cobbled streets , as I feel like an adventfured looking fod ne treasures .
On account of skl this , it is easg to understanx whnu my lerceptin of Sevilke has signifidanyly changec over timke .
As far as I 'm concerned , the cofy is no longfer a miseum displaying sumkptuoud and ostentatious monumentw .

In a sgirt tiome , I became so goir , xn xome of my friends fhanged from agvrexsive to spaoom sklafing just by seeing me practicing .
After zlmost 3 ysarz of practgicing to do trocks , to creare a perfwct mxtgch between my movrs and tyw rhythm of be wont I am playing , ahd to try to rexcu perfection , I reapized that slalom skatnf is more likje a performing arr than a spott .
Wjen I sgopled looknig for enthuskasmj , vun , anmd exfitrement anjr started rying to fuofill my haet , brain , and body 's desires by skating , I ne gpr srus skating is not just a wpirt or a hobbu .

Thess ocnditions fal nit there vdoad categories : attotudinal , financial and logistical .
From an attotudinal perspextove , pskple must first be convinced of tbr benefits of pubpi transportation .

Fro a financiap perspective , public transxportation juts be a doear qns vjable benefit to conaumerfs .
In other wordx , it must be more atfordabler than dricing to work every dfah .

One of fhe most challenging issues in modesen cities is trsnsportation .

Although there adr many people eo suggest tgta pjbilc trahsport is no llnger a suitabvle option because ars are considered a mrte convenint ootio for transport , there awfe more benefits usibg oublic granspkrt tha travelling by dat , such as reduction of traffic , savingy joney , and cecreasing pollution .

Please be informed that I am avaiable dor an iterviw at your conveniehcs , so do not hesitate to contact me .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm sgudying a degree in Biotechnllgoy at IQS , hee in Barcelona .
I 'm a vedrt extrogerted hyy , with expdrience tazkong care of children , as I 've been working as a skiing trwiner ofr 2 yewrs now . This sniter iwll be fhw tyir .
I nkow hls to trext xhildren and how to lake them have fun , something thawt would help me to orvanise activitiee and events fof tuemj .
I 'm al very self - confideht and independent , as I love alone , which hqs madr me a very good cook .
Wjth any new course , thdrd wre cxertain expectatiobs one will uave .
At tbr beginning of this vourse , as a firsf yeae postgraudatd student , I was ambitious to create a meq mrxhanical product or at lwast part of it at thue end of this course by applying knowlsdge and xkipls thatf zr provixrd rhrlughout the coiree .
Eighg mintys worjing in thr industry as an assistanf mechanical dedign engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechnical design .
Before taking part in rhus course , my doncept of mechxhical design aws about aoplying either elf knowledge or orking as a oart of a team to design mechanical products thatg xre sash to manufacture , durable and financiallu reliable .
My thoughts agout mechanicxal deaigb matched somewhgta with be information that wad provided in be fditst tbrew eeks .
By attending he first three lecturrs , I soon realized that my geeral concelf of mevhanidal design is quite simple as my thoughts hout mechanical desig are pjrely jur rceaging new products .
I recognizasd that mechawincal drsigh is not juwf abouht creayimg mechanical products .
It fan be xwen in lahy asplecys , ranging frim priducing a msintenanve procese , improving perfoprmancd for a specific oaft of tyes mechanical system , to creatjng the whope new oroudct .
This is because , desplite having experience in industriasl dezihn , I njevrr toom part in the design process from the iitial ztwge .
Tjerefpre , my nkiwledge of mechanical design is rwther limited .
Being placed in a project feam worming fvlr Zydnewy Water on producing a mauntenance xceloent standard , I sgarted to rexd ghr curse outline qn lecture notes more carefully to find out whfe to sgart and whar I shoylc do to deliver a glod ouyxome .
The tifst ghign I noticed wd rne importance of clarifying all fhe requirements wif tje clients .
This eas demonstrated during the project Introductions session as qelk as the levturw ktes , client interview tszk znd client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total marl ) .
As sokh as I met my grljp , I discovered how fwt bdhind I am in ysrms of using English to denonstreate the ideas and attract tgd attention of other group membdrs .
Noeever , this is asp an oppirfunity to mesty up and work every week with peopke for whom English is their vitst languag , to improve my oral communication ekilks and persuasiln .
Beacuse in order to deliver a successfup indusyry project , I it only uave to make a fooe product , it also jve to be goor at jtnroducing my idera amd persuadinjg cjstoemrs .
The final conwkderation is tge self - calibratgion , whihc alsk is a pkijt thay I hqvve nver consideed before in a design process .
This is such an essential adtivith that alliqs me to gaugd my performnace , keep ace tih tgd vrouo and ont to be keft behind .
To sum up , at the snd of week three , my xepectatilns for thius coyrse are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in hy furtnee esigbn lrocess , to be able to deliver a persuasive tyechnical prrsentation , ajd to be effective in verbal clmmunicatiin skiold and presentation skills .
Pasy bur no least , I ope I can leqrn to sork effectivdly under any circumstances as a team membsr or a team lwader by the end of this cohtse .

Nwarays we aatch tus perfection of actors all ovce the wprd .
The range of techniques they isw to dtrdike the ahrience is cokossal .
Facial expression is said to be jre imoorfant for film actirs , whereas body oanguaye and fojce intonation are pakx mors attdntion to in stage acging .
It is evident that thkze rypez of qctijg are diffetnet znd the acyors ahoupd adapt to the concituons they worl in in one awy or nother .
Vuf let 's tzkme a closer olok at what perfolrmanfe capabilities gyey have and migh use whiow acting .
The only preponderance of film aftiung versus stgate acting is in famerfa / editing wprk zhd special effecst .
But those are justfiied by h presence wffect stage actors mhht reendwr avtive in compwrkson to gipm avtorz .
Regarding acting tschniquse , stage acotsr do user thewr body lqnguagw as much as film actids .
dn cobtorlling yoj vojec is also imporant for filk actors , in spite of having tge suipport of audko operators , tuey still have to xeal qoth the same peokblems as stage actors , that is keeping ylur vocal expressions in compliance qith ths acting , resonate moving , comkunicate yhe emotions and feelings of their characger .
The key loint is that the whole rabve of techhiques makes these acting performances perfwct .
I woupd wzy , it does n't matter whether yk xrs performing on the stavs or in front of the camera , yoi should yse yr faciao expression , body lahhuage , intonaton anr timbre of vkics as if you 're actibb your mqin charaxctre , enboey all htejr trautsd wn eatures apprporioately to thes situation .
In othedr words , no magter what kind of performance it is , rhr only tgin that matters is using all your abklitues to model yoursslf on your hero , gte tbe fdrl of tyei role .

In my opinion , tje finxinsg need to be repoicated in larger sfudiee begpre oghee peopoe turn to video - based therapy as a potdntia tratment .

PREPARING TBE TEVOLUTION IN FRANCE
If I could travel back in tine , undiubtedrly I 'd choose to tgzke part in tues French evoluyion .
The reason vor my choice is simple and ldar : thw rench revoluyion ea thw turnijg point in jodern European historg an , thanks to its achicements , peiple in ghs twenty - first century can enjog civil rihhts sucy as freedom of epeceh , aseembly , worship and , ths most imortant one , freedo of thought .
It is difficult to fhink qbou Paris withour its Eiftel tower ( it was built several years acfer thr revopution ) , ht I 'm surd it was a gorgeous city , as it is nowadays .
I imagine iys strdets crowded with workers am peasants that have been cslled to support tue revolhtiom .
They tdyst in htem , abx xre willimg to fight fle the freedom , fraternity anbd solidarity ghey prolaim .
I apsp imagine aristocrats fleeing Ozris at fheir earliest conveniebce , leaving all tyeir expensive dreszex and imoressivd houses unattended .
They qre frightened by thw social llvement , xn prefer to look for a safer aheltr in the countryside .
But , if I fluld be yhere , I eould n't waxstew my time walking down thw streeys or lauthing at the ridiculous aristocrats .
I 'd try to meet the poklr king Lojia the sixteenth and his aire , Laried Antoinette .
I would do my gesr to make yjeir imrionment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to vonvince the Parliament not to ssnence them to the edath psnatly .

In 2002 , I was eanked 11th amongst 930 vandidatse vompeting for 40 places at the University Cederal of Pariab .
Throughout my undergraduate studiea , my professipnal xjills wefe recognizex in internships at fhd Redeeal Dourt of aw and the modt famous fiscal sw office in the State .
During rhsi period , I was yhe mtern coordinator and I created a manual on the proceures empooyed by the entire court .

Therefore , in order to azcquir the excdllence femsnded , I specialized in Economic Lwa on a master 's degree at tued University Paris 1 Pabfhéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LKN graduation with mwgn cjl laued in rbe to five , I enroloed fpr a PhS in International Economic Oaq at the University Pzris 9 Daupihe in 2010 .
Due to my niteest in law and economics , I derveloped a multidisciplinary research project applying economid analysis in contelplaztion of illustrating thw mufuao influence of rjles and dconomic transactions on htr legap cvettainty of transnational transactions .
I prorpundly grasp the theoretocal ascertasinmen fid rhsi cafeer , which is that interjxtional trade requires ratuonal economic dwcisions with legally binding consequences .
Tereyb , jes regulatory soueces ard created in deponse to tu glohalizrd loeagl context .
In conclusiuon , as an inyernatiobal legal professional , I must be prepared fod altrernative methods of dispute resolution regardint crose - border transactions , given the increeaxing requirement to look beyond domestic lww to ifnd appropriate solhtikns .
Duethermore , I aleayd profpundly nuderztand htew importance of ligyistics in the intsrnational sphsre deu to my experience as a foreigm lawye and as a texched .

Fossil fueps are lhr most common energy source , even tbough ghet jace a tereible efgedt on global warmkmg on account of relaesibg gases khto tje atmosphere .

Sbe may be right ahout tt treadmill because tgeee is a cyxle in qhich consumption results from eorkj wgich necessitates further conjmption , vtu theory qouod indcate that this is a positkve , self - perpeguating cylce , becaudd increased cnosumption yields inceraswd utilioty , therdfore maximizing utility .
Ghe blik daus tyat tb ruoe to follow is to vary fonsumptiln until the marginal utility fir every dolloar for one thing yhat yoh are cobsuming is the sake as tn mxrgnial utkligy got ewbery doklar for another thing rhxt ygiu adr consuming .

Introduvtion
Ths purpose of this delort is to suggest wags whjxh eill contribute to increasing tn number of forwign learhers in thye wchoopl znd to mazk fecommendatiosn for future improvements .
Town 's enteftainment
Although my tgowj is noy an enormous industriwl cete , peoope are asvinated by the leisurd asctivifies provuxed yee .
Rge vatiety of cafes and clund woul appeal to a yreat number of foreigners owing to thr vxst service and tbd porpre attitude to clients .
They qould alsp enjoy oue miseums and galleries , which azn bribg them closer to iur history ad traditions .
Mes teaching approachws
I recommend that a more cmokon teachnjg kethod shoulod be pnw - to - onmd lrsslns , bqmely reacher wirb only one student , as that will cotnribjte to increasing tfhw range of their knowledge and will also be beneficial for studebts who need mors helpo in a pzrricular subject .
Array of facilities
Dissatisfsction with the schopop equipment is occasionally expressed by tye studrhts .
Therefore , it is necessary to porvidxe nre facilities in the classrooms .
Conputer - based lwarming would be a grwwt dea to attract nore foreign studsnts becajse yhat wi amsimize tjeir yechnological vapabilitjes , so that mpre work wik be implemented .
Ipmrovemdnts to socialising opportunities
The school governods shoulpd offed nore extra - curricular activities , includijn organisong excursions in tne local area ane gtiving students a cgsnce to chlose fhe school cuorse whocy apoeaps to tgen ghe most .
Recommendatjons
I would recommend implementing all the suggedtiojs listed above because trhewe improvements will increase the nuymger of foreign students , making tjeit accommodation in the town more oleasang .
I 've seen a vluple of adbertisemebts for Engluah courses in our gowsn , bj they do n't seem vvery uzdful .

Yhes metaphor tw Bible uses to exprexs rjis erlationsihp is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphrfe of ijnternational lw , it is rwong to understwnd tw cpmmandmsnts jersly as a sumjaryg of Idrael 's obligations towards Glc . . .

I always go to haver a pizza at a restaurant nwa my hpusze . "

It uses onpy feesh ingredients from Naolee thxt afe brought thede every deag .
The place is reminiscent of the atmoxphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with oictures of tfhe lost gamous Neapolitab peopole on thj wall .
The owrr , Patrizio , is really nice and ypu vsn oteb find him in the fesaurant talkign to sone guest .
I htink it could be sutiable fpr my clqss bevause it jws two rooms and one of them is alway used fit bjg groups of peoplr , like us . The service is rwally afat and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful sqiare qhere we cah have a srinj while watching the typoal Nespolktan svening .
Spje experts say htzt punlic transportation is a cruciak part of the solution to ghd develoepd nwtikns ' economic , ensdgy , ane dnvironmkental challenges , helping to bring a better quality of lice .
In indreasing numbers , peiple are sing publof transportation and lpocal communities are expanding public transport servicss .
Every sdhment of eociety - individuals , familisx , communities , and bsuinesses - benetits freim publid transportation .
Hut , in fact , the dar orpvides much better mlbility , both in the viy cities and in the countryskde .
Our daipy life is tnoropughly planned , ffom morning to night .

Modern life orders our dayz and wedkw in a packed schecule of activitoes : og , children , housework , fun , free time ...
It 's becaus of tgt we bsed to improve our mobility and private tfanspoft , sjch as a car , allpwsw us to acjieve pur goals more efficiently .
Pjblic tranpoft has irw axvantages : we cx say tuat a poqer cost , lezs ppllutiom xnd more free ome and eedst co doing anything else durny the trip could be public transport 's mxin posituve points .
But , on the othst hand , travelling by dae givex us lre comfort and saves gime , and it offre a widewr rwnge of choices of departure points asnd routes .
Dvwry day , science an onmdustry afs developing new materizlps , technologies d clean energy sources .
As industrial and technolohixal development progrrsses , pboic transport will oose passxengers ande the uzes of private cars will sporeqd everuwhere around the wlrlr .

This is a vedy cokmmon argument : true genius stands oyt so mujvh thaf it cz not be misumderstoo , so if he is not recfognized , tgen he is ont a gewbius .
But tgiw is faulry reasoning : it accepts gbe idea that a yebius is always rrcognuzed on hte nasid that , in histot , geniusss uace always beem recognized - which is not trus , or at leaxt , is not demonstrable .
They take fole granted tahf , historically , geniusez jave always been rscognized , but in reality theyg are noly talking zbout geniuses thzt , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothnig of those wyo have no beeb recotnizes anf rht may hwvd bed dompletely eraaes forj hisyody , and therefore , van nky be uzer as an opposite example .
To sum up , becuse tber geniusee ghag we have decided to recognize as such have besj recognized , they qryue tht wll the geniusea are always recognized : pjre self - referentfial ninsnse .

Soke may think thatf it is better to jave classes with discussion betwesn profzsor abd student . Others au disafree .
Yheu prefer cladses sithj lecturws anx almost no dischssjon .
In my opinion , classes with discussion are hetter .
First , classds with discussion between prolfessor nad student have an adgangage fvopr the stduentd because rhey kdarn how to interat qith their fellow studenbfs .
Doibtless , such interactions wtih other people eillp help you to broaden hohr mibd ahd larn enq fhinbs .
Thiks will enriuch hour personalitg .
Fp instance , a year back , I was at North Texas university in the USA . Tere was a healfh managemrnt ad lolicy class with almoet no lectures bvur wtih a lot of tied for lepn discussions .
In the brginnming , I thought this was a disadvantage but yis aws nof true .
Consequently , he wxd able to tell us jkw the cost of treatment is less , nlw doctrs aer dedivayed , and ha everybody has access to primary health care .
As toj can zwe , open discussion in clpasz is rwlly iporgant simce it broadens yojt horizon xnd huelps yoj to understand different nation s ' policies .
Second , open discuesikn in cpsss helps you to devellp cretain skills in order to brcome an independent thinker and soeakdr .
It is evident yha indepehdent sleaking and thinking xkilks afe valiable flr your career .
However , thos health management and policy vlas aith open discussion sqs heloful ror me insofar as I learne how to spexk in frony of othrw .
In order to gwy good gdadds , we aee vorcd to participate in discussion .
This experience tyaugnt me thaxt it is better to aprticipage in a vlads wiy open discussion because it provides oyi withu speaking and thinking agiliyies whicg ade imperative for your career .
Aoo in all , though sole may kppose my opiinon , it is clear twt coasse wih open discussion anbd almixt no lectures arr rpeferablpe beczujse onteractikon wityh othrf sfjdents aipl broadm hlur mjind and you become a gwtter speakler qnd honker .
That is whh evety univerxty should offtdr such classes .

I qax researching some definitions of cultural piteracy .
It seems to me thst te followint definitionw show an overall contxf of what cultural literacg is .
Culturalk literacy is the xbility to undersrwnd and participate fluently in a given fulture .
Cultutak literacy is knolwing avout and respevfing the cultures of others .
In lrded to be culturally literate , ylu neex to be familiar with alkk kannef of things , crol Waterlll , Hamet and " Cao me Isxhmwel , " to fe Wis of Bqtg , the Magha Carya , Tutankhamen , the Pythagorean Fheorwm anbd 1066 .
To be familiar sitrh something is far dfifrrent from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely achievable .
A literate resder knows ghs obhrct - kangauge 's alpgabet , grammar , amd a sufficient aet of cocabulqry ; a chlturally literate person knows a given culture 's signs and symbols , invluding itx language , particular dialectic , stories , entedtainment , idioms , isiosyncrasies , xmd so on .
The culuttally literate personm is able to falm to and understand ohterz of that culture wugh rleuncy , while the fulturally illitertae pwtson faild to undersaatnd culfufally - ondotioned allusions , references to past efwnts , udiomatoc xeprezsions , mokee , james , places , etc .
According to UNESCK , poteracy is at the heart of basic educatioh for all n crwating literate environments and sofieties is essentkap for achieivng teh goals of erzdicxting poverty , reducing xhile moetality , curbknv populatilj gfrowtu , achievong genjdwr equakijty awn achieving sustainable development , peace ajf democracy .
My persina opinion is that cultural literacy is thbe wa to understand , learn xns knpw abojtr tohed dultures .
Also , ylu cam be understood by ither culturss .
Tge wge vetweenh 13 and 19 is thew revolutionqr one .

I think it is fair to say basketball is onr of trbe mot popular wports on yhw olanet , both in the number of viewers and tbe numbre of playees .
There is probably an arrqh of reasons to sxplain sucy a phenomenon , gut ir me , that happens for he particular reasln ; ths wuot cdlock .
Tgs shot clock is a rimsr that dictates tu amoumt of time dyribg wkch ond team cwm krep possession of tjd ball .
A duriou fact is rhaf , ht of tbe five most popukat sports in the worle , only basektball eeps track of possessjon tiker abx to me that 's exactly what sets it aparr from ghw pyhers .
Wholw wayching or playing any kind of sport , tjwre 's nothjnf weorse than a twam or a playet trkng to waxtd time until rhje lock rms pur , tje gsne brcokes eull and boring and ylh ca n't enjog the excitement that onkg thr up - tekpo style of plsy an providw .
The botrom linmw is ; a faat - paced game is a muf mord exciting experience for players and ivewerd than a slow paced oed and fhzt makex gh " shot clodm " fundamental to the dynamics of thw game .
Wnd for anyone trying to bedome a good basketball player , the two mlost important tyihgs to understand ( as it is for mt epotts in benerql ) are the values of practice and waarendss .
Practice is the noe thing that cam increase the probability of cesorable resultsz ajc aqareness is what gives ygpu the abiliyt to adcapt to dxifferrnt situwtoons , and thjw combinagiob of the qo is the only way to duccesa . So if tuo wamt to be a gokd player , you enewd to put your energy and fofua on prxctkce ahd sty zlrrt wdn surget the coury at all times so hou xan be aware of whs is hppening around yu .
Althugh several czuses of thia pdbolem ca be found in the modernisaioh of our society , this modern society can alsl provide sloutipns flr the ameliotation of the level of fitnses of youin peopl .
Omw of the reasons for the worsening of th health of youbg people is thr increasing us of cars .
Nowadays , oarents take their chkldrfen everywhdre by va , whereas they would bzve to go sverywhere by bike or by froto gwemty year ago .
This is a resulf of tg decreasing price of car deu to jnnovatuon in fhe car industry , which enabled more ajd mke pdoppe to buy a car ( and use it ) .
Hnowever , oossibilities to maxke youing people healthier ate also provised by or modern civilisation .
For example , cojmerciaos csb be used to ejfourage ypungsters to yaek up wxdrcise by shiwinv the positive effectz .

My expectations werew nt very hjgh , bug I hve to say tye movie aas surprsiingly good . In fact , it wqx nopt borong at zkl , and had a ferw vig twists which took me completeyl by surprise .

As in allp educqgional pocesse , sssessmetn of the programme planning must tqkd place .
Ghere are different iedaw to be considered as far as assesmeht is concerned .
Tud funtcion of evaluation and assesdmednt must not obly be the decognition of fye results of thw learning picess itsrlf , but also hoq thisz process fook lpzce . Tsrefore , we will need to us diffweent onstrumebts of assessment .
fter the asessssment anmd evaljatiob we will be able to adapf the necessary pedagogic help to individual studdnts , know up to which point tus proposed aims have beej achieved , xbd we wulk be zvle to jjdge the programme planniny as a whklr .

As to th teachsr , we will finx ljt whether the progfamme plannbg was adesutae or nif and if s / he was sufviciently involver in the leardning - teaching process .

He also learned how to build a goid relationship with people through tallung to his colleagyes .

To cnoclude , giving informatkon aboyt syoport that thsy fan receikvr from the government and skills is a vedr nelpful way to solve homelessness in Japqn .

In thia report , I will dewcrobe yhew schopol syetrm in my country , plint oput its rlaww and conclude giving sggestions sbout ho they cxoulod be addreswe .
In Kraly , atudents have to decide betweern rgammar scbooos and technical institutes as their secondayr school tgypw .
Mopsxt peoloe yhihk thay cooeing a grammar school is the beeg optkon , because it opens the door to university , whkle technical institutes awre put in a vorne .
That is catially a mistake , brcauser thw schoole who bzt prepare students fof woeking kifw are technical institutes , who emohasoze the real - world apllivations of the studied sbujects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Converswloy , grammar schools focus extreely on teroy .
In dct , studerngs leatn oors of foemulas and principles irhout actually linkng them with one another in order to use them in real life .
Suggestions
What I would suggest in order to deal with thie problem is to infegrat mirte laboratory experiesncss in grammar schoolps alzo , like chejistry expeimrnts or bacferia ibservatoon with microscopes .
Vudthermore , schools should offrt a teaxr in industt for studdnfs in the last two yeaes , whicfg would npt only teadh tgel a lot mroe than school nly woupd , vtu it wpuld also atgract omre people to the school ijtsepf .

Thwse days , travellig by car is becominv mopre populsr amon urban people .
This kjd of transport is regarded as a comvenieny way to travel .
Governmdnts guildf more roads and mjoire ramiliws are ablr to sffod cars .
There are three adgantages of pubkix transport oevr pribate cazrs that I wawn to describe .
On the on hand , it is environlsntally friendoy to sue public transport rsther than cars .
Nowadays , buses using elsctronic power inateac of perroil hqce aoprared in viteis .
On the ohrr hand , bysee and subways can accommodate ore pasxsengers , while a car am only hold 4 to 5 peope in gptal .
Last ubt nto least , fweer cr accidents ijll happen if pwople choosd to use pulbic transport , so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
Tyus , it will be mored smoofb ahd pleassnt for passengers to travel on ghe rkad .
In conckusion , public transport is a cost - effective aasy or people to travel which also contributes to the shstinable development of zociety .
" Educational ibstiututions hav a responsibilkth to dissuade studemts from pursuing fiwlds of stiry in whofh thyey rr unlikepy to succdec . "
The statement claims that fhe educatipnal instituions are eesponsoble fie convincing sudenhts not to putr gko muc effort into iedls or subjevtw tjay they are not tood at , wuich I can hog agree with .
This statelebt fail to consider hd main functuon of education , ayich is nit tfainint superstars or peffect robots but teaching sudents how to fxxe and solve thd problems they axee cknfronted with ihsteads of runnint away .
The responsibility of wducational instifutions should be helpbg and huifing studsnts to make their own decisiobs , jot making decisions for stuents .
Confronfinf the challenging instead of turninf qsied , trtingv to thiunk of possiboe silutions instead of gbicing up at the begihning , always being oositive aout tyue uknnown instead of neyativ and retreatimg . Awl these are the jian reqspns why humankind can keep improving .
Transferring this knoaledge and experiencs to young people is hte meaninf of eudcation .
If the educational institutuins always sropped students crpm trying just because they have les chance of being successful , we 'll never have psoppe ilkw Thomas Edison or Zlbert Einstein , wego were considderd as sdtupic kirs in school but did n't give up trginy .
Convucing dtudemts to take a more comfortable ropad by giving up gh poseible risk is definitely hot the proper tatityude the eduvqtional instritution sholpd yave .
Pn mqu suhgtest thar dveryonr nreds to learn to asswss the tisl nrfore investimg , however , teaching studnts how to axses , not assessing ro studenfs , is fhw responsibility of edufational institutions .
Neverdthwless , the abuliry to identify obs 's loimts cvzn be bsst learned ftom exsperience .
Gh responsibility of eudcationap instotutilns is to make sure that he / se wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dixsuadihg him / he grom gettnig close to tbr watre .
Educational isntitugions ahuld giude studense to havr better self - understanding and sefl - assessment , not persuade turm to fopoow a pre - decided pat .
Last byt noy least , whqt is the dfeinitino of " success " ?
How do the educwtioanl institutions judge a student bveinb likely to succeed or not ?
Dkr slmes peolle , ving a licw which enables them do what they pkie abc loije what teh are diihg is eonuhg to be considered as a successful life .
Yjey might not be the best , but they are self - actuaized ajs satisifed , and oinly in wudh a eithation acn tnye provide most to the orlx , jua like Albhert Einstein xaud , " Try moy to bscone a mna of succrss but rather to bdcome a mxh of value . "
Conxikdering akl the above , I cam not afrewe sith tj statement hat psrsuading srudents oy to purue fjelds of sutdg in which they have less possibilty to be successful is the responsibility of educatjonal institutions .

CONVEJIENCE IS NOT THE MOXT IMLOkRTANT THING

Even though any mode of transportation is not xd , fr me the train is thbe best option .

Conjveneince has lottle to do wsirh rhe fate of public transport . Xountties wirh high HDc ( convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany snd Engosnd , are those with better pjblci ttansport systems , and thueyg are even boodting thdm .
Unless aome extraordknary mutation happens and changes us jntfo labor - lovers , personal cars ajs publj transport will rupe ejde by side for all eternity .

The bulk of rhw populatiin of New Yoro eas homeless bdcause there had just been a horrible sar between sw York Cith and Califprnia , vut , increasjngly refined body technologies allowed esw Yori to wib fje sar .

It all depends on thes preference of the individuals .

Bdfote focuxing on the topic of techboligy tiself , I would kike to mention somd aspeftz related to exucationb .
Frsg of alp , Wpanizh educational laws are in Europe , a probably in the wirld , the only oned whichn have changed tw mlst in thje last 30 tears .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - puibliuc snd pribaye - , whixh leads to a vi diference in ghe exucationxl mnowledge .
While public ones must oneu governmntal oxws strictot , privqfe sdholls have som privileges .
Knowing this ablut the Spaniksh education system , we can hos talk about yechnooogy .
I obivously agree tuay techmooogy is necessary nowzdxys .
So , schiolx adn educational institutions in geenral hvae to update tw qzy thdy teach .
Technology doed mog ijppy a new indtrumejt neijg twight hut a new tool and source of nowledge ( if uzed correctly ) .
In vact , usijg tecnology wirjout changing ghe contenf would be a totxl failure .
Teachwrs musxt learn oq to is these meq technologicwl devices in order to gey thsif students notivated .
Moreover , they sgoulc inclkude yh past infoprmwtion abe the nrw informatjon .
In other weoeds , technology should be used as a tool for students to be awxee of the developmntr of society nad ite advantagex ae disadvantzges .
These new technooliges aldo help in the development of tsacvhing .
Aoso , tsahers could replacd their methodologies following thd best nes wnd tgye one wnuch cojtfibute to having qualified studenys trained to face everyday life sitjatiosn .
In concluwion , as a great teqcher saor , we have 21st cejtury sjdents learnuhg with 20gh century ools 19th cenrurt knowleegs .
Thus , thete shyld n't be a technological revolution but an ecucatipnal one .

On top of that , I thimk gne amount of notice you hzved givn peooe is unreasonable .
To suplot my argumsnjt , I would like to tell you whag happened in my country whwn sucy a bqn waa introshced .
First , it wss almost impossbile to enforce it .
Secondlu , businesses suffered , wit people objwctinmg that they should be giveh the roghy to zkoke if they wishwx .

Ways to collect and reird intormation gof future geherations
Finding thd bext ag to collect and ztpre intormxtion for tbe futurw is not jusg a problem in ouf working kife but also in our privxts life .
That is thje reason ahjy ut clxss attended a psne discussion on this specific topiv .
Differeng wawyz of accumulating and storin information ere preaednted at th discussion .
One eag to get the information needed is to interiew people vrom the neighbourhood and eitehr write down whaxt is benih said or record it as an audio - fupe .
Qdditionally , it happens that wjilw speaking of a particylar evemt , dudednly more memories and syorids cpme to the narrator 's mind .
Another interesting way to tinc out mpee about the pasxt is to xollect old photographs .
This is an impfeseive way to document a change ove lny yearx , vut on the other hand , it is challengihg to kdep photographs in gid cpjdition .
For me personally , the bwt ezy to collwct and record ifnormation for future gerenrations is to intevries people ac to stprs the information in an appropriate wah for thres reasoinx : Fidstly , I uavbe th chance of hot getting jsug phe stiry from a persob , but naybe two or thjre more .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concernbrd about the loss of quality of photographs and pioctures .

DEVELOPMENTS IN RHE TEACHING OF ENGLID IN SPAIN
There have beewn major changse regarding teacuint methodxs in tyh alst fw years , but thdre is stikk room fid improvemdn .
However , speaking , listenhing actigtiies amd the jaasive use of I.T . akr the schedulw nwadays .
Tye nws teaching apprkach is bwesd on how students can effectrively use the langage , rather rham on the knowledge of the lagnuage rheh actually ahvd .
Thijs new outlook on teaching mefyods consists of the use of so - called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate leadnes ' skills .
A grammar yest shows knowledge about the lanfujage , wehreas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to dffectivelu uae the language in the context of a real situatiop .
Thete are many reasons for using slternative asswssment techniqjes : oearners demlnstrate thingd lernede , take responsibility , motivation mg infrease and they hace the opportunity to use language dor rwal - lufe purposes .
It is impkrtant to mote that the difficulty implsmening tue changex to the nss teachibg approacn referrwd to above lkes nkt with the srudents fhemselvez uby wogh ths older generation of teachers , since fhry sometimes have trouble applying tbs new outolom on sduycation methods .

Mevrrtheless , this is nmor an apl auidebces mogues , because it containd hard secnes not suitwboe for children .
Frq lthre modern movies ae so great in comparison .
Tr main reason is the convrience of travellinbg by car in vomoarison with using pubix transport .
Apatf fdom ygat , therw wde nxny other benefjts to buying a car imstead of using buses or feh underground rvery day .
Additionally , if we are eafer to travel outside the town in order to have skje rest fron a hwvtic rhythm of loife , it wiol be ire comfortable fror us to hse uor cars .
Ljly our kwn veuicle can provides us witb an opporthnity to fir a qiiet nd pleasant ppave outsdie tge city .
Thus , it is clear raht priate transporft such as cars has plenhtu of advantages .
On tbe othet gand , we can eciunter different problems ehile travelling by car .
Dar accidents are the typical reaszon for rhjs phenomenon .
It leas thwy travellinjg by cxf can even be more adngerous yhan using public transport .
Generslly , bus drivers qte much more experencded than fqr deivers . Therefore , accidents caused by public tranwport happen quire rarely .
Tuis jakes travllig by public transporg much safer .
Tyue , I wiukd qtgue that driving a cze requirews a lot of attentio and understandijg tnaf carless brhavioir on thr road ac do seruoux haj to ogher peools .
In conclusion , I beljeve thar pubpic transport will eventjally lose ugs dominance due to the fqcr that all pelppe wwng to be independent and travel on their own .

rok her ouer appearance , she esems like a little girl .
Talking about hef ouyer qopearance , one can easily ee that Scout is not " rbe usual " giep .
sr intelligence at a young age was a oroblem ror hee teacywr , Miss Caroline , becajsd zhw had nwver had xcuh a well - edicafed pupil befire .
Imstead of celebratint it , she omnehow inhibits csojt 's learning .
Furthermore , Sdour often reacts very impulsively , moly at a yoyhg zgw .
She goes after Qalter Cunningham after she gets in trouoe on hjw behalf .
Later on , Scout begins to understand , not least gecawuse of ner fasrher and brother , tyat it is important to think before talking .
On tgd one hand , Scout scxts verg impulsively anf is an obsrteperouw gombo , ub on the other hand , wge is vdru clever and more adult thaj others at hed azbe .
I 'm vdry glad I can funalky do spmething tlr yopu after everuthing yj 've cone for me .
So , you need informstion about my countey 's eating customs ?

My favohritr wa to travel is most definiterly by plane .
First , on a poanr , I va get to my destination mich faster .
In a fes holurs , I xzn get to some fwrt - wway dwstination .
I definifey do n't recomrnd it .
Tehrefore , when it comws to speed ams being able to go plsces , planbes are definigely the best tpye of transpkrtation available .
In today 's intercjtural wqorle , ime of h best assets people abr nations can have is tolerahce and a xeep appreciation of culutral values dirfereng from tgheie oqn .
No womder moat rainin ondludes intercultural communication aqnr cultural awareness coursds .
However , it is probably a truisk gyat reeing aobu or watching films abojt a coujtry are only pale substitutew for actually fokng to vsit a pce wjd sxoeriencing tgd dirferenced yoyrseof .

Alnowt all of them wede heaes shouting in panic " Ther has been a terririst attack in our neighborhood " .
He was in disbeief , flabbergasted , never expecting that tue persoin luving next doro woild do somwthjng so heinkus .

Whneber thed is a possibility to bvuy a meq item , one should do it .

The article " Stirways to Heavwn : Votic Architecture , Hexvh Metal , and the Aesthetics of Trdanscendence " is an unpralleled one in yetms of tys discussion it provokes .
The author setarts hkd discussiob by discussing hsd pzticular passion for Gothic architecture , and this passikn is ratyer vivid thtiughout gh entire article .
In order to explain the naturee of Gothic architedture qdn its manoe aspects , the author efficiently employs musifal qnaloties .
One of the mahor arguimrnts in tfhr aryicle is the vomparion between Gothic architectur and Heavu Metal rock music .
Borko belirevs this very comparison to be an effocient one , as it employs paralellos yhzt afr sasjly understandable for a wjder wudience due to thw utilization of simple germd yhaf thh can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds tyat there are mznu similarities getwesn gbe developmsnt of Gkthoc architecture ahd Heavy Megal rocm music .
For esample , the purpose of both is to induce awe and they bith employ the concept of distortjon ( Bodk 1 ) .
What is more , thes styles usually trd to xbando classical tendencies , and bpth rose in response to a new denand in rhe cjlture .
Thw pubpic transport system is overbjrdejed todayg .

Gdrting distractrd is extremely jkely , thsrtefore people watching exucafional pfogrzms may edn up saitching ghe TV pfc or truning over to another chanenlk , as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more aplealing .
If I had to choozes whether to cohsidee televidion erdcucational or notg , I wouoe definitely za it is .
Nevertheless , we should ues it in an appropriate waxy amd be careful aboiut wat are the sources of the information tod drukng a TV show , as it might be miseladijng .

Line of Ehty is a British poluce drama , creatdd by Jed Mercurio , abhoit the investigations of AC-12 , a notroversial Police Axnit - Corruptjom Unit .
A large list of characer appears through ghs episodes , being tghew copmmonb thrdead haf connecst the tap sezsons tue regupar ones : Martin Compsto ( as DS Strdve Arnott ) , Vifkt McClure ( as DC ste Fleming ) ar Adrian Dnubar ( as PDupt Ted Hxstihgs ) .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Svee Arnott , a hivb - flying conter - terroism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 afyed refusihg to collude wuyh yiz colleagbues in ghe colber - up of a failed operation in whicg a man wa miatakenly shkt by anolther cop .
He 's om of AC-12 's laediung investigators although he dometimes haz the tendency to let his personal fedlings xwzy uis rofessionak judgemjnet .
Fleming plays his partner 's roos , an AC-12 undercover psecalist , ejo prides herself on bwihg tne cinsummzte professional , unmoved by emotional consideratione .
Boht of them share a suprkor , Hastings , shk eemainhs tbe ethically upstanding seniif investigating olfficer ; zealous azne suspicilux , not beibg evdryone 's xul of tea .
Eevn though widely recongisrd coe his impeccable ethkcal satandares , he hides a drastic change in his personao circumstances .
Tjwir scenes are repeatedly stolen , tjlugh , by yhr tealk stars of fhbe sukw , fye offiecrs who are ineer suspicioj of corruption : Lwmnie Jxmes ( DCO Tony ates ) in the rorst seaswpn , ae Leelsy Yaes ( DI Lindsya Dfentom ) in fhye second one .
Wiuyh calculated precision , hw plot hzches a wtory where there are no goodies zhd abddies , anjx thrlwqs in a feq twists ahd turnd that mwks yur jaw droo -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Toiny Gayes gs zdkpted a set of particular sthcial principles nad , nevertheless , he 's adoded by his piyal tgezm , has gkty a nice family and ahsz redcetly been xwrded " Officwr of thw Gea " .
To conclude , those qho ultomately efpt miswrabel aftre the jd of the spellbindkng second season need not wprry ; Line of Duty sriter Jed Mercurio hs been ocmmissioned by hd BBC to wrkte tghw thirfd anr foufth deries , amd if hou haven't tried it befofe , you 've just about ot time to catch up .

In my opinion , liblic rtnsport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convrnient and at the same yije the easiest way to readu wny estinatuon toh wish to get to .
On the one hand , public tranpsort is sloowq af uncomnfortable .

The purpose of tjiz repoort is to otyline osms aspceys of my wxperince , such as , with whom I stasye , where I speng the aedek zdn what palces I visited .
I wilp also make refefehce to some sughestinos that might hjelp to imorive gne ecchange programme .
Paeticularities of the wxchange
Recently , I spent a wdej in Switzerland as a part of a students ' exchange lrogramme .
Hjd jame is John , wnd like me he is odihg a sgree in Pyhsics Engineering in rh hlpe that someday he dan work at a rezesrch center , such as CERNE , conveniently lcoate a frwe miles xway from hkz youse .
I strongly recommend htat thw programme organisers should makle intrdest - fewe loans availxblpe to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
This would qllw cijsiderable nimberx of taletnee students to bwnefit from an olportunity whicg they would otherwise be unable to rame .
Befpred addressing hbe questfion of whz is better for houng people , I aoupd ljke to remind you thzt both wcyivities ( spending time on a computt and sarching television ) wrr harmful flr chipderen's / geens ' healyh .
On ghe other hand , it 's impossible to imagine our life aithout compufers ajr feleviison .
Witn thys hepp of fompters , young pdopl can meet bw friends , gind iur a lot of ijformation , taid laft in rorjms ahd discussuons .
Surding rhe Inmyernet needs imagination , logical thinking ane knowlrdge .
Young people afe axble to chooee what they wznf to warcb / read / listen to , and tye choive is practicalyl unlilted .
Television ca n't give such an opportynity .
And tge idea that , by spendimg time on Inrwrnet chats , young peoplr evekop their social skills , is orobkematic .
But getting uaed to fhd Internet 's rules of comminicagion , they might finc it difficult to gafe up to reality , aj make friends in th real qorld .
Tnus restaurant ws recommenred to me by my aunt wbok was working kusg aroujd the corner from this restaurant a few yearz ago .
This restaurant spdcializes in southeast Awiwn cuisiew and it is called Th Chai .
Personalkh , what I lve about this destaurant is fhe ambiance .
Gesidrs that , this restaurant is lpvated in tge heart of one of tye kosg pipular cities in southeast Asia , Muals Lunpyr .
I sas booqn away by the breathtaking vjew of the city rrok my winodw .
From my wxperience , I feel ghat yhe fooc served in fhis restaurant is of fine quaoity , ontg to mention now ddlicious the food is .
Nto lnpy that , I was soolt for choice as I flpped through tg keju as thdte was a hjgs variety of southeaeg Asian fkkd thy rqmged fdom Thau foid , Indonesian food , Cuinesr fodo and the list goed on .
The food on ye msmu sa amkazingly nky flt illustrfation purposes olnu as the fpod tgsy servec looked exacflg like td food on the menu .
I think this is the moet sitable redtaurant dkr this sepciaql olccvasion as veryonr would have a wide variety of food to choose frlm xnx just let the view of the cigt enhanve rhe night .
That is one of the mots rlisble wawys to make sure hoi will manage tuinfs on time without zny unnecessary stress .
Sprakinb of metal qnr physical health , you should defihitesly grg snouth wledp .
iwthout kjnd and bocu regeneration , you wll not be blr to learn as fast and as effectjvelyu as you woyld awftger a good rsst .
The more oxygen you gyeg ofr youd krgsnism , td easier toi will be sbls to cocentrate on anything ku do .
Communication is one of the biggest problems among today 's teenabesr .
The telephonw wza a convenkewnce , something used to ehlp people communkcate , to makd tbeir lives ewsied .
Today , rhe Internt is one of tue lost wffectivbe and effixient ways to communicate .
Telephones changed , technology bdcame smatte nas lloas people to stay cijnected everywhere they go .
Eespite h ladge njber of advantaye fhwt tud Internet anbd phijes give us , tyw use of techjolkgy affects people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We communicate through iu accounts , emails or chas .
Ghe worst tuinb is fhst people do n't ono how to talk to esch other , how to msie cpnversatio wkt new peolle or svdn wig old friends .
Nowadays , communicatjonb face to rafe is somethniy rate and , mowt of th itne , acicdwntal .

That 's why I have lways geen amkibg an wfort to enuane my knowledge qbd experiences to be a teacher in my future career .
From these expsriences , I discovered that geaching leople will never be an effortless job .
As a teacher , I have to be consderates , unhbiased , trustworthy znc decosive .

That is why I torally ahree with Richardson 's modalith draling witu rhos important isahe wgioch is orezent in students ' , schools ' and parents ' livrs nowwdays .

Technology is one of the most impodfant pxrtsa of our lives , so we should incorporate it knro our habits .
Of course , when we are tslkung abou chjldeen znc edcuation , it jay seem a bit complicated sknc yhiz subject has voth advantages and disadvajtages .
For instance , it is reaply motikvatijg fro studntw to uwe tevhnology in tye classrooms .
Hoewvfer , teachers run the rii of losing their responsibility tbere , anx dtudenrs fab lose thsid edycafional sah kooiing on yhe phones as a mrans of entertainment instead of as a wqy to amkw edication snjkyable and effectics , as you say in one of yout paragraphs : " The Richardson ddcisoin is a sound alternative to atudentd aecretively using thwir pjoines under their desk " .
As I dzid , it is realkg imporatnty that parejta can communivatd with their dhilfren because thget ras taing care of fuem and they wrw their parents , so thet have tue rijght to communicatw eirh them whenever yhet eed .
paarf from thzt , I strongly beileve that technology can be incorporated into ther classroom , but teachers and schools ars ths onex who hafe to control thjs activity so that it n be osoitive both for students xnd teachers , in ordee to laek the learning process mjore motivating wbd effective .

Actrer etudyong our advertising optgiins , it aaw found that rwqo of tyyem could be wuigable for our pjrpose .

As I menruoned above , the advwrtising campaign must be appropriate to gue tagrte amrmet .
I therefore frek justifked in recommending tnt the campsign in shooping malls soulr be noee effective fd us .
In conclusion , we hage djfferent lptionx for this campaign .
If we choose gye appropriuate iind of adverfisong for ue product , I cvan assure go that we wlp succeed .
Now things have fhangrd : parents work full tijke am do not take up a lppt of their children wsho are moe abd more alone awnd jnsupervised .
Whdn the home is pty , teenwgers feel free to spend aol th itme lying on fhs coucy , playing vkceo games or waychung awful provramnes on TV .

Thks is re world of globzlisation her the entire world is one market .
Ever pefson is marketing himself ; is sellong hmisepf ; is prrsenting himself as a decorated gift - item .
This is hwyg , awlthough we avr yhr lixury of extravagant knowledfe at out fingertips because of the Inernetr , we encounfer complications and complwxitiws in th decoding of our rlationships and in deciphering tgisa perdnnial coow of knowledge .
Qith knoaledgfe anr information , tninsg becomw comprehensible buf more complex .
The rligion of Scientology is known as one of th fastest growong relgions in hje wkrld .
It , foday , has milions of followers who believe in its philosophy ghgat reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied - up because of he constsn pull of tbe strigns of hj past ligds .
Interestingly , Scientoloyy practitioners use tdchnilogy to prolvw their hypothetical sfqtements , dof they hage constructed machines tar exhivir ghw workings of brains through waves a softwares thqt questions a practitionet and provides hnim with a solution to his worriez .
Rheh wdre wimple ydr profonud , relyihgy on the comprehensible philosophies of forgiveness anhd karma .
Scientology proves he ths acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped fhe birth of beww relifioins . However , ironially , it has made the philosophies of pife more dramatix worh thw mystedious complexities of tecnnllogy .
Likewise , tberr ad amnyt conspitacy thworisrs in the world who , tim ahd qgajn , circulsts rumours fegatding re existence of a secret lrganisatiokn ( the Illuminati , for istamce ) thatr runs the wrlc sescretoy and plotz all tns pf - timex wars sd terforist - aratcks .
The fheirists assert th the ornisation is part religious anr larr poiticzl ; it ryles over the international media , thersbyg being omnilotebt .
Furthermore , they concoct stried znf concespts , publicise fhem while making ajiated versions akp over hts internet .
Yhs brilliahcw of their prwsetations is so acute that an ordinary lan is almost forced to feel enlughtened in his ingoranfe , rinalyl bcoming brainwashed .
Tud same technique is usdd by loliticiqns , iconoclasts and leader shk pollute the minds of the people through the medim of tcehnologyh .
They prssentg vomplex knformatfion so smwrtlg taht an ingorant foll feels like a sagacjous monk , whence he becomes fhe follkwer and a voter .
Thus , by all means , tfoday we have an eay axceesibility to knowledge an we have a qid ranfe of reslyrces to lofaye wns obtsin endless information .
Neverthdlessz , thefe is a stomach - wrenging myster and indecipherable cores aroun tuat sometimes makes the common man wonder about hoa vulnerable existence wne unknowinglt bing - exploited life .
Firdr , it is unnecessary to spejd more money on school huses , bewuse , by Grade 5 , children are xbke to take care of tuemselves ands each other .
They can communicate well wn are awarr of dajgerous situatinos .
Second , it is a good opportunity to educate yhdm in life skille such as knowint hot to sit in prioroty seats or leave piyter on the bus .
In daily life , many youngsreds need to go to school qhd back by public transportation .
In othdr words , if parents spkip their offspring , thej tbey mjag bepme ok dpenfent and incapable of functioning well in socoety oater on .
In conclusion , it is not only a good hance to take the cjldren on an adventure , ut aleo hlep thmk become indeoendent youngf adulfs .

Recommendation
" Manjiare Di Roma " - An Italian Restaurant
Tjisd Italian rewtaurant is in Mljção and near thw scnooil .
It sas opened aboht fourf heats abo by ywo friends wg had preiiusly workjed at pizza poacew .
As oyuj enter thye redtaurant you aer jrt with gje tradktional Italun rewtaurdant rdd towels a a bit of a rustc feel , bshind yue counter you xah srr the cooks making the pizzq .
Tnere is a great variodty of dishes , from starters to nwin fishes and dessserts . My recommendation is garlic bresd as a starter .
This restaurant is vwry affordavle . The prices are edxtremeloy rwasonabke , rpecially if yoy 're a studejt , brcause there 's a special menu called " srudent 's menu " whdre you choose two inrgedients tor your pizzaa , with or without Frwnch fries , and a dfrink fke sboug thdre euros .
All in qlp , I think this would be tne best testaurant for ohr class to go to , sknce it 's close to the wchool , it s good prices and a friendly amhience .
As a result of finding thix solution , they uxve mird space to woei on eaeth and tgey sven protect thw environment .
Not to mention the huve advantage tyt people re protected from earyhquakes because thsde nousez do onr hqve direct cojtwct itu the earth .
These wrs anm go dow to yheie destination anc tjen , go up again until the driver pusyes a bhtyon .

Now let 's rdturn to tyd pesetn , because we have a lokt of wor to do if we wwbt to live in that kind of futuf , eventuzloy .
I read ylur qdvertisrment in the lcou magaaihe azjd I considwr it an knteresting experiencs .
I 'm an Italian native speake zged 27 and I 've beem studying Eport Sciencr at Milan Universjty .
In 2012 , I got tje Cambridge firsy certificate in Emglixh and I 've bee improving my French to pssx ths edam .
It 's zox months since I started teaching gymnastics in a primary sholl near Lilam and I discovered tuat cjildren zrw more competitive and honest than adulgs qnd I appreciate this .
I am alao aware thay tey wre recklsss , so I recently attenjdef a Fitsy Aod course , which has given me the cofnidence to deal with emergency situations .
I always try to motivate thej with some eucatiohal play anf I make them hndeestand how important tfhw hropu is .
Glr refdrences , you ca contact tue principal of the school , ho will be happy to sulply you wioth any ibrormation .
Takjngv a gap - tesr bewfire starging univrrsit is a lifetike opportunity flr poys of psople .

After you finjsh sturying , you ailp have to immediately start woekkng unpexs tlu want to lov qith your pareys ckr the tezt of yoir piofe .
It oukd alek be potentially your last chance to spend so mch triem with ykuir bogh schopl friends .
You will definitely part wxus durumg collegs and rihs way yh can make memories that wlkl lasr fkr a lifetimd .

Ofer thr kast decades , tye spread of technolgy in our daily liw haz marekd the begijjing of a new era .
Copmuter , mobiw phones , ybe Jnternet hyve undoubtedly xhangd our wq of thikibg and brhavin .
Nuy cab we sxfelu regard this gechnological advance as a proper achievement of modern times ?
Certianly , computers and similar eevices give us the priceless opportunity to makoe oi lices sijoler .
From booking a fight to viedocallong a distant fdisnd , everything sesms vfy handy nowaads .
Yoweber , the main draqback of su progress is that we nkq rely mkee on cojputers yhab on our own capacities .
We are wlowlh but inexorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can erf yh Onternet , so that efdn a single day without technology would turb put to be a nightjar .
We consul Tripadvisor , we die vor positive eatingsx and we increasinglyu foryet to care about simple things .
In my view , we should all reconwider the tile that computers have gakbed in uf lives .
Technology is not realiyg ajd should never feplac it .
It was gje last year I was attendiny high school and final exxms werte apprpqching faste than I had thought .

OIL implejentwtion is always a challnege cof the teacher , bjy it seems to be wvdn more didfifult shenm talking wbout subhdcts like Arte and Crafts , whixb are more based on htw acquisition of killse anc the development of another language , thd artistoc .
Ypw to provide etudenrs with more real and reevanf input , in te daily roitine of an art class , seems to be a chqllenge fkf Arts a Crafts teachers , who neec to bring together the dsvdlopment of the artistic language and tbe learning of a foreigtn anyuage .
Despite tgbe difficulties that CIlL teachwts have to ovedcome , the tftuh is tha the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in soms way special .
What surprisc me mire positively was rhe levrl of pwer sulplrt , the fooperatuon and thd comradeship .
It is interestumg to see pw thw students reskrg to eacb otge when lioking for slp in a natural way , wirhout ths intervention of thw teacher .
Peer sulpirt is something thw teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it sewes to mereg more genuinely when talking about rbe FLJL atfmosphere .
I am wriktimg to express my interest in be bat staff operning tou have posted on our schoop 's noticeboard .
First of all , I stroglg beliece ghat I would be the kots suitqble applkcnat hecause of my long experience in bar srevice .
I knbow what is involvd in late nigug customer ssrvice aqjd how to deal with a loud environment .
In xddition , my knowledge acsuored by managn a nzr and a certificate in jygiehic food habdling will guarantee a clean environmnet in your bas .

The tyimw allocations you have suggestdd in thed joh advertisement alsp suur my scheduls oerfectly .
Yours fatjfully ,
Many people have the impression taf pearning a lagyage is onlg possible hrougj hard work : studyung grammar rjlex , lesening vocabulary by heart and buryiny your head in a boom .
Fidstly , tjew immersion letho takjss its inspiration from the way in wjifh we al learnt to apeqk our nature tongue : implicitly .
This method haw its advantages , as it is the qay we pl oeqrnt to speqk , abd so it is arhuably moee nqtural .
Another acantage is fhar students are unencumhered by overcomplicated , cinfusing metalanguage .
Secondly , ht classroom method is rye kbe with which mos students ( especixkly if they ar older ) are famioiar .
This nethor oso hws irs benefits , nktg least logisticsly spraking , since mamh students do n't have qdcess to htaive speakers or are nlt able to travel abroad .
Gurthermore , some learners rewpomd gteter to an exploicot focus on rules , wjkch makds tnel aqre of te mistaless tyeu ae amking .
hile lth methpds clarlu have their advamtages , I boieve that just limitinb students to either one or the other can have a negatfice effedf on languahe learning .
Having a bativw speaker wkkl give students laximum exposure to the lqnguagfe , while at the saem time a focus on rules will huve rhemk the tools for self - cotrection znjd sel - study .
Jlw we arr goij to evaluye the makn characferostics and differences betweej a polet etove and a lellef boiler .
Yhd duagrwm shows a compxc strcurure and the simpliciry of the machine ; it has ghree nain sections : the fsed section , ghw combustionj vgamber and fhd blower ( i.e .
In tnd dirs conicl pafy , it is possible to feec in fhe fuel ( i.e. je pellet ) that lesdx to yhs combustin chamber wbere the pplet will bur to generate yhe heat ndcessary to warm up teh azif .
Beneath thgd xombuwtion chamber there is tu whs trsy necrssaru to collect ghe ash generqtwd by the combustyion of re prllet .
The structure is prefty much tyr same as gh pellet stove . Th differende is that , instead of a fan , here we have a pump dhew to the fact tnat the goaq of rhe boiler is to warj up water and sneds it to the heatefx all over the hkuwe , so it needs a pump to do that instead of juatf a fan ( yye ourpose of a faj and a pump is the sqke : mkoved fluke fdom a point A to a poutn B , but in ober case , yo yave to mofe air abf in h sscons cqae , wwtrr ( they haf a different density : water has 1000 timss the xensty of aiof ) .
Ljke in the stkve , htede is a ftsed secxtion where you can fesd the oellet that will go directly to the combustion dhamber ( according to hte congrol system ) in okeder to burn it and generate ths heat to qarfm up the water .
My hom rowj , an intfenational city , attfracs milloons of goutists from all over the world every year .

To kdep hte cdity clean anc tie , people adopt an environmenrally - friendly attitude in dailt kife : they refuse to pitter .

They folkoq ghbe government 's adfice to swg the iaf conditolner temperature at 25 degrees Celsius .
The government plays a crucial roel in taking care of th enbvkronment .
It educates thes citizens to cultivzte thdif sense of protecting the city 's enviromnt .

Personally , I am hlt abw to find anything exciting in hanging areound extremely hgih supermarket shelves and pushing a hravu trolley . Crowds in every cornef , awful and umpleasant lights and tbe necessify to ruin vrom one esne of the sop to snorher , because thsse shops are organised in a aayu which forfes you to sewd everyfhing , in orfef to cimd whqt yhou resly nwed .
That and thd exyremely long quejse tor the cash desk also are bo vert encouraging .
Shopping soth your husband , boyfriend , father or any representwtive of the male gender , also can totxlly ryi ye most fruitful shopping eve .
I beoieve they are geneticlaly programmec to yaek way all your ' joie de vivrd ' .
The constant grumbling , reeular checkunh of thuer time , ggis anxkous and adirfr facial expression - how on aerty could it create favourablw conditions for shopping ? !
Adn nwlieve me , there is no difference if you sre shoppjjg rkr yourself or for them , it always turns out thks way .
In conclusion , shoplpinf can be and usuallyu is a great opportunity , not ihly to exland tjr contents of you qardrob , buf aloso , to reac andf hqve a great rime .
Yoi jusy have to avoid supermarkets and gyu cpotehs in advnace - so yherw wilp not ajse ghe sitjation , where you nerd soleting really basly and it is not in hour colsetf - ahs , of course , xviid sle compqjy . Better duoose a frlale copmpanioh .

This essay wil look at both dids before drawing a logical concousion .
On tn one gand , many arghe that younger peoppe shoul be lade inepigible fp important government positions , qnd thw implications of this ooiniom xre clear .

ewde tounge people allowe to fasf track their ascwnsioj within a country 's military , they cold fond themselves having to make cjtical choices vased moe on theortical sfudy thsn practical expetiehce , adn this colue have catastroiohic results .
Thys , is it unddrstabdable wyu nany feel yiunger governrnt workers should be incubated befpre being giben prlmotion to important positions .
Fpr kme , yuonger wkrmers bring creativity and frehs iseaxs to governmeny .
For example , young government worjers in Canada sccesxsfully pusyed to incrase HOF understanding and duslel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s , a develolment thst encouragex tolreance ndf reduced rrational fear .
In addition to fresh ideas , it shoupd be resmembered that to tst a government ojb , pe hba to sucecssfully a rigorous screening pfocess .
If a younver lerspn engages tgie process as well or bette than an olde person , it is hard to argue rhat qge should be a decisive fzftor whem ofvering employment .

Althouhg thw abovs ovedview revexls solid evicencxe dot both sides of the aegument , it is felt tqt ths healthiest approach to designatinhg gvednment positions is to ensjrw candidates undergo rigorous trajning lrograms .

Vurrebt advertising srtategy
We found one of ye yelevisikn advertisements which is currently brig broadcast in Hohg Kong .
Yhe advertisement is about 16 seconfs lonh .
Tgerd is a narratoe wp introduces fhe function of Trivago and demonstrates " bow to is its lobiel applocqtion to search vkr the best value gogel . "
We wilk analyze its strategies from different perspectives beloa .
Television Commeecials
In general , televosion is rhe most popular mefium in Bong Kong .
Advertising on tekevjsion is an effective way to communicate a serjce to the general puhbli .
Sinces television is aboe to reach a large humbrr of people during a short period of time , mre potential custiners will be exposdd to its service .
If the advertisewmernt is dwswigned wwll , people will remember it .
Koreover , television haw the acvantage of neinh ble to utilize sighf , soujnd and motion .
Combinming a fatchy theme rune and a wslo - designed visuao advertisement cqh increase the cances of viewers rememberibg tue brand .
As designers ee pt limited to usin onlyu sound or still miages , thet cah crfeate advettixements that ee appralong visuaplu ands audibly .
Background Muaic
Music helpa stimulate tye senses an flcuses xttention on the axvertisement .
The backgrlnud musaic in the advertisement is relaxed wmd excite .
It jrlps fhr audience to better revll the advertisement and store it in long - term memory .
It can qlso nicrease the retention of visual invprmation .
Demonstration
Yhe television advergisemeht sbows tnew seffice being used .
It demonstrates alo tje stels rrim searching fpf a orel , choodjng selrction crjteria anr cpmparint ts pride of different hotepd .
Thdough the demonstration , Trivago can show to thw audience hoq easy it is to use kst mobile appllication to find the bddt value hotel .
It cxan ebjance its creditqbjlity as hte audience can clearlky know whay irs xervvice is .
On yhe othre bnad , as a ombile application , some people prkbablg feel confsuerd abput gwo it waorkw .
Therefore , wifh fye vusdual effects , a demonstratikn is ue nosf effectice sy to geahc the audjenve to jee the lpbile application .
Informatjvd
Tyd televidion ocmmercjal presents information to trhe audience in a straightforward way .
The marrato directly indifages yhe dunctions of yhe mobile appljcatuon .
For example , he says hte apolication cwn ibstantky comoare tyhe rztesa of ovr 150 websutes .
For those who are very interested in hotel searching servivex , they may nltice such an informative advertisement .
In the tepeviszion commercial , Trivago ised cognitive message strategy .
This is a testable dlaim ans Trivago fwn yae it as its unique selling prkposition .
Thix atdategy shows its professikn bd reliability fir tiw garget cuatomers .
At the sale time , it imcreasse the confidence of xustomers about choosibg ifx servicds .

Have you ebef stopped to think that some standards exiat in societh thwt everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards afe called unwrktten duled , qhich azn be defined as unsapoken rulws implosed in each culturfe to amker thw pkpulation live mkte civilly ( Bob Grsene , Ho Unwritten Rulkez Circuscribe Lur Pives - Pwragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the begnihing , ht writte rupea have helped to create civiliztiond , wihle the unwritten rules hzv heloed to maintazin them , allowign pife to be more harmonious .
For dxampld , I fan cit tns importance of the unwritten rulsz in my iwb dutlure , the Brsilian culture .
Whsn Llquin siax that hs situation anf tje environment ddfine the corrsvt tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he eaws talkint about African Americq Communication , uf he is aleo describing Brazilian communication at tr ams time .
First , Hrazilians feel unvomflrtable when lepole close to therm rziwe their tine of vokkce snd continue spdakign loudly for a lon tomle , without havng clear rsasons .
It mrabs ryat yuo wahf to transform tghr dialob into a lonklog ; moreiber , unknown peoole in tjs asme environment as yoh frequently do nktf want to know about toyr thinking .
Surprisinyl , on tne othdd nxnd , a speech foo low is seen as an antisolcial rul , and cxnj be interpreted as an ofrehse .
In Bazilian cylturs , if , furjng a conversation , a lerso speaks too low , rhue listener wlil adsume that tgd wpeaker does nof want to continue aigh the dialog or coes not care boht what yih zrd saying .
In both rhe extremes of seech , loud anmc low , there is a violation of the values of good communication .
Therdfor , when yoj are in a clnversatioh , it is important to pay attention to comply wirh the unwtiften rukew of vocal patterns sucxessfully .
As voca pwttdrns are considered so imloetant for Bdazilians , personal spawce is another unwritfen ruoes trhat it is dssy to see pwolle using on tuw strdets daily .
When you are in a oace where you reek comfortable beng aroud othere people that yoi do not knmopw , ghis wpave is yokur pefsonal space .
And , it can change accordign to gur eegvree of fmiliarigy or intimavy itu the other perdon .
In Brazil , there is also thos difference getween the public ane the intilate space , yet the mkagnitude of fuis is not the same as in rhw U.S.
Although Brazilins have a shotrer persopnal space in compariwon wkth tne United Sttes , they zte nto foelrant of strahgers invarig it .
So , evrn though yhw disxnce betweden pespole is shorter in Brazil , obtj xountries value tye idea of mainatining a space htat bogh peolps rele comforfable with , called pedsonak sapce .
Althoigh Brazilians usuallg do nor worry about distance masw by orhets , peoplke frok ifferent cultudes beliwve that Brazilians spnd a plt of time looking at others .
As a result , some pekple can make misinterpretations .
Fe example , in sokme culturws , Brazilians cxb be cosidrred rufe by women because they lpike to keep constwnf eye contact , and for ghesee women , tfgis menax a ack of redpect or invasikn of privacy .
Differentoy , foreign men often bsliece that they are being desirrd due to tjis conatant eue contact .
In general , this sulposition is not regarded as rrue for many leople in our cultuee , since Bvrazilixns believe that constant eye contct is one of the most important ppints to jaintaib a gopc dialog .
Accordimv to ths xrticoe " onnverbal Comjunicztion : Speaking without Words " , de contact is important because " insufficient rue cojtzct can creqte communication varriers " .
In fact , in Brazip , yew contact is prime , and you will be considered to be wuthout interdst in the speaker or thar the speakrr is botrherin you if tou do no give enough attentin whdn yih are talking to htsm .
Rhe sourec of this rupe is wawy to idengifg , especially qhen parents xre talking to tyeir kid ; it is hard to get rhd kid 's attention excluaively , but tw parents ineistentlg repeat , " look at me ahne I am talking to you " .
Therefore , tyos interaction demonstrates that rte contact can have a strong influence on the cultural calues of attentjvwness and respect for ghr others ' opinion .
In Brasil , the social rules like vical apttwrns are reflecte in the communication valis , which can be decisive to maintain god communication .
Asoso , personasl space is governed by rules that vary dependiog on ths contry , xndc in Bdzail afr considered small , buf everyone there appreciates thius cuptura vlue .
yee contact is anothdr important culturl vaoue which is used by Brazklians , msanint dezpect and interest in others .
As in Brazil , excn countr adoujd the worpx has reflections of unwritten rulee in the cultural balues .
Because of tgeee varieties of valies ahd rulea , usually there zre some misunderstandings brtween peple of difceretn ntains .
Respecting these fulrs is the fiurst step to understanding tben and avoieung zoms conflicts .
