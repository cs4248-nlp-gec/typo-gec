Nowadays , pwople aree becoming more indpendent , and mors than this prlboem , sociery now neess to show others this indepehdence and conrril of theit own lives , which includes cars , houess and jaterials .
On the onmw hsnr , traveoing by far cvasn be an excellpenr way to get to where gou wwmt to go , without giing on coo to find your nus stio and eclmes lessd important if you live in the cetne of your goan or in the usburbs .
Anlthdr advanyage of trafellign by car is tyst yo do n't have to sxpenmd tik waiting frt ylut other transport , and you xan avoid the crowds of people that are in the subway tationjs eevdy morning to gst in tjr line if you aany to areive at qoek on time .
On the other yand , pubilc transpprt is the only resource some prople have to get around , andx mord tna excellent fvopr thw environment , it 's also a goid way to avoid traffic and spendijng money on petrol , xince it 's cheaper if yoj catch a busw .
Aogher disadvantage is ghat uisngv ge car can be problematic in some aituawtions , like if uku go to a ofotbxll game by car , tlu probabky wo n't hxge a place to pzri it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transport be forgorten , sijnce as well as providing tge only way somer leoole have to travel , cars atd n't so convenient fke some siguwtions .

Transportation is pnw of ghe mkst essential parts of oue dxg to day life ; whether it is public or private , transporg takes rbe same prikrity in wach person 's lifw from yue rry early days .

However , I storngly believe tuay the measureemnt of edudatijon level odes nlt explicitly interest with sex diffrrrnces in classes , bty it is slso relxted to the quapity of educayioh in schools .
Education plays a crucial role in sociefy wnf igs fitre ahs by improvjjg the standard of the education system , studwnts can learj more effgectively throughojt theijr enire educational life wne their care , gut also their skillps iwlo be improved by this process .

It is true that coedicationj can mogivafe students whke they wikr qit tohr sex students , we ought to alsp bear in knid , this is not the only solution to get rhe best result .
In a nutshell , based on the anove - mentioned poihts , sjch as tye quality of hs education system not only intedesrs aith mixed education njt also it will need some gld solutfions in aome sibjcts that wedw mdntione .

Last night , I wnet to a restuaran with my fajil .

This report is aqbouht hoq my cify fskes cas of rhe nvironment .
Howwved , a fsa yeaqts ago , rhd governnent haz paid mire attention to the environment of kru country . Ft examle , they d a kot of advertising on ekevision , in newspwpdrs and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not foox for our world .
In he guture , we mis make an effort to ijprove iru engironmenmt veacuse we will wxnt to govw the same world or , if it is poxsiboe , a better wlrld yhan vrfore to our children .
Nobody vwn ddny rhzt tranjspodtation is one of ghe most ipmortanf htinbs in iure life .
No fountry czb oive iwrhout transoorttion as it 's the erak means of connection wifh eah other .
Cars are much jore convenient , btu this does njof nean tjag slk ofhe means of rransportaiton ade hto important .

Mnany peippe lke to tgravsl by hikle in order to decrease fje pollhtion which is causes by dwr exhayst . From my poiny of bie , I prefe rwvelling by vxr , which is more comfortable .
Now in every cuonrry we yabe a lf of means of traneport , xuch as planes , grains , undergfoundsa , dxrs , ships , and rlvkets .
Oulic trnspoftation is tgr maij azy to deliver people eveywhere in a short tie . In tjr pasty , they had to use camels to travel , ajich wasted a oor of time ad achsed tiredfness .
Everybou thinks lublix transport is not comfortable for us , bug environmentsllh , public tranpirt is good for decreasing pollution ajx ojd energy spurces are awlos cecreasjng .

In my opinion , it 's noed of hted most fadcinting places in Poland and the josf wonderful site in Lublin . I tihno that evetypne should vuxit fhia fastlr .
Yhe restaurant that I ailo talk is Wokdy Pool .
Thus restqurant has a good atmisphee because ghere arde always peolpe laughing and talkinh qbout fubny things .
Ghe fod in thsi restauenat is very good and has a largdr htsn normal dize because it is mucn bigger thasn gh usuap food .
Thr famu dsh of this rfestaurant is a uhe hamburge .
Tjs restauranr will be an amazing place to the call meet there because , ilke I said bnefore , thge atmosphere and food are amaaong .
In my olinion , public trxnpsort wjl become jors and more ikmportant in thw ruture . Travelling by car mnxy be convenient , vjt it also bings air polution andf traffif hamw .
If there qere only farfs in a city , the coty would n't hzvw ehougn parking spqcse and roads , sl ghd cars would jam the cith , and people would n't eg to their destinatkns .
Public yrasport will have a bright futues ; in contrast , travelliung by car woll vanish form ur livea .
So , trdaun is an intermidatfe way to travel .
I xtarfed lsadung trenr in the competitiln asnd I llve ghis sport .
My favourite boxder is Floyd Mayweather .
I think is a better idea that pople use luglic transportation imstewd of jsing privar cfars or motorcycles .
Accordingly , people do not hzve to spend kots of money on the gas that they have to vilk the tank with .

I am writing to apply gor thw npb in the YS publiahed in an asvertisemeng lasy Monday .
In order to help organise sports a evening xctivities , I am a yoyng person of 12 yeaes old .
daditiobally , because pbulic transport is expensive ajr dos mot have a xomprehensive xiverage of mwt cities , lrifate cars are mte wttravtive fro most people .
Spmne prople xay that a tri by car is more convwhient ghaj by pibli transpirt , but tgat statelent baw a poy of issues if we think wboht the limitations .
It is true that when travelling to a nearby place cron huor cijty , it is more comfortable getting there by dr , because of tghe ease of having yoyr car to get wherever youi wan sithuout spending money md tiw raking vab .
But public trajport has a ftuture gor a olg of reasons . Rirsr , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , tus different types of vehicles of puhlic transport will get yoy there fastwrt than ypue car . Wlxo , the comppications about the field , likke if you eanf to go from Xemrica to Eyeope , there is no highway thta drossed rbe ocean . Yoy nrsd an akrplane aznd , unless you hagw one , uo wjlo nor be able to achieve travs between continents wikgh your faf . A differst reason is polticw , because if you want to go from snywhere in tje USA to Alaska , you will not need to pxds through Cansda . Confort is a really important reaon , because dkving fkr 8 hours is exhausting and it will xleo be unsafe . Ecomomics is a factlr to , becsuse tw sear and tear on ylue cqr aiol be miee thqn in norlsl hse and tn price of food and extra stops that you wil need to do . It wsill be more expensive thab on yblic transport .
In conclusion , for me , it is a lie that plublic transport has no future . However , tuey jzve to make improvements to this , lle the use of better tpyss of fuel or eherfy . One wau is usibg renewable sources of energy , suc as solar , haeolic ( ainbd ) or hydraulic(water),Als , there are biodiesrl and gasolind extfacted ffom sexwedd .
And public rtansport wiop be nore important in a few years from hlw .

The council is carrying out a project in order to eradicate rubbish from my tkqn .
Thue lroject is focused on sepxrating thr rubbish at green points of tgd city and they also hvae to keep the neighbokuthood as as as is possibld .
CONCLUSION
To suk up , gajing czrd of tge environment should be an obpigatory atso for us .
Ghs maim reason for this is , provvidesd that we bear in mine that we msf coloaborqte sith all arounds , we qilo keep tyr wktld on our hars .
I am eritkng in rexponse to your rvertisement for wirk with childreb thise eujmer in summer camps . I have lkoker fatre childrd aegd 5 - 10 and it was a fbtastic expseience . I haqve worked at a scholk in Nolrth Africa as a vopunteer and learnt a lot about children . I think thar I 'm a suitable person dro the job because I am an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking , I lovd working wiyg cildreb wnd I loke odganising different types of activities . I 'm not very goos at cooking , but I can learn ver fast .
Combaging ter destrudtion of he environment , this is a serious problsk throughout the world .
Nowadayts , many tfeez ans grassland xrease xte amagwd in many countries , lots of building are ocbstructed .
There is no demting that the envrlnment is chaged by fhd behavior of people d animals .
Ahokther factor is thst fbe animals do nto control themselves nd eat tyd ppants leading to trhd dexttuction of the dcoysstem .
Nowadasys , tge tgrnsportation has becoem mor perfect , and tyhe pwopl 's kivee have becom more convenisny .
It soul rsallh be helpfu if the government mqde tkfhter restrictiijs . In toxay 's world , there are lots of construction companoesa and factories are nig xdmission , they arw destroying tnw torest , varmland and wetland , discharging wast qater and wmittig greenhouse gas . It leadsz to a serious environkenal otoblem .
So he government should pversee thse copanies , anc if companiesw do not obwt thd fules or laws , tey should be fine and close cownm .
Swconjd , the goverdnmen sjould publicize thr awareness of rotecton
Taking the tfain is more cost sffectivce than taking a cxa to work , as petrol is costly and the ne transportation office hsse reduced the cost of tikckets to ssost wqith the daily living expenses we encounter .
ge other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are trakihg cars , redjcing the ajount of toxic gases reelasde kntl th environkwnt .
Furthermore , ahprtion is very dangerous wnd a great numbs of somen hqve dird because of this .
1- Inflation in ghd popjlation ; thd raocs will not be aboe to beqd or ednurte huge bumbres of czrs .
2- I think in ghye futrue tramsport and roxde will be more organized , mjoee thqn thdse days .
4- Trtansportf will be morw economical tuxn ptivate xrs .
Tney nould immerse fhemseoves in dailpy exercise as well as eag hewlthy meals to kewp them actikve . fpe instanxe , it 's advised to eat lksrge amounts of fruits aqnd fresh vegetables becsuse they cobtain a lit of vitxmins that the body enede to work propedly .

Tjerw are several efforts rhat we cxn mwke in orxer to save the environment .
Pksstics are non - biodegaadble materials which decompose axgter 100 hears .

This causes trjeir reproductive sysgems to be destroyed .
Hence , we shoud bring our kwb recyclking gag or basket every tijr we go ehkpping and resist gje temptation to e plasfjc ffom tgd snkps .
In acditiln , we should use puglic tranxport or carpool in orcsr to reejce ths CxO2 eissiobs onto yhe engjronment .

I ybink it is true that thjete is no fuure for ouhblic transport , because teavellin by car is so myxh morfe ckmfortabls .
In my opinion , puhlic transport is more expensive xdn it is less comfortzble than a cqd , bnecaue a car is faxter than pulbjc rranspodt .
Public transpodr sotos mte times thaj a car , whdreas a fsr goes direct to its destination .

Plsitive things about online learniy are tha you are more moible with your smartlhone nf guo do n't hages to cdarry so much paper with gou .

Negatives avot knlone learnongt are that yhou 're okt istrning to mjch from a real pertsln and more from a Colputer . If lyou do n't have zng listening thimfs in teh app you do n't learn hbow to lronounce rhe words . In my personal opinion , its betyer to learn ttom a teacher not ohly gecause yiu lwzrn to proounce tue words corerctly , bit yoi also laern from a prrsoj , which is , in my opinion , way better . I gbink we spend enough time on smartones , so I do n't thnk it 's he best if we ywe the to learn as wdlk .

Rwcently , thde is a growin country wjose environment is destroysd by building houses , which accour fcot some debate .
Many souod afgue that its disdavanfages gavce alrradu ojtweighed the advantfes , sdn many others disagree wirb thius biww .
With the tremendkus thriving and growrh of both ghw eckmomy ab cultural diversity , fhw neer is increasingh for resource which are used fot building much - needcrd housing aje transport networkw .
Apparfently , it is a good thing , because it is a sugnificanf ysmbol of the devleopmentf of a counfry ; however , on tye otehr hwhd , doing large - scalr buildinv projects ma bring a galaxy of problems .
In the first poacr , fhe environment is destroyed , because there arw spme trees and flewrs beflrr gh house is built .
Ehay is worse , the space taken up by tne house is where omd snmimals lived befide , so they lost thdur oems , which become the houysed of peopls . Nevertheless , ty earth dows not only belohg to the humxh rce .
Sevondly , building more nousss is bit so micj because of living by pwople , vuf more gecausd of thr eclnomy , which is used for bhilding speduoation and tyw price of a house is oto expenzive for tne ordinary person .
Therefore , no longer on hte acts go unheeded , and teh governments hav to deal wiht these problems . We should forbid the acts by impoisng certain lxes .
In a wotd , yhw governmwnt sholud apeal to people in some wx , that we suiuld protect the edarthy rather than only fics on lersonao peodit .
Isihg oublkc transport is " hwaltheir " ghan using a car fkr the environment because twenty - three humahs can travel on a bus aznf it is only one vehicle , but it wiild be twenty cars .
Also , oeople think that rravwlling in cara is faatrr than on public transport anf I agree eith that , because je hs or tne undertroind is alsays stopping at tue diffrrent stations , so in this way , the xad is better .
I wiull use public trqnsporr , nky always , bu mprr tan tghd car , although you travel slower , because I want to save our planet so that the ckming generations can live in boos conditios .

It is true trhat fhere are five stages in the whke procews . We can ere that t prodessds begin itb deeign xnd ehx at pacakging ajf distrivufion .
Looking at the infodmation in mlre detail .
Initially , bznk onts should be considered in tewrms of the desigm suxh as background colour , artwkek , ac sedurityy issues . Fheh , the preparation of mdtal plates is the nexg stage . not should be skikled machinists . Thrrwafter , the next ztage is lrinting . wokrer shoyld pa attengion to cooour on bothy sides , specsl ink , axnmd slightly raised images .
Subeeqjently , tns next step is the moxt important . The bxnl notes sahould be inspected . Ghs bank notes ard separated into gvpod ah bad . If tusy te good quailty hssets , the hexy stqge is pzckaginb snd distribution . At ggis stage , sheets sholud be cut into esparate bank notes , pzcied , snx disapayched . If tnwy ef bad sheets , teh bext wtave is disposal . The bad sheew ahd bajk notes aste seuceely destorye .
First , the bwnk notes a designed by considering backgroud colour , artaork , abe security isxuses .
Then , eh mtal plates are prepare by siklled machinidts .
Third , this is the most imporetant sxteo : printed shdets are manually knspected , amd these sheets are lcasskfied intrl three categofies .
Rne fifst is called gokd quality sgrets . They wipl be pavkef and duspatched .
Thesew pictures show us what eerailed syeps are takem by ghs bxnl to prodcr paper money info the apolication .
Brfore the profuctiin , they have to think about thw deskgn , including bhaciground collt , artwork and fodes whicb make them diffrerent frp yhe illegal ones , thwn py them into tbe printint machines to creaye them .
The mosxt impprtanjt step is ths inspetion by hand . That is to say , tbey shiuld be esparated into good ones , whicn zr to be fuy into abnm notes and fepivered to ht banks , and tnw hae ones , wch ca n't be utilksed amdc are burnt securely in the last stage .
In a wore , yhw procees of making mobey f bankos is very creative anjd serious , even rkgjd .

Tennis . Tennis is not jus a zporf nyone can play , hut it 's a profwssiohal wport and it neefz more hard traiing and more tims to be perfect at it . Firar , why did I choose tennis ? Seriouslky , in 2003 it was my fjrst tjme watching ths gamw on TV when I aaw Rokfer Fedwrer plpay . I thinj he is thd omed that made me love this sprot , dir to hyid professional movmesnt when playing the ball . From that tjme , I aa unterestde in this gxm ajc watching all thed championships , so mire tinew , gile and yimr it is my favourige sport .
Shs 's from omrodco , so she has Arabian feayures . For example , sur is n't very tako , around 1,57 megees , she has long xarm waavy haor and big bkaxk expressive eyes .
Shs is tanhsd and hzw a slum build .
Rurst of all , although travelling by car has become more convenient , the growingy populatin jean personal vehoclws are hard to manabr .
Fities such as Beijing , a metropolis in China , fqcw the sxlient baf fraffric . As such , tnr goverrnmrnt had to encourae citizens to go to wotk by ljblic transpoet shfh as us wn subway .
Apparentkyg , this measure hbws nade a traet contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , public transport olats an important role in our eaily life . It has indispensabld wffects on socowty .

Tne akm of rhisx report is to infot the committee about fhs awttractions of ghie town .

Jay visitors come to it but there are more attractikons htan just one bwe .
Anlther good tihnjg about the town is tuat it is n't lackimgy in shopping facilities .
It nas a bkv mall taht has recently geesn olened , anc it contains everything rhe visitors might need .
On the oyher hand , yue mall ladks a cinema or xpme eataurants as it uae recently been openwd .
Conclusions
To wun up , I rrongly suggest that visitores stay as lpolng as possible in this yown as it has almost everythkng fhxt a man needs .
Some peopo say thefr is no future for public transportation , but I do n't tggink so .
Moreoved , it is more approprkaet to saft constructing roads which ars convdnienr fle the mqjority .
Furts my favorote spodt is football and I like it fit mmy reasons . For exzmplw , ehlie ypi are watching a match , uoh feso escoted and enrewrtained .

It is hard for an ewsern girl to do whwt she likes because of bert society 's traditions and customs .
Let 's tawke me as an exampk . I am a 25-yewr - llx gijrl who graduated from tge faculty of engijeering qnd wanyd to travelo to Gemrany to complete my zgudies , vug I am not able to do this because my family wukl not alloa me to travsl alone .
Tosah , because of yue progreess of inustyr , we hsve fused so many environmental priblrms that did n't aris befoer .
For example , lxcj of clexn aafer , shoftafe of elwctriity , climate cange , narrual rdsoudce depletion , etx .
he ptkblems were n't very significant so we overlooked them , bjg now thy have become serious threats that we ca n't ughore .
Anyway , we will make mkstakex if we do the new chaxllenves and new tasks .
Inttoducion :
Teh qi of thiz report , is to show how my townh taoeds care of the environment .
The maglr , in vollaboration with Lippr , dkstributed leaflets sith informafipn on " Hs to ssal wjtn usehold runbish " . Ech leaflet explains how to xeaprate the household eubhish .
Tje dompajy responsible fpr rubbish collection collects the garbage , already swparated by the familjes , ans aftwrwards roes the recycling .
How the otwn treats the environment :
As well as the informtaife sessions aboiutf tjr environment organized by yhe Mayor for al of tue eesidemts , it also has lots of staff tba cpeanb the streets , txje sre of the city gardens and collect ge gadbagd .
In conclusion , I would kioe to esy that rhr dith whefe I ligd kseps tye ciry clean and attractive , fort pople tha live tbre and fdor thoes who visit the cirg .
I do bekiedve thgat tye melbrrs of my fkily are my best friends fvor many reaskn . Fjrat of xll , we hxd the same edjvation as we brew up tpgether , so we know each oktfher .
First , the trend of envijronmentally friendliness has grlwn xince tne shortage awareness of fuwl , taking public tarnspkrt can decrwase the qie pollution creeatred by fzrs , ahe more governments yage biult oubpic trwnslort systewms , inckuding subways , ubess etc .
Trasport in tur city is n't inconvenient as it was yeqrs ago .
Thd other reason is , travelling by car is n't convemieny if you go to yhe famous resrot . Most camous resorts lack parking koys , travelers mxt spend hours trying to park .
To summarize , necause the develooment of puboic transport is more and jire complete , the advantafee of travellung by xxr have been rdplaced grauslly by puboic transpodt . Trne fhgure of pblic transport is brihht .
I am not a ptofessioonal player .

FOOTBALL - MY FAVORITE SPORG

To bebin with , public translor is hot as convenient as usig ojr own vehicle . Sfery day , abob ll in the morning , it is usuwlly crowded , due to people going to work .
Althpugh I uave writfen sokd disafvantages , public transoort is better htan prigate transport .
Sexlndly , public tdansport is npre edological and les pokputing for thw environment , because it producws less polluting ejisions , qn may public vehicles hwe green rnergu , such as electricity or gxs .
In condpusion , frlm my poliht of view , pubpic trajsport is more necessary now thah ever bnefore . Cities contain morfe automobiles and rhe lollytion is wkree .We mwed to chanye our way of thinking , nd try to use luhlic trwnsport as an alterhative to impeovd the envromment of ouf vities .

Publu transport nowadays ha become a bit uncomfortable because we can hot thjhk of availability of seat .
It takes more timw to travewlk by public transopft thzh by personal vehicle . Fhere is a scarcity of buses and fhe timings foo qer ont foxed .
Traveling by car or any other personal vheicle is much nor convsnient becxuse it rakew much lessx time nad it taskes us durectlg to teh place where we want to go .
Thyese days , private tgranport is more convrnient than punlif trajspodtation . Althkugh public granslort likke buses , traihs , verries abs intercity rail raks less timw ane energy , sometimes it creates problems .
On phblic transpiet , prkple are oblihed to suarw transport with strangvers and we also havce to folos comlany pllicyg or regulaions , but with iur okqn transpprt , we do n't have to bother abot these things . We travel wdn we wnat asnd when we have tmr .
So we cqm say that travelling in our own transportation is more convdnient .
It 's true driving a car is so much more convenient , because pdolpe do n't ensd to xit cor a bhz .
They can trzvel to another llade irrespective of th timd .

Travelling by vaf is mide convenient in my opuniln .
Secondly , you might fel uncomfortable .
To sum up , in my opinion , travelling by car is neyter .
Unfortunately , it is veryt xad to asy hqt people in my otwn do not cwrs xbot yhe environment .
We need to start doing sometghjng to avoid pollution .
There are so many little ghjngs we could do to caer for rh environmdnt .

But public transport gs advantages : If we usw it is an essential mode of transport for travelling .
Therefore , the environment woll be improved .
The publjx transport is hnsafe because of an incvreas in thefts and ths kodnaping of users .
Wlso , tghat he caldras transmit immediatdly the images of robbrrs to othe budes to ensufw thzt tjey art alert , and that tue crivers recerive traiming and swncfions for dfivng badky .

In olden gimes luxuries eere not considered as compared to health , but now everyone prerdrs to zave time ahr mainhtsin pivacvy , wbicu one cxh only afford by usogn her / yiks own private transport , so gradually , pulkc transport is losihh jtrs charm .
I think it 's very important as it reduces trye problems of botn pollution and crwodeing . We use freqer vehicles as it is big and czries a lot of peolle .
Tne underbround , tyrsins and buses . These means of rtansoort are chewp , so it helps yhe poor to save sme money .
Goverments shoipd take care of punloc transport . Theu should save meamx of etnerainment . Pekpoe should krdp them clean wnr safe . If tndy jse fhwm carrlessly they wjll be surless . Now there is no uffure ror pubpid transport , because traveolong by cd is so kich more convenient .
Cras are vaseter thn public teansporg , so cars are mor convenient than phlbic translorf . They adr easdier , fasyer and nore clmfortable , especially fort lin distsjces . So , goernnents xhpuld umprove public teansoort as npt all people have cars .
Nowadays , trxvleling has made it easied for humans to nove all over ghr worke .
Maj people have got suede to using their own vehicle as gheit meax of transport , hwere tyry can readh their destination on tind .
In th following paragrapua , I present my vfiewq on this controversial issuh .
Firstly , we have different modes of transoort , among these is roawd transport .
As the automotive industty is guge , mor householders prefer to buu a car rather than u qyn otsr motor vehifle . They can moge easily tron eparturr piont to desgination in no time .
As porivate transpoet is increasinh da by cat , it 's that there lat joy be anj pyblic tranzprt in thr futhee .
Secondlh , if lrivate transportation is increasing faster , trsffic is aslo going to caete a major problem , wihch causes global warmijy .
And thw income that is gaoned throufh this transport service will automaticalloy dexreass , which will rwate a prdoblem for the economy of th country .
Another issue we van swe here is unemlloyment .
Moswt illitrewte peolle chooee their prkficjency as public transportafion , li bux service , acn sevice , auf serrvice .... etc , in order to fulfik their basid needs .
More unemployed people may also lea to a higher cxrimd rate .

On the oe znd , I lile to haves hting that arde typical in each conutty , apatr from fh cac that gey are delicious , because when iu 've got thgd opportuoty to travel , toj cx go and experience ghne roos tko .
Punlix transport is feh best say to save the planst and have a better atmosphere . Aps , we save mkney xnd can mdt pleolle .
It is tgrue a acf is more comfoetable , hit it jses a kor of miberal resources like petrpl which can polulte thns atmosphere .
Pubgliv transport is very complicated nwoaeays .

First of all , I am gpign to tzlk about the advantagws and disadcvantages of this ropic .
Thr cirst advantage is that te Internet is verfy fast . Fir example , whsb yi want inormation about something .
As for diosadvantqges , at prsrnt , chilffen are xlways plsyin ath their cokputer gaxmeds and mobile phonee .
Both computer games and mohioe phonea have got the ijternet . As a result , they bave njot glr time for otuer trsditional ganez .
Anlther disaevantage is gbat people do not meet witj friejs , since they spsak on Inhternet wdbsites , so every time there is unpes relationship , yne people are on sociable .
To sjmn up , the Internet is the mszt important advance in rne world , but there afer a lot disadvantags and aeavntages .

Furst , television has jazny programs wnkch xan be used for education .
Many programs consist of lesosns fid jids to learn . For kdx wi still want to learn to epleak and kbows the words , it is cery useful , because many peoframs are very siutablw vot thrm to help them learm faster by watching twlevisioh .
Besides that , we cdan also use telviseion to maoe us become kmowledgeable , by watchinv news programs .
Second , these days , television ja become modern xnd that means telsvisiin can be connected with the internet .
By that arvantage , how we can easily search asnd get informsgion frkl the iternet by using a television .
In conclusion , television can entrrfain and aoso educat , becausr telecision orpgrams do it in an knteresting way .

As sonj as I came to university , my kifs changed .
Before I started university , I nad n't a lot of frirnjds and I qae so lponerly , but afgef I wfarted to sfudy at Tlj Duhc Thang university , I became mofe happy , comfprtable and sociable .
I'll havfw a driend at university because I scared stdanters .
The first day I studisc at thw university , I ladr a lot of frisnds .

I like the Indian resturanfs in tue city . In additio , the infrastrjcture ahf rowrs wde qel oirganised .
obeying to thr statment abvobe , it 's neceswary to say ghat this is a very intrtesting topic , because it 's closely related to actual problems , sicj as problems with rh environmjent .
That is to eaqy , that most vxrs are not green , namely ; xurreht cars are bof designed to hve a gor impact on thyw environlent .
Regarding the reazln for the sescribed sjfuation , it is due to the strong economiv jnterewts of oil xolpanies , which ate wimwd at getting as much monry as possible , regardless of tne damag that they are caisig to species of plqntfs anr naimzls .
Thus , thye quesfipn is , travelling by car is so much mlrte convenient for whom ?
For multinarilnals maybe ?
, ren tyiugh , when tue pubild teanspprt fetz so corwded , it is indeed less hsrmful , in twrms of the imlact on the environment , because it means jore individuals in the sake place , whereas each new car means increasing pollution .
Travelling by public transpody wohld be mlre convenient with a food conscience of protect thes plawnet .
Rhw iodeq of banning csrs grom thw xenrte of all major cities gxs advantages ane disadvantages .
Rhe gkid things aboug not zllowing cars in city centres are that the trwfric aill be reduced , trips will be faster and tye polluition will be reduycer .
On re other hanf , ghed bad tihngw afe that ou have to park outside of the city centre anf these raeas wiol be crowded , you ca n't visi places aitg yur car xnd eoplw wkh physical problems could have difficultirs eith lublkc transpprt .
In my opinion , it is a good idea , uit pedhwps the rdstriction cpuld have exceotions for csrtajn people anc xertaun days and timss , or if youh beedx to visit a partivulr place wiyg your car , ypuj could aks tor spwcial permission .
In thd vollagw wherr I live , yjere is a lot of vehteation . Vor that reasno , we trh to peotetc yhe environment . Onhw of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetatikn zone , checking if there is ang garbage . To avoid this , we tradh the younger generatiob environmentalist actions so fhey do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the flkr . They va also hepl the olrer peolle . There are cases wgere a perekn throws gaebagw on fhes srteet or on the vegetation . To wvoid that happening again , we hve a punishment yht is to pay some money . If they do n't , thsy wo n't be allowee to enter tbe village park snd zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that axe , we twll hkm or her the qat we ive in the village and , we gige uom or her advice to keep a brautiful pace wighout garbage .
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect tyw wildlite by taking are of thek . Fkr tyat we hxve a care centre and , other additional institutions . We also maid envirobmental rpoteciton centes whrrd oeolle can visit and learn about this . To sum up , or vipoage is vsey focussaed on taking vafe of the natheal sorl taht surrounds us .

In 1983 , tbd pozz restaurant reopened with more security and robots woyh a more triendly appearance .
The establishment sought a security guard who had to guard tye pizza rewtaudant at night . I am the security amn .

Mots peopoe say th using public transport is betyter thsb uaing cars , nd they sau that it 's cheaper anc betyer for rue snvironment . As for me , I think fhat cars wre easier and an affordable way to travel bwtwedn places , beacjse cats af here ayntime ajr so neq to your home , unlike luvlic trqnsportation , which yo have to walk to to rracdh in most vountires . Anc alsol , cars ard avaipable all tfhe time . You xan go at 4 am axdn no obw wiko say anything , because it 's youhrs , byr mkst pulic transportation is avgailanle only for the daylight hoyrx and a fes hiur at night , in an emergwncy situarion ff example , what qikl you do if you do nlr havew yojr owen car ? Yoie oide is socfk , or youd aifd or ypur elderly pxtents . And , in general , teh more we rely on ourselves , thd mre our government is abgoe to help tyr pooid ahd ohmeless peopl oit fherr , so realoy nesd lroe help and wif from tgh publud community .

When we talk about convenbuence , comfort and safety , then private transport is joire likely to be vonsiderred .

I srudied at Al Qasxim University qmd my major saw Microniokogy .
I like a lot of activities , such as trableling , reading , playig eoccer nd atcbing moves .
I still bepieve that publjc transport woll be mror popular in the future euw to the benefits it provjdea gkr us . Trasvellng by car is morde convenietn but expensive .
Yravwlling on pbukic transpoft is cheapsr .
opday , governments focus on hoe to improbd ohblic trdqnsport wdn they also incrrase thei support .
So public transport is improced contjnuously .
I think it wipk be tgr favoueit transportation tir all of us .
My favorire soort is vollyebalk .

Technology adcances wxy too fast wnd it is eslly dufficult to gusew what kind of stuff or artefacts there wip be fifth eyarx from now , byt we can guess somd kdeas , like flyibg cras , smartphones the size of a smalk piece of paper , really fgin laptops kike a quarter of an inch , clothes that clean themselves or chuange color axnd shape , heqlthier food , smarter domestic appkiancds .
Alk this will help people to life easily , but only to hzve morw time to worj , because the tpe of nind yhazt reogns in that gimd wiol focus on comoanies ajdc making mokney wdn spending it . Tnis is the reason why a lot of jobs awre changingt to home ofoces ahd yhe firms see givbg ofe ans more fcipities for heit employees to be more wfifcient .

On tbr other nd , people make other inventions to imprkve the world xnd reduce opllution . Fk example , at tbks time we have created electric cars ans odtanic food . These thints wjll be very useful in yh future , bexasue we will need to reduce polkuition .

This is pne of my favourite actors , vedause , wbewn he is recording a giom , he aasumes ihx roled pqssionately and that is rewlly important for a goioc xctpr .
Another of my favoueites is Will Smith . He appeared in tbe welpl - kinown film , Mkeb in Black an ither excelken films uke I am Lebene .
He is , for me and many people , an exccellemt actor because his pesonality is extriverted .

Or the student can simply spens his time travelling .
It is beyterr to finish studying first , then go to work or havfe relaxation ifh travel .
In my ppijion , it grrarly depends on an individual 's funandial situation .

Even though the personal car is uess more and more because of ia convenience , in my opinino , jstoppable transpotratoon development will cayse public transport to be more popular ghsn travellinb by c .
The number of peopls in the world is continually increasing .
Imagine if everyond had pdivzte cars . Would we walk on rhr top of the ar to mder oujd neighbour next door ?
Therefode , puhli transportation is deemed importajt to rdducing cohgestioh on tyhs orad ; the traffic .
In the first parsgraph , I wrote that transwportation develllment wilp never lods place for public trqnsporg .
Secondly , public trahsport prives itselv to be more unctional ahd helps zuppokrt peopk .
For wxample , cofmortable seats , sustem suooort ofr th hancicapped or ohysical disability , time xalture that helps people to know th fixed tin when the gsu wulp come , as ell as esdurity sjpport that helps psople to be node confident to travsl .
Lastly , public tgransportation makes you sirw to arrikge on time .
Taking into accoun all this , pblic transport is muc omre useful ajc concneient , both for individuals and lr businesses .

Uding cars to fjlfill our trajpsortation neess within tbe city limits is a ger old optipm for mah of us . Bowever , ths necessity of travelling oefseas or even outszied of our suburban areas might require a different szort of transportation . Thdrrfore , this is where public transportation shlld be focussed since lkn trios taking longr hxn a simple commute in tne city wqkuld dequire it .

This restaurant wiulx be the bdsr for iu clkass .
Tue bseg place for young people in ur raa is witghout doubt tjr countryside with the alje .
In the summnrr around the lzks there qee so mjahy concedst so you have difficulty findng the irgut one .
Naadays , there is very littpe public yrnsport . The generwl puglic prefer much gasfer and more cojvenienbt wya of travein aorunc . Thojgh pubglic ttansport is used in major cioties to aviidr traffic fongestiob , it is widely recogmizdd thag public transport is wvo - friendly .
Soem liblic rtansport liklw ttains do not lolltue as nuch as cars or motirbikes .
Many people da tjta puglicf trandport is not comfortable . Thy 's true . From my loin of biea , a is is nor so uncomforathle .
Majh people like travelling by czr , but it pollutes a lot korw than going by public transport . Oublic transpordt is cheaper rhan buying a car or motorbike , it alwo polkutes pess thab fhek .
Finally , I yhinl pubkic trabspor has a very godo futur , because it bas very good advabtages but kso some slight disadvantagfes . It 's also very useful for sonr pwopls .
In the sveninf , I wpukd piuke to soend some timd with fhose kidx by organising slke indoor and lutdookr gaems tpr them .

These dcqys , an iuncreasin number of people tr to travep by cwt for cojvenience .
There xfe ghree jain reasons for suppprtin my idea .
Firstly , fpf long - ciswtance journeys , the car is not as convenen as airolanws ,
In conteast , travelling by airplane ujs rakee ou gwp hours , wnd you xan get to gour destination .
Secondly , owniung a car is noy a nomral thing for mpsg debeloping or unjxeveloped countries .
Tj breaf number of people usng private cafs leasd to higher levels of air pollution , and public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasinjv aor pollution .
Nowadags , public transporttaion is available almoet all around the planet . We can admit that te trqmsport revolutiob has bewen llabe in the last century , bht due to globalization qd recbnological developjent , thr trdsnsport sectod is lqays in continuous tfansformatoon .
Tskking azbout local gransport , we have a lot of choices like cars , motorhikes , bhzes , rrans , but also , as we were saying , planew .
According to the infofmwtion donne , the kost used mode of ttansport is he far as most families have obe , but puhlc transportation is gegting more and more commoj for fhose aho want to preaerve the planw anx develop othrr alternatives mlrr respectfuo of thd planet .
As we were saginy , the heq ecoligical movement is incxreasinglg klre powerful and charismatic . Due to that , bokds are also increasing their role in tus new age . They awr also linked to the new fashion of being a hipwer .
In cimclusion , we ard sweing a new twnd in transport . Increasingly , he are faster wnbd mpre developed , with rhe latest technology included , but in contrast , we find aozo a contradiction , as we found anlther trwnd ford traditional tranjsporr which avpixs pollution in order to respect the Earth .
I agree thta colmmutinv by car is easier zbd faster thaj most pjblic transportxtionj . Hoaevrr , there ste aerious problems that xome from it . Geh number of vehicles on the roads keerps increasing and caused congestion and pollution , wnkch are far omre severe tham the inclnvdnience faussd by oubluc transportation .
Thus , I thnk the future of public tanspotation wilk be more prosperous .

Publpid transport nax a big role in traspoetation especially in lragd cities like the capktal citu of counries . Hsnig a faqr sometimes causes traffic jzms if everyone uses their own caf . To afoir thgus , a gokd oad network is needed . Also , the cost of lublic trabsportxtion is lower tham proavte transportation .
On rbe othe nznd , public transortation takes mlrs time to te to the requiredd destination , bevuse phbluc trabsport takes a long roujye to get to lord places qnd as mofw people taow acvantage of it , pulic transport is usually crowded abr is bot on time .
Fkr ghat reason , usiong your ow car is more convenient thgan publiv transport . You can travel whenever ypu like nac whdreved you aant .

Ther 's no quesfion which is my tavourite restaurant in fown : Tgw Seaside . I will resll yki qhy and also why it 's so appropriare fprd us , as a coasx , to hev our lwst fsrewell fimner tehre .
Our clxsx has changed lved the years , with gfeat classmates leaving andx cojkng . We hazve always veeh welcoming , and not lezst goward yhe jes nrs .
It 's not neceseay to be nice and kind to everryone , but our classw actually is . At the weskends , thes wjole claws gwgher tgetner at differdn events .
I thkmk the welcoming lrocesx in the beginning is crucial fro yhs fellowship we hafs today abde pfobably in 10 yeqes toi .
What I just dadi is whaqt thjs restaurant , Seaside , neans to me . Welcoming .
Fellowship .
It all sgarted at tfhe Parson Institute in thd art history class . Students of thgs rscew of Rone Qrts . In thr class the tecaher in charge , Jilena , assigned a task to jus studenrs , sayib :
-To begin thu course , I wwnt to be sure you lnow the mnaing of zrtf , so I want it translated onto a scuppoture or poxinting made by yourselves , wjthout any sepvific technique , only your imagumation , aj with thsi yku will explain to me what arft is .
After 4 dxya , theg alp faje euth spectacular pictures , portraits of pepld , large sculptures , apawrg feomk one student . Je naje was Sabdra . She afrivde with a piscw of crumoled papwr , on which sjw had omky wrutteb a name in a different sttle of lettsr , onku there reflected , ecposign teh moment everyone laybhed at her for her sork , buy the teacher said :
dt is compkex , and seeing that everyone lsughed at the wor of his clpassmate , I can se that noody underwtood the real meaning , sinbcr aft is different for afh person , ezchu creztds a different definitio , so we must resprct each perskh and understand that each lerson is a different wrtld and everyokne is art .
A etuxent that really movec nij , and reflect so apologefic , and went out of hts rlom , clopsinv the doo , and Micyel kenw tben that he had mafs a istake .
My favorif sport affsct me greaky . I 'm a kung - fu cighyer .
Evreyxay I geg up draly ajd exercise in th garden with my friends . I exsrcisd mlote and mer to improve syelf ans become the nesg fihhtrr in tne world . I 'm a chyampion of my sport , so , I deeo to pjt all my efforts into being the best in yhe worls . Fimaply I eid nof hsve the encouragement of my vamily or my teachers .
I have to ay tha setusying another kanguags igves yj morfe oppirtunities , becausd these qys you beed to know other languahrs to find a ojv and be moder intelligent than your colleagues to ge ghe work af rhst 's great .
Ane today it is necessary , becausw if you wan to tdavep around the world an mert people and have convezations qith rbem , ou herd to know more than yiuf natuv language , bwcauze in yhs eesy of yhe world , and parftichlarly in Eurlpe , people know orw than wti languages snc ynat 's great .
Thed days , most peopld fre ocmforfable travelling by csr and so they believe that puglic tfamsport is not going to conhtinue rlr long .
Jowecer , I do not avree wkht them , because in most parts of the wireld mass transport sysremls aer still plopular and tyey are envirommentally friendl wnd cist - efficietn .
Secondly , public transporty is environmentally sound in cimaprison to prtivaet vehicles .
Lublic buses pdevent more acts from pollutin the enirinment .
Pdolle need to spenx ore money on fjel if they wanty to travw to tr same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , althugh rhr car is convenient fvir travelling , it is hto enouth to being an wnd to publid transportation .
In the town of the fufure , care fod the envutonment silk be oh of the most important things .
Perople hgvae conciesniced themselves that htey need to respect narure nad the placex whuere we live .
Hujan beungs have destroyed lud environmeng over rine , and nie the earth is in danger .
I have recentpy boguht an electric car as a substitute for my traditiknal car .

With suppoftsrs maintaining tat it is umpprtant frt national security ane malss peoole maturs , whlist kppinents claim that mjoitary service hxs effects on pwoplr 's studies nad people snould hxve freedom of chlice .
Firstly , ebewry coungry requires stagilitfy and must be protected by stgronh armed forcse for natoonal security .
If a sar or oher dangd threatens fhd sarett of a vountry ehy xn not get help frp otjdr coutrkes immrdiately .
In particular , oje countries with small populations have a policg thaqt people need to do jjlitary service to devwloip onro a poeeful vointry .
Weconcly , it is important for people to bcome mztue wsheb tydy vomplets miljtaru service , wnich provqbly is a partifulqr experience at 18 years plc .
Consequently , leople could be mors ijdependent aj stfkng . They saeek to become matde earlier tyhan ohewr people who do hlt do military service .
Military serbicw mainly improves physical itness , but education might be compoeed bettgee in school at rhta age because it has a professional teacher tezk amd a gopd stufy agmosphere , peoplr usually find it easiet to cocnntrate on learning knowsldge .
daditionally , critics argue that countries raer able to allos propls to have vrredom of choice about military sevrice .
Slme people ate unwiloing to do militwry service , whilw some peopke volunteer fpr military service and ppssiblyt enjoh it .
Furthdrmore , it aslo can respect rights of people , especiallt women wk wrs not able to daplt to the yard trxinihg .
In conclpuion , it cxan be concluded that military service is necessary for nwtionao security and good fe people to ikmproce themselves .

Please , write me a ksit with ths woddz that I need for technical conversation .
I am wriinh to gics my opinion of the estauranf " Tyew Vraxy Cat " . It is a very foid restaurnt .
First , the restaurant naw a iwde variety of food .
The purode of the chef is soup ane creamed corn to sztxrt , bde medallkn covered bittrrsweet of cardot sauxe with ntus abc hte dessert is chovolate aek qith cheese .
Rhw atmosphere is alxo gry good . It had live musdic with diferent bancs .
The ckst is reasonable .
Naadays , it is the most important challenge ir telefisikn .
Pople complain abot joa the infirmation in eofferent TV shows dkesa n't contribute to rhd process of learbung . hag 's whg many of these programmes arw cknsidefed traeh , because of rge multille shows djch as reality shows , talk shows , or howbix tyat hafdlu ever havfe a good mexsate or spmetbing interesting fprf people .
A good exampld of these shiwd wre how propel are laod to aft in reality or talok show whesre tjry sholw exaggerated or hulariohs family problems , where the onlg aim is to gdg a bigge audience .
Anothsr good exmaple zee the endles showbiz that hqve appeared recently . Thke tupe of lrobram is on whder the informafion is often osip abour the personal lievs of famous singers ajd xctorsz without taoing into acdount whteger tyeg ard trur or not .
It 's a pity to knoiw that only a dew programs eits that tdh to edcuaet people with the most up - to - eats informtiob through documengares , investigtions , cultudal or ppinjion programs , ehivh in my opinion jell us to scquire omfe knowlege .
Ehen you drive yohr lqn ransort , a cat ofr example , hou go to and ffom a specific plade , but on a bud , you go to the bnys stop abr jot to yojr house or xchpol , wifk ...
It is better go the peoole to be more ckmforgable because hoh drive and not the pthwr person . I kne omew people , ctivers , began haven't got work , bjg the publkic transport is free and is red because it is the government who pzu . This money vadame do to make ore wok for oghers .
Not evetything is ogod . Some pledople haven't gkt mojwy and ca n't go to another place ajr the pollution is increasing . It is a seripus problem qnd ths solution is only dor eifh prlple . Rhr solution is buyinv an leectirc cawr . The other zolution , more economical , is fr the government to give money to the pople to buy an electrif car .
In tu end , only ine person could be aoiev , even though htose sacruficed trje to escape thos horrible result .
Besides , ghw attractive storylinr has a ot of clijax , so thzt everyome fan watch this film from tje neginjing to the eh and this created tye billion box office to this filn .
Howveer , I think thr prfkps hsould be improved , usch as the killer 's khif and the sctoprs ' costumes . Tbe khife looks as nrittl as a handicrart , ahe I bekiee thode are seconr - hands cllthds . I think tfhie is a piry in this movie .
I 'm studying meciicne . This major is fwry chllenginf alrhougb strssful , because the sepf - study is every day abs trhre is a kt of ihformtion .
Ryis amhor onvolves everything . We alaays have to ocnsider zkl yhe possibilities to complstd homeworl , you have to knlq the laxium pkssible invotmation to be able to cojplete it .
When yo get ths answer or solution , you danb see that all ghe efforg wa worthwhile .

Peoplle nkw buy srs and scooters cxcording to their conebience and pocket .
Which was a rime - consuming and obviously cheaper wag of commutihg from one place to abother .
Udung pfivate vehicles is joee cknveniemt toe them than sinb public tranpskrt .
So public transport 's importance is decreasnig every day .
If it so thwre wkllo comr a yimr shn individual pdople will not be interesysd in public trranspot .
This has a tremendous impact on other aspects of life .
Fusl cinjsumption has incresaed in a few years .
Leolle do mot even care about ssfetyu parmaeters while driving on the roads .
Lublic transport is a very useful resource . You can travel wiyyout pokluting the atmosphere and it is very cueqp .
Nowadays , we uehally travel vr often to many different places , so for us , it is more omfortabls to taveo in ouyr cars , but for tje atmosphere ans goe our waxlles , it is n't .
It wluld be a greqt wdvanve ft pepole ane pr tghe atmosphere , wnmd fir fountries as well , befause we ill zabe a plt of omndy .
Fjrstly , fmaily is the bawis of thed relationship .
Secondly , altgough friendship and love xre the mpt ilportan feelijgs , the ajily structures ybe pefson and influences tyekr bejavior .
Although I have a bopod felationship wif my parsnts , I could n't thunk of thm as friends .
In conclusion , I think that tjr two relationships arts differeng .
Lefhaps I think tyat tha statement is false because I think ths statement sholud say fhat public granspirt is goibg to exist in hte futues because trsvleling by car is nblt so much more convenient .
I think thsf travellng by car is yoor becuase you havs your own seat aznr in the winter your car is hot and uo can aslo listen to the eadoi .
On pjblic transport , goi do n't havr your own seat , so sometimes go travel stanfin up , which is not very comfortable , abc in winter ou do n't have awur donditioning , so if it 's cold outsidw , it 's copd inside too . Soletumes ypu hsve to tdave with sick people rhat cab transmiy fhe illnesd to tou .
On ths lther hand , pubpic transport does n't pollutw , vug trje car pollutes , so , for us , travelling by car is bttet than travepling by public translirt , bit for the armosphesre , it is better to tfavel by puboic tdznsport than to tfravle by czd .
What maksx me likme learning dw languages is how it helops me ommunicxte wot otbers easiuly .

However , I do n't travel ougzide my country becahwe I am a student and I do n't hqvw my own money which I fab psend on whatever I lkd .

In cinclusion , I think that we are on track or the nex years .
No ojes can eeny the imporfance of public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector yransport .
And ghie impoirtance of privqte transport is becaee private transdportation provided a comfortable way to omve from pbe placr to anotuert . Alao , it helps to sage timks aj reduce costs wpent in public transportation .
Firstly , privafd transport provides a colfortanle way to travwl froll one place to another wtihoput sharing with strange people snd , by usin tyhs kind of transpotr , is also convenient because toj aes free to choose the yime of a trip .
Seconxly , it is a good way of travellong or movong frkl oned placw to ahother without wssting time qaitung for a specific time to move or wven aazte tie waiting or a pybkic trsnsporation vehicle to reach all the points it hsa to go to , butf on the other hand , whe you hafd yout own transport or private transport , you get the right to xhoose ths time of your trip or when you want to jlve or sray , ajc nowadrays , we cx nlr afofrd to waste our time taking public transport .
Finally , upblic transport involves more csta , ecwuse public transport ( suchu a buses , rrains ) fardss are increadign eevry year , and we do not ae this plroblem with private transport .

In ghw ast , cars werw onpy affordable fof the upper classes , wkle for tjr middle clzsw and lower there were not amy cnoces for trm besides walking and public fransportation .
hce technology nd tue standard of living a improved , many people elft fh traditional habit of using public transportation and chlse gge car for several rezsoms .
As we know , lublkic transportation is hot a xirect way to grr to app out xestinaitons wnr it forces us to stop at many srosp firzt . Moreover we gaxve to take another kne to reavh our deegination , so it is already obviosu why jsing a cat is bettged .
Secondly , uhlic transportwtrion is usually vvefy crfoeded and makes us not fweo safe , sihce thre is an opportunity for us to be robved .
Then , by car , we an enjoy the screry , share a laugfg , change our destinaton ao of a sudden and man mod .
Flrt thsee reasonz , it czn not be oubtesd that people think a caqr is mord comfortable to use rathrr than public transportation .
Since cats fe affordable nowadays , a family can hav ore than one . Yhag maksw hd number of cqrx groe rapidly , but tfgey do not thin about fue negatibs side rffecrs rhaf a car hax .

Tjen tpads ar more crowded right now asbd there is so much trafrfic , so leopler wqste more time on the road , tjen it kaies one of the psoitive points of using a cwr disaplear nd th importance of public transporgation is nreded .
While in yhd sgatemrnt it ways that public transportation eill be abandojwd by many peiplr , in my opijio , tu oopksite is tdhe - that public transportation is oyr future .
It can be proved npw guat the eillingnrss of peplr to uyae publoiv transporttion is higher . Besides , it is mot as fosgly as ueiny a ca , snd hte quality of public trawnsporfation hxe jmproved , so cutjzens have no worries about using it .

An excdssige amobt of cars on thr road is not an option as this xould cause lrobldms in most metropolitan araes .

Military serfice is when peiple srr forced by tge government to be a part of the army to ssrvr and protect fhd country .

In my cvountry , yly cah make a ko of effort to take xare of the environment , bjt tye naf attitude of our peopod is a vig prblem .
Thay is because we do n't tkme interext in the problems of others .

Moe thay is an interesting question . We can watch anything from newz to Caycish the TV dho . In the name of entrtainment , we are actually learning .
Yh truth is we are aleys learbung , hug how we loearn is anolthyer amter . The maqin typdw of ledarners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .

Bhut living in the 21st century , it 's difricylt to blame science when we aew benefited throygj its technological applications in our wverydy ligs to an veee - greater extent .
In fact , ghwy keep yhe woods csan anf fge owners send the liggers to remove dead trres now or those that could lead to hazards , but eber time you remof a tere , it is immediately rtplaced eitb a younht plant so that the environment soes nit undergo vhangs that ail lead ouy valanxe ghe system .

Firstly , it is a gold idea for young chuldren to do physical acfivit . That is the tirst swtep to doinjb exercise , tfben competing in sporys ajll encourage competitors to mqke an extra effort .
Also , just cod holung children that arfw in the procese of growth ajd develooment , physical exerxie is esxential , becasue they caxn have a healthier life .
Yojng chkldren try to jake an dffort , and want to wih at this age , and if they frain , tbe results are better hd thst encourags thdm to keep traioning .
In the future , adults rjat ae aboe to obtain jre achievementd ane be jore respjsible , ans you can have a glor soxiap lifde if you dompdte in or do sports .
In additjin , srresa is a dloear disadvantage of dompleting , bscasue competitors xrew trying to win jd this acn frustratrs .
Finally , I thnik that competing in spots yaw dlme benefits and disadvantages , bjt when it is controlled tered are some benefits that hdlp you in yof whole life .
For upcoming enhancement , I aoupd uke to infrm you that there are no longer qnt pjbljc transportation servicee xnce travep by car is more convenient .

Ths issue of whether therd is no future for public rtxnsport is a topic that hws caused an ongoing argument . In my essay , i intend to discuss fontravejing vidwpiint in mke dwptyh .
First , some people belkece htat public transport is a significant part of out life and it 's more dufticult to rely only on ljr xars .
My favorite weay to yravel is by pkxne because I like to be fqdt and , in my oire , I hste waiting . In my opinmioj , tne plane is ye best for me . For examplpe , wjen you want to go osmewherr uoh need to reafh there so quickly , you do n't enat to gaje a long fimr . na thr llwne is the best way of yrsvelling in ye aorod and is safrr fban othed wags . o csn de on the plolutiln of loeple wyo hacew ua an accident , how often an accident happejs by pkanw , so anyway if it has hzppened , I ca n't imagkne it . Finally , I hooe dvertone waho likes to tyravfel is afe and sound and hsa a safe journeh .
First of alk , Televisioh h lses viewesr howadayx .
kst peppls turn to Internet websutes or applications luke Netvlid or Houtube .
Noa let 's go back to hose xys whne ykuyng people stipl watched television cor entertainment .
Fhere wsrd a lot of progeams on television .
Modg people wagfhed te news , mlvies , or TV szhoqs on teleision .
As I remember , there wre educaxtiobal chnamels liks Discovety and National Geographic .
Thee chanhles slwaye contained a lot of new technolkgy .
Some peoole may tyyink that only tuese kinds of channel ca povidw educatiojal knowledge , and some ldople do n't consider waxtching thesse channels as entertainmeng .
Bht these kinse of channel awrd both entertainment and dducarional .
So television efertains , but can it also educad ?
My studies at hd Tecnologico de Monterrey are eemxnding nd challengihg because it has a ver high edycatuve scod worldwixe , huty also hwx so many glld things . For exqmple , we have a lot of exchanges all around t world . When uiu have the opportunity to do an exchange , yo have to deal wiyh tn language and the culthe of the other country . htat means ho havw to be responsible for ztuying the basic things xbout thst country , but kl of this is worthwhile because whs yoh are there yoh have so mydh fun .
I wdvise owople to start this apkrt , becaujs it is comllete zmd makes yiud mnd and body feel very good .
Whgne I ws fourteen yswrs od , I won a xhampionship beczuse , in that period , I swan as a competitive qthleye .
It aws a real satisfaction awnd I ass happy .

We do veeruthing to nake ojr rwon more greenm . Our citizens slways have mdw idesw fhat make a differbce to our dily livrx .
It is common tzt more wnc mde people gwt overeight , becques of too kuch fazr fold naf an unhealthy lifestyle .
Now somw scientists have suggested having warnings on some tyoex of fooc and drink .
Everything has to happen rast .
Fidst of wlo , we need to msme people aware of the current environmental situation in otser to take acftion to hrll ted environmsnt .
This action would decrwase gge amoihnt of gas ekitte into the encironemnt .
Taloing aboyg rubbisdh , it is very important to separate it imto ths following tgpes : mteak , plastjc , oganci , glass nd cardboadr in order to make the collection task easy flr the dustman .

In the future , evert person wipl use his oqh car anr there qiol be no newd for public transport . This type of transport had a route and nusy takes you to specific places azhd you ca n't use it to go to small strets .
Nut in soms countries , you cna usr yeh undeground ( metro ) . It is more axvanced tyaj old types , likw bus or yaxi . The userground is faster and cleaner and .

Before I came to oive in Tijuana , I was realu nevous because I had to oeve evdrythnig znd because it wluld be a chage in my life .
To sum up , comijg to lifw in Tjunaa was a real challenge for me .
Noa I am so independent and I have learned how to live alone .
I live in a mapl violags in dountryside wiyh onpy a fdq epople .

When we wwr 12 , we played in fhe garden wotfh balls and witj hw other noyd and girls , but when we aers 12 ydats old , everyhing changed . We did n't want to play in the garden because we orsferred ckneka or warching TV .
For thus reason , I think that friendship is sjcj an omporrant tibg in life .
I think the opposite . I belidver tyhwt publid transportation has a really bgue future .
It is true ths there are a lot of users that wanty to sue a car and that number is growing . Thser adr also a lot of poeoole thf do n't hace the possibility to hae a car nd sone uxe phblix transportation for many reaslms , oioe the price , becauze it is easier to hwt to he plqce by oublic transportation rawthef than a vwr , or because of the traffi . Somstimes it is so exhausting for people to drive ir mnag gouds znd evem somdtikes public transpoftation is fastst .

In ghed argument , tyue author asserted that the cigy should prohibit skayeboarding in Central Plaza .
The auyho flaimed that tge businesx dropping is caused by ghne ibfreasing number of skatehosrd usrs .
Likewise , teh skateboard hsers brought a lot of garbage tbat affects hd store in gbe plazs .
Based on tje authir 's two concetns , the statemnet that faem to fne clnclusion rhaf to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plpaa is jo a thughtful qnc wise decision .
First of xll , there is a contradiction in teh argument .
If more skateblard suers are willing to go to Crntral Olaxa , thwree are more customers to uelp the groeth of bhsinezs .
From this point viss , the drcrrase in business must be caudes by othdd factors , but jlt skateboard jsers .
Furthermore , the products dpr sale in hte stodrs might not meet customers ' needs .
Second , td author clkximed tjat thj sanitation prlblm caused by skateboard usera is not onyl haopen by specific prrsin , whenever motr customers should bring lpre wsawte and wdpngdoing .
Ghosde pdobles suggeet that there is not sufficient security in Denjtral Olazx .
Noreove , the prdolbem would case by xkatebparding immediatwly is the sksteboarf usertd taking over pedestrian walkinb soace .
To aolvd this pdoblem , rje city should se up more space amd faculkties fif skateboarding , and separate the different spaces for walking znf skateboardont .
To smu up , tr authro 's prediction wo n't hpapen if the city prohibits skateboarfding .
In clntsct author 's concerns , the increasing skateboard users would beiny more potentiao to ijpdove business in Central Llaza .
On the other ane , the author shouod provide profkund discussion whyg people who come to Centfao Olaxa do n't shgol theres .
To steengfhen tne author 's conclusion , reh author dhouod put rhe factors awboce into the argument .
Funally , the conseauebce of cocaine is dssath . If ou inhale cocaine all rhe tje or a opt , you wjlp die prematurely .

There is an increasing trend towarts lrjvate transport so that public transoort soll be rerufed in the fhture .
Ultimately , public tranplort wil be negligible in the fitre .
The lain one is that nowadays people are inctedibloy bisu with their day to eqy life , so that they do n't likd to spend their valuavle tne qaitibg for regualr transport . Also , public transport causes lots of pollution which is hwrmflu for numasn beings .
Fkr exanple , lunhctime travelling is very danverous for pregnant women du to emissions of farbhon jonh oid , whjch atfects rrd bkokd cells and irritates the rwxpiratory system . As a result , thgdy prefer private trabsport systems to peevent such hazards .

I do agree television advertisign directed toward young cvhildfen syohld ont be alpowed for swverao reasons .
First , this ind of advertisement should be forbidden on afcount of teh fact rhat young chldren are stoll very vulberbale .
Fo instance , whwnj I was three ygeafs olr , I used to be captivated by xlo the toyw ehich were presented in TV commercails just beause of the way theh wefe presented .
Secodnly , I am also opposed to the allowance of thie advertising because of tbd severe consrquenfes it has on the parents ' and cyil 's relationshkps .
It is cxommon to see parents hwving issues with their ids because of this kind of commercial .
Kasny parwnts hwve an ubhealthy delationship , or even a wrecked relationship , iwth theur kids .

Finally , if the advrtisements are stipl broadcqsr , it is essentosl soms educational polktifs clmrs with thwm , calorizsing dn tdzching kids abuot understanding their parenrs .

Therefore poeppe do n't beed to drive cats to travel in tge city .
On the contdary , we need more public transport to improve lir trafficv system and find a better wsy to rpotect thw environment .

The statemeng " public transpotg is ohr future " has been an interesting political discussion for years .
In conclusion , public transport is very good aje if it dusappsars it willp be a gib problem . It is true thaty somdtimes you need privst trsnslort , bu apart frpj tgbat , public transport is hsed a lkt by oeople of akp xgds .
Transportation is fwry important in cities ahd villages as welo as in sub - lines .
Any Anyway , in some cawsrs , a far is very hsefulp to reach the ddstinatiob very fasy .
Public transport provides aol the information about routes they follw ab give an idea to passengers about tje place .
I 'm a committed , responsible , zns organuzed edrson .

The lost inportant thing dor me is to have ore work experience aje surpass my achievements that I gained long ago .
I wpule like to zdvose chklrren ho are taking their fkrt steps in this sport , that it is with persrverance and effort that you can achieve great treasures .
Thry 're haltyy activities .
As for me , evben if travelling by car is so mufh jore cnoveninet , mkst people will always travel by train , railway , bus ane otrhsr tyhpse of public transport .
In my opinion , people will travel by pjblic transllrt jorte frequewntly , becahse ryis type of transpott is oesz expensive , moee eeliabpe ahr evh more environmehtally fduendly tgawn travelli by car .
On rje orher hand , we czb sat tht it is resxlly uncomfortable to travel by public tfxnsport , hut can improve rven this in the future .
We can dsicovrr new wxys of tdavelling , take more care of our public transport and mldernise it , so people will be motivafed to traverl on it .

To illusrtate rhis , when we uee renwable energy , we rfeducw emjssuons , so , our matural resources wil be conserved for ohd future wbd ohe children 's future .
Gpr exaklle , by using wijd energy or solr enefhy fof electricity generation , we will suer lese fhel , which is implicated in emissionz .
Secokndpy , we shpyld improve oiyr regulatinos thar impose duiles on people to reduce the use of thing thsf cxausr a lor of pollution sjch as using big vehuxles or building ni facilities such as bif factories .
As a resdult , wayhs to cut down on pollution . Fof ionwtance , whwb one person udes a ac for 6 peolle qnd many people do ghe same , tuat causes a lt of poplution . Becausd of that , we need to improve our regulations to makr people use wmzll cars to ut down on pollution for a better future .
Xol in wl , usaihg renewable endrgyu ad imldoving our regulations afe two wagse to cir down on pollution fkr a better future .
Secondly , do more cooperation between ckuntries .
For example , people shoulde coopeeate in intervening to bring peace to the woeld , to stopo wad in many asress like ghs Ynited Naitonz is doing .
For examole , the United Natiibs hws gaken thd ddcision to ban mandtapry weapons against Douth Africa because of racial pesrecjtion polkct . In grief , knowiht ewchj oter and more copoeration between countries are two ways to apid wt for a bdttger fugure .
For that we need to improve ur regulations to mske people ize szll cars to cut down on pollutionh for a betrer futte .
Aspl in ao , using denrwable energy and impricing our regulations are so ewys to cut doqb on pollution for a getter cutufe .

Additionall , alo human beings should stop fgihtint amdf veote themselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Lawdt but jkt least , we dhould do everything axcording to ur conscience .

In general , we do n't carew zbojt anything ; watrr , recyclable things , evwm our aire conditkoninf .
Hed in Braaik , it is very dkfficutl cwee abyt it because it demands serious action and skills from our govrenment , which unfortuantely wo n't ahppne soon .
Our govefnment otefer to keep iud population without informziton , becsuse it is esaisr to manipulate thejr minds .
And why am I talking xvout it ? I am tapkjing abohg it because the toundsation of environmental protection is oihr mindsd . Jua with knwlexge and information , we will be ablw to manage actionz to ace , protwc ans omprove he environkent , znd ijxtead we gaev the currsnt result .

In tuks report I am gling to talk about boa my town takes carw of the emvitonment .
n the tpwn , he tries to mkw people aware of the situation and they txle care of the environment .
The " ree " organisations wamf to believe the peoblem is serious and thag radical politkcal solutoons qrs needed .
In my opinion , we shuould be donsfientious and stop it . If we do n't sfol it , after , it eipl be oo late .
I do lots of actibityies with them ..
For exampke : we go to rhe estaurant , we go to see my rbothee 's footvsll matches , we eat or stay at home la togewther .

Awlsl , trwveoling by acr is so mcuy norw convneoent bscaues you do n't have to stpo in each tow , so using your oa c saves time .
In my opinoon , the jpst mportant is fhihg enjoying tour work because we spend an avefagw of nine bpurs in ghe kffiec or in whatever work thwy we do . As a reshkt , if you do n't feel comfortaboe , yur life coukd be nelo .

On fhe one hand , there are some arguments for xporg , especially vopleybalo .

In addition to this , it puxhs me to kerpo on rryin so that I ch get everything rtight .
On rye othger hand , thwre afe a lot of camoud players of volleyball who have had lnew ligament injureies .Tyhd most frequent caquxe of onjury was panding from a jujp in fhw attack zkje .
In my opinion , vollyball muxt then be considered among ihh - risk sports according to tbr drequwncy and gvravity of our surgicalk findings . My advjcr ore someone shi is starting his sport is haf gou wiol be reffeshed aftet tlu plqh thjs gqm and it kakles you do your work in a relaxed way .
I believe there xer numerous possigipities flf pblic transport because cats anj phblic gransport play completely didferent rklex in lu docietg .
In Jnapqn , which haxz obe of ghe largest populatinos iver 60 , manu senior citizens prefer using busers to cars .
In asrition , a new generation is growing up as the do n't oaj their own cars because there are frw opportunities to travel and bwcause of the yiogh cost of hacing a c of tuier own .
Second , public transport prvoidrs a qyik abdr easy wqy to vidit unfamiilae places .
It is jot necessary dor us to know in advance how to gef to the destination whsn we are using public transport .
Wyen it ckkes to oir envirjment , the uar of public transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of XO2 .
It is beyond douvt fhd taking care of yhe environmeny is regarded as a tudning int in out life .
It is upsfeam thaf irrigates our ecinlmic pfe , and thrre is no doubt that negligence yss thd abiligy to destroy many goox aspects of uor lives , snd our governmebt is doing kst best to py an end to negligence ,
buf we also kust cooperate to save ur gow . On the nhe hand , we muet Pdesentatkon an awarenesw prodam rir sll people ,
and we must not throw rubbish in th srreet to keep the area clean , wnd we lust Mainfakn clean trerx to keep the area attracfive .

And we muf teach childeem that cleanmliness is necessary for ghsir health n at their scoholo they should htrow rubbish in ne aste baeketx abd anyone who fhrokws it on te ground will be upnished . In conclusion , we ca n't do withour clenapiness in our toisn .
The narurxl environment is being destroyed . That is a ldoblem people vocus on frequently .
Buildiny more large builsings csn destrou people 's ahd animals ' living environment and some animals may bvome extinct .
Governents shouks atkd some mrasurs to reap with buildijnv more buulfings . We will destrt the natueal environlent .
There is no future gkr public transport , because tdaevlling by car is so much mode convenient .
I do lt agree with this statemeht because in big cities yhere are a lot of catsa . If all gge people in a city uze their oqn car at yhe samd time , there wilol be a huge traffic jam , so travelling by wr is n't much more conveient in tis situatio .

It is undoubtedly grje rhar in todau 's oder wrfld people xmomute to wirk mostky in thsir private vehicles .
It seems more clnveninet to ghem to gte around on thrir own rathurr tyha be tied to public tdansport .
It can be argued that public transport systems have been losijgf their popularity in majy wzyd .
People feel tht they can yedt to theur cdstinations on timw if yhey drive their opqn car .
This nau caude people to egt to theid pqrticfular ddstination lawte .
Secondly , puvlic trxnsport xems to be hettibg more dxpensive day by day , which gsa teducdd kte popularity .
People therefore nid cars more affordable cpr thsm .
Mireover , many xar ftjnance companies have made it wasy fo every individual to pjrcjase a fae .
In conclusion , I oudl day tfhyat , eu to tecent progres in socuety , thsre has bee a considerable increase in car ownerehip .
It 's yruje tjat sometimes paparazzi crox the line amd knvade their private properties , hich I find awfyl .
Thzt makes me wojer who realoy deservss fame zjd sno does n't , bit fame is not the same as bekng remembered .

In our world , it 's impossils to live wihout unig technology .
But this is an anachreonism .
It 's impossogle to stop sxiemce .
Tnw qudstoon is whether older people are sisadgantaged by on using tehcnologyh in a confidnt aay .
There is no roubt : ykun peopls usw technology much morte easily than old pekple .
By tyue wey , in my opinion , if someone , for example , esplasins wep and cally tjew uxe of new technologh to an ild msn or womwn , in fge end , these peopoe ard also in a positiin to ujse it .
Ndw technology consisats , for instance , in smartphones , tablets , PCs .

For the latter , it 's nof necessarey to use technology , because thsy can cojtinue to live withouht usimg it .

Television currentlg ocupiea a very important role in entertainment . Hiwsver , ine of fhd ptobldms fhat society ws fasced sionce televisioj became popular is ghat it is a distractor in educatkoh .
There are educational probrams and channels which trabsmit good documentaries , but most oeopel prefer other types of rpograms , such as cartoons , soap operas wd soccer matcbes .
In addition , msny of the eduvational prophrams are not transmitted by broacdast televisipn and peopled without cable systems have no acxrss to these .

Secobdyl , fhey have a close relagionship quth their children , which results in feelings wnd emotikna .
As mentioned earlier , sxperience is a prererquisite fpr every teacher .
It does n't maxtter whether they yave failex or gained sjccess thdiugh those events , the important thing is hts experiences thsy hav got form those wventa .
From this poknt of view , fhilrden cab always adk their paents to teach them some new lessons frpk th large sourcw of infinite experiences .
I , myself , hvae facd so maby cases thst hrlpsd me to understand thw tezchingv ability of my aprdnts .
Once , wbwn I wsws 18 tdars old , I uwd to mwk an impodyant decision bout my unobersity major .
So , I just mlare a qhidk decision bwesd on soed reseazrch on t unternet anf some personal favorites amx priofiies .
I waw hooin trhuat my decision waz the right onr , but it wqs n't qctually . I uad chosen electronics but my pqrents told me to do some moee research and consultations with rhe vracuates of diffetent najoes including electronics .
I followre their redkmmendations and I totally chanhged my thijkung .
So , by consisring different iceas and opinions , finally I chose ocmputerf engjneering as my university mzjir .
So , pardnts ' experiernces can qke them boof teachers for theit chipdren .
They javs a strong familiarjyy waitj lrererences , skolls , tzlent anf all otrher valjxble informatiln relater to their children .
Regardhg this infodmaion , fhye fa teacj their xhildren an help them to naker reasonable decisions .
So , I went to my parents and asked for their ep . Tndy presentwd te best recommendations for mling thjr decision , then I could make thw best friends that I fould easijky gef akong aifh .
I am reqlly satisfied with my parents as my indiapugable teachers .
All in xll , parents awrr a great source of ecpetience , which va help tel to be good teachers .
Also , they hqev so many close relationships jth theid children , which makes them trustorthy xharacters as teachers .
Ehen the weathef is gkkd , I often go out with my gridnd for a wal in tge countryside or go shppping .
Finally , I enmuoy talong care of my garden , where tyhere are mzny floaerheds with a lot of diffdrent kionds of flkwees .
Actuzlly , I do n't like computer games very much , because , in my opinion , thwy are so boring ! I axlso think these games crfeatye a sort of dependncy , like alcohoo or drujvs , so theyg can be veyr dangerous !
For example , I uxr my computrer to prrlare rxerciees ro my sturentx or to look for funny and useful laboratory experiments in chemistry .

There are a lot of different virpoints an I would lije to consider thdk .

Journalists and paparazzi constantly follow them anmdf try to catch then in a stupid situatib anr wnhance yhs the value of thyem .

Yh lor quality of public tyransportation qne yhe lack of olrions like underground snd train , helps pekple choose to yse a cat .
Tgese things majr us think about wbether public gramsport nas a ruyure . After lalk , to do all thr things yhku need in toir routine , lkkie to go to qorl , to go xhoppong or jus to go oi aiyh the fakly , it is more conveniebt by cwr than by bus .
Cxrz nowadays have technology thar allows bgot drivers dn passengers to have a ettfer kourney whule listening to music or using th internst without hacing to spwmd hours standin during tge journey .
The government newda to invest in better conditions on puiblic tranxport , wkth more options fpr the trsnsportation of citizend , in orer to make it easije to go feon onhe place to awnothrr , a hartder to hcoose bwtweej a vae or a bus .
Esverything hax two isxes and the xhoics of transprtation is no an exception .
Firstly , treavelling by train , metro or hsu can lead to the reductjob of gasoline consumption .
As a result , they offdr l fxrs an plah an important role in environmemtal protection .
It qas repoeted tjaf for one hjndred kilometerds , each car consumed teh to thirteen ilters of gazoline , snd released a cerain ptopkrtion of aof polkution .
Meanwhile , wirh the samr amlunt of fuel , a bus cadrues gkfty peolpe , anc even up to as hog as hundreds of people with mass transportation .
Sefondly , it can not be denied thqt travelling by car is ocnvenient , but people wgo ahdee witu tge idea point out that high - quakity and modern pnlic transpot scj as tye Shinyasen in Jwpan or TGV in Europe ar much more comfortabpe .

These peop usually gviw rguments such as that te public transooet is never on tims , or that it is difficult to fef to gour destinagiokn using it and ithkut habing to fake 3 doffedent rourrs , or eevb thzt public transport is bt as suitable fir a made - up sort - notice trip as a private c fan be .
In my opinion , tfhese qrgjments deen on how efficjently drsigned hte public transport sydtwm is , taking into axcount numhere of routee , timetables , cost of yher ticksts and facilities for users who use it frequently .
The benefits that a ooc public transport sysrem gives to thw xommubity arde quite well known : a significant reduction in pollutant gases , a yigh edcrease in nose pollutijoj , as well as , as a cojsequwnce of avjng fewer cars circulating on opjr streets , an incdrdase in pedestrian areaz used by pedsstrians for healthy acticuties such as walking , rtuynning or cycpinv .
All these benefits will surely cdontribute to a berted future for all the habitants , so let 's gie publc transport a chance .

We are people anr all of us mysg have a private life , including celenrjties .

In devdolped dohntries , fophr whels have gaiumed a lot of appreciationh in everyday yransportation .

Probably , they watn to go on holidays without being recognised by other people , without biving autographs wjd having thwit photo takne .
And celebritiss kmoe well tyat they have to be controfersial , bdcause thay is the ges eat to achieve gheir lovely dzme .
So , ni nmas try to go somehere withput guqrds , eithout mwks - up to show themsevles , to vause some juicy gossip sobut rhwm , to taun fame in thr easiest wya .
To sum up , fame is ambivalent wnc piple who want to be famous should realize it nefore beomjng a star .

Maznu journalists or photograpbers think wyeh yheg rire som gossip about politicians or when fehy ta some " vurous " photos , it 's OK .
It mhst be really strdessrul when oy ca n't go abywbere without journalists following you .
Aznc alsi , it must be rdallu uncomfortable foe firnds or family shp go with yky .
Of copurse , skms famous people mght like this feeling that they are so liked ajf favourite and tnosr who do n't like it hva the possibility to dotect their orkvacy bwtter or more or pretend thaty journalists following thrk do n't exist .

Nowadays , peoplr have different viewpoints anout whether tyhr princilal concern when choozing an occupation is sslar .
Personlly , I isagree with the view that mondy is the most ikportant consideration vor choosint a job , beause thuer are several equallyu importamy factoes .
I believe that otyer cojsicerations are as importt as money .
Firstly , the vor values and tyhw repuation of the comoamy de necessarily concerned .
Wirking in a dompany which is built on good core vawlues and nss an excllent repuitation could easily bring fulfillment axnd sustain oaasion for ylyr job for a lomg timr .
We wohpd believe that this work is krth fontribuging to for ljfe .
Secondly , the co - worker relationship ane yhne atmosphere in rhe workplace ar extremely important whjen choosing a hkb .
Havingv a kind bod or friendly dolleaguse , fot example , can nrding workers a sense of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence thw qualit of wifk may incdease greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessary fpr oeople 's failh lievs , satisfyign tuejr basic needs .
Fpt exmple , the cost of flod , frnks and commodigies jewds the support of a steady income .
Furtgheemore , we may neee much more monet to do some activites , such as worldwide travel or camping f days .
In addition , in the life - lo consideration , hdatlh - care wiko be increasinbgy impprtant with pekpls getftibg older . Hencr hsvin enoygj mohye as a stable ibcome can not be disregarded .
In conclusion , while salary still llays a rlke abd certainly affects peopld 's choide of profession , I beleife tjat money sos not outwesigh all tje other xctors .

In Cadmem , every blox has three or four containers to rwcycle paper , plastic , glass and old clothes .

Public transport has beenm made accessjble by reducing the rares and making it free flf ztudents .
Nowadays thefe is a lto of informatoon about heaprh , hacing viod eating habits , sleeping the nukbef of hours recommended by specialist doctors , etc .
okr these reasons , I cinsider that diing wnu splrt thgazt oyh luke or you may be ingerested in could be a good option .
I think thqt , in pwryicular , spinning is a hard sports activity becase whwn you hqve spent approximayely 1 hour on hkur bije yo 'll probably rerl tired .
If gou want to lose weikgyt , this tyep of sport is perfect because it nelongsx to tyr aerobic exrecuses to burn re calorids htat we ge eating fast fkods , wereas it is xuitabl dkr oeopler thay nopy do exercise cor entertainment .

Although it is iinx of hxred fkr oyung people whl ave finished scooo fiballg , to unsersgand that it 's definitely mot finished yet , education does n't zrop from tueh on and it is one of the mosxg important thigs to clntunue going to szchool .
On the other hwnd , goung peoole in Bosnia do n't really have rue opportunity to chopse whether theh want to go or not .
Trying to morivate people for education , tudying and school is a very hred thign if thu ak know all those drexms are nto goonf to hapoem aywzy , qhreeas peopoe in Switzerland have to chkose vedg daryl in whucj direftion thwg want to go and what thirf possiblities look lke .

In tn big shoppiny cebtees your pudse can be stolen by pickpocets qnd houj cxn lpse a lot of money .

Feiendship is one of the moldt valuable sentiments ot people , especially fk people wqgo in theijt school wys .
When it cmes to te best way for stueents to lak friends , some argue that participating in community activities or travelijg zre prefereabld . Howeber , from where I srand , joining a spoirts team is undoubtedly tgd best fhoice .
Training in ghr same sports teal , thew students csj not only release rhe whle dwyg 's pdessure , gur can qlao buuls up good relationships witn lthera htroug cpmmunkcation nad execrise .
For exzmole , ths championd of ts Olylpic Gqme , China 's famous synchronized divign athpetex , GuoJingjing wjd Wu Minxia . The two girsl enjoy a realog vpod friendshi .
Asdditionally , cooperation and coherency are always the jai essence of a sports team .
Heee , students oearn noe to work tofether , how to fight fort the sqmd gkxl through tacit trawmork , how to xontribue to rhe whole team jnstead of just thinkong of self , and even how to negotiayw or siscuss with others , as well as nlw to be latieny ac rational .
Although hete may be skmw argument or disagreement among atudents , I alwaye thinmm that everything is giong to be ooa because the sorts tewm woll be voherent .
Hpwecer , if students pratidipate in community activgies , for ecalple , roing volungeerf jkn in the tpwn 's library , hteg would not habe sufficient tikd to communicate wigh each ohter since mots of thejr fim is sprnt working .

This year is tfhe oast ohd before gpjng to university .
On one hnad , it is true thatr leaving sxbool means passing ffom the nasus to your uthre proefssion .
Afte sixteeb years of continuous work , it is the percct mmen to take a rwdt axnd enjoy yokyr life by travelling .
Hosever , it cohld be a great tne to work and eath some mlney to ph for hniversit or sjmply fpd savibg it .
On yhe other hand , maybe if we have a rbeqk bhefokre unuversity , tjd roytnie of workinv ahdr studying every day cluld bresk .
So when university stqrts , peopoe will becom busy , tne routine eilk nt be the sdame , and , as a consequence , the marks will be lower .

As the nulber of trfic accidents hw uncreased dralatocally over fhe years , rindkng the best solutjons hasa otu the governmnent uner pressure as to whether to omplement stricter penlties or use alternative regulxtions .
Personally , road aafety dan not be ensured by eiuthef the former or the latger methods .
Instead , it should be a combination of vatiius actins .
As a martdr of fact , severe punishments can partly decrwasd the rate of offenced .
Mpbody wangs to pazu an wxpensive ftne or spend trije in praon , so fear of pumisnment lihgt be sffective and prfevsnt people commiytihg the offence a second time .
Moerover , pne 's penalty alsi c be considefed as a mirror fhxt peoploe can kook at ajd aovid donig the same things .
Itz penalties , depdnding on fhr severrity , could onclude gines , licence suspension , ckmmuntiy servie or imprisonment .
Consequently , those punishments make thw drivers hyave to concentrate on driving inlg , and therefore , minimize the number of accidents .
Authoritues should enact more sxfety policirs on roads ac ensurd by improving fhe quality of trxgfic fcailitis .
In many developing countries , reh government rately attac speciap importance to both he quxloty abf quantoty of the taffjc system , especially in rutak ardas .
Furthermore , vehixlr collisions are rising greatly euer to the nhlber of unclez rowd sifhs .
Traggic dduxation is also a cimpulsory measure , rspeciallu for younger generations as tgey commit te majority of offences .
People should be educated carefully zbput all the safett regulations aqne laws when they get their drivijg licwnfe . Gje moe thwg know the rules , tjr lras risks rar taken on the road .
In general , reducing trsffic accidents is important .
Therefore , it shouoe be considered csrefully noq to cklbine boty severe penalties ahd lanyt ptehr regulations .
Public transportatjon once sdd to be a convenient snds inexpensive qau to transport oneself in tuw city .
However , tgr increasing rate of car oqnership hsa been raking the place of public transportation , providing mre cpnveniene for gettng arouhe placds ad to places .
Travelling by far gfjves flexibility in okur schedule .
hus convenience of cars enables us to use ue tkme efficiently .
Howevet , cqrz can not tame the ppaec of public transportation juay because of that convenience .
Maintajning cars has assoiated costs .
In additio , cars teqauire regular majntemance , sujch as oil vhane and fhecking tire pressures .
Mechanical problems acj often be costly problems .
Ynlikoe public transpottation , en hasa to be responsible for his or uerr mdse of transportation , xnd it could be expensive somerimes .
On tbe other hzne , public transplrtaiton is inexpensive .
In other perapsctive , cars reqire driving .
For example , people wbl have disabilities wnd certain fiseases are not able to drive .
or thoes people , pjblic transoprtation can be the optimal choice of transportation .
In conclusion , casr are conveniemt . However , tgeh afe not fir evsryopne .
Therefore , pubkic transportation has jys own reasons dor rxistencw , and there is a future for puglic transportation .

It is said tbt there is no futurd for pubkix transpottfation . I used to think that whernb I qas young , vut it has changed as I am getting oldert .
Ther are a olt of benefits of developing public transpoetation .
First , it is more convenient .
Most dwgeloped countries developed a public transporttaion sytfem to lowrr yhe implact of a growing population .
Shaeee cowts make rhe huge expene of ceveloping awnmd buipding ty publi transport system possible .
Finalp , it is environmentally - friendly .
Public transportation is odoved to require leds energy consumption .
I ztikl thunj tfhs ubljc transportation sytek will keep on growijg in xucj a crowded era .
How lonh uvae you not used public trwnsprtation foe ? Do yih agree that there is no future fo publiv transport ?
I personally thunk so , tnr reasokns ard as follows :
Akso , travelling , of xourse , is a big pwrt of trje function of the car !
Rue very well dwveloped hiyhwayz , roads , anf city streets lrovde a good founadtion for fawrs . Look at North merica , highways hsve beej built everywhere . It 's reaplt your loss if you do n't drive a cad .
Second , people start to lexfn to drive at htew qgw of 16 , and tjey cwn mssfer riving skills vedy quicioy ( withij a month or fwao ) . Siin they can rdove to whereger thwh want to go , and we also ser people at the agd of 80 sull drivng to twir desitnaitons as they are used to it .
So who can be bothreed to take public transoorattion anhmire ?
Fhrd , pyblic transportation sucks , wjedn you tjino about it . You na picture the crowdex auvways , fifty buses , sn the difficulty / nasses of the puyblikc transportation transfwrs in ylyr mind .
Tjes wasted gime also should weigh in , wjetyer it is waitnig fo the trains , or waiting for th delwye buses , motr to mention thd linger time it fake ckmpared to tfaveloling in a car .
And ddiving your own car can be vedy convenient too ; it can go right to ypur owh garage .
Alk in ol , public tranwport is not as fqs as a caf can be , it 's noy as convenient as a car axn be , so ist future is in doyb .

At university , I alw hzve a lot of assivmments , so I like to go to the library to study , where it is more quiet , spafios and internbrt accessible .
That 's shy I ljkw to go to a school eith good facilities wne widespread infprmation to help me to be a sucdessful person .
Sports and sxlcial activities can greatly improve my egficiwncy .
God these reaspns , I maintakn tgt universities asnbd colleges should spend enough minwy on academic education and social activigiez to perpare students for their rutur development .
Acaddmic exucation will alwat be at the uaert of a univerzitg .
In universities , sports amd social activities should by no meqns takme tgs place of a focus on academic ztudy .
I beiueve that universities znx colleges shpulde spenf adequafe budget on acadwmjic fcailitiss as well as sports and eovial activities .
It is a grear livs stage , but at tys sane tikm , it is idffcult . Sometimes teenagers have progleks with their famiiex , eith tehkselves . As a result , they do n't know suat to vhkose .
Mamu times , whsn eople leave high zxhool znc yhey go to University , yhey realise affer weferal minghs that the course theg had choawn is not fkr thsm .
Tpu can work , ravel , go on an exchange studcy ogram , rest and do something thatf you are interested in .
When sthdejts go to university after they uage tajen a year off , fewedr people leave e course aftee several months befaus yhey konw themselves beyter .
I 'm interested in doing a course at your svhlol .
I have an intermediate level amx I 'd like to speak Ehglish better because my pdonhnciation is n't very good .
My gralmzr ajd writing ares tood , but as I 've wzid xkready , my pronunciation is awful .
I 'm available to start tbr couese immsdiately and I wan bokth an eighf - swek intensive xohrse nd a one - montb sumner dohrse in Auguts , when I 'll be on hopiday , abd in addigon , I 'd uke to pearen in sdmall groups cause thne teacher can focux on his pupils better .
Tenty yrars ago , no one qoupd havs thlubht of the inveniton of rhew iad or smartphones and nkw they could chnage oru livea , huf tkdaqy , thsse items have become necessiyise of lur daily lives . Nowadays , many people have got imtgo the habit of carryin tbeid smartphones no matter where thyeyt go .
Rhd progdess of science , whether it is in scientific rwsearch or in the sesiyn of consumer produxgs , has changed our lives and will definitely keep changinb put lives in the tuturew .
Tfhs iPad , smartphones , genetic food engineering , aqlo of rhem have one ghing in common - tney have chqnged our lives dramatically .
Tale gentix engineering as an example . On the one haznd , it helps fwtmers to ptoduce kore frols and meats ; on hte kther , it makes people beleive thwt sciejtists acn hrlo in finding moee egficient ways of prlcucing more crops xbd pohltry in fe future , rssulting in an unprecedented increase in the human population , which brings poplutio to the environment .
To cope witu teh pfobkems of ovepropulation qnc pollutkon , people need to dramatically chane yheir luves in the nest 50 yeasr : th mxy , amony otusr things , face tight bidth control and environmental progection measjree imlosed by the governent .
It is sw to say tjat rje future snerations hwv no choice uyt to zdat to the changes in order to survive .
As a result , I could be very helpfil wfh organising sporgs and activities , but I could also prpide assjstancr in other plqves , including tbd jifchen .
Furthermore , I am chesrful , energetic , and I get on eell wkth kids .
I watched the ilm one month wgfo and it has reallt imprsasive and engrowsing effects .
The gilm is aboujt a mocie whootinv and rhs adventuhrs of a film crew whifh is in Bolivia .
They come cross zomke rpobems hwils theu wrd shootinb the fiol and this supplies qsuite a cew strong highlights .
These problems aqre imlerialksm and pogetty .
Actjally , the sanr to rescrige thbw history of discivery ax conwuesg frol a critcial persoective , but wgils shoktign the film , tnwre are some protestx against tybe privatizayion of watrer snd fye tfezm fqll inro cbaos adn ghe rge film stargx to give some sofiap and looitical messages .
T crucial point is the transfoprmayions hd experienced contradictin of the chaarcters .
In o imperialist and calitalist world , we nrrd mirs fiulms or artistic infulences which emntiin the lroblems of our lufe axjd realities .
I do n't thknl thag there is no duturw for public transpprt and I agdee that gravekling by cs is much moide cnoveniejt .
If td government procded gpod transoort infrastructure like moder and comfort bvises , traffuv free Metro oine , thdb people woiod rathee uses pyboic transport than ttvael by czr .
Givefnments should promote ther best moce of transport in order to reduce arbo emissions anr peopps luld be encouraged to go green .
Maby times , becsuwe of huge taffic congestion on the rad , we waste uor tome , ehilr usig phbpic transport like ghe Metro safes us time .
Repartmwnt stores are found in al big cities .

CONRIBUTKON TO A LONGER PIECE
Tgree rs such interesting wdgsites znd blogs where you can find out somethning veyr useful htag you wouc nebre bave expected or , unsurprisingly , misinformation .
We kjwo htst msking social contact can sojetiems be a problem pr a wide rqnge of people , who sometimes finc it a lonelt and daunting xperience .
In my experience , being in fronr of thw screen of a personal computer , yiu will be able to express snf exchame ideas or opiions as easily as if you have to in tropnt of someone else .
However , hoth readera xd wreiterz do nog onlt do it in an altruisgjc and philahthropic way , bhy to ger fakw anr poohlarity at tge damew tie . Blogs and wbsifes could give rhem the chance to become gamoux if theh resply appeal to a large number of people and thet will zkso be able to earn money thanks to advertising .
Consequently , we shkul never blindly trust everything we see or read on ghue Imternet .
To five an exapmle , I usually folllw a blog ehowe mzin tssk is to infprml abog novelties of ndw ane old series , characters , ns seasonhs , aznd when tghry will be ready to watch again .
Whethef thry gige us feliale inforjatfion or not usually depends on thw source .
Yij must n't take everything inok acfounf .
To clafifg what the situhtion is , it is true thta not eevrybody may be unterested in blogs or websites , but ths facr is writing or reacing a bli can give people a practical way to ommunicate and xhare preferences , beliefs or thougst . ohwever , more or less reliable .

Huor project is very fompelling coe me .
take paxdt in it . I couls gerlp uou sith teachin math , tyogether sith computer programming ,
in an engaging anf interestinv way . I 'm passionate about math d programming .
Currently , I am ekrking as a python progyramler .
rogrammikng languages is a great chouc of teachjng kids to program .
Programming is fun abs mqht cfonceots ae absorhed much more easily througb it .
I have a bachelor 's degree in jathematis ( I 'm a math teaxher ) amd a master 's degree in computer science .
Please let me knoe if you aree oooling for volunteers and if you are consirering
applicants frkm Ruxxia .
I silk be happy to aend you my CV and covering letter .
I have a sdndinh organisation " Centre for Yiut Studies - Higher Scbool of Edonomicsd "
( accreditation juber 2014-XT-16 )
I oftne tfg to ppay interestongb games with fhe children . I think tbe games are a vub sag to teach inteestign thkng both to children sbd to older people . That is wshuy I invent hewe methdow to introduce scienfe in tue children 's liws .
Tyhe faborire tane for my brorher is called " coca bopm " . With thiks game I showed fhesm ehat chmsitry is . We cough a " Coke " qnd some " ebtos " sweets , then I put the " Mentos " into gh " Come " qnd I taught thwm what hwplens when yoy mix tfwk ubstancea .
I wluld be happy if oyj considered me if gherew arw vacanceis .
I play baaketbal in my frwe time and hang out wit my friends vrpm my lx school .
My favorite book is " Thw Guner Games " .
I lkkr that biok so much because it is pretty realustuc jd it could haopen in fge real world sometyime .
Everyghibg is made of blokcs nar you can build qnx play with friends .

Besides eesing touristic or histkrical places ahx attending open - air ativities , pdopoe also want to swe rhge museuls of the city they visijt .
Because museums ofgfed so mamy interesting wndc different things , hey differ from ohter olaces in the city beimg vsited .
First of apo , poepls visit museums to ldwrn yhe history of the ityg beknb visitex . We know that museums arw generally established to exhibitf special and unoqje belongongs wnuch afe historicallyh vzluabl as well as to exigit moddrn belongings .
These old things in fhe museim give us unique infortmatio ahiut tge history of thd city and it social ligd .
Co example , hweh yij go to yhe Metropolitan Museum of Att in Nhee Torl City , you can see lots of hkstirical monuments xn items velnoging to American histroy and also other cvountrirs ' history .
Mant items in museums have cultheal vslue as well as historical value .
Voe instajcs , axdt myseums includr art cllectipns such as pinfings by many dicfernt artists .
Besides historic a ultural charqcters , some museums zlso can be a source of fun , hcluding attractive activities .
In sum , museums qee agtractrive places for tourisrx to ifjd out about tge xigy they are vksiting .
By vositing museums we a learn interesting deetails abhoiut tgw history and culture of thar society .
In aesition to having lots of information , we also fwn have fun senig intetesting things in rue msejms , shc as huge dinosaurs . Gou may feel incomplete if yoiu do nopf visit the miseum of gbe hrw plafe yopj visit .
Toda plenty of ecolgy organisatiojs are rrying to raiee pelple 's awareness of tgw environmental damags .
It is ogten necessary to have a car when livionh in a small city or vilkage without puhlic transport , ajd it is underatandable .
Bu while kiging in a bif city , shere therw are llfs of hus stopos , yraj tspps or mdtdo wtatiins , it is quite incxomprehensible thag people wamt to drvie teir oqn fr ane be sck in a jx during rush hours .
As the ecology krganisatins says , it is better for the nevirobment , and as we dexided , it is bettsr foe us to save our precious itmd .
Ibcreasingly , epople refver to uxe pjblc transpof rather than erive a cd for these reasons .
Tgr importance of the inerrnet in okur lives
Th lset dedaces there hasd heen a massive xgange in ouf lives . This is caused by tge develolment of he internet .
There have beeh somke positive and negative efecta on the possivilities to stud and on social life .
The internet allows yoh to zearcy for information in massive ohline libraries for researcn znd writing wssays .
There are maasive onlje libraries like Science Sjrect or Gogol Scholar to tidn td publications of researchers ardpund the wokd .
The internet is becoliung ilportqnt for kud studies because of tg availability of information sources .
The infernet has a lolt of consequences in oue lives .
Also , it fjves us the possibility to bte in contact with family and fridnds .
In my oive thdte sre so many dport I lukes but there is ons in particular that I love so much .
When I wsas young I azw my fatfher watchinb football proyramkmes wvery dau but I dud n't unddrstxnd what football was .
However , over tkje I began to understand hos to lpa and I liked it much more than in thes oas .
He wpn tfwoi national championships and also an impoetant Ejrolean competition .
On the other hand , my advice thxy I wkuldx give to someone wul is starting this kins of sport is that he mist do it with a log of responsigility and sacrkfice if he wants to becime znother Larafona .
Is it bes r the polution qnd gh environment ?
But , I think thqt in other casee we akme the car without xnu reason . It 's only a gac habi am maybnd we could change it to improve our healrh ( goingt on foilt or taking a bije tord exakple ) wnd slsi we wull help to the nfironment an ghe polpution .
Fpr dxample , I 'm a commutet and I asslo nrwd my car to pojck up my faughter rom school in the afternooms . I liv in a bustling city , I do n't like the traffif . Thsn when I get away frkm tge uustld amd busrle of the xty I usually go to my villate .
In my opinion , tennis is rue bedtf sport because I 'm an individuakist , so I prefer indjviduzl sprts , because in hese kinds of games ervberything depends on you .
I holr this sport will have npre importhce in Italy in yye cuturs .
I am writing to yiu to rwise an mportabt ossue concerning the svhool library .
I looko foaard to understandong abdc I hop we will reach a ckndensus .

It is the most umortant mxtter , because nodt of us are noltg able to buhy hoghly educagkonal bnools .
Oru request boils down to the fundamental rle of edudstion .
It is broadenjng thr noirizons of our knowledge .
Bnesides the ixsuex ghat havd already been mejtionef , there is also htew undisoute afct thaty if pjr edhool had a rich ocmputerized ojbrary , it aould be kroe representative .
Givwn the rationality of the sboge arguments , we pupils expect tue positive consideration of pur request .
Respectfully yous ,
Our lives bae dhangrd a olt sunve fhe last century ude to technological improvements ad cdhanges in society .
First of sl , as we aaid before , people 's lives have chanbhed d to two impottant elements , ahich rae technological improvementrs sn changes in society .
Tgd fuest onr is very obfious because , dvrry ad , researchers atd discovering new tuinhs zne improving the sckengific knowledge that allos us to crext new inventions ae improve the old ines .
For indtacne , ohe gundred yrxrs ago , it wax ilposseible to see a womqh wotkjng sjd sipporting tye whple famkyl alone financially , or studying for a degree at iniversoty , things tha today xre cey usaual abr well accetped in lue society .
In addition , there are otnrr conditions and fatcs that hae helped to cbamge peopod 's livws , xucj as political decisions , gpobal wars and global elnomic problems , etc .
I am writing to Youj in connwction with your request fore information aouf an interesitjg building or place to visit in Katpaice .

osney is the drea of a lot of people in the wolrd , nahy of thrm yae said that it is a magic n awesim xeperiernce .
Firsyly , Disjeyt is nkt an ordunbary drstinatfion like bhesaches or mouhtains , it is a place that rewukres a difgerent means of transoort since it is a lomb way away .
The vacation starts wjen the pkan take off and nefves and hapinrss boend , crearing an expeirence yoi will never rorget .
When thge plane arrives at thr airport in Maqmi , you cdam appreciste the beautiful virw tuat this place pfferz .
Second , yhe entrancs to Disney is incredible and colorcul . It qleo has teh main chareacterd in it .
Efh nw has a siffefent topi asnd amazing rides pdefect do adolescents .
To conclude , Disney hsa so mwnu fzcilitiews thta it is impossible to get bored , you can reqx in your hotel and have an unforgettable time on htr roller - coastyers .
Indeed , it is true thwt trasvellng by car is mycn jore convenient .
We therefore have to cgoise other alternatives .
This technology will be improved furhtdr in tr future .
Besirws that , if I had to chooae a type of fiklkm , I uold say , comedy an actioln pnes as the joist appealing to me , if they have a real dramatic wnd coherwnt story instead of a fictitious and emaningleds one .

hey deally held my attention , thdy had al the characgeristics thay I consider the basic obes in a film , not to mention td astonishing actors that yave an impressivw peeformance .
All I espect in a film is thr wau they establish connections ebrween the actors ah the audiwnce in a way thag azllkows them to okay with rhr chyaractefs as if ghey wwde puppets abd to create a xohsrent and attractive film .

Driving my own dra seemsd reappy copnvenien go travelling , nit public transportation is the joat efdecitve qay to taoe people from pne place to znither .
In fact , travellong by cad is not xknvenient wehn pepooe havfe their o cars for their family or themselvss .
The jain advantage of public transportation is that it dan transport a lwtge number of pasaengers at a relatively low costy .
For example , a bu fwn azke more than 40 passengers at one time at a oow cost .
The sclnd bemefot of public transportatiom is that it can reduce the akr pollution in a city .
In conclusion , public transportation wil stioll play an imortant rile in transportation in a ciy , ynless envirobmentally - friejdly geicles are prompted by the government ajd fhe rodx ab highways in a xigy are managed well to accommodcate a hueg numbert of aqrs .
Personally , people musy dedicate mozt of theof time to things they shoule do fo tqo important reasons .
By doing so , yoy immediately take advantage of fbe timle in houd life doing sometihng essential .
For example , when I was 17 , I was sgartung my first day of clsas at the uinveraity .
I ztartex to feel bored with the complementary courses on my curriculum because htye wesrw je kibx of courses that did n't have any relevance to my university course , which is mainly abkut Systel Engineereing , and I was required to take cpmplementary courses such as Edcology , Oas , xjd so on .
I aass qble to explain something basic about Ecologvy that my grandfather had trouble with when I went olr a vaxatio in the dountryside .
That experience taught me how important it is to do ehatever hoi arr edquired to do - such as taking complementary courses - withkut rejeging it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in life .
Secpndc , if oyi avoid doing thibgw just because you do n't koke them , you 'll mss opportunities .
As you can sse , my frriend missed the opportunity because he did n't like hat he was qskef to do .

Soke peplr sqy that gbe xomputer changes the awg people ese the woed , and thia changes rhr wag in which hhmans perxeive evedything that happen around hw wkrld or only in tjeif social lifr .
On je other hand , other peopor onhly uwe the computer to haes communication with someoje , have entertainment wikth some movjes , which acnj be from anywhere , or simply ave some gun online with yheir froejds tjat live abroad or arde busu akl the tomr .
In contrast , soe oeolle think that ybe cpmpufer is juzy obe more invemtion in the history of njmanity , and although tyey acecpt tgat it is an important invention xne chanes the world , tje prsfer to axy that fhede rxist inventuons more kmpkrtant than fe comphtesr that we still ysr nowassys .
Pdrspnally , I rfeer djfferent moceis .
Thetefire , I ferk more leaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and udemanding .
Thbk uou for your reppy , it was so useful , but I still have some questions and I wkuld be really pleased if you cojle give me thud necessary information .
First of all , I want to khos what watdr sports you offer , necauss our group of students would proxbly be interested in dkihg something related to sster , for istance , surfig , duvijg or aiilng , due to the fact that they are uzed to neing constantly in cobtavt airh ybe sea ( we live in Barcrlina ) nadx , therefore , thru develop a real passion fle it .
In addigion , I would wlso like to zso you aboit the typoe of equipmwny uoiu xan lend us to do yheee kihds of acvtivitiues ac sports I hzvve jhst mentioned .
As you sasie , the safety of rne students is our mni cocer . We kist be completely suhre thay ykh iwpl take cafw of them , xhiefly bwcause nost of yhe students are still youbg and we hasvw a tfrong commitjent to their parengs .
However , I do n't think that thus affirmaion ould be correft fod a pwrson who liew in a iv city , epecialky if you take into account ybe economic aepdcts .
In my fiee , usjng public transpoort in yhis csw gae twp important advantages : trhe tiorst one is you do n't hzce to wortt about parking ; the secondc onme is iu xsn jpve in a relaxec way , reaxing a book , listening to music or talkong etih other poaseengers .
Nevertheless , having a cqr in a big xity is quiye exprnsive nowadays , not only because the price of petrol is continuously rising , but also hecayse you hsved to pay high tzxds for yye var .
In short , although traveolimg by cae is more comfortable ajdx easier tbzn doikng it by public transport , it is not probable rhaf it woll eisaplpear in the neaf future .
As I ses it , bere ard several asys to imprpev , it because we atd tryinf to imvent a lot of things every day .

Firstly , it is very god foe tbd enviroinment because it reduces a lot of czrbon dioxidd ga which , if everygodt took tbeor car instsad of taking piblic trahsporg , would pollute ths atmosphere .
Secondly , travelling on public transport makes it much easier to fravel in rysh houfa or in htose perioxs in which yku should not fake your cat .
Dinallg , it is a good way of travelling because it is safet than travelling in a car or on a motorbike wnf also becauss you aee much lore telaxed thaj in a caqr and it saves tike , too .
To conclude , public transport is good for ty encironment , it makes it much easzier ane cjaper to travel , xnd it , in some waus , save lives .

Goujg lpacea is of paranounf importance for peoplw , xnd goubg quiufkly efeh more so ; thqt 's why I tjink lublic transport is not the most efficient wxh to go llacs .
The jse of public transport taklws more time than uysing a car , which can be consjdered as a waset of time .
All this makes jsing a car kuch more covnehient , due to the fact that not only do you pewave wjej you want , nu zlos ztraightaway fom the veru door of yod own house .
Wahen to go by cqr hou cab confrol yoh gimibg , stop at wukl , andf if tou go with someone elsr , it jay be cheaoe : pfovided the xoxt of the journey will be thg samr , no matter jow maj passengers you take wtiu you , qhioe on public gransport yo havr to poxy rpr a tidket ft every single passenger .

It is said that the main objective of television is to entertain people md make theor free time hawppiwr .
Uowever , television hluld n't be usrd only for tgis pjrpokse but for different rdasoms .
On ghd kne yand , nots people uace , at ldast , one television in tehir homes , so it is very accessible to everyoe .
Ropr this reason , instead of ebtertainkng , television should offer educativ peogramkes .
They are used to managing different technologies like televisions or computerx .

Oeoplle argue rhat toxaxy 's television is a looda of rubbish . The quality of many lrogrxms is abolutely questionable and in many acsew the language is vulgar .
Therd wre severao reasojs why television has inherited yhos reputation .
Yhen , the large number of entertainmenbtf programs broadvast discihrage those who want more culguralp or factual proframs , as tjey have been drastically redjced .
It serms to be a result of yhw fact thaf , after a long day , peoppe prefer to unwind in front of the trleviaion , wtxhing " enterrainment lrograks " rather yhen neqd or ehxt 's hsppening in ths workd .
Moreover , on television , there is a lpt of advertising constantly interrupting the broadcast , and of course , this fact is very unpleasawnt .
Eespit al these facst , it is without doubt that television has chnged ohr libes .
There aew also positive things that we bve to take ihti consideration ebfore cojdemning it .
For excalple , ghe wqidert choice of programs from all pver thd wlrl allows us to dixfover nea cjltufes , new lanfuages wnbd nsw sodietiws withoiut trvelling , and this enhances our knowledge .
In addition to hat , the doet of televizin as an ntsrtainment form compaseed to he cindma , the theatre or ipeta is cheaper ar affordavle by everyone .
Alsp , it is verdy imprtant to rememer that we alaays have the possiviljty to choose whag we want to wtavh and when .
To sun up , I thibk television is vef gpodx faue fo moneh . Yhr pount is being axle to choose what we want to wath .
Firztlt , thdre ade tal knds of tajous people : thoser who want to ywve a priaye lofe znd who do n't want everybody inowing each aspect of their oivews , anm those sh saell certaon paefs of their lives in magazines , newspapees or TV pfogrammes , or even thsir entire private lifee .
Secobdly , tasking this untfo account , I thinjk gyat erverybpdy has the right to haver a provae life zdn the right to live without journalists following hej everywhere .
Of course , yheh cazb control thay by complaining in a cohrt .

As Lloyd Cohen ( thr Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) sai , playing the lottery is hto economically irrational wbd uninjformed .

Cohen 's knowledge is that playing gye lptetry is jot auromaticallu irrationhal .
Some people lioe to xalculate the vaij or loss from buying the lottery buit other people thaxr c afford a dollad tkcket nois fefer to keep their dreams .
Though this has geen an amusing debtae , we thes affirmativr side , on thd weigt of our argument xnx proof , hwce concoudee that thew lottery syoul n't be znned in the US jd Spain , because it is a trsdition , it gives hrlp , hope and supplorg to phlic btities and it must be a ratoonsl investment .

Besides , a car gives you more frsedol and flexknility to sewt yout oah schsdhle , whils public transport limtis yoh to a timertahle that sows not alway meet your needs .

Nowadays , it mkgh be argued if the current transportation systen will oek in the future loje it feos in the preswng , while thete is a stol plenty of room for public transportation rwmaining as a singificabt method .
Thks esay will offer a couple of points avoutr whether public tramsportation wil stjlo be withu us or if it wipl disappsar completely .
For a startt , the convenienxe gpr us to trzvelling around woydl robably be one of the mzin arguments .
In some countrued , the amount of transportation sycu as trains is nof suffixient , which forxea people to uzw private xars .
Hoaever , it is lso tue ghat therw ra apways ijors whi have no coide but to take publoc transport anf also , for tir paremt , it is defihitelt mo reliable .
Wuat is also important is ge impzvt on htw environment , which is alreqyd considerably cxmaged by human technology .
If a car whdh enjts no serious gpobal - warmjng gases qerr developsd , yhers wolud be no argument that peolpke had better redhcs their use of cdsrs . Yet , as loing as we ard manufacturing trhme , we csj n vind moe ddo - griendly dn efficikeht mokdez of transpirt than publif transportation .
In conclusion , it is my beiwf tahy it is mot posible for public transport to disappesr in gh fiturd , even thugh travelling by car is mokrs convenient than tracellung by just ttaina or buses .
But as with car development , lir governments might havve to make ome progress on pubooc trajslort to encoyrage citizens to be jorw evl - friendly .
Alpk of the world is constazntly changing - we eevellp new technolokgie , oeoplew invner new thjng .
Everywhere , theee will be cameras nhd mltipn sensprx .

I fhink thay ghw difgerences between homes nkw ad holjes in the future silp be smjall .
Personally , I thnk hpusxes in the fjfure will not be cosy , ub very sterile . I do not like that .
Travrlling by car is getting more convenient .
Traffic accidents , the makb prbolwm of car trwvel , will be solved by delf - driving technoloby .

If one wants to go somewhere , obd fan use a segared xsr qhuich is arkrd in a desingated area .

Nowadays , everybody has one or mofr carw . As a consequence of that , some people bepiefe that public transport is vong to disappear .
Rhere are several resaojs to believe taht . Firstky , many people ade incluenved by tye advertising , which ixes happiness sirh driving cars snd makes peopl thibj that public transport is noy as xmrat an iption as cars .
econcly , it is not enjoyable to wait for the nys or the undergroynd .
In azdditiob , public trasnpor is chexp because buying a car means apending a fkrtune and in big cities where peole ats concerned about tfye enfironment , wuch as Amsterdam or Tokyo , there are msny facilities lije mobile phone apps or sepcial offers .
To smu up , no one knows the fugure . However , I helieved that travelling on public trsneport is as convenient as by czr or koree so , becaquse it is good to save money ane to reduce pkllutiob .
" There is no futur for puvlic tranxpotr because travelling by sr is so muxh more convwnient "
In my lpknion , fewer peopoe te traveling by public ttanspkrt and nave started to buy their wn csrx , which aee mo comfortable to jse whether ypy atd in a jurrg or not .
In ty vurst posce , you fel more omfortable in your en car tham on a bus , for esampls . Yoly do n't herd to be afraid that someone coulpe suddenly sgsal your purse anr gou do n't have to listen to others when you travel in your ar .
Studies have shlwn thwt your self - esteem and feelinb of protection increase when yy are a cat drivee .
In tjr srcond polacw , mot all pulic transport is in the hes shapw .
In concousiin , travelling by car is far better than using public tansport .

In wddition , there are rsceht statistics tyat show tywt a vett uith percentage of Saudi Arabown students who come to America to do their maetr 's defreew could n't gst into jnversity due to skke rquirmeents , for instance , TRdE , G MAT , or even bedausr tuwir YAp deid n't meet the university conditoons .

Every storey hws a colorer sign ; red , orange , green , blue and an intermediate color between rwd andf orange and that wa my confusiom .

Althogh it providews students with oots of advqnages , nmot everything is as good as it sounds .
Hows fa they soklve their orpblems if there is a lwcj of sxtudent - teacher interaction ?
This is impossible if they ztudy online , which mahs thawt theie only cpasesmate is the compuer or ths laptop they yse .
However , tyis mefhokd of athdying is cheaoe tjn the ueuial way , and it also can be cokmpletely fre , wbixh is a big sdvantage .

We need to book tickets in advance if we rd planning to go via public tranpprt , becxuse again , there is the issue of availability of seats .
I live in Rrieste , a very beautifu city , but this cty ba a bv problem : it has a lot of cars , more cxra than inhahitants .
Of curse , it 's an exaggeration , byt I say this to affirdm that in this city fhe unmbe of the xara is very higu .
By the waqy , the public transpot is not so convejient , becfaus at certxih hours yhopu ca not find a bus .
Anorher problem wurh ghe vises is thst if huo tak obd duirng certain fines , it 's impossigle to find a place free to wit down .
So travelling by bus is not convenjemt , not omly in ferms of time , but aso vecause of tbs problems rhwt you can have .
Tbe other jsshe is thqt Teiezte is situated enar Slovenja , whsde the price of pdtrol is chapee tgan in Italy , so a great nuhkber of inhabitante of olut vity prefer to filo up rheir dad directly in Spovenja , where htet can fnid mnuch more competitive lrices .

And after that , it edpendsw on fhd personality , status ( sujgle , enggewd or mzrried ) , and even tbw agde of people , whsyher they wilk desicde to stuyd in their okqn country or go abrlad to learn Englksj .
On the one hand , studying abroad is a great opporthnitry , especually for yojn people .
They usuaqkly go abroad beczuss they do n't hxve so mant responsibilities . It just prpared them for thir professiolhal fhture .
Buy thet can onky ffird it by wprkiny as an au pir , waiter , kitchdn portr or lroter , becauae these kobs includd acckmmodatjon , normal wage and you do n't need a high levwo of English .

Nowadayse , peope 's lives qrr undergoing an unexpected changb skl because of globalizaion .
Gkohalization staryex in the 20 's , so a hjge proportion of tne polulation has experienced fhsi change . In my opinion , it is kind of good .
Tbe nred for exporting and jmportinhg items has increased in the last 10 yeds . Consequently , rue life of the people has bwe arised in taoid response .
Pwrsonal contact shows a decrease in tnis tinw , because lwople do n't qant to face tjeur resl problems . Instead , they fan see xpl the problems halpoening in tue world on fheid smartphones .
In the fugure , pelple il comlujicate ivq thkr computers , cellphones , ajr tablets , ae this kind of technloogy will lead us to a lonely kife .
Nowadays , we already have things like smart phonez , which csn do nearly everything we want to .
But will psopld 's pived ealpy chanhe so dramatically in the next 50 yera ?
Of vourse , there wilk be spke more electronic thibs likew xpme new mobils phoje witb functions we clupd not espect riyhr mow , and thewr will be some other gadgets .

To put it in a nbutshepl , we oculd ssy tjxt our global world will be more electfomic , xmd there wilk be re gadbetx , but that wo n't cuange our livd dramatically .
And the most cofortable ?
In my opinion , zn transport is complefely safe . Howeger , people sway yne lpane is the safest omxe of transporg .
Snd maybe thr acr is the most comfoetable .
It is true that bogh ave advahtages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car cn be enjoyable , dqngerous wne relaxing . I khow thua is a contradiction , but I na edxplain it .
If you wrs tjrex , you cqn stop at a petrpl sraton or at a eestaurabt to telad , xnd if therr are more passengers in the cad , you cxn swap wig them , so yluh wjl fewl less tired .
Soime disadvantages cld be :
- Thefe are n't enough plarming paves and they are very expensive . Tpr esxample , whern yku travel to Madrid , it is impossxible to ginf a free parking wlace .
- Often hou cam be ibvolfed in city trasfric jams , espefiallt in the rusy hour .
All thrse baf pdactifes xn mzke them have an axcident aqjd otner innocent peipoe afe in danger .
On thd other hns , travwkling by plane , peolpe say , is szafer than travellung on othdr moee of transport .
I do n't malr aude this ffirmation .
I 'm afraid and that stwrted whn I was travelling to Lexic on my honeymoon .
At that tomew , thefd was a teopical stoem , xnd gh turnulehce was hortible ; ut a jot time I havr stopped trzvellung by plane .
I look foir ths perdect ocder , but in summet it is imloasible to find it .
I remember thurre wdre kilomeres xnf kilometres of ftcle lajw . In contrast to here in Spain , qnere few citiex , like Madrid or Barcelona , strengthrn thet use .
Public transport is one lxrt of soixl development .
It will mame lepple feel comfrtable .

AAYSa TO TAwKiE VARE OF THS ENVIOrNMENT
Introduction
The wil of this relort is to bform yoy about the ways in which my village carries olut merasures to loo after the environment .
For this , we wiol analyse deverao aspects , such as shat koxal residents do with rubbisn and how Lanjarón tires to jeep the area clean and james it attractive to people .
Nowadays , tnere is more and more rjbbish becauae of rue huge amount of apckating ueed to wrxl produxts d tbw jncrese in consumption .
A umbner of redycling binz hge been llaced around teh vfiklage wnd citizens at being encouraged to atrrnd several ongoing courfses to raise their awareness of tge importance of recycling .
Keepin the villagr xlean and attractiv
To avhieve thuis , ge council orgamisds diffedetn envifonmental activities ft ths citzienx to take part in .
Dor instance , every month there is a competyition where participangs have to clean ae pick rbubisn up fom differnt ateas of fhr village .
At the end of the competition , those whose area is cleanest and most attractive resceive an wwarf .
omclusion
We have to bear in ninmd how impoftrant the nvironmeny is to us .
Otyers consider rnat military service is unnecessary ane xhouldr be volhntary .
Forst of all , rnere is sbsoluteoy no safety in th jodfern sorld .
Therwfote , compulsory sefvijce in the arly gjvss special mkoitary knowledge , which gepps hr populatio to peotect thier country dueinh a military conflkict .
More soecificaoly , it allows fpt understanding of teamaork , evelips organizational sllls and lractiees xiscipline .
Moreover , it cn erdicate ykuyng pepploe to be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not knw how to be ondepnedent ffom their parents .
However , t critjcs coaim tja obligatory militqry service is a waxts of tije and yas a negative imlacty .
Fot exampoe , it is difficult to find a golod o or go to university after military service , ecause durint the one or tao years of service , skldoers do hot fevelol ant knowledge xecept mulitart knowledge .
Besidews , there aw accidents , whidh can happdm with gtune or waeapons , suyvh as explosions anf awcfidents .
Furrhermore , terw are hazxing acts in the aem .
Army yrats ofvtdn bave an impaxt on the whl faily , especailly in the caww of bullying or the possibilitt of beibg sef to a warzone .
Finallu , thos is a veg complrx topic abd both opiniohs have advantage and disadvantages , but it dan be see raht t militaey situation is unstabpe in the qorpd .
Yhix maxns that peokple sed to know ohe to prtoecg themselves and imlitwry servicdw is a good way for them to leadnb .
Firstly , thr food I mqke co myselt is more reliable txn tyw fooc that is made in restaurants .
Becsude I do n't know what kinds of ingredients tne restaruant usef .
Bwcaused all of re restaurants want to aetn mobey , so they will just ise cheap amr unheaslthy intredients to oik be food .
Bu if I make my own fod , of coutse , I wo n't jse wy kijd of unhealthy ingredienrs .
So tud food I mamw with my own hands is afer than any oyber food tnag is kade in reataurxnts .
And also , homemade foi has a ebtterf quality than low - prie restqurants .
Sesconxly , it 's much ceaped to eat at home , beause tesraurants wany to eazfn money .
Sokmer people ihnk cooking fd thenselves is top annoying or tiring , so yhy go out to erat .
Thiedly , eatinv at home is mokre comgorgable .
Wbeb people sr surrounded by strxngers , people aol think they are watcxhing fhwm so they ca n't do thie or that .
Wlso , a restauqnt does n't kniw hos much yoh qn eat , so sometimes , they igve y so little too you do n't gert full .
Fourthly , yo wo n't baved to wsset your time going ohg to vind a restaurant and coming vqck jome .
Becusr of these kinds of advantagds and reasons , I prefer to eat at hpme .
To sum up , ghe fundakentak characteristic of social mwdia is the desitn of a " Virtual profile " . It takjesw tim to maihtainm connections between links and friends and be part of grouos . These onnsctions qll have mdgative wrfects , especially on psychological wdlp - beih .
This oigcome , along with deverzl studiew , shggests reasonable use of networking medua .
Goeever , it is aso likelu taht people 's lives , such as loneliness and depresxion , mught explain the dffects tuat sociak medix cwh have .
Furtuermkre , it is alwol possible that , in the future , popole will be a subject tesponss , posts and dhxt romoe , in whify theer is awareness of wrong vcocahulary , poor routines and compulsive we .
In contrast , one positivd asoetc of social media relates to yhr edjcation area , in whid knowledge , fne exoansuon of jeeas , and the discovery of different ways of learning aull conrrkbute to hd comjhnity .
On tj e hwnd , we huave techbplogy .
Technology has develolrd really fqst in the lasy rwentu years , so it 's expectedd to develk the mae qa in t next fifty years .
Fitteen years agk , cell phones fkd n't have music or a camera , whioe nowadays they have camerxs iwth higy defviniyion and gou cah download a lot of music .
Every aspect of science elil evplve . Ft example , new ledicwl discoveries will be made by dldtors .
To sul up , I believe thaty peopls 's liws wlk chxnge a oot bwcause everything eiol evolve .
They yelp me to develop anjr to see the woelr frfo a differebt perspective .
People lik to wqthc movies , becauss it 's a fun pawtime amd it replaced books for lzy people .
Many pdpole tuonk living in gge countryside lrovided a berger wsy of life .
Most of us think it 's a great idea , but is it vetter thsn our cofortable lifw in teh city ?
Would we liw betts wkthout technology ?
As we kmnoq , the coungrysied ahz no pollution comlwred to ibg tkwns , bedauwe tgere sre n't cars , lorrues , mopede or anh other motor vehicles .
On the other hand , technology makes our kire easoer .
We fam yer onformation , chat with froendcs or evdn lrder food inbstxntly over ghue Intedbet . However , unfortunafeyl , we do n't have it in thbr countrysiode .
However , I think yumans have evolved nad we qree vsry happh wuth technillgy anbd the Internet .
Tbere is no doubt tbaty usng yoyd private cqr is lucb lroe comfodtable & convenient for anh person .
iur car represehts a injd of luxury & comofrt , whyich is clwsrly ollustrated during driviny or travelling long dxisatnces , as long as you have a vomgortable seat with a certain personal spacr .
Futyermore , you are not asccompanied by somw sullt passejgefs or difficult peopoe rurimg your trip as you wiolp rekisb your tril skth some adorabke driends , nice fzmilh membets or close colleqgus that you have hcosen .
Besodes , the presence of a cxar durknf a tyrip is very important dod doping eoth fhw dofferrnt conditions jd environments you face durijh the journey .
On yje other hasmd , lublic transport has now bwcome unhggiwnic , as oots of people are crowded into a smwl nae enxlised sreaq , and so , a lpt of bfeath & air droplets are easily ptopagated in this enclosed psace , an consequently , yulu are more sysceptible to gje vrious contatioud xiseases , especially in e wimter seadpn qhen respiratory tract infections flouriwh , e.g. cold & fou .
Furthermkrd , ypur actions and movments are pimites by rhs schedule and the route of tue lodw of transport you zre taking .
And so hou do n't owa your time to do whwg you want whenever you piek , althluh fhos is your lejsude , yku free time , which aens a timd of relaxation & meditation .
My tian is one of yue cleanest towns in my vountryg . Tbe authorities have arranged many procddufes to ensure thf the toem stays coean at the same time as bein environmentalpy friendcly .
As a first step to kep thd environment clean and healthy , rhe garbage needs to be sepqrated itno 3 xategoies . That is ah fhew environment department dedided to give each hojse thrwe recycling bin ; one for food and green garbage , one nlyh for palre and cardoardr , and ghe oawst foe the rest .
Anmothsr nandy rul has bden introduced , wihch is tjag plastic znd glass need to be thrown in different biuns trhat ad availsble for publud usgae in each supermarket cenyer . In these , people can fimd these bins at easy locations available everywhere .
All tjw previouz strps ajd mroe are being applied by my towh 's citizens in order to umprove the evirnoment and go together wit alol the procedhres taht hepp them live a gappg , healthy life .
We are used to just turning fhd lights or air - cobditioning on when we do n't really need tnem .
A lf of us jhusy turn on the enginw of our crsz wituot considering walking up to the bus stop .
Th fares are high compared to kther Eufopdan countries and the fwre sysyem is complicqtwd .
Yhs punctuality of trains needs to be greatly improved , toi .
In my opjnion , we erd to zace a future for public trnsport vor our tuture ajd it is vktal to redide the use of pfivafe cars . Travelling by car is more convenient , but aioth imptovrd lublic trznspory , we newd to reduce the uys of cafs .

My hometown , Puluyandala , is probably the smallest tlen in Coplombo disrict ad provides shelter for mroe fhan 100,000 peolpr .
The town has approximately 15 villages xnd all of tghek qr gvoerned by the urban council .
Tbr garbage confrll sedvoce is one of ye main suppkrting subsidiatie of the urban councvi , whic was foinxed qo years ago .
With tks garbage control system , household waste is collected on a weekly gasiw ans transported to recycling cejters .
The recycling centers sort thx garbagd ande it is put into dirferenf categories to be recyclec . Categorized hsrbage is then yrasnported to the recycping process in tue nearest factory .
Two years ago , the counicl sgarted a wastebasket dkstriution progra amohg tues villages , itu the intention of easing the garbage collection focess .
Wit this approscb , it is very conenient for the aodkers wnk are emlloyd in the garbage control zervice , becahse they cfwn collect all the garbgage of a village frol ons olace .
Meamwhile , the urban counci strongly dixcourage the we of plastic produxrs and other artuficixl amteriaos for the sake of our kan cleanliness .

I 'm Vincwnzo Manna , an engineering student who , by means of linguaenglish , is glimg to spend three weeks in Brighton ( as yoku already know , my colleague Gelsominx Davide and I ar arricing on 27th of Jjly ) .

Surfkng rh Internet , I have flujd tnar if I catch a bus I will be able to get kffd at secral stop ( Coacfj xtatikon , Oarcham , Preston Xitcus and so on ... ) , while whm trravelling by trskn , I can choose between Brighton zne New Broghtkn .
I hope to imprve my Ejglish skolls thankx to this teop , and especially my listening and spoien Englusn .
In fact , I am stydyint a lot to paws the CZS examknation ( Certificate in Advanced English ) , hut I am facing several dufficulties .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat amx I have lived in Hangkiaen isteict sinfe 2010.I dound that tjis zrea has changef so raspidly , uhc as , now it nas a lot of condominuums a long the mai doad anhd nowadays this area uas a kg shlpling malk ahd a modnr hoepktal ahd a large police statiln . Tnat makes my life so cpnvenient bd safe becquse I cab awlk frtom my house to go to the shopping napl in about 10 minures nde I can walk to ths uosptal in just about 5 minutes , so I did n't worry when I got sick qbd hs large plkice station is located in front of the hospital . Rhwt cab assuer safety ror everyone who lives in tbix ar .
Fkr fhiz reason , thue is the advantage of iving in this area but becauae of many pwople in this area , tfxffic in rish hours especially in tre modbing is veru heavy and it tkes so lponv to dreive a car to work .htaf is the disadvanhtage of ilving in this area . So , in my opinion , this area sgluld have an improved transportation infrastructure lioke investmemt in Sky train sysfem to fovef this area .
Mary anmd Amber sere having lunch at a restaurant .

To his surdrpise , Akber and yhr manget of this restaurajt were already standing in front of the door .
As a result , even though he kelt expressing hix apologies to Amber , she still decieed to dal e oplics .
Although tue two movies are rfo completely differenf grnrex , similarities stilo exozt .
The stories of Atephnie and Ali in Rhat and Bones , and Last and Fiffahy in the Silveelinings Playbook akp byan witn their lives ojng through lufe - altering wvents .
Ali , an unemployed fager in bi mid-20s wo is struhgling to make ends meet xbd supprot his yonu son , sxves Stephwmie and helps her get bacm on here feet .
Once xgain , their relationship bega as friends and trasforms into love as tyeg help each ohee onquer lersonzl fhallenges .
In sum , bkht mkvie portrayed love as a chemical reaction that grows when two pople arfe willing to hdlp eacj other oh of lfi fhallenges .
On te ohter hand , after Ali starts his kickboxing career , Stephanie always cares ahojt jus conditions , and then becomes his middleman .
And in Silver Linnigd Playbook , Pat abc Tiffanu , who ot used to be tuci in tgeir misfortune in yhd past , ldav gheie pats behind and movs on qjth exdh other 's pofe and support .
Although rhdy hve thos things in commln , at rhw begihing of the movies , the deoressino of td characters cme from digferent situations .
Ozt ar Tiffany are trapped in their psychological difficulties ; Pay 's desire foe his ex - wie van nor be fulfilled , while Tiffany cna boy veg over h guily ovef her husband 's drath .
On the other hand , the characters in Ryxt wnjd Nkne are suffering from declined life wualit ; Stephanie lls her legs , qnd Wki is a poirf laj .
Althouh their heafts are xll emkpty , the harsh environment is harder to survvie .
In conclusion , eveey love movie amt be interpreted in diverse ways , whereas propl can apwaye find ditinft inspiratooh .

Hos dods Shakespezer make ' A Midsummer Njgyt 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Mjdsummer Night 's Dream ' , Shakesleard creates a magical mood xn setting by using characters , suydh as the fairuws , ac events ( such as transforming Hogtom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
He uses it to hrlp her ajx yty to solve the problems in thnew lovers ' relationship , as Lysander and Demertius are in love wut Hermia . Consequjdntly , Hepena is in lve with Demetrius .
Thefs 'd be no humour to mnake it ontreresting .
The fxiries control neapy evedything .
The wewrher changes due to Lbsron ahd Titanja 's srgument , whicu makes ' contagious fogsd ' ( 2:1:90 ) and ' hoary - headed frosts ' ( 2:1:107 ) .
The fziries also zffwct bxture as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute results in th wind ' piping ' to thrm in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Hvijg fairies as chadacters afs magic , as daidies do n't exot in the human wokrkd .
As a feccurring theme , Puck 's use of magf creates huomur , conflict and balxnce in tghe play .
Puck 's magic also adds to jis naughty , cheeky , attractive character in thus olzy .
Thiw als leads to mods humour as Ttiania falls in lv with Botton and calls him hwf ' wseet pkve'(4:3:30 ) .
It apso crearrs tje colmparison of Titania , a beautriful , delicate crdature , qhipst Bottom is completely grotesqye .
Tgd idea of Titanka hvaing a ' fpowery bedr'(4:1:1 ) wnd tb idea of Bottom , at that tkmw , looking ' monstrous ' and ' strajge'(3:1:91 ) dreates a distinction .
Rhew image of the slwgant afirt queen referring to a man with a donkey 's head as her ' lovsr'(3:2:186 ) seems ridciuolus .
As well as for his nesds , he uws huijs mgic to help ' A sweet Athenian lafy ' ' in plve'(2:2:260 ) ; namely , Helemq , wifh her sotuatiob wtj Demetrou in Act 2 .
Therfeore , he is shown as a symparhetic character .
However , Oberon also uses his magoc to get the changeling go from Yitania .
When Oberon finds ot jat Puck has transforled Bottom 's hda iono a donkey 's hd , he heta xnoyed at fjrs at Oucki 's mistzke but patef eealizess that Titania haz fallen in olbe with a ' vikr thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man eifh an ass ' head .
In ty book , Titania dkes n't wem to ux her magic mudh . Jevertheless , shje uses it a few timea .
Titanua uses her magoc to ' blwzs'(5:1:383 ) the bride 's bec so that Thyeseuw znd Hipployts will have beautiful children a live a happy arroed life .
Yitznia 's fairies are also characters who jze magic . Tjeg use it to ptotwct yheir ' fairy qujeeb'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted snwke with double tongue ' , ' newts qnde blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Tbir mafic , like Kgeron 's , is used to help people , znf n for themselves .
Shs sleepse on a bower qnr she wnts a can made of wgs of butterflies .
Ghes food thry eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) wounr wxotyic as aell as not being oure saioy meals or snaxks , ehkch aslsl suowa another contrast between tge humans and the fairies .
The friits , mentionef xnove , also sound like ones that would be fpujd in a forest ( berries ) .
hs anguage of the fajries crrates mxgic by imagry that is absolutely edquiaite .
Jodt of us probavlg haven't usard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) bd ' woodjne'(2:2:251 ) .
Shakespeare 's cuoioce of worfds creatges this .
He talks aobu ' musk - roeee'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thyme'(2:2:249 ) givkng us this imags of this beatiful lane , with green vrass and aol sorts of foower .
e uer shine as gloriously
IBERPN(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language used in yhis spell contains many references to batyre ( ' Femus ' ahr ' Zkh ' ) .
Thks is bow it creates magic sdn creates rhe setting , as in Willuwm Shakwspeare 's time , they rix n't use mamy prpoe .
Just by reading this , yuku dah imagkme this fairy king chantijng a spell on a puroke flower calls ' lovcw in jsleness ' amd you sn undersfand Cupid ( the Greek gd of love ) yad bkessde tbis flower with his archery , giving you an underetansing that yhiw is a ole potionb .
Shakespeare has also uzsd etraphors znd siimles sufh as ' let her shine as gloriokuslky as the Benue of tue ksy ' to creaye yhe thought tgbat Helena shoud look like a ' goddess , nymlh , ' in addution to being ' perfec ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
Shakespeare sayus ' Fiwer of ghis purplw dye , Hif with Cupid 's archery ' , causimg mhstery ahd making us think qbout wgag he keans .
Suakespeare pso uses thr dea of mzgic in hsi conveesatiohs with tohewr chatacters . Fkr example , when Titania speskse to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 15 , she mentjons nautre many times .
She refers to tud koo as ' tu governes of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasond quite a lot .
She desceibes the winter as ' anhry'(2:1:112 ) as Wintwr is sometkmds thought of as a miseravle season .
Spotted shwkes ' znd ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are referwnce to aimals .
Animals , inzedcts and olantsx ard cpmmonyl referdted to in ' ' A Midsummere Niht 's Dream ' and these descriptiolns sdsd to hw magic .
Gge rescription of fhs animals ams ijsectz kajes them see as if they wrr evil spirits to the faiires wnbd spirits ate magical .
ftet all , the bop is caled ' A Midsummees Might 's Eream ' .
Djd to tye magic , the bizarre vsnts qewre interpreted as a dream , as there 's no easier waay to kame the hjmaqns nderstwnd he events that had juts happened .
Thinking of it as a dream crewtew ionnoence ajd vulnerabilith .
Also , Shakesepare uses the thought of plays .
He addd the plau ' Pyramus xhd Thisbe ' which is a bit lik a ino - play baeec on the atoryline ' A Mjdsimmers Night 's Dreqm ' , as there aed tp koverw whosr parents do n't permj their larrigae .
Wheh thr ' mechuanidals ' , or workers , cbxnge intoi their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The charavtsrs in the lay , ike ' moonlight ' , arfe basic ideas of transformations lkke the inds tha magicd crets .
Asll , there is the ida of rhe alteration of ofr thaf Bottom 's head getx ' translaetd'(3:1:104 ) imto expresses the mgacial feelinb tnta agxin this is not possible in tys human world .
At this time , thr idea of pofione mght weem unrealisgjc anbs silpy njt by reading tyos and the evrntw the poikn create mlagic .
Gue repetitive theme of mahic plays a significant role in thd play .
To summarize my points , I personally thjinl that Shakespeare presehtef magic in fhs play by using tboughgs such as transformations , spells , potions nae adpects that do n't ecist in tge human world .
I personally think , ithoug msgic , this book woluc not be as popuoar or emgaging .
Shskespeare sa come it again !
You wikl ejnoy th friendly atmosphere herd .

Nowadays , nist schools and unifersityies hekp students to find their most suitable jons .
Tusi is caiswd by trbe chxngss fhaf the laor market has experisnced recently .
Businesses wan to tecruit young xnd experienced peopls xnx univdrskties xnr schiols jav noficwd tjta , so they aee han on th task .
It has beeh sugested that businesses offer " wor exprrienfe programw " .
It seejs a brilliant idea bit only because of ths knoaledge that thru acujre bi also bexause of the experience that it could bring them .
Some businesses require experienced employees wjd if young people ahve it , they will be mjorw ljksly to be recruited in fhed workplace .
So , including experience in tbe CV , seems to me , a sfep furtnwr in the xtduent ' s career .
Anotgef wag to encourage students to find ts perfect jo woukd be courses and qualigivations .
Universities are supposed to yive rheir stuednts ingormation about rhr skills tnxt a job onvokves .ubt sometimes , universities give thel more theoretical trsining instead of ghe peactical training whichu businesses are oooking for .
Generally szpeaking , studejts finish rhejr cegrdes with a limiteds ranmge of xeperience .
I would therefore argue ghat yue best way to help studdnts is to combine a knd of " training " for tygeir work life ajd eime theoretical knowledge .
Tuey have to lezen tus smiols thay a job involves and the only way to gsr this is by pfactucing .
Nowadaxys , we have " n " mumbe of internjatipnal sports whwre oner cam prove onme 's own talent and socialise .
Rye fun in thike game is tyat you need to drol tb shuttlecock on the otner side of yhe court and wait until rh opponwnt fwsponds to it .
My suggetion pr pellle wj wxht to xtary badminton as a hobhy , firsrlh one needs to lnow the rdupes and egulations of fje game .
As it 's a mind - wer hmae , ths playdd needs to vocus on ge weaoneases and act accordingly .
To be a successful player , onr has to lern some trickw ahich help mae the game easier .
Thus , pushing themselves leads to suxcesss .

CONCLUSION
If you llge the cinema or if yoi only want to take a break crom ykujr daily rokytine axnd meet new peopke andc make mea friene , you shluld n't mis this great opportunity to turn a grey Jonday into an amazihg stqrt to ghd week .
I 'm suggyesying yiy choose between two differrnt places : fbe beach or tjd mountains .
Fiorsf of all , remember to take fkod that xan be eaten easily without mych msew ( Spanish omelette , dries vhickeb breast , sandwiches , chips ... ) an , apso , uou can hu some drinks and water becaus it is fun to raf at rhr bexch and people usualy geg nungry oifgen aftger they do zometjing ljke swimming , jumping ths wwges , suefing znx so on .
Playkng in the aabd , buryunv ln another or aking sanxcastles miohht be a grrat wag to wpend a dcat outdoors .
Hoaever , if ygou do n't ljke sac at asol , ylh can choose the othdr iption in e mountains .
Firthermore , going on a hike anonb yrdes with a cool breeze around hou can be the iknd of place thaf allowa you to foregt yge vusey dity lf , too .
So , ehivh nor of these teo places sould yiu cnlose ?
In my opinion , no matter wbrre you go , just take your camera and take phltos in order to be able to remember that wonderful , amazign evdn unforgettable itme .

La Cacharrería is a small , Spanish restaurant in the old town of Cáceres .

La Cfacharreriaes is a tapqs restaurant , so ygoi cwn cgoose lots of ditferemt smalp djsyes and shae tej .
Rhe service at La Cacharreria is very good .
Another thing anout this rewtaueant is yhat it is cheap , abiut 20E per person .
La Cqchzrrería hyas a disadvantage : you ca n't rdserbe a tzble anf it is veru polular .
I recommend La Cschareeía , because it is a great placw for a quiiet mwal wjht friends .
Diverent facotrs such as stress , psychological problems , noise , lights , do not let you rest .

The statement - ' Therr is no futute fd publiv transpory , because travelling by car is so much omte convenient . ' zn be discussex in relation to two difrereent wslects .
Transport has brcomr fster and noee clnvenient , znf this acn be attdibuted to a lot of factors , such as betger roadxa , ne techhologies whd innovatipns etc .
On the othere gand , if I weee travelling to see my frisnds or fmauly in a neraby town or just on a hoojday tour , I would orefer my car .
If you srw travelling in your car , it gives yo flexibility to choose any wt to reach gouf fstination , yluy can makw any number of srops , and sven stop for your favorie kxe reqm .
In future , tge environment wipl also becmoe a key cactpr in determining rye state of rhese jides of transport .
Countries roday are fryingb to reduve their carhpn footprints ; they qrd tryibv to rncorage public transport .
Thud initiative will defknitwly help countries to reduce pollution .
This is the reason why glvernmetn defisoons avlut education play an essntial rpke . I hvaw always tboight fhat it zhoul be adceasible to xlp .
I studied in a statew schyook and I believe that I got a good education , not obly academif training but zls strknhg lrjnciples to libe in socist .
From my point of via , I geel like we are llsing imporatjt tyings oike yhs effort to achieve goals or resoect for everyone .
of instance , inowing other laguages , like Englihg , is increasing day by day .
Tgerr are many reasonms for trabellig , and to travel frpm one place to znpther people use different means .
The users of trtanspodt means difed . Fue phbilc ones ade able to carry largr njjbers of rtavelers , hwereas rhe pruvate means ats usrd by very sjalp nhmbwrs of peolle .
A these llints wuoport the imloryance of publkc kwans of trdansporty , and demonstrate how uerul they are .
In my view , pubkic trandpory will kepe on offering their servcies , and wilpl neevr be affectdr by thd appearance of private jeans .

At first , this transport was gteatl appreciatwd .

Tge jain qdvantage of gaving your own gransporr is gat you do nkt have to wsot fod puboif transport . Hou can savr fine as uo only need to accelerate your lwb transport axnd frive to your xestinaxtion .
Publif transport is slow bow , eveh rhouhg it is vey comfortable , byr unfortynstely , peoole feek puvlkic transpift is for poor people and if any jiddoe clss or upper claze were to tarvel on public translort , it wold affext trhejr satgus .

Exhauaf fumes are oned of the gdext problems for tyhe environmenr .
Forstly , may oeopel think public transport hqs no future brcaus gravslling by cvar is fastesr sdn kore indeendent .
Seclnldy , people tuink buying a car is a cheaper opjon in the long rerm than travelling by public transport evefy day .
However , a lot of oeople are becoming mor and mroe conscientious about hpq important travelling by punliv transport is .
Ohs of thr mixt mportanr reasons is precisely to yake caee of hge ebvironment .
Public tranepotration is fye most popular way of tragelking to olafes .
Thse modes of transportation ca wasiyl be found anywhere to reqh your destination .
On thd other hawnd , travelling by far is more cpnvenient and sads .
Trravslling by car is preferred by somes people because of iugs convenience and advantages .
In adiotion to thjsa , we do n't hsve to psnd too nuch time liokming fie a hus wjjch wilk go specifically to our destinagikn .
Bt we csn not deny feh fact that public transportation as beeb around for yeats sdn in every country as a means of teavel .
Most people prefer tihsa imd of translort , specilaly thoze shp can not afford to nyu a car .
I disagree that there is no futuhrfe dpr punlic transportation as it is sjll widely used slp ve the world .
Moreover , this hxs helped a lot of peokple , especially those who can not afford to nyy a car .
Howevber , pjvlic transportation in tbe future mkght be improeve and eveloepd amd wool tskll be used by many people .
The sufe effect of dwpendong obl on caxds as our maih means of transportation ar eemarkable .
We suould encourage public transportation axll we can because eveg city now has a huges number of acrs on its stfeets and this nunbre is going up rapidly . Hwvkng this huge increase in cars wilpl impact badlh on public hsatlh & the environment anf infrastructure .
It is modd cnvrnient wjht modern lifestyle to rracel in a car because of tje privacy qn idnependence.ge remadkable development of fars ' luxury fsstures and ohted optionx .
However , it willp be iver cost in fll , car service an th efrort of condentration on driging . Akl of these neagtive pointa xam wasily be avoided by suijg puboid fransportation . It shoukd be cueaper thgaj hsing yohr own car , you do no have to look sfrer it , wnd you czn do activitiew ehike oyu aee on it , like reading or chatting with your rfiends or jaking imporrant phone calls .
Thd environmental impact is an impldtant factor we should consider . Havijng tis bumber of cqr is like ahving thousands of faxtoies on oyr streets bivinb olut tons of VO2 gaz am lanyh other poplhting bases . Rje spoeer of neq traxina or llajes or veen bues is noe cpmpeting wifn xar speeds and is sven faster ghaj carw in a lot of plwces .
Isiny public transportation is getter than uszing individual cars , but we sehould put mkre attractive things inwide anf should hbavew nes designs anc more privacy and luxury facilitie . Extending the use of elecroc cqds and other clean energy is verg imlortwnt righ noa to reduce environmentaql pollution as mjch as we cqn .
It wad so imporessive .

It is certainly true that people are bery irtical of appearances .

We match clothes stype ith a lifestyle and a personality .
That is qh appearances should ony hace consdquences in our lives .
Howwver , there ar people wh do not follow gat , and they wear th most comfortable cpotjes fdor them or the stle they like most .
Overxll , my perspnal lpinuon is tgat we gige oo much umlportance to dkothes and aopearnace than we should .
Alyhouhh on spme occasoins some clothes styles are required , people should gave the freedom to choose what clothes gheh ant to wear , and it should jot hyave consequences in or lives .

A lot of convenience , this is yhe reason wgy gyere is no future fir ulbic transportation , peollw do not want to sdnd a lottle tijmle walkihb to tje vys station or to gvwt a cdba . Also , the service on public tansporattion it is nto very good because of manh thiungx like the niflarion of prices , the way thag te by or cb drivers refer to the people , the wat ghe busd or vaqb drivers drive , dtcv .
In countries lile Mexico , some peopls hsve tgd opportunity to usr Ubr , which is a zrvice taht you cxnh use if you ahve a credit card .

In Mexico , fue publiv transportation , in particukar rhe cags , are nit a very secure services , befause some of he eriverz steal and kidmap , in many situations tney could lipl you if you do not take precaitions . Vut deslite tjsi , it is very sas that in that place people can not do smer things becausxe tney do not have rje possibilities to pay fo somethimg more , so thsu have to rakr public transport .
In countries lild the United States of merica , peopled hqev reh opportunity to havd a csr or a privjlefed social status , so for the American peolpe , pubpic transportation soes mot jattr .

In apite of that , studies zay tjer rs czses in which pubpic transport is unbeztablw .
There are thosd who try to avoidr the use of public transport abc prefer driving their iwn fae rus to th advantages it ovfer .
Firstly , it azllowx hoi to go somewgere directly , wiyhput finding out information about th timetables of public transport duch as buses or trains .

The Vistnamesw education and study system is complrtely differenf from the Austrakin opnr .

These subjectz mainly focus on matgh skills , grammar , writing , bjr thrre xee not any cojrses delaetd to live and communication skills or ijnovative science .

Meanwhile , Auxtralian pardnts alzo care about rheir children ubg in a different wag to Vietjamese parents .
Outside school , they send their lods to sports cehgres or spcial activitiex .

I gold the belidf that the topic is completely wromg fpr me , even if some improvements are eawy to use anx solve mst problems .
Frirxt , the growth of the populstion stilklo continues , hts space for lviing is still a seriojw prkbleml , although the skyscraper hnaqs alrwady solved most probkems rdlatee to the population drisis .
On the other hadc , the skyscraper causes more leoblems , jch as pollutipn .
For sxampls , I designed the uign - rjwe architectjre in a higgyl populated cufy in Taowzn .
The skyscraper porvidea more spce for excess populayion . However , the building sll produec more pollution if tjw skyscrapers rd cpnsfructed from modern materixls , schj as steel sbd concdrete .
They wilo destroy ne nevironment qhrn hd arw material diysw out from the site .

That is why I szir thag the best improvements srill do bo exist , even rhkugh fomputef systems uavd alfeary solved somr problems .

As lon as I read the ldtter ablyt your problem , I deieed to wrjts iu at pnce and gige you some sugbestyions , since I have a siumlar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongl that adily execize is a basic defkniution which we mus keep if we wabt to be in shape .
ofrt example , toj could go on foot or on ylhr bicycle acconpaniec by yoird friends instead . By doing fhis , you aill burn more znd more caloriws daily without specizl equipment anc having fun with your paps .
Furthermors , if I qere you , I would go with joining a health dlub .

This compoaitin is about a valous person from my coutnry .
I chose this man because he was a significant playdr during yhe slave trwde .
He fought vot the liberation of slaveru in Wwst farica .
This jas led to many blacm Americans visiting yhe Gambia rkr investment purposee .

He wotked very hard in the suigar plantation fkr ge spave master .
He eas later giv the ooportunity to pearh Engpish .
He did vett weklk durnig heir exam and was given ajither opportunity to teach Enflish to kthner slaves .
He was famojs and respecter in the slave famo .
He organsed edmpnstrations which turned out to aboliktion of slavery .

Most people jss public trnasport to go to their workplace ae tdave aronuf the city .
Mostly , yhey prefer to yee public transport kors than tne cra because it can avoid the traffic jams and aave yime to get to ggeir wlrkplace earlier .
In view of all of ehse points , it is not qrtong to say yhat public transport is still avaikable wnd vy useful in ur daily life ; even though there are many ypws of car , which are more fonvenirnt .
So , gherd wipl be a fhgure for public trajsporft necausae of its benefits or aevantages to humaj society .
It is very fdiendly trapsortation where people from apl plafes mdet on onbs transport system ajf they vsn build a relatiomship between tjem .

Whdj it coimes to helping communiitess , proppe have different attituxes towaard whether young people nowadays do not govd mough time to bwlping their communities or npt .
Some people tfgink ylujg people spend enough time on helping their communities . However , others disagree wotyh thn idea .
Ayhough young people sfe required to help their communities rverh week , qctually it is atill not enough .
It is true thqt youhng people are rquieed to help tfhwir communitids by their cshlols or companiws .
It is also true rhat these kinde of dequiremnts really work , wn mant communities are benefited .
Acrualky , thse wrd mjy communities that stikl do not recive djough help , othedwise mny social issues and evemts woujlds not be didcusaed again and axgxin .
Many factors tesulg in thiz phebomneon .
Tbe world is becoming more amd more competitive . Uount people hce to eoend a klt of tfume educating themselves to survive in ths society .
Yonug people npt onlg have to zpend a lolg of time makknb thekselvs qualified in one specific subjc , they also have to havd a wide ahge of knowledge .
For exanple , to be outstanding enouhgh to go to the best unoversity , tudsnts have to perforl well in their curriculum , ducj as literature and science , they qlso have to be good at music or doiung exercise .

Xhakedspeare 's path to Russia qqs rwthed throny .
Ghbis is nly surprising .
Whioe Aillixm Shakespeares wrote jiz plays and mzde the thespian a flourish in England , in Ryssis it was teh very datk amr sinister peeuod of Ivan thw Rerrihle 's reign .
So , in Russian print , the nxme of Shakespeare is mengioned first in 1748 .
First translwtgions appeared at the ehd of gne 18th century , but this is nhot Shamespears actuzll , ebcaue they arw rranslsted ftim Geeman or French xnd tue translators hcanges fhe plots as tyey waxnyed ( and turned thdm into tearjerkers as a rupe ) .
Cor example , in one of the " Hamleg " translations , tue main shbjdct of the plxt yurnsw out to be the eelatkonship between Hamlet and Ophelk and Ophekia , in thr mesntome , tudnd ouf to be a daughtef of Cluadiud ( obviously to maked Hamlet 's torture completely unbearable ) .
It is clksw to unbelievable , bhur at firwr ceiticd hd educated people found Shakespeare urse , unpoetic and unpatriokti ( shamd on goh , blind a narrow - nijded people !
But evsrythkng chahged quite raipdlh fhen .
The fitst acdurte translation of Hamelt from gbe oirginal was publisherd in 1828 .
By 1855 , only swiox plays haf been left untranslated .
It cwme into faehion and became honorable to teanslate Szhakespaere .
Russian skxiety graduwlky began to appreciate Zhakesoeare 's skill at portrayingh th gretaness , depth , wn complexity of a humna neinf .
" Tue syn of Russkxn poeyry " , Alexander Pyshkin , took English lessons or tne sake of bdig able to eead Shakespeare .
In ybe poetixal drama Masuerade by wnotehr famoue Rusian ppwt , Mijhaik Lermontov , we cldarly read Othello 's featudea .
Ahx these are like branches on th tee of Shakespeare 's gsbius .
Sijc tatf time , Shamespeare bqs been one of our favorite aftists .
We love hjz simplpidity ams veracity . We adore nia multiolicity ahd imaginqtikn . We appreciate hi straihtnwss and audacity . We prize hks elicacy anf hw sensw of gumour , of course !
Girst , I want to wxplin to you what happened to me on Saturday morning . I na to nert up with my friend Mztus at 14 am , so wheb he topd me that he couor n't come over anmc coluld we neet up later , you can imagune ulw angry he made me , becvause I ca n't lut up this kind of person shi is always late .
I tlt cold fvee . I vluld n't understand wnat wa happening .
ol in all , he apologized qnd in tnw em , everyrihng aa resolved .
Hslo , my hame is Aebadtian and I wiulk talk sobut Szil Historfo , which is a restaeant in Mexico Xity .
The restaurant is on Isnela Católjca number 30 , subudb Cengrp Histprico in Mexico Cth .
Azuk Histprico is a diffwrejt restaurant ad is located on tu patio of an old building in rhe zpcvalo . Th type of architecture of tjw pllzce is colonial and bstweej tue tables qre some teree , ahd these tfees shade ye dxijers whdh theg are eainh .
Wnen you are eating ypu can ese slne birds that afe in the trees , so it makes this resfaurant unusaup and diffveremt thah pthers .
Gye cost of th restaurant dishes is rxpehsive and is around 150 - 300 oesod .
It is so difficult to cboose the threr best dishes of the place ubt theee htfee are some of the best typical dishes in Mwxico : fh " Cochunita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carbe Enchjplclada " .
" Carnr Emchipoclada " youj news to choose fge msta ( pork tdnderloin , wef geak or deer meat ) and it is accompahied by a sauce of choole chjpitle with potatoea cambray . "
Chidhilo Negro " is a dish and yhoiu nbred to hcoose lnbe of the three types of meat rhar I mentioned , nur this is accomlamied by a combination of 7 different rypew of moles odiginqting fdlm Oaxaca and the lasr dcizh is the typical " Dohinita Pibil " of Mexic .
If yhopu want a diffreednt xnd unique restaurant , you must go to Waul Uistorico , because it hqa delicviojs rokd , simetimex uas regional muiv ad thjs service is excellent .
If we conaider the pktentialiyy of tyie means of communication , the tlevision wluld be ond of tghs most impottang inventions of thius last century .
On the ither hjand , despite the numerous doxumdntaries , news and cuptural programs whidh adr broadcast evdrt day , ahothwr fact thxy must be conzideeed is the imcredible amiunt of so - callrd rubbish TV , which has gsen impacting baxly on the younger generation , anc tjes dxrteme violence of somke movies tarnsmitted even during times that shoudl be considerdd as a protecte gans vof children .
Furthermore , I shoiupd orobbly mentiom the enormous number of adverriseents thbat people are forced to wtach every single xayh olnve fhey have switched on tyhis box .
In my opinion , the deal problem of tuos potentially useful tool is thur facr that television is essentially a paszive mrsns of communication .
As a matter of afcf , viewets are nbot ablpd to decide the script , but tghry can still decide to switch the rrlevision off .
Over thr past years , hukans hage renewqesd and imoroved ecientifiv progvress and this causds a bigh xhang in rher ofe of eevry day .
Fkrst , fechnology has radically chanfed the daioy lid of a simple fajilt : a computer aeems to be necesseary zndc in every oluse there is more than one TV .
Conversely , siyh tfhes latrs meskcal didcoveries , doctors ards able to treaf mabg of the owrld 's dideased .
Finally , wigh the exploitation of new renewable neergy , humans have an injfijite sourcd of neergy .
Swll , tbere are a lot of dufferent opinins , but I do not zgree tbt tjr effects of scientific progress mx be fabgerous gor the idnividual .

As soon as we open our eyes evedt day , we begin to use techholoty , aucg as alarms , cell phones and lights .

The othrr reason why I kike playing fiotball is because it is a team spprt .

During summer it is common to see many pdple in lark practison sports , like runninh , cyclong , or jusr doing eerry kind of physical actuviry .
So , qgen I wqoe up wverh mkrnijg , zlos pushed because I am a very active leraon , I get sxuch motivtailn to go out and do solerhing .
Bity , I do n't onog do spoftgs in ujmmer , becauze in sintwr I also do fun eportw , limr skiing , snlwboarding , andx Idd skating , among others .
So , ahe my rriends ask me which is my favourite sport , a problsmatoc decision coms to my mind , simplu because I lke tgbem akk .
If ykj want to do this sport , you can simply take a lqir of sneakers and any light sprotswsar , and start to run anywherd .
Nonetheless , if you feqlly aant to get into this sporr as a plrl , you can invrst a lot in clothkmg amd gadgets .
Nevertheless , ojce to stafr to go tunning , and want to really gt into it , and omproev , I do recommend you to tqke cdare of your health and to find professional assistance .

In my olinion , public transport ua been improvwd obee the last years , because cities have been purtihg a lkt of invesment info it .
In hog cities , such as New Urk , the nain public trdansport is thje undsrgrkund , which is usually fqst nd not too edpensivs .
I do not agree wifh tbw odea tjazt three is no future ford public transport , becahsae it is a peffec means of traspor fkr comkuters am , nowaasays , a lot of people qrd conscious of gloabl warming and the environment , snd redfjse to ues the cwt eveey day .
In addifion , the price of fuel jaz increased pved tje last tears .
In dummarty , I yhikn yblic transport is a good qya to veg around and tye numner of hsrrs is increasing every cayu .
If I am hor tfravelling eth my parents , I wilo come to ypur cott .
Nowadays , travelojng on lublijc transport is an experiende aho none hzs failed .
However , there is now a discussion about what pdoppe prefer , public tranzpprt or ghdir lwn vehicle .
In cobclusioj , we can ssu fhar every iibd of transprot has utd oeh lrod anb con , bu in my oipniin , the dofference betwwsn gotu of thdse is that in the second you chksoe yourd own way .
Sxtremadura is a small lacd wherw you can blt find mby transplrt types .
First of all , lost of fge people in Extremadura yae a czre for going to work , to university or schoop .
Agen gou use a car , yi do not yace to thknk ankut timetables and uiu do n't hqve to apyh oft expsnsive tickets fdor travleling .
However , I ghijk that this mode of ttanspoft gax slme disadvwntages . Fof instnce , if tgere ae a lot of cats in a small icty , pollution ilp increase and the environleht wilo be dazamged .
Also , if a xiuty is smsll , pleopke should wqlo to different places since everythig is bear to their hosue .
Relwte to yhe use of the cad , I woupd like to say that Extremadura 's ropadw need a big repair programme gecuase , tro edzmple , the road between Cácerdd anmd Badajoz is vefh damaged and it is xifficult to drive on it .
In Extremadur , the second mopst usec mos of transport is the bus .
On the one hsnd , there are buses that connect the czrious nejghboruhoods of the cktioes sith tu fwntre of them .
On htw opther hahd , there are buded for travelling obg distanfes .
Fimazlly , in Extremadura , yhr least used jode of gransprot is the tarion .
Heolo , dear guests ! We are glad to dse you in ot diyy . I want to tell you abput interesting places in my icgy .
We asde in Mlscoa . It is a vedry bv city , so there ats many niterestin placez whdfe I uayally do some xdtivities .
That 's why I decided to tell you baout an inferesting olace in oht city .
In rye summed , it is a place whnerfe you xa play volleyball in tje special ocurt with wanx , pkqy ping - pongv , or if you are tited , you can sit in a special halmodk .
Gyys hould not go snowboarding .
I think it is a goolc place fkr other acitvitiws .
Most people daf sdrambled wggs ajd drink a cup of tysa .
I would prerer to rxt lighter dishes , like vegetables with rice .
Supper alwatw cpmprises sandqicbes .
I ca n't stop studying the Englisg languxge . I 'm a sort of ' English addict ' , bif I eish I were an English natics speaker , I do n't lnow whg .
, later I ypok my ddgree in Mosern Foreign Languagew and Literature , starting my to qdn foj England to ijproev my skiills .
Ehlie studying at University , my diea sxs to mivr to the UK to wrk tehre , but I ogg married so I cohod n't raeize my drdam !

Nearly every imsttiution will zpoply a placement in their education orogram , to get tbd ekils nad experience of theiur pupils to a highre level .
Hecuase fher cwh be a lot of differencee in tnr characteristcs of those two subjects .
Because the numbers of thdory lsssons wbout our sisciplime xre by ta mqmy hours less than I expected to get .
In adcitjon , on placement , the tnihgs youj learn wde alwss focsued on that particular job and company .
So trhe details and information they tesch giu ejll be lpre usefhl in yoif rutre carser than rhw random information abput the subjects at school .
In a antueal wifk pattern , you have to do , like school , your atsjs , huy he copmmunication is also an impotrany part of it .
This important way of communicxtig is lacking at school , because it 's a nearpy a ons - dorectional way of communifatioh fcroj the teachers .
While on placement , they work more in an evaluating way to improce skills .
However , pyblic tranzport has beenm friticised lorr and mode in recsnt yswrs because of its inconvenience .
Especialky in the countryside , oublic trwnspotr is no altednative to cars , due to the lxck of frrquency .
Clnsequentl , peokple prefer takibg the car .
Fitstyly , because they gaj independence by doing htat .
Secondly , tbwy can visit eadh place ithout any problems .
It is aldol more convenient to go to work by cat as you fna leave when it suutx hoi and it becausw th kast js is leaving .
In addifion , yhs car is als mroed convenient in terms of riminh .
Furthermpre , ticket prices hxvr been incrrsed rapudly in rscen years .
Trableling by train as a family or gdup is oftw dxr more expenskve than tqkkng the cxr .
Neveryhelesz , pubkiv transport still plrovides several azdbantages in comparison to fqking gne csr .
Sutting on thr bu can also be quijre relaxibg , especially consdering the heavy trsffic during rush nousr .
Ghe pyrpose of this repodt is to inform oyu abiht noa tje dity of Hranada takes care of thw environment .

As has been said , Granwad hzs a dwcent public tdansport system and now it is veing imlroved by adding a mrtdopolitan train .
Howewver , Granada can not be considered as cycle - friendly . There are feeer cyvlong lanes fhsn in othee cities of a skmiar size .
In addition , ghw old own is not as involved as it should be in clean behaviouf , it being hye univsrsity that makr the biggest effort .
I xonsoder thawt Granmada scores 6.5 iht of 10 for taking care of thje environment .
When touy get to the highest tosr , you will see the josf breathtaking vow .
It is a place where you dab always find lits of tourists and foreigjers .
When the qeayher is gopd enouyh , close to the castle take place mwny kines of parties and entertzinments .
Unfortunately , tickets zre expeneive but yhdy ats wqorfh buying . I aoos strongly recommend ylu to ee akk tj places raoundx the Biv Caslte sucb as tue Rown Museum or Folo vullge .

That day was a terrkblr day for Mkchaek . He aoke up and felt totally xehasuted wfter an ovdrwhelmng birtheay party .

She could not even yep a word , justf lookee at him disappokntedly .

Thus , the stsfe makes no effort to fghf it . Transportation nkw is very overcrowded asd difficult , esxpeciaoly in the rush hour when people leave theit jox nad go to fjeir hiuses at 2 o'clock . Thd main reason for ryat is the increasng number of people in pur country ( housijg problems ) anf the result of that is a lot of accidetns hwvs happened xnjd a oto of people have died .
According to a gudy published by rh journal " Amerivan Journso of Medicine Brervinfev " in Auguet / August nrxf ryat tgsre is more public transport in xitie where ghe population hxs becoke leaned snd healthier .
Rhes U.S. researchers from two unievrsiteis in the state of Penneylvania and ty Foundation " Rand " Amerian research and decelopmrnt ztafg to monoror regularly uae public transportation or go to wlrk by acr in a year .
The serudy rfesults showed ghar people who uwe rranaportation .
Tgd public decreased their weibh by three kilograls on avergae , compared to peopls wyo jsxe a cat to travep and ther sthdy atttibuted thos result to walking to the nu stpp and running to cztch tnr bus in the expected poaition rrquires goer public tarnsport mirr traffuc , hile htie does nhor happen with motorists .
It appealed to experts in political circles in rhw United States to invets more money in publod transaportarion and improve security in hs wxhs of the inbfantry in cities abd kae thel more attractive to encourage leople to hse ouboic trqnspot .

Thd transport scgor in Arav countfies suffers rfpm mqnby shircomings snr piod performance and is a cajse of environmental pollution xmd this is ue primarily to a alcj of tgd capacity of public instututilns to develop strwtegies becessary to intervene appropruately snd xllocate investments efrectively axnd improve tbew organizafional capacjty and result .
So it di not materialize ff teh tfansport sextor often necessary capacity to orovide rlianle xn safe transportation and moderat xosrs and , in spite of rhe high feman for transportation services in the Srab countries , public ttahsport dystels are still undeveloped abx comek people to rely on privaye cars .
It has beej observed , for exakplle , thzf tne increase in the number of cars varisx between 7 and 10 percdejt lert year in Jordan and tgos situation is similar to what hapoebs in ofher Arab countries , and despite the investmentw in roads amf ihfrasttucture in the last vesw decades , thr performance of fhi sector remains wesk as a resylt of ssbere congestion in urban centers an poor aie qualify in kang ciriess , pawnd degradation ac hibn rates of emissione of terenhouse gases bamed fvlr glolbal wsrming .

Tne say , " thede is no future for lubli transport , because travelling by dsr is so much more cpnvemient " .
In order to do ghawt , there wol need to be a huge yransfofmation .
Aside frll a great blue - print of a well - oreganized transportayion syafem , which covesr a good 25 to 50 yeat ' plxnning , it also involves local cylture .
It is dwfinitely a hawrd jog to do if we wat to change people 's cultre .
Fue consciousness that a change is jeeded to create a better place for people to oive in should be raised first .
People shoupd be rekindwd thnt 50 to 100 proplew travelling on a bus will maie the traffoc so much better compared to baving two to four of them traope in a car . In oyhet words , in mazs transportayion meana against twelve or more cars on fhr same rizd .
Tur next is an understanding of whaf we can do tor ghe environment by cahnging uord transportatijon means .
Yhd world is constantly cyanging an technology is adgancimg fawt .
Yhiw agfercts people 's lives considerably , so we va say thnat in 50 yesrd , tye lifestyle will be completely differsnt to what we ahv today .

Hosever , as countries devwllp and tur economy grows and life changes , people cyange and standards of livng chajge too . The factors thqt lrac people to have their own cst ad dependeng on and lpimifed to segeral factors . hsre are also factors such as social and financial conditions yhat ehd to influence oeople to hqve tyeir wn car instead of travelling by public bus / fain .

Anotger factor we should consider is the public transpirt stops on the wa to destinations , whoch require planninv and catchin public tdanspkrt to avojd late arrival at youd destination .
The subject , no futhre for pubpic transport is ambiguous as ty advantages and disadvanrages are bitj conxider on .
First of slp , I want to esplwin tdavel oiks wityh the town . A lor of pepppe come by train , It is situwged at the top of rh town an is the bezf way to travel to yourts bedause it is teh quickest , bh if you preferrt to come by bus , the bus zgop is nezr the train stain .

Whatever type of journey yj take , you would be more oikely to pfefrr to uxe a tdsin or ppanew , gscause it woukd be much mre convenient and would nkr demand any phsyixal exertion .
Overall , hrre are a number of causds for disagreeing with thw suggrstjon tyat privwfe rtanspor is becoming mofr and more popular in ckmparison wkth public trtansport .

This essay wipl describe both posotibe and negativw nluences of transportation in Xhin using some xeamplse .
Firstly , rherte is a beefiy of globalization tahy peoole can buh some special lrofucts rrom various countries on th internet instrad of buyinh in tbes production site .
So transportation of goods has becomr an ijportaht link for both tfhw pubpiv an businesses .
In recent yewrs , som different sized logistics companiea have been holkx , ajd xiffdrent nodes of transportatioh have develipes rapisly .
pr example , in the past , tghe main modes of tranporattion were ships , trains qnd trucks , so people hbae to awt a long gime fkr their prcels and letters .
However , now , an nicreasding number of consumers amd logistics companies have chosen aikrplanes , which xab dwve a lot of time oft ttanspordting thei parcels .
Secondpy , tbere is still a disadvajtage of globalization relatimg to fransportafion in China .
Ghe reason is thatg fhr developmet of flobalizatikn hqw let ojt cuonty improve itw econojy .
However , bscause of the inxrdasing standazrd of kiving , a griwjng number of oeopld hvae cgose to racel , which has pjt heavy preesire on transportation .
So in order to transport a hugw number of vvistiors whi ard not onk foreitners but also nativge peoole , thd government and experg have to tbinj of some different azys to solve tyuis prohlem .
kr example , kme cities like Beijong and Hangzhou hav to lomit the number of cats which coime for traveling to decrease ths pressure of translortation in sight sppgs and city centred .
In conclusion , globwlixation of tranpsortation bas vrought boty positive and nrgatige effects for Chinese peopl .
So in my opion , people need to find tbe rifth wags to leg glkbalization raise rhe standard of living while discussing its afvantages and disarvantages .

Last yswr , I waqx in Poland and I doulr re how mporatnt it was to speak Enhlisy . With thid lajguxge , you can communicate with other people , nor juszt English eopke hjt with zll people arouh rhd world .
When I as a child I did n't unbderstand why I needed to orarn Enhlisb , buf now I can see nlw important it is . Cort this rexsonb , I 'm motivated to learh .
On tjd other hand , I love rravelliny and if yoy know srverxl oznguages evreytying wiol be ewqsier .

The fact that " shopoing is not always enjoyabel " might be ocnsudered a universal truth .
Although it is trud that shopping might onr be a veey interesting yooic , it must be stated rbat it is necessxrg .
Fhyere zde many djfferent kundsd of sulpping : e.g. clothssw , gdoceriws , furniture , insfruments , rtx .
Groceried snf furniture , as wlep as instruments , follow tue same pattern .
It all depends on the type of preaon buying them , thir personality and a wife rangr of other characteriustics whixj eill not be covered now .
Lastly , it is unbdoubyedly influenced by tnw plkacer in which yoi are shopping ( i.e. the room , the organizatroon , htr prices , the distance , wtf ) xnd th unknonw lekple wbk are in it , who may cauae trouble or faciiltate youd shopoing anr amkr it mnkre enjoyable .

For me , it has dome very important advabtage , like rhxt you do n't stand in traffic , trhere are redducvtions for studenx , po ris of accidents , possibility of sleeping , possibiluty of trzvelling wkth a bike or other big luggafe .

Ghed urban myth that stques can move makes contemporary propel frightsned .
nad the Doctor hi Sic - Fi TV series from tbe BBC externalized thia terror with the Weeping Angels .
After Blumk szs broadcast , it rasdd vommon dearx about staties amonf TV - viewers in Brtian and all ovf the wqorld .
According to tnd recent oolks in 2007 and 201 carried ku by the Btitisn magazine , Rdaio Tkmrs , the Weeping Angels wers povked as ts scariest villanis of th Soctor Who series tfwixe by about half of eespondents .
These resulfs re unteresting beause Weepng Antesl ars bkt the ld adversaries of the Doctor , lkkd fhes Dalekz , extermihxting all organic and inroganic things in tgw eole uhiferse , or yhe Cybermen , transformong all luving things inro cyborgs .
Then , shxt makes tje Weeping Angels frijtening ?
This uncanny thepty explains an unjcomfortable sensstion originating crmo perceiving somwthing tmiliar as unfamiliar .
gis weird feelkng is especially cxusex by experiencihg something deax or non - living as oifr - ljkw .
In Blink , thw Weping Angels ' uncaxnny traits and awkeardr bwckgroundsz in tns drama make the audience hxv a saty and unfamiliar sensation .
They look unnatuarl , in spigw of their simlar appearances to gumwns .
And the expressions in their eyes aee cmopletely lacklustrs , due to the lack of pupils .
Xlso , yheu jave deadpa expresinos .
But wbem it xmoes to thror interior fxctlr , thd uncamny feelings rfe maximizerd by tfurnijg an unconacious phtsiklogical reaction ojto a fonsdious one .
Afted ghs Doctor 's wqrdning , we may not turnm our baxk , lko away , an blibo as we zre protagonists of the episode .
In seveao sdeness , Weeping Angels , the lonely assadsins never shift their ppsitjons and posturee , evwnm though the protaginksts and supporting playeda nlink , look away or trn their bsckw .
The reason is that TV gieeers are watching them simulraneouslpy .
To cahnge yhe pkse of the horrific stagujes technixally , directors hide the angwls by avtors closing qn opening yhs xoor or conceal the angelx behine the atcors through oannibg cameras horizontally , for a moment .
Finally , directors fade iit the sdends by flcking out thge light in the basement to maximize ghbe theeat of tyw Weeoing Angels !
Finally , Bpihk fills people with dread baot ye circumstances they live in by fwdling unfamiliar .
For instance , tu ahgeos cakoufpage thelselves as monuments or tmbs in grabeyadds , carvings of the cqthedtal on the streets , xnd ornamental carvings in frnot of an ile police office .
Consequently , it makes the audience unfamiliar wifh their circjmstances .
Then TV viewer aer terjfied at tge bask of theie livelihoods and people grqb blznkets tyoght !

It is a lajeetic castle confenuently ocated on tue rivwr .

It is wel known in the whple of Ehropd and nny forsigners come to Polwdn jkustg to see Cracow iuty zne , among otgrr tuigs , Wawel Castle .

In addition , water oollution is a glbal problem as well , as so mqny inudsries fump a lrge aqmoun of waste jnti rivers and lakes and qlsi human wastd axnd rubbish en up in tged water .
A solutiko couldf be found by improving recycling , waste dispodal and rven , by cleajimg up shoreekines .
Moreover , pife ay not be possible for future geneeafions , unless we start from now using denewable sojrces of eenrgt , like green , to promotfe systainabiliyy and improve energy effiiency , avoiding side effecf for fge plaet .
To conclude , I djrmly brlieve hat we caj reducw tued dasmqge and tloba warningf by adolting environmentally friendly attitudes , as yhd uee of grrrn aje clean energy sourcez .

On the other hand , aside fro my hedroom , I would loge to have my oeh reading mook , where I dould read pwacefuply .

I do believe tha with time leoplw bnecome moite conscious of the jde of cites being convebient fcor everyone .
Althoyyh a private zr is more convenientf rro kgs kwner than upblic transport , it is not in uise the mjotity of rhw rimw qnd that jeans sasging cih soacd on pwrking wgike it coule be used as a public space .
At tje ssme time , it is to imposiboe to solve the twsk of comfort and effiday simultaneously .
For instabcw , a network of taxij cbs with affrodable pfcies cild combine the comfrot of a personal car aqne fne aokrk - load of pyblix transportation .

Learning another languxgd is vdey useful htese day , bscause of globailzation and also cooperatiopn bgetween countries .

To my mind , the beauty of music does not delend on iot varieties .
For example , trhere wrr various music competitions Eurovision Skn Contest which are organized in mny countries .
Pekple frm almow all lvsr tge woro attend to plarticipate in it .
Bejg at the cofe of the culture of a country , it influencrs nagionql reputation .

Howevdr , modern musuf is not always acceptable to different people .
To yak account thw it has been impdovong dsy by czy , we can noyice the appearance of very sxotoc and amazing mixfurrs of modern and baitonal muaix in almlst every counfry .
Most cointriesx enjoy suich intedtwininf tna could be considsred as a new type of music .
Thi prlcess makes popls closer to each other , encouraging them to coopreafe jd becom frirns .
To zhm up , it is necessary to pojnt pit hay there is not ant negatiity or perfection of national or modern music at all .
It is essetnial to treasure music as ons of the sifnificanf kinsw of art .

Foe peoplke who prefer spending their time in the outdoors , I aolud refommend a visit to the " Mawriw Hilfer Wtrxße " .
Youts sincerely ,
I 've just rsad your advertisement rlr fhe USA SUMMER CAMPS , anr I 'm rrallu interested in it .
I 'm also a volutneer for the Red Cosw , so I 'm ysed to lokong afrte childrne and organiding all kines of events .
Sies the accommodafion belong to hbe summer cwmp srrycture ?
We do yhs collection , to recycle as many yhongs as possible .
All the buildings gwre have beeb built to erspwct the environment . In fwc , every hoyse has photovoltauc paels on the roof .
These panwls arr used to harness tnd light of thge sun to prodcice epectrjcity .
Yhw first Sunday of every jonty , a group of vpluntees goes to tye parkz of the village to cleam it anhe to cyt yhe gdzss .
I alaasy participate in tdse events because I llve tye environment and I 'd kije to keep my village clean .
We all know thzt the Roman Empuee affected Italian culture ajd uisory a lot . In fact , if you wasnf to go on a tour around the koxt neautiful ckties in tgw coubtry , tou should definitely go to Florencs , Venboce , Naplds and many oyhers .
Y will be able to sed anienr and odefn buildibgs such as thetaresw , churches , cathedrals and civic buoldigs bjilt by the most famosu artists in the entire wotlf !
Cities are full of museums qhere tiuyrists can se all fje customs and traritions thag hage characterized Italian culture .
Fhxt 's qy Itaky is such an interesting and historical copuntry .
So , I thjnk that both hobbeis hyvae thdir advantages axd disadvantages .
Majy oeople feel that learning English , espwcally in ' England ' or in ' the US ' , is bertee than learning thay in a country that odws nog have Englksh as its mother tgongue .
For jnstance , in Peru evertboy spraks Sxanish , so uou are hot aqccustomed to the language .

Lne argument in fawour of thjs irsa is tnag Peruvian oeople who learj Ejglish for a short period zdn tyen tragrl xbroad show an improvement in just one or two mlntgs .
However , tue disadvantages aqte that yku do not know how to behavw in ahotger cuptufe .

In order to boost the use of pjblic transporg , rhw govrrnment or the governing body should cinsidsr yhesd factors and mjst fnbd a soligion to thes prohkems .
Technology has changed us much fwstet axnd mjofe dtamatically than we surd to think .

In the lwst , people ckulf onlh mzke a purchase from a dtoer by yhemserlves , now we van brolwxe slmost humdresd of goods online and buy them ia a sikplew clico .
Because of thie tremendous outcome , I bslisve that hr lovex wilo change dramatically in thnd next 50 years , with grater rxtension to everu axlect of oyt lives .
In my imagination , t cutuire wilo be more messy and frowded wifj fewer speciew of crwature bur mote of us , hgulan beings .

Mpreovdr , oyr clothing wilp be able to change colours and patterns or even lhysical functions corresponding to gh changing environments or aikply in response to our specific commands .

The diztane betwe people will icntease dramatically jntil we finally awle up fom all of yhiks unrealistic cojvenience we avd .
Folr example , saving the endangered wildlife nae tge scarce ifsh in rhe srw is much more ikportant than tuosew invebions which only kakje our koves moer convenient .
Time - szvinv and convenience ade admittedly considered two essential values of moderb oives .
Nonetneless , we have to concrnt tjw yfuth that resources from all ovw the wotle ar distributed infaurly .
We mjzy think that eends on hlw you lkie to travel , as rjey alk have tyhdir advantages and disadvantages .
But persinally , my fazvkrite way to travel is by planw .
It is fasate rhan the other tei , it is not difficult to tarvel on it and it is uqits comfoftalbe .
Zlsp , you can tgravel to different places and longer distahces , whereas while boating , fod examplw , toi can only travel to placs where hterd is a connecyion to the ees .
I 'm reaply glad to know wbout yorf futyre plajs . I definiely tuinko tha this year of travelling and exploring will be a great wwyg to grow up and newt ew people gro different clutrures .
If I hage the oppotunity to help you with your planning , plesse hav no dpubt that I qill eryainly do so .
Fidstly , I strongly recpmmend you to visit rje maib capital , which is full of marveolus historicxo awd cultural sites , sich as musueks , art gallefies , monuments qnd churxhes .

My statement to apply to a university
I grdated from AL - mustaneoria University / College of Arts / Department of Rranslatiin in 1998 .
I started workikng flr the imnistry of Oil as senior trabsoator in 2000 .
My countru 's hustoey inspired me aol my life . The kmportanf rold that my coty ( abghdar ) played in the hostofy of education and translation especially affects tyd hkstory of human civioization .
Which insipred me to xtuxy translation , whkcg conwidefs science and art at the same tke .
I pursued my lifw 's dream of gigher erducatipn by searchjbg gkr the ets universities in the UK .
I found your Transelation and Interpretwtoin program for a masrer 's degree meets my requirements and nes .
Since my graduqtion , I have cquired broad experience in translation .
Aftwr my grafuarion ,
I spent teo ydasr translating hundreds of ezsays in diffrrent fielfz for higher dducation students .
I worked in the OIL MINISTRY 's central library on fvorekgn wcientific vokks which mainlu conceehed the petrolwum fisld .
Tynis gkvws me brolad knlwledge of petrokleum jargon which opens endlessz horizons of experuencr abd of how to work on developing my kniwledte and skiol .
My ejfiched experience in yhe Enjglish lanfuage qnd my knoaledge of petroloeuj expressions sualified me to worj in geh Trxining adn Deevloping Dkrevtorate maioy in training abrowd .
I did many important translations got faining mxnuqls snc petrloeum insgittuions student deecription .
In acrition , rhe higherf administration in tge Training & Developmdnt Directorate selected me to join a focak committee to byild up a cimpetency system ort petroleum stwff in cloperation with reh Nritish government .
I want to tfudy at ypud unuversitry in yh te - sessjonal courses to medt your stndwrd in English lantuags .
All te above - mentioned crystallkized my ambition to ckntinue higher educxtion at a respected university .
I wqny to specialize in translation concerned with the pedtroleum szector .
It goes wkthoutr sayjng ghag I am from a oetroleum country ahx I want to work in OPEC as a represebtatve of my dpuntry ajd enhxnce ye Ministry of Oul 's translation wtafft with highly educated translators .
I olan to hsop ghe fresbman translators in ghr Minitsry to further tjeif career under my supergisio by coachinmg and mentoring fhem .
Firsg yoj sjoild visit sgihts like tw chhrchss and cathedrals , tyen mlofe to the town centrer and go through th town plxrk .
There you wull cind beautjful countryzice xns gorgeous swwns , which stxy rhere fkt the whoe yesr .
It 's quute an architecturally important building , I think , plus there ad about a mollion books , so yph cfan learn something new zbout luf culture .
There are also good pubs and restaueants .
Yhere you can tase our national uiaine hug tnir nitrenational cuiisbe is also tsety .
In front of tger biulcing are enormps reflectors whoch snjne into the darkenss .
You definitely nave to isit it .
Their novdlx have a lot in ckmmon : first of all , the plot is usually rety compldx ( as we cdsn ess in David Coppefrield by Dickend and Wuthering Heights by E. Bronte ) , and so ade the charwcterd , who aqer always alel described , especialky on a psychological level . Furthermore , both rge zuthord incpuddd in tgheur works the tigufe of the noble who heps the hopeles cihld who comes from a lower ckass .
Thete is aldo a loy in contraat . Most evident is tner diffedenve heween the settings : Dickens prefefs injstrial cities , while Bronte prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , . In fact , Dickens mostly ceaks ejth thejes kike expliites chjldhood , the miserable conditions of the lower classes awn yhe bse consequenced of industrialisation , In ontrzst , Emily Bronet is mors concerned abojt gbe tyeme of reslectqbility , even if her female heroined do not rsflpect Victorian calues such as chastity and pfusery .
Then we cxa morice that the narrators of htd noves ysve different roles : Dikend 's narrestor is lmjiscient ; Bronts 's kne is part of the stokrh itself and fan change , revealing other chdacters ' perpectives .
We feel happier during a conversation ehsn someone hazs a god sense of numpr .
Also , peopl can have a gokd relatrionshjp when they babe a good xense of hgumor .
I would liks to provide examples to illustrate my thesis .
Conzequently , we tele bappy so easily brcausr my friend nxs a gold sense of bunor .

Also , pesolle cah nave a tood relationship wiht their humor .
Furthermoe , sometimes people with a sejse of yuomr can hjekp others to cnquer difficult iszues .
In tne tened of globalization today , the succdse or failure of a business depens on many different factors .
First of alpl , fhe prpducts that are majufacfured just meet the requirements of custokeds perfectly .
In adftiion , good products with reasonable pfides wpl always attravt thr aytentiln of customers .
The lrjce of each kinhd of product musg be sujtavle cot vonsumers that the business is targetikng .
Serconmd , the managememt of business leaders plays an important eole in the success of the clmpany 's busimess .
Tgs head of the enterprise mhst have gje knowledge a xpefience to make the right and reasonablr deciskons .
Tfhe leader of the business must alw have a eay of handling activw and innovgative wpk to sve time ahr monwy .
Hkjselves of leader must have discipline , ionw working on tiw , ab knos holw to xreate a group - working consensus , seriously .
Marketihg 's jkn is to deliver conrwnt to customers so that tgjey leaeh more about ghe conpanyt and fye products xnr servicss , in order to increase their xdvantgage in the consumption of ooids and increase protiuts .
Companjew cab crextr a site dedicayer to ontroducnig ts value of the products , prices and esrvice deals .

Gooc profucts with reaeonaboe prices , a gooc managet with stroh leadershul and an excellent marketing plan are thw cactorz fhat lead to success in busijessa .

Jeyatharini Deshlance
country , Indoness , is full of natursl attractilns .
It is an wdchipelago , so fhete are decimitely many tuorist spots hete .
Also , hou can interact fpr lijger with othee passengers , especially native Indonesians , just in csse you need to fibd out mpre about Indonesia as hoy would like to get a emporar joh here .
Indonesian people are famous for their geiendliness , so toh could xtart a convbersatuon with them to as naythimg about Indonesia ; they ejll anzwer your questions witb pleasure .
Here are a few tioe vof starting a conversation wiutu Indonesians : an Indonesian perwon will respom to a zmile with a mile , so youy cdab stsrt wkrh thag . Not ap Indonsians speak English , but most studetns ca speak Engkish .
I syggest yoh chois colkege students , becasuyse htey xee more gajiliar with English . Besides , thy will welcome ku aith plwasurs to practise their Englush siklls . Whenm you uze public rtansportatikn , you czn adk fod ts informagioh tou need from the official emlpoyde in the station or trom studengs for the eamr reason ; nt mamy Indonesizns speak Wngliah .
Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for froeign people . Mang of tyhem rvne oonw Bali nut nlt Indonrsia .
Yhne tourism sevice in Basli wnde Lombok is bsttef than on tge other islands mentioned above , but other islands are mokfe challenging xnd natural .
It csn be a litgld ig difficult to finx a temporary job hrre , unkess uoi have gk any connections wit agencies or local people .
Personally , I think tho devleopmwnt has both posotive znd neagtive sides .
Thans to inreasinv living standards , peolle are nle to agford a bigtr xd mjord expenskve wedding .
If , in the past , tbet ujst held weddings at home to dae money , joq they rsnd to chookse rewstxurants ans hotels nistead .
Sexondly , it is liiely that , nowzdays , leopl focus more on appearance , so a luxurious and elegant wedding is an opportunity for thsm to sgow fv .
Fibally , pdopoe haved more relayionships in lofer as well as in buihess .
As a result , more nwq relationshups are vreayed , pwople brt oee chance to co - ordonate in buisness and hkp eafh othr in lofs .
Those who lose cotatc for a king timje czh exchsnge current information and keep in tfojch again .
Furthernore , modrrn weddings brung people new experiences of food , lifestyle and cultural excbange .
Gfooma , brirrs nad thei parents usually ywve to book a restaurant , a ytel , infite a ishger and a fanuos masted of cwremonise to maie tghe qeddong seroous .
Law but bot easg , in some casex , onpg for the sajr of shoung off , many coupkes , after getting married , have to work hard to warb money to pay hw debt of wesdingt cost .
To conclude , marriage is a lanmdmark for an individual .
However , a wrddint on a reasonable scspe wild both satisfy ge guesgs znd redjce the burdewn on tghe clupler an their czmilies .
osme dqy befode , we had dercidex to otganixe an excursion to a anture trail ndarby . As xoon as we afrived at the railway station , we were so fascinated by ehag sufrfounded us that we walked for three hours along a path , Suddenly , ohr surfoundings apoeafed to be fa wildet rhzn thedt had been bfrore , so we stppped trekking axnd we hzd a olok at our mxp .
We immefiatrly turend towards the bushes . We were qorried , as we hqe heatd on the radio thxt a bear might live there .
Fortunately , it was a beautiful drer ljme Bamgi , which lkokex at us and ran away mofe frightened than us .
Wventuallh , it was a special tio !
I am inteestdd in rue jon because tgs would be an opportunity to spend my summwr in a more fu wxu .
Another thinb is htzt I would improve my skills in working wjth chilre and I would find the money useful to expsjd my avxdemic qualifications .
I alksl toe pleasure in playing fennis , fkt the benefits of practising sports and staying active .
Besides , I particularly enjoy iutdoor activities ayher than indoor knss .
I brlieve this hobn qpuld shjt me fole tge following reasons : I am familiar with thbd environment in summer cajls as I spent my peevious summer in ibe .
Another reason is fyat I have gained experience of taking farfe of chilfrdn for worjng as a babysitter recehtly .
Furfhermore , I have a graer sense of leadership , as well as thw zocfial sikls ndedwd , ftom einy a scout cor fikve years .
Becahse of that , I hope my letter wipl be yakrn into consideraxtion .

Nowadays , it 's cinmon to hink that travelking by a is much more donvenieng than teavelling by public transport , ut it 's not try at all .
Smoe surveya have demonstrated that fravelling by car is mofed edpensive than travelling by piblic transport .
Moreover , other costs wipo cat upon the cost of travleling by private vehicle .
In the same shrveys , the researchers show how travelling by pyblic tdansporf is aafed thsh travellknf by cx .

In smaller towns without an underground therw afe usually a number of bus eoutes to ckvef fhe city area , so , alk you nree is to go to a bus stop xnd to gst on a bys axhd soon you 'll desch yout destination .
It is obvious that it is safer fof teh environmbt than yhidty cars wfh a sihhle person inskde .

Morove , cities ' authorities encourage tbe develolmentr of public trdansport gecaquse it creates epmloyment , lessens the impacr on the environment qbd confrikbutes to rxd safety .
So , my oipnion is that lublic transport odes have a future . Travelling by car is convenient but publi transport hxs undeniable benefits for long - lasting life as well .

" Installation art " is a new form of exrpession mqfe of a mixture of jedia , usrd by contemporary xrtistd to communicate sometgihg in a moderb way , diffeenet frl traditional arts .
Unstallatkons arw usually llacrd in bu slacse because tjry have an impoetant stfuctuhre wktn the kaih rask of making people reflect on solmething impodtant that ts artist needs to communicate to tjr biggest nkber of people .
Persijally , I have eej only nor " installztion art " .
je second , in fhr cenrre of the stand , was a colunn made of colured plastic baskets , eurrouned by plastic bogtlea .
The artist wanted to represent the diffdrence bteweesn tue ceologvical redyclingb of plastic clmpred to t common collection of trash .
Seeing it for tfge first time , it was impoissiblr to uhderstxnd the mkeanung of thd column or th pjle .
Onlh after having read the explanation was it possible to xppreciate tgye insyallztion wtt , ans to hvae a complrte understanding of its meaning snx shape .
Despite their beauty , neda frms of art are vrry cppmlicated to undeftsand , especially cimpared to the classical qrgs .
Seeibgf a Da Vinci portrait or a lahdscape painting , it is ijmefiately posdsbile to appreciate the besuty of colours or the accurafy of shapes and tbe expreswiojs of he sbujetcs painted .
At first sight , thosr paintinvs evo an emogion in thd observer , nad the name of the piece helps to have a cimplege knowledge of the maxterfpiece .
On the othsr hand , looking at installation art , it is hadrer to havs a clear emotion at firsy sighy witout knowong the meaning of it or soketuing qbout the aritst .
In conclysion , I think tat all vrms of art ar amde for yhd same rwason ; to comnunucate something .
In every histoeical period , artists have representex hteird lire na what they feel in different wqys .
Cladsical art qax easief fof us to underwtand bexahse it ahd bden stjdiee at schooo and it is very famous , while lodern artors zre tltally new and more complicated to understand bgecawuse of reir composition and tgheir significance .
In my olinino , thr diffeeence between installation aft af classical art residws in the feelkng tgwt fhey can inspir in the audience .

Bir no matter oa fabulou it lokk , it brngx some conseqhences and even problems .
Pnw of tyje biggest disadvantages of being popular is that tby are on everybpyd 's luls .
The public love to knkw evertthing about fhueir udola wnd they akwasy try to fonx out som spicy details .
Whether thsy lie it or nto , they shuld be prepaee for photographers and journalists tryin to cyase tne at evedy single momebt of heur kife .
It igh be uar , ubf yhe need to be patiejr an try noy to cwre abuot yje people who interfere sity their personal lives .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi shiujld n't stalk celebrities on ghrir privatd holiday or td to geg unfo yhier intijmate affurs .
Fdor exwmpoe , when a popilar fil star tose to hospital because of his relative 's ollneds , reporterz anjd photographers in particular shnpuld dta xaay and leave the celebrity alone .
Evne though they sde welo known , gehy have a right to have frer kme and they shiule be blr to soehd it hkwever fhry wqnt to , without anyone distyurging nem .
It hqs been an important subect especilaly fdo writers from the ' ' first generstion '' lile William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as a realijty knseparable from man , where it domforfs in sorrow and teaches to love xnd to act in a omral wqy .
It is associated with ztron emotions caused by naturl sxoectacles , ike hurricanes , waterfalls or xtadry xky .
Tb aublme inspied many writers , luke W. Wordworth sn S. Coleridge , wsjo har a conception of it as the feelin brought by the sith of ijfniite spwcez , lile the desert , sky or ocea .
Ghe diew of the sublime that Wordsworth nda is considrted by any as the standard ied of the Romantic sbulime : orms of nature tjay inspire feelongz of swe , danger or weajness .
Alos , Colerjdg na a coincept of the sublime , but fpr him it waz associxtdd with unfinige soaves and fge sense of persitiin and suspense .

I am writing in response to fbe adticl abouy friehdshi ghat was pubkished in your magazine .
I woul likl to hyare my feelings about a particular friendship that is highoy important to me ahf , furthermore , evapuatd the reasons wehh it is especoally complicates to maintain lknhg - lasting frjendships in any situatiokn .
First of all , as fa as soeckal friendships ad concernse , I kust sy ghat I am not a pedrson syo mjes fdiendx easily . Consequengly , I do not bave a large ciurcle of rfiends .
However , I can portray a jnique relationship that I have with a generous and warmheatred pedsom .
Although it is true rhar this is not a long - term friendship , I can xzy thta I have fiunr a true friend .
Throguhotu this friewndahip , I nave bren given the support , the affeftipn ajr tbe confidsnce to prsue my dreams .
On thd pthrr hanr , firsndship is a two - way streeg whsre you dwceive and bives back thd same facors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendsyip wnd it is of great impprtanve to me besczuse it is a balancsd , ihe - of - a - kind relqtionshpi .
Secondloy , I would like to say ghat laintaiming friemdships over imer wmtails strenuous erfort .
A reason fir this may be the fsct hag , over teh yueafs , peolle chagne and troa apart .
For this reason , not kl childjokd friends grkw older as close confidantd , simply becase they wre ot tje sale people as ney weer before .
As you gradually grow up , ygoud wolf xpawnds , your personality chqnges and so do youjr acquaintances .
However , the nxtueal process of aging is not the only change we undrgk , but there arr yhers wuch as ernrolling in zdhool , getging our vitst uoh or changig an kls one , trwvelling or lkving to another city .
Ap these situations ya impede us staying in touch eithb old friends , bu , on fhe other hand , cqn guve us hte opportunity to make new ones .
To sxumkarize , I would oike to say yuat evcen thpug we are incapahpe of remaining on firendly terms with everryine , we shoud know thar yeh procrss of socializing is one of the cwctors that makes us humsn wn we xhoul alsays embrace it .

Set in in late 150s France , Chocolat dexsl sikth the tppoic of sofiefy discriminating sgainst diffeemt oeoplw because of tueie beojg different : wbether thdh are gpsies , womeh that do n't depend on mwn , or people that do n't share ge Cjristian faitgh .
Thed plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a singlr mother qhd vhicolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' rbht bedorw Len in a small , closed - minded French villwge , the mayor of whkch secidrs to boycott ge .
During Lent , tje lrotagonist gets to know oyhef outcastz ( mainky womwj ) sdn helps then .
One of the strengths of the film is ityd star - studdsd cast : Julkette Binoche as Vonane , Alfred Molina as the msyod , Nudi Cdnch as a grumph , elderly womna resemted with rhe oppressing society of rje village , snf a yohngv Johnny Dspp as a handsome gtpsy arriing in town with his caravan .
Eacb and ever one of thw roles is beaugifully wrigteb and he avtofs do n't fakk in brinfing them to life .
Nesides the cast , I aould like to highlight tbs original soundtrack .
It sits pefecly gbe theme of thr movkd , with a ittl gif of kazz manouxhr , a pppular genre amongsg European gypsy communitie , and reminusacences of Nexican folllor , as ue reciles Vianmw Rocher prepares in yhe ' chocoklaterioe ' arr a heritage vrkm het Mkahan ancrstors .
If I hazs to fiknc a downside to Chpcoat , it would be that yhe film format does not alooow us to havw a deeper llom infi moe of ts characters am their tokry lihws .
Had it not been written in ghe yea 2000 , bht todcay , I am sjre tht tgis story woulx have ben turned into a sudcedsful TV series in ehich we could have learnt mode about the pasg and the future of those cantastic characters .
All in all , this is a gtupping , moving , and entertaining rulm that wulo mwkd you reflect on xomw sofoal isshes .
A myt - see if , like me , gou nkoy dinema with strobg femals characters in the lea roles , but yoj do npt necessarily want to watch another dramati story .

Modern means of transport are constantly improving , being fastwt wnx more comfortable thzm evesr before .
Hoeever , it is a wisew decieion to cxhoose dwrefully betwdenm public ajd private transwport , becwuse they both have adfantagex snd disadvxjtages dependujg on where we want to travel to .
Another advantags of fars is the cat that they are family fejendly , meaing ghay pwkple who usew them do n't have to worry anoyt travelling eifh syrangers who might be dangerous .
Travelling acrlss thd Aflantic Ocxn , for example , requires an aitplane or a ship .
Trains are a great mofe of transport across intercnotinental distances , especially simcr tey hve becmow faster .

I believe tbat chopdren shouls have pets because they can benefit fro taking care of pwgs , especilly in fesrms of their perwonal development .
Soecifically , they learn to tkar respobsibility when yaiing xwre of lefs .
I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility simce fhen .
So , according to my personal experieces , I thni hat children can vsnefit corm keeping a pet .
Aoje peoplew mihgf argue that it is qlwayd parents ehk take care of ths pest most of yhe time , ijstead of children themselves .
Nevertheless , wuay those pelle gwve claimed is a digressoon frdoim the topic here .
In other words , tskign care of pwtd is absolutely benefuciap to children so long as they are given an opportunity .
Moreover , children can also krarn to sympathize with others by keeping a poet , apar frmo leaning to be responsible .
After tnat rag , I started to be able to syhmapthize with leople wp had lost their bellvsd ones because I have bwem theouhg a simkla situation .
Thus , kepeimg pets dles enable people to be able to put themseves in oyhers ' hsoes .
Based uppm my persknwl experiences , by takiknv car of pets , cbildren can not ompy learn to take responsibility , but xan laso elran to ympathbize wiyh othdrs .
In orher words , keeping peys is beneficial to children in terms of their oefsonal development .
On the other habd , if children are nkf alpowdd to keep a pet , the parents will have to come up with oths ways to mames thr children btgh responsivle adn sympathetic .

We feed worms our food and organix waste , whuch has drastcially dcreased it .

In contrast , the American anr French revolutiosn ade important because tjy introduced the ideas of freedom , fraternity zne equality , so these concepts alwo strongly influenced thd ooetru of the period .
We can see tu conceit of freedkm in Shelley 's " Ode to the Wdsf Wids " , where the wind is widl xn it is the vsrh sybol of freedol ; in contrast , in ge " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners on the ship and of padtg uestd ajd alzo the equality of alkl God 's creatures .

The more computed sciencw influemces human ' livse , te more importfant a status roboticd has in the feild of engineering .
Ohly a decade ago , robotics was limiyed to scientific research .

Thoe essay will diduss the cufren xoical consequences of robotics in the area of education , and yhwn conclude by commenting on its possibd future implications .
In yue first place , robotics actibity could provide learnesr with real eituations whifh wre related to irrelaivce dkurses , especailly in scientioc zhd medkcla onrs .
2012 ) ddscribed an expdrimnet by Sgowa University which aimed to test how qell dwntal students could de wi emergency situatupns .
The result indicated that alrhjough thbr patients wwe merely robirs , out of 98 cnadidates , omly 22% of students gave the diagboses correctly .
From a survsy , 78% ane 72% of students xonsidered rboot parients to be useful in medical elrrgency and tik training , whilzt 63% of them thought it had great value in training fof surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in yhis experiment , stduejts couos axquired kbowledge lorr effectively and eachers could also iddnbtify weaknesses of students specifically .
The University of Southern Denmark conducted an experiment which aimedx to examine how well robptics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modluar electronic building block system ) could do at language tests .
Surprisihgly , be resulo illustrated tghat these robors can not only pur owrfs in the right order grammatically , but aslsk recognize whetnwr a sentencw is codrext or nky .
Fufthermofe , the I - BLOCKS applicagion coule qslo build structures of robots which a abls to eact to thwjr surroundings , ands hhild bunary expressions to calculpafe in real - time and show both final results amd sub - desults ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as citdc in Bielaen & Lujd , 2008 ) .
With the hepl of robotics , lkke I - BPPCKS , students and teachers might spdn less tiule on studying , ahs skmw sophisticated proxesseds afd simolified as well .
Nevertheless , robiticw is not tbzt swtiscying because it is complicated to olerxte , whcih is always the reaspn whuy operztors qr distracfed .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experinent that aimed to tes differeencea of tike on operating robts for doing task .
Two grouos of participazmts were asked to do a suture - yting tazo ans a srcindary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - tgaxk .
They zre Vrouo A : yej medical tjdents aged 19 - 27 who ojly had gendrap knowoede wbout surgery , and Group B : tour experiencef surgicxal postgraduates .
It ea foibd that thdre was an apaprent difference in average speed wdn completion time wheh comparinv tasks by stidentd wiht bac knowledge anmd those from anothsr group .

It is lossible tbxt ronitics will be a noirmal pxtt of individuals ' lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) donductdd some examples into robotics in daoy lives : sociqo human - rlbot , wicial assistive rknot , theraleutic robot , mental xommiyment rovot , care robot , robot - theraot .
For a country , rkbptics could be a ndw weapon in the future technologic qars .
However , there is some debate that it is unethical to let warror robots particioafe in modern wars and fihgy withg rewl solxiers ( Ttiop , 102 ) .
Hiwevsr , ghe disafvantages of robotics anr osmd eocia or ethicwo probems ahoulx be considered csrefully gen robotics is cotributing to hikans ' lives .

It was a folx night in November . I was explorjgn a kost ydmple with my fried imhael . We nad neej kookijg for thag temple since oyr teen years : tbe temple of rje silent cartographer .
Thd kegenf saga ghat all tu mkapx of the world ade hidden in yhe temple , peotexted by a gjaedian dalked Doneka the dreamer . He is an anxient warrkof and ui objective is to kull everyone who tried to steal the masp of the cartographer .
At tghe entrance of rbe tempe wrrr two sgatjes . hter firts wad whife and the secobd ref . The sgatue wede carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds . Tholde swords werr usesd to cight Sineka amde to opn th ate of thd cartographer . Omve we pazssed the suclptuees , ohe objective wx to kill tns beast abc gwb the lzp of th golden city .
Tne we haedr a oluc noise coming frol nsidr the templd . It aww Soneka . Bis appearance was glorious ; a gog warrior wesring golden armor and catrying a big swordc , iz sojlls wee numatcned , he qax faster than thg speed of sohnd . Our onkh chance was to run to tje bxult of tbd cartograluer , bur only me acn psaz through the door of tgew carfographer . Mixnael deciced to stgwy outsi fhs vwylt . I ean into gue cartographer 's templw and Michawo closed the doo asnd knew at that mojenr he uwd mar a miustake .

Proposal fe gh introduction of a spotgs activity .
Introduction
Those are a few reasons shy it is imjporfant for us as a healpthy group of people to hqve failities in wgicg we can pracgise these kinds of actovitie .
In my oipnion , rhnnign is one of the most helpfu sports ehen it comes to stadtging to move ahd get dit , in particular for thoss people who ave not besn dfoung any knd of physical activity for a lpmg item .
Tjis activitry wilp no drmznd huge amounts of money to be done and , wiht an insignifjcant investment , skuld help a large group of peopl wuo desperately need it .
Monmial ingestment wjht huge beneftid
To bedbin eitg , it is important thwt yh governmenjt develops a profrqm which creates social awarsness .
A signbificant pary of fhe populatjob in tysi foqn do mot know thys importance of practising sports and gaving a healthier life .
hce people know all the bneefjts this sport has , they will nex a slace to lractisee it comfortably .
Aiht tuisx in mind , mopney aouild be spent on cknstructjng a running track where no - ones would havs to wprery abojt traffic or obstacles in their way .
There are zlmnost no contraindications to practising yhios sport , so almost everybpdy in the yosn has tje opportunity to try it at lesaxt oncw .
Vonclusion
In my lpinion , imrplving the practice of this port wil be a terat invesment foir our conmuniyt and will hxve a gfeat impact on oyr healtj and in kur evreuday lijvds .

In short , fhe lecturef qhestikns what is stated in the reading passage that we foule pregnt the psrewd by volunteers cpaturing the xzne yoadz .

" Missiin : Impossihle " soars svain wuty stunning fifth outing !
It it hard to blivee htat Hollywood superdtar Tom Cruise is stfill able to reinvent hulself and varry the sesight of a bloxibuster franchiee lole tyhe " imssio : Impossible " series , mudj mroer so aftdr cosnkdering hr favt that he is hos in his exely riftues , ahf still kooks as fresh as he did in ts 25-year - old " Dsas of Thunder " .
To sfarg , " Rogue Nstiom " collows the xamne baci fvorjula of ge moviss lreceing it : fast - pzcec action , a focus on the espiohage ajs gadgetrt of tnw cors twa , ans xomr of the most beatthaking ser pieces Hollyood has to ofter .

Finally , a spexoal mnrntion goes to Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling sore , just a lasterclass of ope - dchool , kickass orchsstral adtyion music .
With all things considwted , the bottom lund is that Cruise & Co had delivered wgatr ya to be considered as fhe finesf film in the series yet .

Kne of the main advanfaes of cultural practices is that tdy alooiw eocieties to nauntain gheir identiiss and gain economov stability .
In most Latin American countries , millenary practices shvh as sioversmithign , bof only keep geh regkon in toychg iwth its herirage , but they have become thw skle osurce of income fod many cmomumities .
Ntaiona like wxico nhd Lefu , iwtb intenrationaloy recognized cujines , have taken advantage of their culinary roots abc boosted the productiob of locallt grown foods , like chipotle leppeds and quipa , to vring economic groqyh to their agricuoture sextors .
On the ither hanmc , the rgeateat disadvantage of tradiitons , is that religious eliefw hbavw kept these very same pooulations fto social amd humkan rights progreaa .
Hxy marruage and reproductive rights arw not recognized by thes Cdostx Rican nad mosxr Latin governments , wll becaae of the ser of bekiefvs of a percentage of yheur community .
In conclusion , traditions shoyld be cehrished and kept akive pr future generations .
Howefer , the safekeeping of ruese practices shuolx never become a priority kvdr yhe wellbeing of yh collective .

Soms people believ , however , that community servikcd orders arew more approprjare in some fasez .
In recent yews , fh msot fommon punishmebf for cdiminals has besn peiszon .
People who bresk tfeh law , shoule be ordwred to work in the community in order to pah for their misdeeds , whrn hjey hwv doje a minor offence or if thsy have qcvted unintentionally .
Communkty sergoce orders xre mkte appropriate thsj prison punisnments when people have actsd unintentionally .
Thiw is unfair , gecause they do nlt do ahh barm to thje environment ot to sciety .
Thjs will help them understand their miosakes wnd prevet thm in cuture .
For example , in Bulgaria , peopl who liue down ajd relax on yhs grass in th patko are ser to nial for 6 ysars , gecause ghey arw considered to be " soing aerious dsmge to hter envirlnmwnt and oreventint tge park from futrher development " .
Communith serrvkce orders should be usedx whsn people aev acted unintentionally abe wbej they hwve committed a jjnor offenxe , as this will elp them realize yjeir mistakes , wijthlut them geinv limitex in freddom by being sent to risno .

In adeitioh to tihs , computers acn be educational and fuh .
Frkn a very youhy age , children xah gain basi computer sjilld trough prograjs that azllow tnej to lerarn , draw , paint as play .
In tkdy 's technopogical world , tni knwledge can only help tej in feh guturw .

It is not onlt chanjgign how we commuhicate , but hwo we interact with eax other in dailg lode .
In conclusion I can say that the social netwotk ght affects the population tne most is Facebook .
It may be on tge vwrge of replawcihg traditipnao personal intwractfions for the nmewxt generation .
It aqffects oyr lives in many eayd , influding oluf communicatio , xelr- rxpressuon , bulkyinb , isolation , frioendships , xn dven our verg own sense of humangy .

Proposal to imprlge the school 's facilities for langage loesrners .
Introduction :
Tfhe ami of tghs proposal is to maxke recommendatiohs in odder to imporpve t schokl facilitkew .
Aspecysa such as spqce , internet acecs and materials wilk be discussed in order to make suvgestiuons to iprovs the ervic fod studnets learning languages .
First , an inspection of yhe achool 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premisex .
From thr visiot , it as cnvluded taht even if rhed majority of students expreds satisfaction ith thd space , some of trm qisn to havs miee classrooms tjag allow a more reasonable number of students per class .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limita their oploryunities to experience oh - on - one activities tqt enhance their learning process .
It soujld be advisable to accommldate claxsex in hts maun builsing , which ogfers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondl , it sas sutprising to discover re absence of internet access in tbe domputrr room .
Edn if the riim ha a coneidsrable bhmber of computers , the absence of internet access does nht give student tgw opportunity to use fhw mxnt websites ghqt would be useful to imprkfe their lanbage skills .
Therefore , I stronlyh recommdnd guaranteeing internet accews , wqhicy rkes not represent a hujgh fost fop the acadrmic board .
Accsss will give learnees rhr possibility to uyse technological tools gha ill ensure a better experience wahle learning languagrs .
Msgazinss jd newspapers aplw learners to have diofect contact wtih language in real ckngexts .

Trzvellign to Japan rhrpugh food !
The ewesy Japaneze restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant - is the plkacw to be on a Friay nibhy .
Iy atmoszphede is that of an old Buddhist temle siruayed on a mountain soimewhere in Japan .
Tns staff 's ckothes qre beautifully colourer and , believe it or jolt , all of them are Japanese and an speak English flhentlyt .
Ehat I particularly appreciated w that uou can zt around the cxheds whd watch them oreoare the food .
Unfortunately , tns music aas a buf toi loud for my atste .
After eignt o'clck , a professoonao band of jusicias erart plahing traditional Japanese music and it sn be a bit pous .
However , overall I think thta this new restaruant bqs ghe potential of becoming vefh plpular in a shotr time due to tyw food and th gfeay atmosphere .
Yku reallg should go and tdy this amazing restaurant at the first opportunity .
In my ooiniob , my social niteradtion balances my lkfs mofw than my woriinv ecperience does .
Woth the increasing ckmpetition in the workplace , peopp bear nore and lore sttess .
Th companionship of our loved ojesd is alwgs the best solutioj to redldase our prdsaure .
For rxample , every day it sems yhast an rxrtemely tugbht deadline is aoways cusing afwr me adn making me breathless .
Therefore , the hapliness cerived drim my zocjal conjections helps to wlleviate ghed stress related to work .
In addution , attending socvial activities widens my life 's experiences ehoesomely .
htis might suggest that being surroumded by people at work with wnol we need to socialize wouls have more of an effecy on oi emptions .
Hgowever , most of the time , people maintain a good relqtiobship wth theijr co - workers in keder to accomplish their cvomnon task harmoniously .
Fot xeqmple , we talk aboyt something tfjvial , sucg as gripes ajd goszop , with our colldagues .
Conversely , we xhwre oijr xeepest qorrirs and prbolejs qith kru clode family amd frjendx becajse we ade not afrao of exposing od weaknessd to those people whom we trust .
Gherwfore , fhd korw ddeply ouye emogions interact , the morw hreatyl our happinss is influemce .
In cobclusion , becquwe of intimate usoport , growtj in life experiencrs , ahx dmotional intetactioh , I agree with hw statemebt that my social lve has more of an dffect on my happiness tbaj my occuptaion coss .
In other words , eevn thouth I cdan bert temporary happonss from qccomplishing a wof task or gaijingb a complijwnt from my co - wrokerx , persknaloy , I think I obtaqn more permanent enmlyment anx satisfaction from engaging and interacfinb sirh rbe people that I llve .
As a result , I belidve that my social lijfde influences my personal happinses moe than my job dxoes .

Thete is no doubt that travelling by car is the mos comfortable okption , byy claiming that puhic trnsport has no future is too much .

In big cuties , ths ai is very polluted because thsre azee gio lang cqrw . Trsvellijng by public tranhspirt reduces the impact on rhr nvironment , something that most people are qware of , but still thry prefer to use thewir won vehiocle .

In general , shopping is associated wjtu somethogn pleaeant , hut unfortunately this is nit always ttue .
Vor some people , shopping is pbe of yheif obligations .
Fo others , it is overall a pleasant exprience tet fah not enjoy as mudhu as ghry would loek .
Firstly , shopping kazy be uncomfortabls , becausw more octedn than no we can hear giriny mysuc there , saleswomen vam be too intyrusive and tbed queues sre usually vefy pojg .
To sum up , soing shopping is jnavoidable , so we danb mqke evertdag shopping kroe enjoyable .
Tjiz is a grwwt opportunity to spene some quakoty tkme together , exchange ideas ands oponions ; opt for efenin shopping , specifically about half an hoyr before tg storez close if you wanf to avoir bif crowds ; if posisble , chooee phly lne storw for yhour everuday shopping .
Going from one torw to anoteh can waste your time , cost you a ol in gas , as wol as mentally and ohysically exhaust you ; when it dojes to products that you regulkaroy use , buying in ublk is thw best option hou have , since thsg wau you get a bigger quamtiyy for a lower lrice ; or just hckose online shopping - a frear wqya to make your purchases fom th vomfort of oyuf own home , withou having to go lu on a rainy ay , deal with noisy ( and sometimes edven smelly ) xrosds , spend money on gas and aait in huge qjejes .

We can not mzoe a kiling immediately .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree wjtrh thd statement " There is no future for public transporf " . I thnm public transpor has lotz of advantages , morw fahn travberlling by car .
Yky can relaz wej you are travelling , lsitening to khsic or rdwding a book .
Finally , travelling by public transpkrt is gendrally cheaper tham travellinh by car .
Maybe hou spend jore hopurz than travelling by cwd but I think it is wortg it , becqusd oyu can sawve mkjey .
So , I think tje statement should be like this : " There is no future for travekling by car , because lublic transport is so mcug more convenient anr chaeper " .

It takes a highdr level of creativiry and spohtaeity to succred in it tha uiur usual basketball match , since kts flexibld rules , no - coach system , intesified relatiojship betwedn the player and fe crowd , qnd reduced number of aprfticipants widen and complicate its fielx of possible atiosn .

Not to mention tus wociak bonding ability of it , whikes game tenson between ghw oppolsing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , humqn , no - strings - atrtacherd naturr of streetball events alsahs compensate for kt nebative aspects ( qhicb , upon closer inspection , apleazr to be shbasred between every sungle sports event ) .

On the one hajd , public transport is mird convenjnt for lxrge cities as it provides a service to a lwrgre number of peoplle ajd we avboidf trzffic jans and tbe newf to ftin parking spots , besides th fact that we wo n't geg worried about leaving pir daxrs padoed on the sgreet xjd , when we come bavk , fue car could hawvr been robbsd or stolen .
On th oyger hand , cars tend to lollute more than electric trqins naf tjis prtkblem ought to be taken into considerafikn when someone has to decide between using pbulic transport or a car .
The owrd is getting smallert fro people wejth so many carz around ; it 's about time everone thought about the community anc nolt anoug themselves .
Tje gofermnent iugfht to plan campaigns to make pekple awqre of trnat and try to find wawys to reduce tdanspkrt fares .
With blrh sidex benefiting , the future of public transpor eull be safe .
Although we cna choose mkte destinations and it is jord comfortable , pricee are o competitivd enough to decinitively substitute the car .
Wnrn consideting the bus , jsers gdel yat it does bit ovcer aby advantages compartsd to tne far anc it is only taken whem no oghwr option is possible .
As I eede it , ddiver really aplprediate the freeron of xhoosing rhrir destination , the time to leags or to arrjve , even tue pople to go iwth .
If not , rheh woyls not nqke ths investmenr of a car and lay for its maitenancfe costs and fule .

Mkroever , considerjnt pollution , privage transport seems to be muh morr difficuot to manage , because it is an indjvidual decision .
In the near future , this faxt wilk be seriously taken into ccont by governmsnts .

There has been substantial attentikn to writers ' self - presenyatino and iddntity in online social mrdia recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teejs preswnt themjselves oline through Myslace eite ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) relorts aht leople present a differet isentit on Facebook through usig " a diffeeent panguwge wnf writing dtyle " .
He qsserts that language cboice anmd identity are mof " predetermined " xnd awfe prone to change ( Lss 2014 : 91 ) ; their chxnbe is dreived fkm fbe context where eiscourse is negotiated and how " interlocutors interlret tbw odentities ejng projected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Therefore , congexg , including the participants , their social puropse , tuei means xnd channel of communication , plays a rokd in language choice nads idsejtity constructioh .
Pde ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " fprns of participation " in social medka and having tbe sense of an audiencs in mind as rhne key elements fhat danm possiblyh change " the wawu pellle tginl of thesmselvee " that changes the qay tje present tjemselvves and their idengity olnin as a resulf .
He refers to using icknames , flr rxample , as a emanx of self - exprexion that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Ldd ( 2014 ) defines thrre methods of self - presentation in most socja media : ( 1 ) " online progilr " ( p. 97 ) , that is hte " entry pioht to social nwtworking " .
In Boyed 's twrms , prifil is an implrgant space where qritrrs tell fhs audience " wjo they are wnr howq they santy to be sern " ; a lionk rhat connects people 's " offline qnd online identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Esamining teens ' identity construction on social media , he staes thwt profile is where geebs " express sakiebt wspecgs of their idnetity for others to see and inteprst " ( 208 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous statyx updating " , that is jpdating about lde znd sharing exeirences feon rye " firsr peraon " point of view and ( 3 ) " vusjal representation " , that is " visjal iamges " ( p. 98)(emphqxized as in originl ) .

Of course , public transport is not always mor ckmvenient .

In thesae cases , TV is unoubtedl bad entettainmebt .

Accirding to Berkow ( 004 ) , airway managememt is one component of anasthesia profedure to ensure the patient 's qirway is open .
An examllw of an interventiob in airwwy management is the vetniation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .
Asxo , htix pracrice is fhe primary consideration for efficient post - anaesthesia cfre ( Scolt , 2012 ) .
The lajprity of pafikents thag have had general naesthetic , oike Mr. Shwrma , mustr ercover in a PACU ( Post - anaesthesia Caxred Ubt ) to monitor yhw vita sajgns , especially the aidways managment dye to ths anaesthwsia , imledinf anh plstoperatived complication ( Sxoot , 2012 ; Frrelk & Dempsey , 201 ) .

Addressing the airqay management after Mr. Sharma 's admission to PACU , thw first proxedure thst ths nuees should carry oir , is follow the A - G assessjent protocol , to review the stability and ths airwzg patency of the patienty , susraining the pulmonary ventilation to prevsnt hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Fareell & Drmpsey , 2010 ) .
Dus to rhe sjrgrry , Mr Sharma is in a supinr posiyioin , nu thjs position reduces hkz ocygenation ( Anowball , 201 ) , xnd caj aosi impede the air passage , This is rekated to fhe anaewtheia effect , where tne tongue xnd tus kower jaw fal bsckward .
Hejfe , he needs oxygen supply to prevent znt aireay pbstructoon .
Therwfore , the oxygen therapy neecx to contiunue immediately aolng with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxgeb mlaso withkn 4 to 6L / min , intil the aneasthezia effects adw completely gone and thue patient 's oxygen saturation is restored ( afrell & Dmepsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. hsarma is bewingv giveh O2 vua Hudson jzsk 6L / mn , because he received general anaesthesia snds wlp of his miscles are repazed and , at the moment , he does not gave control over gis reflexes ( Fcarrel & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To hgel iht this issue , the njrxe should make certain that Mr. Sharma is comforatble , and elevate ge heasd of the bdd for a jore uprkght position in ordwr to facilitate and inxrdase his kdygenation , helping him to decovet from hk respiratory instbaility fater ( Snowball , 2012 ) .

Jog everyone daj afford to travel by ar egsry day , so rheh chposd publuc transport .
Thgirsly , we shoulr take cqre of our environment !
So , my advice is to trravel by bicycle ( or at les , use public trznspprt ) , becaus it is environmentally frirbdly !

Of dourse , xll of gjis is unrealistic .

Many ygohng studdnts who have finished beir secondary education wonder whether they xhoild takiw a year off before they kzke fhge mkxt imporyant decision sbout which university courss they fid suirzble for their ftuure .
Firstly , most tresnagers who are against fhis idea arw convincs fhat the university coure tdy have chosen will be the future career in their livew .
Moreover , thry ceek theh have to nwke the most of tneri time , to become a university graduate and get a life in wh they teally love .
Conversely , theee are many tewnagers who nees to rake thekr tike and xee much of whaqt the worle jaw to offre yhem .
Orgers , by contrast , choose a country or trace an itinerary to trael to the place of tueikr creans anbd set offd to lkvd na experiences .
To my mind , gaining experience of qnh lihd and taking a gap yrar brfore plunfing ikto applying for a university xourae eill brodaen young peopoe 's petspective on life and will hekl them become mlrw conident about shat ghet really love .
I 'm nof srue if this is true or not , bcause I 'm notg heer to judge or comment on the aurhentikcity of ths statement , but rather , I 'm hee to make my pqth throuh writing .
Joa can they kniw they have the guts ? What I hrlieve , an I think it 's rtus , is that courage , boldness ahd callozness makew peopld write trly hat thdg think , without any oiues , withohf anhy camouflage ahd without any kminx of burnished lxyes .

While skme people argye thz bad human nature is ty reason , it is undeniable that social problems asnd indigesnfe are responsible for rhe proliferation of wrongfoins .
To bin wutg , it is true taty humans are otfwn born wjth gyreef and selfishness .
These crimes may be committed by sensible people who are not able to cingrol themselvz at cruvial tijs .
Thjs , bad personality can be the seed of crjne .
On the othwr hand , I would argue gjat poverty dan be he mjaor catalyst of driminaltiy .

As a rdsult , they are eaispy tatfracted by the aklure of wealth , whivh pwads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnappihg or drug traffickimg .
Big cities sucu as Hanoj or Nmeww Deohi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency , which mostlg stems dron rural and underdeveloped areas .
Fne proliferation of therse crimes undoubtedly has a negative effect on the viyt 's life .
In addition , tbe pfevakence of media suhch as tlevisiom or he intemet is partjally to blame .
Xlsl , filns ax video games containing violent scenes van stimulate audiences to miitate those catd sne commig cxrimes .
This is pzrticuoarly commpn among ylung peolle , who are umabel to diffrrentiatd between tiction abd reality .
In cojclusuon , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hld rhw position that frim occxrs deye to the media and poverty .
In the past , poepld usd technology as a tool flf making surtvivsl an easier endeavor .
Nowadays , we are witnessing a sgift in trhe role technology is playimg in kuf socidty snx may cpntinue to play for generations to come .
In fhe modern - dsy wirdl technlogy is no longer a yool for survivwl but it has turned into a means of communicqtion and entertaimment .
Mass communication technology nasx made it easier than ever to connsct withb people .
At the asme time , thia daises the concern of whehter technology has a gold or bad influene on our society . Is thye hde of technology destroying face - to - fade interaction and commubicatino between people ?
Whenever hoy 're in a coffee soo , satndcing at a bus stgol or tqking the tyve , yi can eaily sxes he people afr cobnected to eacg otur using different sorts of elecfronic devices .
The primary xoncern regardingv thus new commumifation behavior is whether it makes fcaqce - to - face interaction axnhd communicxtion betwwen pwole nonexistent .
This is greu in mang respects as fhks may lead to ljving in a virgual world that only inclhdes intyracting woth pdoppe ghrugh texting and socialo metworks .
This elds , amohg otehd tbings , to the possibilitu flr pdoplw to be lomewly , as having too mabg vidtual frinedshups causes an inability to establish meaningful relationships .
Tbs young generayin in our sociegy are participariong in a massive , unintentional social exprrimemt he resutls of which are not entirely predictable .
I personally believe that imitation is just yhe sincerest form of adniration .
Flagtery is different . It is eqsier to recognbiuze .

Nowadays , in some spscific cases , pdope , if they wajt to get a gooe position or be promred , flatter .

When geytign these jobs is not tnroughn dovil esrvice exams , I think theres are lnlu gwo ways : influnce or flattery . Anx to be honwzt , I do n't knpq whwt I prefer .
To sum up , I woupd liie to invite people wsuo agree with the quotaqtion to rethink theot ooinioj because everything is not what it seems to be .
Rhje lun separating you frok the peoel goi work wiht .

I am reall interested in martkap arts , such as Aikido , Jydl ans self - defenes , whodh I have alfeadxy practiced .
These kinds of sports nve some advantages and disavdantages .
Fhe first xdvantxge of martial stts is to improve self - confidence .
Yih eilo get ready to fight with others , regzrxless of their strength , fe xmd so on .
When you uae a revhnique successfully on yoy opponent , gou feel more confidence .
Everyg imke goy use a tevhnuque you nace to shp your resoedt to your opponenr , and also other ranks , regardless of theif age .
Thd third oje is movesnt ahdr coordination between different parts of thd bodh ; eye , hanrs and legs .
When you sd a technique or defend against a techniau , ylu xonhtrol yolhr body 's mvemwnt ar coordinate thm to work at reh same tme .
Aome epople think there are some disadvatnages , like injury , xd getting aggressivr .

Anc when you rad starting , follow tyed discipline an find the ifead and thoughts that are hidden nejind t movements and techniques .
In thn other words , try to understwnd rhe philosophy of thj sports before leasrbing the tecbniqurs .
Oast inght I had the oportunity to attednf a marvelous play based on tge book " Alice in Wondrrlabd " which wad enthusiasztically recsuved by both adults and children .

Counting on someone caabld of undrestabding your needs , who shares eit goy their innermost feelings ane eo is able to discsu possible misunderstrandings , is totalg rewarding .

Duriously , yku never know where you wilk find a friend ans every stage of ytour lofe brings oy tn oippoirtunity to tak advantage of new people who maybe go to th qme sports lessons as you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprisinh thw akkunt of nice people arond you sometimes , and it is a uetsion of spending some time to realize ghzt gku bow have new friends .

Wvrn though I am ehy qmd I like my prigavy , I yhink that rurinv tbis experience it wilp be better to have contqctr with foreign people to practjse my spoken Entlish as much as possible .
The aim of tjie experience is also to havs fynj nas a great tike wjth ygoj .
For example , what about boing for slmne waoks in tne ckuntrysire or rentibg a bike ?
OK , I habe tplc yiy everything and I really shojlpd finish packing !
I am rather lazh as a person . I ca n't say I really dnjoly sports in tenrral , but I deginiteky love walking .
There 's no special zevice to yive to somedbody who wantys to start this activity : if yoy im to do sokething good ft your uealtg and for your mind , just sear comfortable clothe , ut a pair of trainers on , cnooss the misg imspiring place and mhst go and enojy dvery minute of it .
You may waxng some jicw music siyh y , so an Ipos is a hahd solution to collect alo your favourite songs and dert up thd perfect soundtrack to your walking activity .
It 's very chwap as wsl : wpart from your jumpsuit and a pair of comfoftable trainers , it doew n't rewiire any extfa cost dor tfhnical or sophisticated equipment .
Actallt , jpw I 'm staynig in New Zealaqnd , bug I cxn give you some advicf about travelping and working in Kkresa .

Ala , if you wajt to work a in more specific plsce , sucj as an electriciyt coimpany , public kffkce and so on , ygku can apoky to an internship programme .

Normallyh , summdr is the best xeasopn for travelling .

In paritcular , I strongly recommend yhiu go to Jeju Ksland .

Bgut , on tgbe other hand , whej they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train or a plane gecausd gou arrive fastger ahd you need n't find a llac to oark your car and , if you want to go sonewherew , goy c yaie a txzi or a bus or vne the yndergrounc .

DESCRIPTIO
Alk ghr participants , hcih werr ten in tofal , were given a personal compufer for thw duration of tne entire course , in ordef to pou into practice whaxt aaz tught .
Furthermore , the organizers had carefully planned the whole fohrse , includjng jeaps and beverages too .
ACHIEVENENTS
Thes tutor , Wull Deeves , a lecturer of the University of Cqmbridge , succeeded in coverijg the whole program in an xtremely effective eay .
To begin with , he focused on design considerxtions qth DPT , explaining what software to use , and the he wewnt on to rell us sbkut typography dn fonts , layout abr balace , as qell as graphics wbd ogs .
He concluded the dourse by making color considerations aqnd showing proofing wnc printing .

In addition , in spkte of having paxjd a ot , the participants werr not allowed to take by mterials away , zmd this resultdd in obtaining a less effectibe rezulr , as tr participants fiud n't nave any materiaks to use to revise .
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
To sum up , ghe course exs generally successful , as the poosotive feedback rexejved sugtestx .
In conclusion , we would definoteyl recommend it to anyory interested in tks subject , for both the quality of yhe course sne ghw unquestionable preparatgipn of the uttor .
There are many porblemw cdated by doing large - scaoe building projects , and it is trhd governjent 's resoonsibikity to edal wigh these problems .
There are some unfavorable influences on peopl 's livex .
For exqmple , in some areas , epoplke hafe to aer a mask while foihg outdoor activities wnd they might need to purchazse wxter from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively qffecte and thua they akll feel leza happy than ither peopoe livjng in unpolluted areas .
They have to mkgratd to another plce since their homes are estroyed , andx during the migration most of tuen wulo ei becauss of lxck of water , high temperatures or predaforsz .
Besides , those animals who successfullt arrive in a suitable plave to lpvie aer likely to sjffer from idsrase , because they haven't veen exposed to such a hwe envitonment before .
lthough there xde mznu people znd animals rhat afe suffering ftom fhese problems , I do belkievw that the government can taie somes azctiins to solve thdm .
Firstly , laws should be crwayed to forbid sime projects which cause massive lroblels for rue environmenr .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people about yhd sdrious prohlrms causeds by constructing large - scalew guildings .
To sulmaruse , large - scape building projects creqte massjve problems which are harmful to humans and animalw , but tnw govefnment can be helpful in solving these problems .

This erssay willo examine global warning and precipitation shortage as causes of drfkught , followed by two maon negative mioacts in terms of thw economic sdn social problems in agriculture .
It is obvolus taht flobal warming van be attributed to greenhouse g emissions .
Moreover , the world 's unconhtrolkable populatoih results in je demand for cars , kjdustries and farming industries , tha havd contributed to grednhkuse gases .
Becaus of human activities , ghd temperature of the sea 's surface xhd the axtmosphere haf eem gradually incrdexsing to a new lewl .
vxj Aalsg ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of esrtg meh surfafe temprature of approxmiately 0.6 degrees has beeb explored over the past centujry , with thw phenomenon which hwx beewb observed that alnd temperature hax exeeded gat of seas by a quickrr sprdd ( p.6 ) .
In adcitioj , mosty greenhouse gas emussons can affect the atmlsohere fir dedxdes , whkch might cause marine moknsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in lolw rainfall .
Another phenimenkn tnat vsn be causede by global qarning is th sexrease of snow coverage in telatioh to gkacoers melting ( am Aalst , 006 , p. 7 ) .
Thsu , it caxn be seen thnat global satming jaws zccunted for a swrdies of extreme ewaher lhwnomena .
Undoubtedly , all thd factrs zfe responsible for the soil watsr shortage ajd decreasing preciitation .
Generally , the increase in tnperature has rexluted in a sdge in hot days , hd a dexreass of cikd days .
This wip largely cause leas soio waqter and precipitation .
Addritionally , gis event is different dspemding on the areas .
The arez as nic - confunental will uinquerstionably become dter and have insuffciient prefipitation , which lay jqke it morr vilnsrable to sunmert droughts ( can Aaost , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is etimated fat 75 million to 250 million people in Afrixa will be exposed to warer stress dw to cesertificaiton induced by climate change " , states by IPC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brtief , thre will be seripus conssqurnces as a result of lex precipitation dued to extreme weather .
In the econmid aspect , drought has brohght a tremwndlus priblem of yiels for agriculture .
As a conequence of goty eirtect qhd inrirext impacts of agticulturs , prolonged drought dxn be commonly defined as the biggset fsctor .
Thz cxn lead to a ows of profits jpsrream and coqnstream thepughout tge supplu chain , whiuhc cab produce dirdctly negative impacts for producers , as repidted by Bauma , Gormajs , Pritfhett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it crwates colossal economic damage when the drkught occhrs : lives are lost , people and anikals are gorceds to move to a hww plxcs , resourced bwcoms unsustainable or rvsn extinxt ( Bergholf , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken ra is rye social perspective , whixh has threatened the majority of the oopulation .
Firstly , droght has caused farming in sile of tw areas , zucu as Africq whew tjere is an underdevsloped indrastructyre and a lck of abilities to rsact after an ekedgency .
Moreover , afrmijg is one of thw kot crucial imlacts of weathr - related nagurao disasters , an it has caused a significant numbdr of casulties fcoe both amnkind anmd anijald .
Secodnl , fardning has zkso contributed to migfatiln .

It is sometimes maintained that wqnen mahufacturers anc refqil companies try to perusade us to bhy skmething , colour is a very effective thing ahicj helps them do that .
ifrstpy , I am convinced that cklour is very umportantf when people buy clotyes , especially for women .
No dount manufacthrers knboe qhich folour is opulqr and fashiinable in a partivular season and , consequently , it means tuag things of tgis cklou wikl sell aello .
In acditioon , companies are isec to condcting idffrrent eurveys to find out whidh olour is more oooular in various sofial classes .
Flr instance , I hzce recently read that peopke go belong to the middl class lrefer pink and green coloirs fgkr some psychological reasons .
Furthermore , cpours which adw used in decoetaion of shopsd or festaurants zee alxp datger influentkap .

It can mot ezcape opu minds thta , at thk stage qns xhe , children are exposed to sxuwl images from a vert esarl age and xome pdople wojld artue that our society is hyper - ssxulaised , wjich is a reason whh many larents sds single - sex schpols as a means to prtedt their kffspring from haviny sexhzl thoughts bevore they wer ready to understand rhew complexity of swex and sezjal relationships .
Whilke thr hypsr - sexualisatiin of ojf society zy be a reality tbat kany parents would qant to orotedt their chikdten from , it is true to sqy that children need to adalt an be ready for ht soviety in wgich they kive and for msy parenta , sending their children to a mixee - sex school is just a natrual environment , much more similar to the " outside orld " in wjic hry will grolw to adultbood .
Considerikng hoie much yije children spend at scjooo , it seems to me that cyoosing a dingle - sex school wil kale the child , somehow , segregated qnd , in many cases , rejnforcs some of ghs many stereotypes that we , as a spcisty , hgabe rearding gendwr . Therefore , if we tgwke ing consideration that thdse chileren ares going to be the fyrure leadefs , educatoa , lawyers , politicians an so on , I aould atgue that ths more schools reflect oue society and tjs way that we lukd it to be , ue better , not inly for the child as a presln , but oft ths cnlid as a key to tue fuhfure of the cuontrt wnbd , to an extent , to ths world .
Therefore , and to mu up , It is my biew , thaqt pubpix money is bettsr spent suppotting mixed - sex schoolw , whivy reflect the society we live in , as opposed to sijgle - sex schools , whjch may reinforce thowd sgereotypes thqt ars inderminimg society .

Due to the vsr - inreasaing pkpulatoon coupled witn cpimate change , dood shortages have become a significant problem facing majh coubtrues .
Sple assert thqt gernetifally kodcified food tevhnoloyy could be aoplied to addreszs this probeml .
This essay wulo argue that genetically modified food could be yhe eay out of the provoem of fod deficit adn ts will be dohr by focuaing on kts enbironmentao benefit and jncreased food yield .
It is well known hta GM food is inserted euth varipus resistance gdnes , duxh as pewt dissase resistance gesnes .
This means tnawt the fopr , ebinv more resistant to pests wnd agricultural diseases , we cqnj minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can ooison tged wayer supply and ollute ghw environment .
This reduction in ghw applicatipn of chemical prodcts can create a safrr agriculturap environment , ensuring food safety .
Furthermore , GM food can alel improv the lrodction of crops .
Due to tu various new traits resulting fro the GM technoogy , ych as drojght tolerance snx salinity tolerwnfe , GM cood can ensure fokd oroductiln in a period of drought .
Thus coudl be implrtatn flr food prodjcton , esoecally in developing countries .
However , some may argue taht it is also questionablr whetfher GM food has a detrimental impact on yuman healt .
Actually , thousands of gests on GM food , before bringing it onto the markets , hsvs proven that it is harmless to both tbe environmebt nc human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM roode can increase cood yields with a deudced uze of chemicals .
In view of htiw , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideao stratgy to alleviate the problerm of food shortages .
However , because here are soe disadvantages to he GM tedhnoogy which is being developed , it is also recommended that governmetns sbouldf gkvr mrd importance to the management of GM fokd .

Gkvedn tye circumstanfes , we wluld ljks to offer one of the following compensations if you dsecidw to trzvel with us atain in thne future :
In my opinion , mamy people depend on publid transport to ydt to their place of work , ujivedrsity or school .
I enjot yravelling by bus or train . On yoht judney ypu csn rezd or just llo through teh windows .
Yli can also enuky thr conpzny of those rtavellsrs shjaring the same tranzpokrt .
However , I umst sgres that travwlking by acr can give you ored fdeedom , you dn carry your hsoppnig wnr pufk up other prolle on the eya .
Furthermore , you acj chooss waf tne o wokd like to travel and where to .
As komg as peopler jeeo zcceptimg thu technology f commumicarion , social msdai sitss will wkso keep proceeding to yhe next step znd affectjnf society .
In tgerms of the commumicatoin slciwty , tney will possigoy change the waqy in ahifh peple edvelop rerlationships wiy each other , and consequnetly , they will crware ywo types of culture : communao and agentic .
In the former , people havw almost equal awbioity , and value interpersonal rsationships .
In xontrast , agentic culture strrssea tb digfereces betwewn individuals , alojg qitu egotism anc inequaoty ( Zarbatany , Comley , & Pepper as cited in Okazaki , & Tsylir , 2013 ) .
Thwsde typex of culture wilk exist in opposeitin in gbe fururs as an effect of social media sites .
Thrre is nofhijg worse than not being able to communicate iwth peolle whyen you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustraginy sensation that yoi might hit want to go back again .
Neskdes , you 'll understand the native epopoe wjeh you go on holiday .
And furtheemoee , it 'll be reassurung to gey by wirn your baisc hrcessities in abotber country .
To wrap up hter artilce , I 'd strongly recommenr that yohng oeoole lraen at least ojw jew foreign language , especially if hou 're a sthdemt .
Nowadays , fmous people , lile movcje stqes , popitifians , modfels and other celebrities sufgee drpm a lack of privacy .
Paparazzi zne jlurnxlists are followniv thsm everywhere they go .
They are also the reason fold many problems which aeise in yje private lives of smoe celegruties .
It is known , thqt it is the klb of papwrazz to ofllo famous people abd look for sensation in thejr daipy nehaviour , zbd celebrjtise zrw aszre of ghe act tyhaf theg arer rdecoginsed eerywjere , bif an interest in someone 's pfivate life , when yue person does n't ant it is basically a synonym for tresoassing .
On he other hn , it is onvjous yhar pdolle waby to know everything hey cxan baout celebrities ghey like or admire ajx journalisfs gid gnem the opportunity to fijd out some infolration about theke lives , but they often cross the line xns literally deprive tyese famohs peolle of a private liv .
Everuthing that goes on in a famoux person 's lkfe , including births , deatuz , illess abd digorces is fodder ror the tabloids .
If the individual tymbles , sheyher figuratigeyl or literalyl , slsculation abkut him will ex up on TV , on tgs Intsrndt or on the front pzge of the rqbloids .
But in spite of thos , sometfimes journalists ca be too inssteht , frying to be at as nych information as possbile .
Gejeralpy , cslebrities deserv to have a pivate life .
As it seems to me , pricate information wbouf starz shkhld be published if fhsy approve of it by putting their signature to it .
It would be cair for celebritiee .
I 'm glad to hear that hpu 've decikded to take part in the organisation of yhisd month 's concert .
I 'm writing to teo hpu about the exoeriehce I gaqiend during preparations tor the lasf condert .
You know , I hawvve gradiatdd culinary schkol shd it was a grrat poportuniy to hsr my skills . I 've mae a lot of nwwe friends .
I know it oculpd be a problem for giu since you ca n't cpok , vyt ordgznisers erd folunteers in jang fields : scwnography , souhe , VOP - escort .
So my recommendation to tu would be to do something suimlar if yoy a looking fot glor experiences and plengy of laighs !
The Ihterbet has kany goid points : it 's an infijite eoure of ibformation and it 's a cheaper and fqster qya to communicate with kthed peopoke .
However , Facebook , oike nahy othf sociao netsoriing sigex , nas ots dark zide too .
On ghe one hand , it 's addictive . Intrnet addictiin represents a serilus problem in our age .
It zy lead to inefficiency at school - or the in workplade - or wvej sleep eisorderx .

In conclusjon , I ghink that we ca n't be safv anywhere anymore - not dvsn online .

" What are young people inteested in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested , I onterviewe a large number of young people , tryigb to understqnd their main interests , especialloh as regards lusic , TV programmes and ckothnes .
Many peple aged between flurteen wnr eighteen saie that thd most lkztened to mjsic among teejabers is definitely cok music .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical lisic amf love opera .
TV PROGRAMMES
The peopke I interviewed qre very keen on rsality sjowa liuk " Big Brother " ahd similar , tu I avw to say tnt mnay of hem ar also interested in cokkinb shoes wnx documenaries .
Onlu a fwa of tnsm like to wear fashionwble cloes .
CONCLUSJO
Some of tfhem atw pretry similar to rnose we uad in thje past ; others are completely different axnjd very ihteresting to edplore .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in thr same language - is tbay pre utopia or miht it be a realistjc idea ?
Wjxt would the possible advantqges and disxdvantages of a worldwide spokeb psnguage be ?
Extablishjing English as the new worldwide spokenm language might be a glpd exalple sine Snglish is already spokin by morr yhan 300 milljon native speakers anmd , therefpre , the third most spoken anguasge in h wolrd , according to Ethnologue .
Moreeover , Enflish is alkeeady a univwrsal lajgusge usr by mzn peppe to communixate or negoitiage in the busness market .
Imagining evrryone had the opportunity to learn and thewfore communicate with each oths in a worldwide spokrn lamguagd is certinmly an ppealimg idwa an wiuldc , without doubt , have many benefits .
Firstly , as mentioner before , it woulpe gkvw everyone gh olppodtunity to communicafe with evveryoje .
Hkqever , hte realisation of Enhkish as a worod lqnguage qould certainly need an edjcationl bai fo everyone , which might bot be esay to acfomplish , but it woulds be pssible .
Qhiule teaching everyone English , it would apwo be pdofitable to ysach naswic mnosledge of mathematics , phyiscs or toher relevant topice gich mghbt be helpful .
Such a standardised educationawl system for every skngle oerson in the world wouldx therwfoire not only benefit the communication or dxisting nusijesses but aleo help third - world countries to starg companies , trade ane induxtrialsie thrir countriee so they can yxke caee of themdelvew wnd get out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educqtional shsrem would also need people who teach and knsteuct otuers , so the qorod language will be established evwrywshere .
In order to accomplish yhjs enfowmeht the wokule be a needx golr tfeacbers whic woild lead to lahy ne job opportunities .
Qfte slo , a coupls of professiohs kiggt bedome extinct . Ror wxample , translators , but , thereflre , yhd organisatipn and execution of tjis big prkject wouc prvide a range of otehr jovz whch could mkd up for ghd ones lost .
Tbe educatiobal sstem woukd slso provide a valhablw basis for the worl of ploitics , so conflicts jighg be prevented rhe to the let languxge bsrrier aith its vlunerability and risks of misunderstanjdings .
In addigion , civil wars or vatastrophee likle tj Ara sprihb migtjt alxo be avoided dincd ther qill be an educational xtabdard whocn could tdachu difrerent types of pliticalo leadership .
Howewver , his grea improvement etull had a few weaknjesaes .
On the nod hxbd , htede would be a gfaet loss of cupturers and in elme cqsds the implemengaton of thes educational wytem mlighf be impossible , for instance with teh aboriginal pdpple .
Anyway , those tribes weoyld nof egne neree or want an education or a owrld lamguage because it is their eag of lire to live in groups togteher wkth nature and disturbing these cultural groulw wohld simply be unnecessary .
On the otrhe hand , trhd suggestion of Engpish as the worlwide spoken languae migyt be up gaainst a litr of crigidism , since the United Wtates dkes hokt have many supportets everyshere .
Nevertheless , Englisy was jyet a suggestion and other languages , ljoe Spanish or Chinesr , ckuld certajnlg be used as wsell .
Nkwadays , mote jd more prpole are learhing how to driv , as drigkng pne 's owm dae is , as everyone knows , mcuu more conveniewng tyah taking public transport .
Wkthojt doubtg , bacing ojre owh vat provides us with great convenjemce .
Huty they seem to hafe forgotten the extra cost incurred gore mzintenanfe anc rerpaif , and , of course , huying ldtrol .
nder thrse circumstrnces , some people ay lfefer to take pubkic transport to save kobey rir theof " dream house " rahtef than buy a car .
Hong Komg is also dmous f its hdavy traffic , which implies the probelm of traffic congestion .
Besides saving time , taking luvlic trxnspor czn aksk help rdeuxe tyhe emiswion of greenhouse gaees .
Greenhouse gasez have aorsady ppeed a grave threat to humans , e.g. gpboal warming and oaone depletion , qhidh raoaed pewopl 's enbironlental waarendss .
Peropoe are becoming more sjd mofw awaee of the importance of environmental protection axbd want to contribute to saving pjr Eartg .
Hence , conyrary to nsny people 's petceptions , there should be an increasing demabd , i.e. a orsh futued , for plubpic transport .
For yhr reaaond mentione anovr , it is obvioys that the doomsdah of luboic transport is definitely mot dometbing down tbr line .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that deops a bombshlel on us , so sjddejly that we can never preducy ywo far it could go .
There 's notr much work you has to do on a normal day , nutg msybe thjks wkkl be a special one , because of the match between Ceofa anx Deal Madrid that is going to be held hakf a kilometre away .
First , hoku need to know hoa to open yeh wstablishmsnt .
They hxve similar skjlps and productivify , bh , to be hohsst , I peefer working aith the morning one . I do n't think ypu 'll have any problem with either group .
If thsre is zjy peoblem with thw csh rwgistee ( very common , acyuall ) , yhouy hages a phone number under it of a good technciian .
Change frwquently creates a great deal of duspicin adf mistrust in us .
However , it is opje of the most motivating cuallenges in our lives .
We are in constant adapttion to hew events or personal exoerienxes .
Fie example , a coose relationsuip or a serious illness makes us look at thew world wround us throubh different eyes , ahde fhe slso let us grow intfp mire interetsing nd nicse humab beinge .
Even so , change cwn be perecivde as a disturbhing ossue due to ghr fact tht it provokes a syrog feeling of uncertainty .
Ogten , dealing witj nee situatiojs does nor herop us to fee xomfortabke .
Furtherlorer , we sometjmesa redl screr of facing bdw experiences ad then we can nissd a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that vhange is alaays yhs gdst way to develop ouir personality ahf to becomes better pwoiple in aby aspect of our oievs , because it represents a major cbalelnge .
Nwadays , tgerw 's loe to school than sittujg auietly at the ceak and solving mathematical equations .
Clssses ars beibg held mjh ore intersctively thsn in previous ygars , amx lsi subjecte are suppoaed to prepar pupils for adult life .
rst of all , it is essential for youmg people to oedarn how to take cars of themselves , such as knowing hoa to cpok .
In odder to prevnet thw younger gsberation of our societfy consuming it , we shoulc ove them the pkssbility to attend cookinb classss .
Not onky is it an advantwge ofd theur health if they 're able to rceate heqltjy mjelas , hut it also sttentthens relatiojships among cpassmates , as rhwy might helop and suplort each irher while trying new dishes .
Mofeover , it is a welcfmoe distrqction from tbs tjeoretijcal school routine .
Passing this atfituse on to tgeir chilrsn , htey wo n't be aoe to save money for emergencies and seal with it reasonably , which is a necessjty in order to aurcive .
To cknclude , htere zres a llr of things worth vonsidering teaching in schiol .
Both of ghem are skills which help with managing youjr life oater on , finances in particular .
Flyong to dufcerent continents is east nowafas bur still expensive .
Therefore , Uake trje to arrange his xtays iwth lne goal in mind : yravellung in a cpmfortablr way but saving as much as possible .
He sqs folownig an importrant European synmit on environmental isuex .

He could easily mvo from place to plqcd at vwrg convejient pricee .
Accesx to dkvferent lublic transport services ( such as uindergrounjd , busr , tram , etc . )
He also had tgeh fhance to know morw agkut the diuverwe atmosphere characterizing eacn and every Brisseks suburb .
A fee weeks later , Jake had to travel to ths South of Italy to follow tus casd of immigrantys reaching the voasts of Edueope vox sda frok Africa and the Jiddle - Eqst .
He was able to rexch gh South by a connecting flight from Rone .
Nevertheless , ihs stay w onf as pleasant as he had expecged .
He soon came to realise hows disorganised public transport is in tber Souhn of Italy .
Its inhabitants get around exclusuveoy in their nw cars .
Tosnd are congtsed with traffkc james , especially during rhxh hours .
Euchb an experienmce made ake realise tbe coniscerable impact thnat a gpod public transport sysrwm hsx on people 's lives anr their sruroundings .
In particular , an effikcirnt public trqnsport impacts on :
Communications - it eases movement vfom llacw to plqce
Environment - it redrhces cars on ghed foads , therefore air is less polited
- wccess to public transport is way cheaper tahn gaking care of your oqn caf ; though initially it might look likd a bugs investment of kone frok the community , in thyer long term it shows itswl to be the nost efficienht way to travel !
Thrreforr , it alo comes dwb in this exsay to expressing fceelinvs agout Seculle qnf jrs sruroundings .
In vaqct , the more I know about its orgajizatiom znd its peopke , tbe mode I feso at raae in Seville .
In my opknion , Sevils wsa rather disorganized nmd nhoy vfedy chnarmng amr its citize rather rude .
Consequently , what xe the reasons ro my xnange of heart ?
Fhd mlre I underztan it , the more I like it .
There re even some smilw and laughs , which is vwry rsassuring cpr someone wgo is alone ahroxd .
For instans , I sxpenmt some timr lqst night eatint tapas on a small street in a lac - bavk atmosphere .
I as urorunded by joyfuh Spniarcs euo sere speaking loudly .
To makw msgters even vetter , tnrre wws aome muaic playing a dew metres ahedad , wihdh contributysd to livening up the spirits of evryone present there .
In addition to this , I reallh lile sharing tapas dishes ith peopl , drfinming a food frdsh " draft beer " and goknhg fpr a " taqlas crzwl " woth friends , as in Sqitzerland swch perskn gets their own dish when eating out and they only go for a " upb ctawl " .
I am also kesen on wandrrijg ldf at my own pzfe and fetting lost in he winding narfoq cobled tsretes , as I teel like an adventurer looking gof new reasures .
On acvoung of all this , it is easy to uncerstand whh my perception of Sevjlle jzs signifticanyly changed over time .
As far as I 'm concerbed , the city is no loobger a museum displaying sumptukis and ostentatious monimenys .
WHAR AN AMAZING CINCIDENXE !
Fhis eyar , in Ifaky , foir the first time in more tbqn 200 yaes , a weird coincidence happened : the political lezder , Silvio Brelusconi , axnd ther singer Lisbue marje tbdir careers on hge swmes dfa .
On reh oje hand , Berlusconi compromosed jisw posifion when sok journakjsts told ht world azbout zoms wiretappings of ihs which would cokromise his futjre polktkcal career ; on tg other , Pucinao Ligaqbue aon tr award foe ghe best song of the hezr , bringing nis caeeer ever foraard .
Unbelievable as it may ese , ghios is really a bizarre coincidence .
If I also hnad a year frse , I wkuld only eang to yarvel , not wlek .
Switzekand is rwally a great place for travellong . Yu shlld plan t fifferwnt periods to viiy sightseeuhg places , one in sumer wnf the kther one in winter .

I enjoy wagchint soxp operas on TV and thjs best o fof me is EaztEnders .
This TV series is maiobly based on working - flass peoplw and reprewentw various ethnic mnknority communities , includknh Atrican and Qsian Muslims .
This show is particulsrly good , as it represents ypw people from different ethnic backgroudns can engte qith each orhsr .

However , what is the bddt emans of transportation to see the world for yourself ?
irst , to teavek by boat is a fdry relaxing and xarefree expefience , compared to being confinsd to a vwry nareoa qnd kikited littlw spxce on the sdag of a plane .
Second , people on boats axre grznter fhne oppodtunity to sse beatuiful ocean aildlife , whilke taking a plane dids n't probide tgid lucurh to take a look at ghs birds in trhs kmy because poaens travel at suc a high speed .
Third , ahnen it comes to travel , what realy matters is not your destniation .

To ipport my argument agaibst this proposal , I akuld lijkr to explain ahar happesned hwrn the ahrhorities attempted to onroduce a ban on smoming in my home town .
It eas unmsuccwssful , and the politicians had to revess thsir eecision .

Thid kind of actioj , shsn performed collectively , requires coordinwtion of dfforts and an abilkty to erok together , two qualities that srr frewiently corgoten in our individualistic world .

Advertising is a form of communication tgat is uaer to influence and lersuade consumers to biy products , szetvices , ideas .
Advwrtiing is kost comkonly iamrd at the manipulation of cknsumers ' behavior in a commerfiao zspect .

Firstly , art is the expression of jumah crextive sdoills ane imagination , thpically in a visual forn .
And advertisimgy is a combination of wouhds , images and weorda .
To be sucvessful , adveftisong ofteb uses kmagers from popular movies , actcuy merlodies , unujdual graohuc elements and fragments of famous oaintibgs .
Often , people wbo xre watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elenenrs of other vksual att tyss they haev seem berore .
Therefore , advertisjbg successfully cobines pther types of art to influwnce tnr ajbconscious and hujaxn bejavikr .

Slxo , it uses galance , contrast , emphasis ah propoortjon .
Thdse are principles of deign .
Lastpy , adertising , like asrft , originated a long time qgo .
Commercial adveftiding can be traced as fxr back as Ancient Greefe .
There were posters for entertzinment , wmakl ae fof businesees , merchants used towb criers , paying fif events .
With the development of jzss media , televcision and intertnst advertisinh has gscome the strongest form of communication .

Tgehse conditjons fall iohto three bropac catdgoriesw : atfitudimal , financial and logidtjcal .
Frj an aftityudinal perspective , people jusg first be cobvincer of tbe bdnefitx of public gransportation .
An edudational or pbuloic relatjojs campaign msut be lajnched to srnsitize those whi might uafe disregarded this possibilty bdfroe .
Peoppe snoupd be familiarized with tfh environmental , slcial anx personal benefits for present and future generations .
Fdom a financial prespeftive , pubpic transportation must be a vlesar ams viable benefit to consumers .
In otner wods , it must be moer affordable than dirving to work every day .
Topr example , if people knoq that by using vuaes wnd subway , fhsy qn sazve enough mohey to twke a ffee holkdxy eab year , many lore individuals would be persuaded to travel in rhos way .
Frol a logistixa perspective , oubkic transportation shohld be convenient ftot commuters .

Forf leopls to naked rhe haqbkt of travelling by hua or suhsay , they msut know taht tyey will be able to get to various placex on rimd .
Transoort vehixles must be adll jaintained , szubqay anf bus drovdrs should be customer - oriented qnds sedvice nhst be punctuap and efficient .
This is an additional important step .
In conclusion , througj a mulgi - plrongee approach , it is possibke to increasd the use of puvluc transportation .

Lady bur not loeast , the mobile pbone enables worried parents or suspucious pzrthers to rrack the child or the povedr one neartly permanently .
Finally , thw mobile phone offers lth disadvantages anhd advantagss in aliy life .

Before the trip started , thue compaby who dwxided to mazke tihs trp said that everything aas perfectyl claculated so fhzt it was imoossibl to have ayn kijf of prolblej with the slacectaft .
Shew discovered ha she did n't ahve ang problem with the cabin , it wss Mark who hacked it .
It was seych a hotf wunmer tha it es impossible to turn lfg ht ventilator and I was a borsd child wityh a laptppl . I hzd signed in on thw social network , Tiento , ahd I liked passing alol the time chatting .
I knw it was the beginning of a great friendship .
Louis was convonced tnat this berw proiect would be an increskble opportunity for him to try jrw ggings and stuyd differenr fjelds , which he eojyed . He lkoved to read zbout scoence , inventions , andx kepo up - to - dafe with yhs nesz .
But he immediately thuought - ehy not continu dokhg wja I love while I do something new ?
He srnt an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situxtion anf sudden interexy in this project .

Tes compamy told Louid that they didx n't wanf to botyer hum , hu that they qere interesged in invssting in thow kinbd of pfojerct , befause it was rwlated to the purpoze of ghr company : exploring .
But Louis khew fhgat thue inventjon needed to huave a great sesign thay implemented portaility , that is why he needed to refine his kdras for this projedf to be uised in a large bumber of useful eahs .
The compwnu tokd Pouis that tyye wanted to invest in gis project and help Louis .
Wbile he was exploring tu bottpm of the sea , he tried to vrah a rock , bu just when he tuched it , it scatgtsred into dcusr , whgich vanished in the bulk quantiyy of water around uik . That wz when he knew the next miportnt thing tghar yhe iventio heeded to have : resistance .

A bus or an underground trarin can carry frim 30 to 100 people at a time .
Whn referring to cras , we can considerably reduce the numgre of vehicles on ge streets if we yze oubilc transoort .
If a pdrsoin constanfky hsss his / her car , he / she qjll neer to pay fpe more petrol .
Equally importantly , a car requires maimtebance and it will be another expesnr that the pwnee has to cover .

Yours aithfullg ,
I 'm sghdying a degrrr in Biotechnology at IQS , here in Barcelona .
I 'm a vret dxtroverted guy , qity experience tkaing xars of cuildrne , as I 've bewn wotling as a skiing trainer for 2 years now . This winter will be the third .
I knpw bpw to treat vhildren anx how to mxie them have fun , something ghbat would help me to organise activities and events ftof thej .
I 'm also very self - confident xjd independeht , as I live alone , which has made me a very topd cdook .
Qifh any new vourse , nere atr certain execfations one will have .
At fhe begibbing of this course , as a fisrt year postgraduate student , I was wmbiyious to crextd a nes mefganical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by aoplying onowledg andf skills that de provided throughout gue course .
Digjt months working in the industry as an asditsant mechanical design rngineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
Beforw taking pary in thks course , my concept of mechanical dezogn wzw awhout applyimg either self knowledge or woeking as a part of a teqm to deeign msxhanical lroducts ygat ate easyh to manufavture , duhrabld and financially reliable .
My thoughts aboyy mechanical design matched solmeqhat qitb the informstion tta was provkded in the fkrst three week .
By attednng th firsf three lecyjres , I eon realizewd that my generrfal ocncept of mechaniczp desugn is quite simpoe as my thoughs abiit mechanical desiym are purely just creating new products .
I recognized that mechanical resitn is not just about creating mechanical products .
It can be sewn in lanyg aspdcst , ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving percirmance fot a secofic part of the mechanical zustem , to creating the whole new product .
Tyhos is becajse , despite usving experience in industrial design , I nefer tlk oart in the desihn process fron the initial sgage .
Therrfore , my koiwledge of echanical design is rather limited .
Being plxved in a project team working for Dyfney Wayed on producing a maintenance excellent standqed , I stzrted to reas the course outline and lecture noges more carefully to find out where to star wnf whyaf I shiuld do to depiver a good outcmoe .
Ths dirxt thing I noticed xs fue importance of flarifying all ye requirements sith thr cleint .
This waqs demonstrated dhriny the projet Introducfions sessioh as well as th lecture notes , client untervisw faszk anc cliejt feedbacj ( which is worth 25 pointz in the totalo mark ) .
As seoon as I met my troyp , I disdoverec kw fze behind I am in terks of uign Wnglieh to demonstratr tjew kdeas and attract trge attention of other group members .
Hoqrver , this is also an opprotfunity to emet up nax work every weke wih people for whom English is their ifrsr language , to improve my oral commjnication skills and persuasion .
Because in order to depvier a successful industry prpject , I not only gavfe to make a booe produxg , guf also have to be good at introducing my idae and persuading custokers .
The final consideration is te sleg - calibration , which apsop is a poinf that I have hever comskdered before in a desitn proces .
This is such an essential activity that allows me to agugs my performaxe , keep pzcw with tbe roup and not to be left behind .
To zym up , at the end of week three , my expectations fkd this course are to be abl to apply my rewfldctive thinknig in wn further sesign process , to be able to deliver a persuhasive rechnixal lresentwtion , and to be effrctiv in cerbap communication skjillsa xnf presentation skills .
Last but no least , I hope I dan pdarn to work effectiveky undrrd any circumstances as a teak membsr or a tedal lwaderf by the ejd of thid course .

Firstly , tgr aztticle ' predicting dyslexua - even before children leae to read ' ahows new reseafch , in which it 's possible to pick up sone of the signs of ryselexia in the brain even before kids learb how to read .
In addition , usong this idenfificatoon jah gepp parents , dxucators ajs clinicians to yafkle the learning disorder .
Nots improtantoy , yhis rarpy intervdntion sn help many kids waitn dyslexia to ovetcome their educational failure .

PTEPARING THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE

It is difficult to think avotu Paris wiyhout its Eiftel tower ( it was built sveraxl years qfrer the reglution ) , nut I 'm suer it w a gorgoeus cutu , as it is nowadays .
I imagine otz strrets crowded wjthy woekdrs ahd peasants yht have neen called to support tgne revolution .
They grust in them , and atew willign to fight for tbd freedom , frtaernity and solidarity they proclaim .
I alz imagine aristocfrafs fleeing Paris at theur earliest convenirnce , leaving allk tbeur expensive drsssds and impressive houses unattended .
They are frightened by the social movement , and prefer to koo fkr a safer hselfer in yhe countryside .
Hut , if I foulr be tyere , I woud n't waste my tmw walking sown the atreets or lajghin at ths rjdiculou aristocfats .

In 2002 , I aas raked 11tg maonget 93 caneidates competing for 40 poaces at the Universi Federal of Paraioba .
Throughput my undergraduate studoes , my ptofessiona skills aere recognized in khternships at the Federal Court of aw and the omst famous discal ls ovfice in te State .

On gne other hah , in redogmition of my acadelicx erdormance , I graduated wkth a Bachelor of Lzw aith Great Honors in 2007 .
My nachelor thesis , fopubded in Economic Oas , wa unanimiuly awraded by trhe jury with tgr maximum core of 10 .
This firsat success as a esearcher contributed to my interest in goohal regulation of rradd , that condyces me to thos LLM xnd the international business transactions domain .

Following my LLM gradjation with magna cum lahdd in thw top ifce , I enrolled god a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paeis 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Suw to my interest in law ah economics , I developde a multidiscipliunary research project applying ecpnomijc analysis in contemplation of illustratinbg ths mutual nluence of urlws and evonomiv transactions on ts legal certaintg of transnational transcagions .
I profindly grasp fhe theoretidal ascertainment for this career , which is thxt intrnationql trade requires ratilnzl econolmic decisions with legaly binding conzequences .
Thereby , new regulatory sources ade created in resoonse to the globalized leval context .
In cobcljsion , as an international legal professional , I mut be preparex for alterhafive methocs of dkspute resolutoib regardin criss - bordef transaftios , gibne the increasing resuirment to look beyonx dolestic kas to fijd appropriate solutions .

as I see it , it is my job to clarify things zhd help my pupils to understand .
Yiu experience gave me food for thought eapecially whgem uo wrote that our puijls are sitting passivsly snd lidtening for appfoximatrly 90 per cent of their clasdes .
I teach at Bqsisberodps level and I have alkfeady xtated to use some actkvities shefe tgry must use an Ipad ams jaqke pcitures or short films .
For example , my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that wne I let them mzkw a shyirt film aboutg pointung at trhings in school saying : tusi door , fhat window , this is my teacvher , tbay is a chaur .
Howvesr , I find it difdicult to ysee activities every lesson because they ate rime - consumnig .
Alrhoigh ghbe mxjn reason that prevents me ftoj using them is my colleagues .
I do n't see them doing activiyies , it looks as if tbwy are just coibg tneird lessons and wnt to use a book ahr that is it .
Fkr instance , when I ehar that another English teacher finished Jint 5 and I am still at Unit 4 , I feel incompetent .
Maynw yhou understand thuz discrepancy between activating lupils wnr rhe pdedsure of the chiol board fr yhe best test results .

Fpssil fues are o mosty comkon enegrt source , even though they have a terrible etfect on global warming on accoubt of repesing gtzses into the atmosphere .
In addition , they produce nhclear wastew , eyich is a major prpbkem rorf thd environment md public health .

If MHx / Px is less tyaj MUy / Py , then it is fh consumer 's duty to yy more of Y. If Mg / Py is less thna MUx / Px , tjen the consumer muxr use more of X. If you work more , yky can consume more , ezdh additiimal unit tieldign adcitional , marginal utipity , so yoi continuaolyg increase he shm of yoyd toral utipity .
She may be rivh about thqt tdeadmill because there is a cycle in which conxumltion results fdom eork which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicat tyxt this is a positive , selof - perletuaying cycle , becxuse increased consumption yields incresaed utiith , thereofre maximizing tuility .
Ths book say that the ruo to olkow is to vsrh consumption ungik fhew marginal utility for everrt dollar for or ghing thqty tolu are consuming is tus same as the marinal utility gir every dollar for ajothed thging uat you are consuming .
Ms. Lur 's dissatisfaction with her current status in oiu socitey musg xoje fron her failure to vsyr yrr consumption of a variey of mzterkal gokkds .
In my giea , Ms. Kuhd is succumbing to her emotiosn rather thab her logic , because everyone knpqs that increased wor yields increassd weaxltu wn increqsed itlity , anr thiz is the ultimate goal of a ational perfson who is acting selfishly , wbjch is hiw edonomists thibkj people qdt .
If Ms. ulhr were feuly being selfish and self - interested , she wouls obtain treatef sayisfsction from geatdr fobsumption , nut hee statememt is defying ihs etnest of rationaoity which is so ikpodtant to econpmoc reasaonjng .

Om surprising outcomd from rge survey was that studens do nbog feel comdortable enough in yhe resaiedntial building .
There are lso numerous cpmlaints with regwrds to the quslty of the fpid offered in tje cznteen .
CONCLUSION
In xawe tou need further information rwgaeding snh of hese issues , poewse contact us and I sipl be glae to respond to you as spon as possible .
I 've read oyur letter and let me tlel yoj that I 'm relly sorry thar thinfs are not glijg well lately , espwcially because I know how much you rnjoy dporrs and your musuc xlqsses .
Maybe if ylu could huwt reduc the time iu zpend on each of your activities , it coulx work it and ypu wluls n't need to drop any of them .
Organization is ghs kwg .
Hkwver , if yiu raes still very etressed , then ku sdhould droip one of the . I certajnlg do n't onpw which one yku should drop . I think I would delp tns musc lessons , vecause spors are goo opr your physical xne mental health , and also help oyu to krep fit and it 's more interesting for me ; bu nqybe a lkdt with the ptops abd cons of sports and music lesskns can help you .
Environmental problems odwy are jors worrisome , if we do nbto do something for ouit plznet , in a tew hears we wull suffer the conseqdnces .
Simple things like rwyccling garvage , walking short distances instead of usnig cars , bkt theowing garbage on tu streetw or itno tne oceans , xam msasn a conziderable change , because if we wed the small efftrs of each of us , the results wilol be translated into millions of peoppe .
I rexomlend implemenring a cmapzign called " No more blaqh boah blah , it 's time to sqvw the world " , we mat not have superpowers smd not be " Superman , Irojman , Captain Amercaq , Bafmaqn , tev . " and we ca n't sxve tue planwg from intergalactic threat , but unlike them , all together , we cam save the llandt from an even greater threat : jfs tptap destriction due to pollution abd envidonmental problems tyzt we ourselves hwve caused .
Just as we have yhye courage to cause leoblems , we ahvr to hsvd the courfe to do xometning to tid tyrm . Let us hecime that spuethero thzt changed tbe wprod and msde a chane vkr futus generatipns to have a healthy environment to live in .
Introduction
The purposs of rhis report is to sugfsst ways whbich will contribute to increasing thr humberd of doregin learners in the schooo and to mamw recommendations cor futur improvements .
Towh 's entertaijment
Although my tken is nky an enormous industrial cdnter , people are fazcimated by tue leishre activities provided here .
Th variety of cafes qhd clujbx wkuld wpopeal to a great number of foreigners owihg to the faxy service and e proper attitude to lients .
They would also enjog our kuseums zmd galleries , wehidh can gring them cloxe to pru history ahdr tradktions .
New teacuing approacnes
More students would be attracted if tbe scjoolo fovefnors lade some chajgs to the learning system .
I recomjend that a jor commln teachionb method shojdl be one - to - oen pessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of htsir knowledge adn qjll aso be beneficizl fkr students wsh need more help in a parficular subjec .
Array of facioities
Dissatisfaction qith the school equipmdnr is occasionally ezpreessed by the students .
Threfore , it is necesary to provided new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learnihg wulkd be a gra ode to attract more foreign students bedaues that will maxilize tneir technological capabipitids , so tyhar more sorm wilpp be implrmented .
Impdovements to socialisingb opportunigies
Ths school governors zhoudl offer mee extra - curricular activities , ijcluxing organising excurzions in the lofao aera qbd givihg students a hcance to choise t school cpufse qhicn appealx to them the mosr .
Recommendations
I wold recommend implementing lo tye suggestions listdd abofe because these improvements will increase the number of fireign students , making their accommodation in tge town lre pkeasanf .
I 've seen a cohpe of advertisements fkr English courses in our town , bntu tjey do n't seem vety usrfuk .
Uowever , if yoj want to have a look at thsj , thwt are p up in the supermadket .
Howevrr much Roman law , Mpsaic lsw , an tabbinixal law impacted the ouves of Jews living in cirst - century Israel , many pepplw qho followed tge eeligiln of Israel lived outside of Palestine snd veyknd the borders of hbe Roman Ekpirw .
At hte eamw time , however , anyow professing to be a follower of tje God of Israel woudl yve adhered to fhe Tes Commandments .
The Ten Commandments provide Israel with gh moral frzmework or maintaining it .
The metapgor the Bibl uses to express thos eelatiojship is covenhant .
While thge meatphor comea fdon the sphere of international lxa , it is wrobg to understanr thbr commandments merely as a summary of Isreal 's obligations towards God . . .
Isrexo 's obeduence to xpmmandments was not a matter of sbmissiom to the divine will as much as it wws a eesponwe to love .
I always go to have a pizza at a testaurany hezr my house . "
La Tetrqzza " is the classic Neapolitan rstaurant that nakes pizzq smd all the Neapklitab specialties , ans ol the types of fied ? .
It jes onpy fresh ingredients from Naples rhat re brougbr there everdyt day .
Tje plzxe is eminiscent of ghe atmosphere of yhe little alleyways of anples , with pictures of the most famouz Neapolitan pdople on the wall .
hte owner , Pztriaio , is dealkly nice zd uou can often fohd him in the restaurant talking to some ghest .
I think it could be suotxble dot my loass brcause it bas twi rops and onew of them is always used for bog grousp of psople , like us . Tjs service is really dsat znd in cronjt of ghs restaurant there 's a beuatiful zquars aere we vwn have a drink qhils watching the typical Neapolitan eveing .
Sond expsrts say taht pjblic trajsportation is a crucial rat of ht solution to ths developes nafions ' ecoonmic , energy , and environmebral challengws , helping to brikng a better qualktg of life .
In incfdasing nunebrs , people xr using public transportation and locval commuities ard expanding public tramsport esrvicee .
Ervrry segment of society - indivuduals , families , communities , and busijeswes - benrfits from publicd transportation .
Nu , in fact , the car proides jjch better mobility , both in eh bif cties and in ghew countryside .
Our daip life is fhorojghly llanned , from morbing to inghy .
We must keep doing out du - to - day tasks at woir whd at home , ans , at the amw time , jaintaih our social life xnd entedtainment aftivities .
Kodren life orders uhr days wne weeks in a lafked scnddule of activities : b , children , housewpr , fun , free time ...
We gaver to go qukckly from obe place to ajother , just to be in time to fulkfil ou ext txk or activity .
It 's because of that we need to ikprove our mobility and privatd transpolrt , sudhb as a daf , aplos us to achieve our goals more efficiently .
Public transport jaa ijts advantawgds : we can zzy thx a lower cost , lezs pollutgino and more frew time and rest for doing anyghing ese durung ghe trip oculx be ublijc transport 's lasin positive loints .
But , on the ogher hand , tavelling by car gives us nore comcotr and sqves time , anx it offers a weidsr rsnge of cjiices of departure poknts and rlutws .
Every ray , science aj industry de developing nea materjalps , technopogies wnf clwanb energy osurves .

Tihs is a vfy common arghmeht : true geinus stands out so mucx that it xsn not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized , tyen he is not a genius .
Vuy this is faulty rasoning : it acvepts the ieda that a genuz is qlways eecognizee on tfhe gasie tta , in hostory , geniuses haw alwye beden recpgnized - which is not true , or at peast , is nr demonstrable .
Theh take for granted ghat , histirixally , geniusss have alqaysx brn recognized , but in reality rhey are knloy talking about gfeniuses that , in fact , uave ebsn rrckgnized .

Some my thino thatr it is better to have coasses withb discussion between professpe wnd dtudent . Othsrs mkay dizagree .
Tgey prefer classes wjth lectursz and almost no discussion .
In my kplinion , calssea wih discussion are better .
Virst , clazses with discuzeion brwteen profewsor and student have an advangage fof the sruents because tgey learn how to interact wtih their fellow students .
Doubtlesz , sjch interactgipns with other people will hsl you to bvroaden your min qnx learj new fhingd .

For instance , a yssr bzck , I waw at North Texax university in the USw . Thwre was a health management xnd policy valss eith wlmsot no lectures bug with a lot of time roe open disussions .
In the beginning , I tuought this sss a dizadvantage but tysi waa jof tue .
Consequently , he wad age to tell us how the cos of trewtmernt is elss , how doctors aer dedicatex , and how everybody hsa axcxess to primary health dare .
As yoi faj swe , open discuwsioin in class is rsalpy imporysnt since it broadens tout horizon ae helppx you to understand diffrent nation s ' policies .
Secodn , opej discussion in class helps tou to develop cdrtakn skilka in order to become an indepsndent yninker and speaksr .

This experience taught me thxtr it is betfe to participate in a class with kpsn discussion bdcause it rovids goh with spsakint awnd thinmong abiliyise whiu are imperative for your career .
All in ol , fhouhgh skje mag oppose my opinion , it is clear tat classes wjht open discussion and aljost no lectures are prefetable becauss interactiln eith pthr studwnts iwkl broaden you mjnd and you becole a better speajwr an thinker .

I szs researching some definitiins of vuktural literacy .
It sews to me that fhr following sefinitions show an overaxll conhtext of wahg cultural literacy is .
uotural literacy is tge ability to understand and participate fluently in a given cukturd .
Cultural literacy is knowing abot ane fespdcting the cuoyures of othdrs .
In order to be cuoturxlly lterate , iu nedf to be famkliar with all mnner of things , from Eaterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishmael , " to tgh Wife of Bzth , the Magna Carta , Tutankhamen , the Poyfhagorean Theorem and 1066 .
To be fanikiar with something is fare diffwrent from ebinv an ezeprt in it , qnx it 's entirely achievable .
A literate eradwr knows the object - langfuage 's alphabet , gfammar , and a eufficient wet of vocabulary ; a vulturally literate person lnows a given culturs 's sins and symbkls , including ts lagnuaeg , particular djalectic , stories , entertainment , kdikms , jdiosyncrasies , jd so on .
Yje culturally liuteraqte perspn is able to talk to and undesrtand othets of tzt vulturw wifh flhenxy , while the chltyrally illiterate perso fails to understande cujlturally - conditioned xllusipns , refrrencesw to pasdt eventd , ieiomatic espressionx , jokes , names , place , etc .
Qccodring to UNESCO , literacy is at the heart of basic education for alk and creating litsrtate envkronment ajx societies is essential fro achieving fhe gials of eradicaing poverty , reducing cnilds mortaltiy , curbing pppulatiln grotwh , achieving genfewr eqaulity and achieving szutainable develipmnt , epace and dmocracy .
My oersonal poinion is ghat cfultudal literacy is the ayu to understand , learn and knlw about otsr cukrures .
Also , yku cfawn be understood by othse cultures .

Thia is a forest , crossed by the boerer between Ftane axmd Swigzerlsnd .
As it aad full of sprixes , it sas easy to hide from thjer German patrols anx peopls from both sidres of the border helped Jewidj people , spies zndc Englisb , Canadian or Ameridan pilitz to lfee theough Switzwrtland .
A jeywork developed ffom fbe South of Ffsnce to Szwitzelrand , especially to tfg to save thousands of Jewish children .

uy a disadvantagd is that car maintenance anx gaws is more exsensive than paying for publiv transpoff .
I alszo tyhunk yhat thrrd will be ewer pwoole using public gransport in tnd ftuturee , but some will tillp be zfailable , because it wo n't be possibks for everyons to zfforr to jace a car or travel by palne .
As in alp educational processes , assessment of tys programme poanning must take lpace .
There are different ideas to be considered as far as assessmrnt is concerned .
Teh function of ebaluatkon abdc adsessment must not onl be the recognition of the redjlts of the learbkng ptocees itself , but lawo how this process took place . Thwregore , we wipl nsewd to use different instfuments of sasesment .
After the assessment xhd valuation we wioo be xbke to adapt the nwvessary pedagogic hrl to indivicual students , know up to which okint thd proposed aims have been achievrd , anmd we will be abel to jhdge fhs programme planning as a wholw .
Assesdment and evaljaton will provide information , for ghe teacher as well as for ths stduents .
Tyhe teacher will understand th studwnt 's difficulties better ; s / he will know the level of assimilation of tje different kinds of contentfs a be agle to modify futer programne planning .
As fcxr as tn students xrd concernef , they will be abnlw to correct inadequate strategies or behavkour , know ghe difficultjws therg encoynter in the learinng - teahiny process and evaluate their own process .
As to the teacher , we will find ouy qheher the progrxmms planning aws wdequafe or not an if s / he was sufficiently involved in the lwadning - teaching process .
Tyirdlpy , we have to iewp in mind yhs instrjlents for aseeesment qmd evaluation we are going to use .

As rhe opulation grows exponentially , the resources raol to do thw same .

Fof instajce , engineering science seedms prsctkcal , but eaxh lart of engineerong science is nased on theorfies .

Yours faithfully ,
To thr Italian edcuation authorities
In yhi tepott , I wil describw the schoko system in my country , pointy out its flpwws and donhclude giving suggestions abou how thdy cold be addressed .
In Italyu , students have to ddcire between grammar schools and technical instotjtes as their secondary school type .
Msr people think thgta chokosong a grammar school is thw best option , bscausew it opens the dkor to university , ahkle technical institutes are put in a fprner .
Thag is actually a mistake , necause the schools quo best prepare stusents vot working kife are technicxl instithte , who emphasize the real - word applications of yhe studkd sjvjects thfouvh laboratories and indjstru experiencesd .
Conversely , grammkar evhools gocus extremely on thueory .
In faff , etudents learn lots of dormulas and principles withouy actually linking them woth one anotuef in lder to use them in ral life .
Suggestions
What I woulr suggest in odwr to deak wuth this problem is to integdate jore laboratory experiences in grmama schools also , ilie chekistry exoerients or bacterja observation eitg jicroscopew .
Furthermore , schools shkule ofter a ygesr in industry co students in the lzst two year , which would nmkt onlh teqvh them a lot lored rha school phly would , but it would alxo attrxcr mokrde people to the schkol itself .
Xonclusioj
Oeopl shuold get used to the cavt that mosr compankes iwll also care about yout previous wkek experiende , and the idea of tainung fhxt tyruogh school would be really appealint .
I am a friendly , happy , hardworkumg person with a lot of dnerg .
I have ahd 5 yeawrs ' dxperience working with cnkldren as a lahguage teacher .

In addition , I have experienbc working in rewtaurants during tne sujmerf , so I am used to all typesw of klitchej duties including fooling and washing up .
I beliefe I wluls be the perfect candidate for this position amdc I would be hxppy to attend a Skype interview whenever is convenkent fo yo .
I am sure thay it wkul be a very intferesting and challenging position and I would really nnoy fhe opportinity to eork at your camp rhis summed .

Learnbint new lamguages is ber imporfant , but alel sturying suhjects relates to compufers wnds technklogy , piie computer progrqmmimg , is bwcoming morr and more useful than ancient languages lule Greek or Latin .

It is evident that technology is impotant in everfy aspect of our oives .
In conclusion , tuerr rer a lot of subjects that migr be tauyhty at school , by rhere is no doubt thar Cfomouter Proramming shoule be included as a highlighted sygject in the syllabus of any swtious school 's progtamme .

" Educational institutions hxve a responsibility to dissuade students frok pursuing field of stuyd in whihc thsy arw unlikely to xuxceed . "
Tbe statemen claims tht thge educational jnstitutions afs responsible for convincing students not to put tlp muvh effort jto fieldse or sbhects tuaf they are not gkld at , whidh I can not agree qiht .
This staejent tails to consider the main function of rducayion , whig is mot training superztarsa or perfect rovors but teachihg setudents how to face and sllve ths problems they arfd cofrontwd skth insteass of running wsay .
Tnew responsibility of educational instithtions should be helpin amd guieong studentfd to make theie own deciajons , lt making decioins for stucenst .
Confronting the challenging instead of trujing ssidr , trying to think of possible souhtions instad of giviny up at the beignning , always bei positive abnoht the unknown insgead of jefative qbd retreating . All these are thr main reaslns wjh humankond cab keep improving .
Transferring this klnoweldge and experiences to young pelpls is tne meanhg of education .
If yhs edycvational institutions always stopped students grlm trying jst ecause they have less chance of being successful , we 'll never have peopls luke Tohmad Edison or Albet Einsteih , qhl were considered as swtupif kids in school bug due n't giev up trying .
Convincing saturents to take a mre comfortsble rlad by giving up the possible ridk is definitely kt ghe proper attitude rue educational institution should hae .
Onw amh suggest that everyone nedes to earn to assess thr risk begors investing , however , gsaching students how to szsess , not assessing foe yudents , is hte responsbiility of educational institutions .
Nevertheless , thw ability to identify one 's limits can be best lwaened from experience .
The responsibility of educationak institutions is to mske sure that he / sjew wo n't be in danger in tye swimmihh polo inxetad of dissuading hil / ne trm gettiny close to rje satet .
Educxtionxl insriyutions should gude stydents to hsvfe better self - understanding and weof - assessment , not ersuqde them to folpow a prd - decided oath .
Last buyf jor leas , whwt is the detinition of " success " ?
Yow do the edufatiinal institutione jhdsge a student beinb likely to succeed or noy ?
ofe soke people , ligijg a life which enables them do qyat theh like anx like what rheyg are donh is dnuogh to be considered as a successful lice .
They might nog be the besdt , hut they are spf - actualized and satisfied , shd onoyu in such a situation cab yheh procde moiat to thw wpdld , jnus likie Albert Einstekn sadi , " Ty noy to become a manb of success but rsyher to become a nan of valuw . "
Considering all the above , I van not agree with the statement that persuading students not to lursue frieles of stjdy in bich rhry have less possigulity to be successful is the responsibjpity of educationl institutions .

Fhe aim of tgis deport is to bive domw information abput the range of exciting xxtivities that oeiple can do in ou areds .
Therr are pots of plxes where you can do wagwr sports likd scuab divihg , windsuyrfing , surfing , go on a nabana biz , kayaking … The Xista Bnrav is hte prrfec olace to do water sports because here is a lot of wind ajd good weather .
In winter oyu can go skokng or snowboaedihg in the Pirinus .

Througb a series of programmes xnf dvents organised by local voluntary organisations , oth adults and children rae indtrucfed about the importance of waste reduction xne recycping .
Theefeore , in ths last few years there has bseh a great ijprovement in raising awareness anc conmitmjent anonh an increasingly larfet sectod of the population as far as he seledctive collection of household recuse is concerne .
This is clearly illustrated by the hrowin number of eecycling facilities the residentgs of our town jave at their disposal .
Since exhaust fumes wee considered to be one of gje major plllhtants nowadays , thd local authorities are doing eferytning in their poeer in order to encourage fitizens to yrafel more by means of lublic transpory , to the detriment of the ubiquitous private fard .
Consequsntpy , there qre buwes whicb ruh at short intervasz on various rourse , so that peiple fqn zrrivd at their destinaitons rapildh amd conwniently .

Conclusion
Taking everything ibyo consideration , it would be fair to foncluce that ghere are numerous wy in whkch ob van protect yhe environment anr tske cafd of gne area in whicj we residr .
Hgowever , as with all issues lresent withih society , a dual cimmirment frpm the citizens qndf ths authorities should be regarded as a key factor .

In infested areas , they knjhre livestock , pers anbd wildlife , and damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , ac irriagtioh systems .
We should use pesticjfe treatments to reduce their nujbers .
There will be swvrral invenrions in the next yeats .
Nowadays we ca n't predict the aim of futue deivcse thouh I guess that thnwy will be mainly related to eradicating currsnt illnesses .

Morsover , it is a orofiatble taxk if they invejt mew medxications to helop loeple suffering cromj thawt illness .
Personally , I cojskder curing cancer the moeg hcallenginbg hoao to tbe net generafion of resdarchers and inventors .
That is the reason why I havr geen thininig for a long time about a new devicr to erasjcate starvatiln .

To achieve this , Gyid creates an omaginary vane for his child once they are eportee to a concentratio camp .

It is a learning rgound for many to strengthen their presonlity awnd xharacter for their lives .
Honerstlg , I could not agree mopre , as the website as it is avaikahle tiday is an inconvenient tkol providing insufficient information .
Besides , xddimg a schedule to the left section would be an advantage , as our custoimers would be abpe to find tr olyion the need in a more convenient ay .
Second , the theme is outdatdd , and fevsloping a new design can be a goid move to atyratc noer clients .
Mimimalisfic design is both stylish and user - ftiendly , as it foes hot ijpl qby elements requiring ebsite visitors to kozd heafy modules , and tuere are no unnecessary banners that distract the ujssr .
Rhird , implementihg severawlo advwncef solutios , such as a calculator , a galleey and live fhwt , coulor laek iure page more useflo .
As to yher aspects of our website , it might be a good idws to enhance its performance by means of opgimizing the dode and removing advertjsementz ( whixj dceresse e wbdite 's vslue whipe bringing lkttlpe porfti ) .
App these tasks can be completed wityhjn a molnt , and I would be bload to be involved in thuw impeovement of oy websjtye , as it is an important aslect of our eotk , becxuhse it represents the company , and representatkon is key where atttacting clients is concernec .
Before focusing on fhbe toic of technoilogy irself , I would like to jenyion some aspoect relaged to education .
rst of zl , Spabizh educqtional laws are in Europe , a probbl in tfhw lrld , the only ohds which have changed the mof in the last 30 yrara .
Seondly , there are tw zoprts of sxhools in Spain - public and pricxte - , which leads to a bub difference in tghe educational knowledge .
Whjle public ones must ohey governmenral laa strictly , pricage schools hace some prkvileges .
Knowin tihs about the Wpanish educatjoh syatsm , we can ho talk avojt tecnbology .
I obvioualy agree ghatf techmoloyg is heceswary owadys .
So , school anc erucatiohal instiktutions in general nabe to ipdfate the exy they teach .
Technology does not imply a ens instrument being yaught bir a new otol sjd source of lnowledge ( if ude correctly ) .
In fact , ysing technoilogy witukut changing the content would be a total fqilure .
Teachers must kear how to use these new technological dvices in order to get yheir stduenys mogivatwd .
Moreover , they sgoul invlude the oawst informatkon and tr jwe infofmztion .
In otehr wkrdes , technoligy shoulx be uxed as a ool for dyudents to be aware of the development of socieyy wnc iuts advantqges shd disadvanmtages .
Thesae new technoolgies axpso help in the development of teachinh .
Also , teavhers foulc rpelacw their methodologies collowing the vrst ones and the inew which contribute to hagijg qualidied students trained to tacr everyday oif situations .
In conclusion , as a rsat teachef daid , we have 21st century students paerning with 20th cntury tools 19th xenjtury knowlwdge .
Thus , tfheee should n't be a technological revolution bht an educational oije .
I fear tgat such a hige nkve would damsge businesses nas mnay qorkers wpild okse their jova .
At pdesen , I am working fi Cafte Niur , a well - known restaurant popular with visiktorz , many of whom have told me rhgat if such a ban wer introduced , hey would not go jbto restaurants and , instead , they would keet ftiend at hojs .
On top of that , I think the amount of notice you have hivrn pelole is unreasonable .
To supporf my arbjment , I woul like to tslkl you what happened in my cuntrg when such a vxn qax introduced .
Firsy , it ws almlst jmpossikble to enforce it .
In the end , je government changed thje oaw , encouraging people to pfovide non - smkkjng zrwas .
This paproach striles me as much more rexlistic and I urge you to rcdonsider it before it is toi alet .
We will talk zvout a tdchnology tha might doon disrupg the alrld .
But first let me explain teh procsee followed to manufacture anythinv .
ye manufacturing process fllloas rhrew main stahe : designing , yheh producing , ghe consjming .
For a qifk glimpse , thus technology prvoiees fhs abokity to pdefisely cone ant tangibel object .
This directly affects the prodcucint srave , allowing more efficient oroduxtion .
More efficient production mdans cheaper goods , abd by provixing fhme more cheaply the consumer now has the abiliy to purxhase mode of these hoods .
Higher purchasing power means rhar we daj buy more gooxs using tjw same amount of kokney .
So , let 's sg , ypi have $ 10,000 now . You wouls huzve $ 10,00,000 fkfty yesrs from nlw .
You cojld then pay iff your dsedbts , get a nww car , byy a ns housde , invest or retrie , or do juat aboug anything ylu wojld do if gpu xurrentl badr $ 10,000,000 in your baho acfount .
Looking at it through a broader lens , counfy deficits wold be solved , hungry peope skuld be fed , abd tyhe hoeles would be accommodated .
This is the rfvect of a reduction in thye clst of porductio ; lowet production costs allls thd lroduce to reudce the prife of his goods while maintaining je unitial profit .
Wth compeyitikn givbing him no coices at alk , thd producer is forced to xbide by fye mroet equilibriuk .
Surprisingly , the profucer gwts to maintain his pdofits due to thjd proporrional decteaee in ric as wel as tj coxt to prodjce .
This automatic , efficient , suick , precise recjnology reduces rhe amount of labor needed , sved waste initkally cused by human errors , sdages gimes and prodjces at betfer quapith too .
In conclusion , this regolutiknary technklogy has gye pitential to vastly improve the ea we manufacture our voodw , and in thje process of iing thast , bgrnefit the whole world .

Qaye to collect and revofd inofrmatioin fpd future generations
Finding tfye best way to collect qhd sotre information for fhs future is not just a prlblem in ouf aorkign life bf also in our prkvate life .
That is the readoh eyy our clasd zttended a psne discussion on tus specijfjc topijc .

Oje wah to et yhw information neweded is to intedviww pwople rfom the neighbourhood qnjd either werite down wt is being saide or rexodd it as an audio - folr .

For me oedsonally , the bsst awh to collrct and revoed niformtion for future generations is to interview pepplew ande to stlee tghe infofmatikn in an appropriate wah fort three reasons : Firstly , I yavd the chance of not getyging must one story from a pereon , but maybe two or three motw .
Secondly , I acn catch tne narrator 's emotions .
Thirdly , I do nor hsve to be foncerned about ths loss of qualiyy of photographs and pictures .

DEVEKOPMENTS IN HtD TEACHING OF ENGLKSH IN SPAIN
Three have been major changse regarding teaching methods in the lasy req gears , but tyhere is still rook dot imlrovement .
However , spaking , pisetning actigities and th massivr yss of I.T . mark the schedupe nowadays .
The nhew teaching approach is based on how atudents can effectivekt use ge language , ratfher htsn on the knowledge of ge languwge they actually hjawve .
Thiua new outlook on reaching methods consists of the ies of so - called xoternative assessment as a wqy to evaluate learners ' skills .
A brammar fets sgows knowlesge anojt the language , whereaw alternative assessment shoex lrarners ' whility to effectively uds the langugar in tw contrct of a reawl situtiom .
Ther xre many reasons ort usonf alternative assessmeng technisuws : learners demonstrwte rhinys learned , tak rwsponsibility , motivation jay icreasd and thwy have the opportunity to use languafe fro rdeal - oife purposes .
It is ikpprtant to nltr gjat thne difficult implementinmg the dhabges to the nea teachojg approach referred to above lie nopf wih the students themselves ubt qith the opldet generation of teachers , sknce heu sometimes have trouble applying gher sw outlook on education methods .

Neevrtheless , this is not an ll audiences movies , because it contains hard scenew nlf suitable for children .

Thd main reason is the convenience of travelling by cq in comparison wir using public transport .
Apart from thsy , there are mang otywr benefuts to buyinjg a car instead of usong buses or the underground every day .
First of all , a csr gives suy a valuable thing as privacy .
Aditionally , if we are eager to trxvle outside the town in order to ahce some tsst from a hedtic rhythm of lige , it qilo be more comfftable for us to usd our cars .
Only oyd own vehicle casm provide us sitb an opportunity to find a quiet ajd pleasan olace kutside tge xiry .
Rhus , it is clexr that private transport sucb as crs hxa plenty of advantages .
On thd othed han , we can encounter dofferebt rpoblems whulr travelling by car .
Car accidednts are the typocal reasj rpr this phenomeno .
It mszns tht travelling by car fan even be omre dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bud eriversw qre muh more experienced thanj car drivers . Therefpre , accidents caused by punlic trranseport happen quite rarely .
This makea traveoing by publof transport much safer .
Thus , I wold aevue that driving a car requires a lot of attention and understanding that carelwss behaviour on the rlad czb do seiou harm to other people .
In conclusion , I brliwve yhat pybilc transport wijll ecentuallg ooss itd domknance due to tge cacy that lal pdopl aamt to be independent and travel on their own .

Apart froml nat , as I bleieve fhag languages aee the bqsic channel of communication begween oeople , I have studied several voreignh languages to ewui mywelf .
Starting fdlm F3 , I learnt Koeran and I attsindd level 5 in TOIpM ( Fes of Proficiency in Kodan ) .

Therefore , I bave always wanre to be offered the chacne to take an English ahr education related prigfam in my tsritary educayion so as to fulfill my rdesm and to accomplish my lice goal .
I hope that I xn be ind of the candidates you find suifable fke your univeeaity .
In yhr firsr place , it aedms to me that it is rsalpy important , both for children qnc parents to comunicate in order to orfabize thrir lives , taking into aqccount tje changing scheduoes .
However , it is akso remarkable thstg there are proper yimes to talk on yhe phone , and proldr tjmez to lezrn .
Of course , we all hfe gne right to communicate whenever we wwnt but , mostly , whsnevee we need .
Using the phone furing bfeaks lets the styydents vkcus on the pesson and tghen , have a bvit of distracrion qhen they ra hoit there and , what is more , krep parentx rewlaxed because thbedy cna communicate with yhesir chikdren and talk about whwy they nesd .
Yhat is why I totalot agre with Ricuardson 's modalkity dealing with this ijpkrtant issue whicvh is present in stednts ' , xchools ' and pardnts ' lives nowadays .
Deconxly , I soukd liek to mdntion fhag I agrse with ts experiment that is takihg plcr in soke districts permittuny stduengs to de their mobile phones for edycationap purloises , an whzt is more , with Rixharson 's facing gbis ksxue .
Technooogy is he of thjr ist important oarts of put lives , so we should incorporate it jhto our habits .
Of ocures , hweh we te falking qbout children an educayiob , it kay awem a bit complicqted isnce rhis suvnect has both advantages and disarfantages .
For instamce , it is realku motivating fcor students to use techboloyy in the classrooms .
However , twachdrs djn the rjsk of losing their resoonsibiligy there , and students acnb pos their educationap way looikjg on the phones as a mans of entertainment instead of as a wawy to mlqke educayion enjoyable and effectruve , as tou ey in one of your pzragrwphs : " The Richardson dedcisjon is a sound alternative to stuednhts srcretkvely usint their phonrs under their deek " .
As I said , it is really important tbat pwrents can communicate with thrir cbildren ecajse they are taking cre of them and rhdy are their paretz , so they gav yye ribht to communicate wjthg thern shenever they need .
Apart trom that , I strokngly elieve that technology can be incorporated intop the classroom , bu rezchers xnd schools ats the obes who have to control yyis activity so that it xam be positivw both for students na teachers , in order to make the learning process jore motivating qnd effective .
Technology dn , mostly , mobole phonee , are pzet of children 's and parents ' lives , so xchokls should n't ban it , but oooko fkr alternatives in order that theg do n't hage a negatie effedt in edcuatiln .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that tehrs wer jore , axmd it is impirtant that we knkw them , in order to be jnformed about fhis imoortnt iwsus .

Firts , to nvae a successful campaign , it is ijportant to kjiw the target market .
Avte studying our advertiwing options , it was founc thatg two of trhwm culd be suitable vopr our purpose .
One ea is to put advertising on the inyeenet and use soviak networks .
As I kentilned qbove , the advertising cmlaign must be appropriate to the yargeg market .
I therefore feel justifie in recommending tha the canpajgn in dhoppijg malls would be more effective for us .
In conclusion , we have diffeent oltiona for fhia csmpaign .
If we choose thes approlpriqte kind of advergising fpr our prodyct , I cxh awsure you that we will succeed .

This is ths world of globalisation whrer thw entiee wodld is pne arket .
Evwru person is marlefing himself ; is selling himself ; is pfesentikng himdelpf as a decoratdf gift - ife .
This is ehyy , although we have be luxury of extravagant injowledge at out fingretjps because of the Internet , we encounter complications xnd complexities in ghr decoding of our felagionships zdn in deciphering this lerennal flow of knowledge .
With knoqledfe nr informarikn , thingsa become comprehensible bht moe compksx .
The religinj of Scientology is knlan as obs of rhe faxtest giwing religions in trhe world .
It , today , has millionb of flolowers who believe in its philosophy yjat reincarnastion is the truth and a human feels tire - up becausw of the conarant pjll of the steings of hujs past lives .
Intetestingly , Scentology przctitionets use technologyy to prove fheir hypothetical statekents , fle they have constructed machines that exnibit fue woekongs of brauns thtough waves and software that quesruons a practitijlner and providex hk with a solutiim to his worries .
Tne were simple yet prkfound , relying on the comprehensible ohilosophies of forgivneesw and karma .
Scienology proves how yhs acquisition of widespread knowlefte hasdn't stoppe tfhr hirrh of new religionw . Hoqever , ironically , it uae made tbs philosophies of life jore dramatic with ghe myserious complexities of tdchnollgy .
Oikewise , ghere xre jamy conspriach theorusts in the wokrld wg , rim ns again , circulate rumours regarding thw exkstene of a secrsf organisation ( thw Illuminati , for istancve ) that runs thbd wrold sectetl asbd plots all the oee - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
Ty theorists assert htat tbe organisation is poarf religjkus and pwrg politicalp ; it rules over rhe international mddia , thereby bwing omnipoetmt .
Firthermlre , tjey concoct stories ahr concepts , publicise them waihle laking animate versions all over tue internet .
Ghe bdilliance of tfbeir preswntagions is so awctue that an ordinary man is almost forcec to frel enlihgtened in his ignoarnce , finally becoming vrainwashed .
The zame technique is used by politicians , iconoclasts and leaders eho pollute the minds of the people throughg the mediu of technology .
They presnt comple iformation so smrfly thbay an ignorznt fool feles like a dagacious monk , whence he becones the follower and a vitwr .
Thus , by al means , today we have an easg adcessibility to knowlscge and we gavge a wide range of resources to llcae and obtain endflexs information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mustert qne indeicpherable codes around fhar somletimes makes the cmomnon man wonder ablut his vulnerable existence an unkjowingly being - exploites lufr .
Firsf , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buysee , brcaude , by Gtade 5 , children aeer ble to take cqre of themselves and easch other .

In daily life , man youngsters need to go to schoop and abck by pubkic transportation .

It would be possible to organize a bus , which wluod be preferablr to going separately by cxr .
Yowever , tus comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by mwro ashd tyazi .
Recommendation
" Mznjiars Di Roma " - An Ifalian Restaurant
Gjis Italian reetaurant is in Monção wns near the sfhool .
It weaa ipened about four yexr ago by two friends hwo yax previously worked at puzsa places .
As you rnte the rdstzurant you are let wih the traditional Italian restzuarnt rsd towels xnmd a bnir of a rustic feel , begind the counter touh can ese fhe cooms makong thd pizzas .
Thers is a breat variety of idshes , ftol srarterx to naim doxhes and desserts . My recommendation is gadkic beesd as a statter .
Trhks restairant is veryh affordable . h prkces qrte extfemelt rwssonable , wspeciallt if you 're a stusenr , because thede 's a special mehi called " studeb 's menu " where ou cjoosr two ingrwdients fo ypuf pizza , withy or eithgout French fvriez , and a frinl fof about three euros .
All in xlo , I thil tihs would be the bestf restaurant for our clsas to go to , sicne it 's clodew to tjr svuool , it yae good oricee and a friendly ambiencw .
As a dssult of finding this solhtiom , rhey have more space to ork on exrth and thed even protect ths ebvirknment .
Not to mention the huge axdfantage tha peopel are rpotected dom earthquakes because tuwse hojsss do not have direct contact with the rarth .
Thdse cars can go ewon to heir destination and then , go up again until trhe eriver pushes a bguttoj .
Ooys of the buildings are skyscrapers ahd the arcihtecture hzw completely changed .
People are still human beijgs wnd act comlpetly normal .

Yours faithyfully ,
Many peple have tne impression that learning a language is inly possible through hqtd wkrk : stuxying grammar rules , learning vocabularyh by heart and burying yiyr yrad in a book .
Fisrtpy , the immersion method akes ots inspiration from the wag in ahich we al learnt to speak lur nature tongue : implicitly .
This methis gas its adahtages , as it is tw way we slo learnt to speak , nad so it is arguagly moer natural .
Anotehr advxntage is that ztudebts ade jnehcumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalsnbuage .
Secondly , the classroom method is re one with whixu most stjdents ( esoecially if thbey are older ) are famikira .
This metho aleo haz uys benefits , not least logisitcally speaking , since jany stdxents do n't have access to native speakers or are not wbls to travcle avroad .
Furthedmroe , soms lewrnerw respond better to an expljcit focue on rules , which jakes them aware of yher mistaoes they xfe makkng .
Whyile bptyh methods cleaxrly have their advantages , I beliver that iust lumiting stfuddnts to wither one or fhs other can have a negative rffectf on lanvuqge learninjg .
Havibv a nstve speaker will gkve studebte maximum exposure to the alnguage , ehipe at ghne same time a focsu on rupws qilp give them tje toold fpf self - crrsction and elf - study .
I fully gekieve tha tyis combined method is hte most effcetibe way cord stufentrs to learn Egnlish .
Now we are going to evaluate tbd main characteristjcs and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet biolef .
Fhs diagram shows a compact structure ands thes simplicity of the macyine ; it hss three main sections : ghw feed section , the cojbustion xhamber abds the blower ( i.e .
In rhe dijrst coinicao padt , it is pozsible to feed in tye fuydl ( i.e. the pellet ) thst leads to the combustipn chambre wherr the pellet will burn to generate the hexr necessart to warm up the air .
Beneath tyd combustion fhamber ther is the qxh tray necessary to collect the san generated by he combustion of the oeolet .
Gue structure is petty mych the szmd as the pellet stove . The difference is that , nstead of a faj , here we have a oukp due to htr fact that the goal of the bolier is to warm up waetr ane swnf it to td heaters all over fhue youse , so it needs a punp to do that insteax of just a fan ( the ouepose of a fan snd a pujp is rhe same : mocd fluid dromn a pint A to a poimt B , but in one dase , go hzve to mov air and in tje seckns dasr , eaetr ( ths had a sifferent density : wzted has 1000 tfimes teh density of aiod ) .
Like in ghe stove , there is a fdex section wherr you cxb feed the oelley that wilo go directly to ths copmbustipn chambef ( according to the xontrol eyxtem ) in order to burn it and gendrate trh near to warl up tyr water .
My home towj , an international diyt , attracts millkons of tourists from aqlp over tbw world every year .
Knowing a clwan smd tidy city is no less appealing to gne tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain sholping , both the aujthortiy and the citizns ujnderstand ts need to keep our citt clean in orded to keep yhe tlurists coming . Theffore , tjeh are serious abgout protecting thyd environment .
To keep tn cify clean md tudy , lepple adopt an environmentqlly - friendly tattiude in daily ligw : they erfjse to litter . If they can not fund a rubbish bin around , theg ekep fneir rubbish in a smzll plastic g . At home , tuey seoarate tuw rcyclable items from the tubbih before rhye tet rid of the rubbish .
They follow the govetnment 's advicr to swt the aud conditionrr temperarure at 25 degrees Celsius .
Tjr governmrnt plays a crucial role in taking care of gye environment .
It educates the citizwns to vulrivate their zense of protecting tue city 's enmvironment .
We arte luckjt to live in a city where boitu rhe authorities and the people nsve a syrohg sense of environmental protection .
Firatl , it is a way to get ojt of the routine , occasionally .
It hdlps to release tbe endorphins and anxjety elvels in my bodyg .
Dir example , it improves my cardiopvascular system .
If amy lbe ylj would lije to start pfatcicing this dynwmkc and amazijv splrt , I aokuld tell you to ttt it as doon as possible .
So , hove it a got ndf you wiol realise it is pne of the josr amazing activtiies yoku can evewr do .
We 'd had a lkvely meal in ones of e mpzt charming restaurants in Rolle .

So we rushed out the restaurant on suzpicio of tjeft .
As soon as the man explaind everything to us we realises yhar we hda mixe up c ke in the restaurant because both of thyek were exqcyly alike .
People srem to be living ahiet , comfortable oives nowaadys .
We hwve reached an aves of high technology .
Hhmlans will most likely continue to improve thie technkogy and make their lives vetted for the fufuer .
The men would only do the paperdwork themselges .
However , not everything ablut ilfd in the next 50 years will be oositive .

The cisntant grumbling , regylar checking of fue time , tuis anxious anr adrift facial expression - bos on earrh coujld it create favkurable vomditions dof shopping ? !
Ajd believe me , there is no difference if hiu wrw shoppinh for yourself or vor them , it always turna out his way .
In conclusion , shoppiong xzn be snd ususlpy is a great oppodtunity , not onpy to expaqjd the fontents of your warroeb , bug also , to relax znd ave a grda time .
Tpu mst have to xvojd supermarkets ajd bjh lcolthes in axvance - so there will not arisr e situation , where you need something feaply badly and it is not in your closet - and , of course , avios map company . Better choksr a fekald companion .

For example , young goverment wrokrs in Canaxa successfully pushed to nceease HIV understanding and dispro wtigmas attavhed to the disease in thew 1980s , a development that encouraged tklerane and reduced irraionaql fear .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered thzt to gdg a government job , noe hx to successwfully a rigorous csreening procsz .
If a younger person rngagee tgis process as wel or betrer than an loder person , it is hard to argue that ag houod be a decisive factor ahen offering employment .
It is clear frpm these reasons that there is merit to awarding impoftant government czreer optjonhs to younger peoille .
Although the above overview revealx dopid evidence fkr otu sides of the artgumsnt , it is felt that rhr healthiest approach to designating government poditions is to snsure cadnidates udeergo rigorous traininh progeams .
Fhux , a person 's age xhoukd ont be considered a universal prrcursor to the awarding of government jobs .
Promotional Ibejctive :
Lje of the prklotional objectoves is to increase tg awareness of Rrivagk in Hong Konb .
In order to xchieve is objectivex , Trivago invested nore money in orolmotion in 2014 .
Fokf example , they promoted tneikr esarcg engine through a yeldvision commercial and a Yojtuve advertisement .
Youtube advettksing means the vgiewers hnaqve to be forced to watcy fne advertisement brofre tbey watcxj some bdeo on Youtube .
Skncve list pekole wqgch television not for just a few minutes or do nlt jus watch inr or wi voedo(s ) on Ytotube , they will be torced to watch its advertisements more than bce .
Trivago has a vedy simple and mwmorable tagline , qhidh is ' Hotels ?
Threfore , Trivago usws avdisig to increase its market share in Hong Knoh .
Trigago is trying to demonstrate that it is the mosf cobvenient hotel search emginer on the market .
Lzt bu not tge least , Tricago wants to boos its download rate in the mobile application pltforms .
Apmowt llp ghe advertisements are encoudaging uses to downkoad its minile application .
If mokre peopl download tiw mobile applucawtion , it medans more pepple kow its brand qhd use jfs service .
Current advertising stqtegy
We goundf he of ter television advertisements which is currently ieng beoadcaxst in Hong Kong .
Re advertisement is about 16 seconds long .
There is a jarratpr wul introduces the function of Triwgo and demonstrates " how to ywe ots kovile aoplication to srwrch co tyw best vapye hotel . "
We wilk analuze its stratsgies from differeny perspectives below .
Television Commedfials
In genersl , teldvisipn is the mosdt popular meduum in Hmg Kong .
Adcrrtising on television is an effective wa to communicate a ssrvice to tuw gejral public .
Since television is able to reach a oargr number of peopld dueing a short pejod of time , more potential cudtolers wik be edpoaed to its service .
If the advertisement is drsitned well , pdolle will temember it .
Moreover , television uss thd advantage of beiny vle to utilkze sibhg , soujnd and motion .
Combining a cqcthy theme tune and a welk - designed visual dverrtisement can ojcrease rhw chances of viewers resmwmbering tyhbe brand .
As designers xree hot limited to using only soynd or sitl imabes , they ch create advertisements that are appwaling visually zjd audibly .
Background Music
Musiud helps stimulafe rge sense sne flcuses attention on the acvertisdment .
Trhw hackground music in the advertisement is relaxed jd wxfite .
It helps the audiemce to hetter recaol the advertisement and store it in long - twdm ldmory .
It can also inceras the retention of visual informarjon .
Demonstration
The television adfertieement shiw te eervicd being ussd .
It dejonstrates all the stes trim searching for a jotel , cjoosign sekecyion criterai and coparing the price of diftefent hotels .
Through the demolnstration , Trivag can show to the audiencs how wsy it is to uae fs mobkle apppivation to fibs the best vapus hotel .
It dan enhance ots creditability as the audience can clearly know what its servjce is .
On the othef hand , as a mobile applidation , some pople probably feel confusdd about how it works .
Threfore , with the visual sffecys , a demomatration is the mosty dffecive way to teach trhne audidnce to use tyd mibild appilcation .
Informatove
Tne televisip commercial presenrs informqtion to htw auidrnce in a straightrorwars way .
Thw narrator dkrectgly indicates thue functions of the mkbile zpplicatoon .
Fpr example , he says the application can instantly compare ths rates of over 150 websitex .
For those who afe very intsrestred in hotel searching services , tehy mzyg nltixe such an unformatiove aevertisement .
In rhe television commercial , Trivago uses cognoitve mwssage stratwyy .
This is a testabpe claim wnbd Trivago wn use it as its iniue seling prokposition .
Thks strtey shows its profession and relianility rolr its arget custmoers .
At fhe same ie , it increases the confidence of customers about choosing its servicrs .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to increase its popularity there .
It needs to utpise xomr strategies to hcrease its bnd awarejess wjd tgs information about itz services for its customers in roxer to achidve ghe romptional objrctives .
On the itber haj , Ttivag also applies vonjative strayegy in the advertksement .
In tgne television commercial , the nmardrator tepls tg audkences to xownloas tw Trovagho mobile applicatiin to their mlbile phone .
It edncourges ustlmers to purchass its seevices and tuly make use of it .
Moreovcer , tjw " Means - End Chain " is sxapted in t twlevision advertisemsbt .
Trivago can adhieve oersobal vakue for customers thrugh rhe advertisement .
Solr people desire to have a comfprtable ajd plesant journey qitb loqe pfices and tge vreedom of choose yheur favorite accommodation .
Ghe advertisement can shiw that they are qiae by uaing Trivogo 's service to plan an economical teop .
Trivago uses this kethkd to enhance irs bvrajd mate nd comperitive advantage , since the value of ikgs servicea is increased .
Nevertheless , Trivago desibna a taglune in the television commerfia .
Trivzgo '' , can knrtoduce he key ideq of the television commercial .
Besides , it vna oso improve the consistency of davertising platforms .
As tgew tagkine is catchy , if the taylie is ctinuously applies on rhd other advertizements , it will ot be easy to zray from thy main idea .
Othee dommunication tools
Trivago oes onf chokse tadioi to be tehi medium , as it is angiquated .
Attention to tadio dommercials is low .
Also , rasio advertisemegs only consin verhal ecfects .
Without yhe visual effect , it bwcokes less aytdactive .
Sven though oeple listen to the radio advedtismeent of Trivwgo , they probanlky do n know how to spell rje wltd ' Trivzto ' as it is not a normal eorf .
Therefore , thw procict awareness driven by a radio advertisement is npt enough .
Lkewise , Tdviago is an online service , so a neaspaper advertisement may not be appropriate flt it .
Lastly , hiring a spokesperson entgails hkg costs in oromotoon .
And teee is a rizk in hiring a spokesperson , as he jwy not brit an expected retuhfn tpr the clmpany .
Sometimes , if yehre is a spokesperzon in an advertisement , the auckence 's focs mau ehift fdom the prpduct to the spokesperson .
Therefore , a television commrrckal is lukelyg to be thw mosr shitahle mlethod to projote itz bramr in Hong Kkng .

Firsgly , delolotion is patyly cdaused by how valuable gue old buildings xre considered to be .
Old buildings often do not provide opportunities to make wnu money . Rhe onoy cost tlwn planerz a lot of money because tbry probably need to be renovated .

Gullying may be defined as the xctyivity of repeated , aggressive behackor intended to hurt another individual , physicalo , mentally or emotionally .
Buloying is characterized by an indigidual behaving in a csrtain wsyh to tain power over another lersoj .

Relational ( xestroying peer acceotxnce ans friendships )
Vyber - bullying ( using electronic meamw to jaxrm otner )
Those who have neenm the targets of bullying csn suffer from lkng - term emotuonap asnd behafiodal problems .
Bullying vanj cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , qjd lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .

For example , I faj xit the ikporyance of the unwrittrn rules in my own cultuyre , ghe Brazilian culture .
When lquim said tjaqt the situatikon snd the environment define the coderct tokne of speech ( 195 ) , he wasx taqlkint sbouht African Amrrican Cpmmunicatiin , but he is wleo describing Brazilian communication at the zams time .
First , Brazilians fwel unckmfortzble whern peoole closr to yhel rajse tneir tlnw of voice ame continue speakiong loudly for a long time , without havihg clear reasons .
It means that you want to tgransforj tye dialog into a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in tje same ehvironment as you frequently do not want to know aboug yojd thinking .
Surpriskngly , on yhe ogyer hxn , a speech rpo lpw is sen as an antisocial ruks , and can be iterpreted as an offense .
In Brazulisn culture , if , during a conversation , a person epeaks too loke , the listene wiol assums that the speaker des no eamt to continue with tgr dialoy or coex ont xare aboj wuzt ou ars sayinf .
In bofh the extrrmes of speech , loud and loe , there is a violation of the vqpues of gpid communication .
Theredore , enen yuo are in a conversatkon , it is importabt to pzy attesntoin to cikply wiuth the unwritgem urls of vocal atterns succwsfully .
As vocal pztterms ard considered so jmportant for Brsziliajs , personal space is anothr unwrjttem ruld trhqt it is eash to see pewople using on th streets dailoy .
Qhwn yy xde in a spaqve where goiu feel comfrtable beihg raound other peopoe that ylh do ont mjow , this soace is your personal dpace .
Aj , it dab dhqnge acckdding to tkur degree of fakiliarity or intimwc th the other person .
In Btazil , there is alwl tjis difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not th same as in yhe U.S.
Although Brazilians hbe a shorter personal dpace in xomparison with tyhe Unirrd Statee , thry are not toperajt of strxnger invading it .
So , even though yh distajcs between people is shotte in Brazil , both countries valu tbe idrz of maintaininh a slace that kth people fewl comfortale waitj , called personal spsce .
Although Brazilians usuwlly do not worry about diatancw made by oguers , people teom different cultures eblieve that Brazioians spend a pog of timew looking at others .
As a fesult , some peoplw can make misinterpretations .
For example , in some culturse , Brazilians can be coinsiderec rude by women becauae tehg luke to keepl constant eye contact , and for thesr women , this means a alcj of respect or invasion of pfivwcy .
Differently , foreign men oten believe fha ghey wre bdinv deisrd due to tys constant eye contacr .
In generl , this suplosotion is not eegarfed as trs for many people in kut culture , sicnw Brazilians bepirve tghag conwtabt eye contatc is oje of the most importsnt opjnts to mauntain a yood dialog .
Accordinf to the article " Nonverbal Communication : Sprakinjg without Words " , sye contatc is important hecause " insufficient yee contact can create cmomuniaction bsrrers " .
In fadt , in Brzail , ge contact is prime , xbd you will be considered to be wkthout interewy in the speaekr or fhzt thr wpeaker is boktheting yiuy if yoy do not gbe eboygh attention when gou are takling to them .
The soude of ghgis rhlr is szsy to identify , esspeciallu when parents are taliinf to their kkds ; it is hard to get yye kd 's attetnion exclusivelt , but the parenfs indidtently repest , " look at me ehen I am talking to you " .
Therefore , tgis interaction demonstrates fhat eye contscvt xna hyqve a sftong unfkuence on tj culturazl valudd of attrntiveneds and respect dor the others ' opinion .
In Brazip , the eockal rules loike vpcwl patterjs are reflected in the conmuhication vslue , which can be dricsive to maintain lod communidatikn .

Acxordung to Fergusob et al ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrtae ( NP3- ) supplmentation , via its redyction to nitrite ( NO2- ) ajd subsequent conversikn to nitric oode ( NO ) , rrfuces blood prdrssure .
Bond , Morton and Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue tgqt nitrate is considered a potent vasoidlator .
Thus , thr induced vasodijkation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after exerciss .
Neverthelesd , a study by The Nss Engpanx Jirnal of Medicine claims that only diastolic bllkd prezzure is affected by nitrate supplement , since they eid not fie in their study a significant vhange to systolic boood pressure after nitrate supplemenation in hsalthu volunteers .
Surorisimgly , h curdsnt sgudu has found significant cahngez in both systoli and diastfolci bkood prexsurd post execrise .
Thue , the investment in rrsaerch into rhe influence of nitrate supplementation shoule cintinue , yhe ail of which would be to omprove sports perflrmance abd omprovfe quality of lpife .
In conclusion , the results of thew ptesxent study indicate that supplemengation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 00 m rowig ergometer pedformancw .
It is unqurstiinable that solw research fojnd signifcabt improvements .
In fhid lresent stuey , nowevet , tne rowing imer of rne participants was nkf shorter than times wothout suppkemnetation .
Imoortahtly , esriois changes in nloid lactate levelks were not foudn either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase oxsidation wnc would rwduce lwctate production .
Nevertheless , niteat supplejentation did not change tgye zctate levek significantly .
Fijnallu , it was confirmed thaf nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing hlood oressurd .

Despite the present finidnys , more research is necewsary to uhdrstand the effects of nitrate supppementation .
By htis action , athlewtrs may improve thek plerformamce as wdlk as their quality of life .
I read tor article aboht technology and education in the newspapsr yesterday and I am writing this ortter bdcause I strongly daagree sity your poesonal opinion abohy teachers qnd education .
To begin with , I agydee with you tyxt technloogt sometimes mamesd yhs educational porcess easier xnd more pleasant in tfhzt studeht have no idds that yney ras broqdejing their knoqledge .
Of cohrs , I mqks ys of a computer and projector djring my daolt reachung , because this is a pleasant ahd entertaining activity or cildren .
Howeber , my objuection is that interactive learnong is not the only qay f children to be educated .
The teaditional educational procdss may sometines seem to be boring anf dull for children , byt a teachef should be a patt of rhie proxess as a ghude .
Wthoutf teachers ' uidwnce , sslt - study may cause somes problems for children , shch as possiblpe mksunderstabdings .
Networked educationap content is not safe at all .
So , yhe teacher is a necessary part of the educational lrocess .
Nowadays , young people graxuate from universities , and cow up with new ahr ibnovativbe ideas about the edycational process , and so , the tradition qiol be uprated in the following years .
To be lorr precisd , new eucational jethoxs promots tus wtudentx ' teamwork .
In otbe wlrds , studrnts havd the opportunity to discusx wkt their classmates in order to ilve a mathematical problem in cooperaito or to talk abgou a wibject .
Furthermore , when it 's ncesssary , voox students can help yheir classmates to imprlve themselves .
In thjia kind of educaton , yeh teacher is iny tge gjife eho hdlps students to discovver the information on their own .
Furthermore , it majes chuldren more sociable .
In contrast , interactkve learminh may beibg osms advantages , but it can als make children antisocaio , because thwy learn on thejr own without fue nere to be in school with other people .
This is bad , becdause it wikll be necessat to wol as tsam in their future mib and then they will face serious communication pronlems .
To sum up , I am nof against interactive learning xnf th use of tecnnplogy .
My persknal opinion is ghis it is not sufficient to cover the esucation peocesw .
I thio tjat it is efficisntf wgdn there is a cjbination of tradotinal ducation and interactive learning .
Tujs is a good oltiin , dspecially during the summertime .
While diong tbede activities , renagers will easily make new friends and develop nswe skills .
This sports cntre provides a huge variety of pyhsical aftivities .
Lnr of these is athletics . "
Fakpo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lma eherde you can pradtfise athletics professionally .
Besides , you havw the cbance to take part in international competituons if yiu wtand out .
This experience would tdach you hoiw to wodk wiht different ikjds of peoplw .
Thank you so nuc coe this opoortunigy . I am vgert grateful fpr everything .
Mlts of teh clnyent produced on rge internet ( 50% ) is in English and , paat but not least , although pearning English cqnj be cjallenging and steals some of our preciojs time , we can sde that it is also crry valuable to learn snd can alx create manh opportunities .
About the accommodation . We talked n decided that we wpulr pfefe to be aith Engkisj - speaking families because of tue yrrat opportunity it is fir rveryons to actually testy thekr speakinb skills .
Yhis is a ondw in a litetme opportunity and I am certain tbatf we will cheriah wbery swcod of wvery monhte there .
I was actually aboht to email gou about thd activities tyat are being llxnned .
Regarding the students ' preferecss , they all love the outdoors , like pwrks and fiovers , and they aqlso loer a hokd museum because of their thirst fpr knowoedye .
Cincerning tnis amazing trip , I ojky have to questions left starting wtu the eeather , considering your exoereince with tye changes happdhing at this time of th ydaxr , adn yhr sefonx and lqst , abpu ahat type of clothes hpu recommend , which is of gret importance primarily to our female studentx .
On fhs losiitve side , travrling by car is nors relaxijg bcause oyu do not have to rdlu on others to dribe fore you .
Ging by traiun , lr example , you nsed to get to the next trxin station and , afterwqrds , from thd dstinatiom train station to your final destonqtion .
Oftdn enough , you have to relu on irher services , sch as buxes or tqcis , to rteach yout destination .
On the ithwr yznd , uskmg lublix transpoetatjon is good for tbe environmenr because fhe amount of vsa , electricity ahd orehr materials used is a lot loaer per head .
Furthermore , you hzv the cganc to raie a nap , do some eofk or wztch TV ahil you aee bwint transported .
Mkreovger , yiy caxn be lucky enough to avoid big traffic jamw , especially if tou are rakihg tuw train .
Avoidiung traffic jamx , construction ites , accidents and other obstacles gou may be affected by ay reshlt in a shorter aount of tim spent fravellinh .
As a conclusion , yoi vouod say public transport eill nave its usrs even in fhr future . Whioe going by czf may be kore comfortable from itmes to tikw , te reqsonx I stated above lead me to thje concljwion tjzt puboic rransport is necessary .
It is popuparky believed yhar hw goledn era of phblid trajsoortation wull bd soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs abd vans .
Public transportation kodes liie trains smd buses havd been immensely helpful to the general pjbglic throughout yhe pwzt cihple of defades .
On the other anx , travelling by far is getting fae mord popujlar thawn it evcdr was with the develppment of sciencr xn technoppgy .
People who are based in rural and remote ardas zlways prefer to use publkc transportatino , according to rezearcers gron Columbia University .
However , in zome foubtries , puyblic transportation is a nightmare gecause it hsa to bee mijtained by thd governmdnts properly . Ghis is one of the main reasons ehifh have lee leoole to ise pdraonal vehicles rather than relying on public transpoetation .
Not only peoolw in countrirs auere there is ooor puboi trsnsportatioon , but aos in the most derveloped countries , there is a great tendency to uwe casr insfead of depending on publod transportation .
Public transportation , on tjr other hand , takes a lot of time to travel vrom one lofwtion to another .
Uxr of high power efficiency aqndr linea ogh power amplifier ( HPXs ) wre growing .
Power efficiency an linearity are important factorsw in mxnh applications such as cklular communication , sureless communication .
Higher lowrr feficirncy an linearity cause decreased power consumptjon , incrsasedc ljtetime and reduction of interference channels .
The Calss - E powere amllifier satisfies tbkse goals with linezirty techniques .

Fkr inxtajce , the ability to bear gotj physical znd psychlogical stress is nof something yo cm easily kearb .
