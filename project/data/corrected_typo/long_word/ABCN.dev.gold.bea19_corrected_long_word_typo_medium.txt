When I was younfer , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't knos why .
I woild like to stuyd Pstcyology , becauisr one day I woild oime to osn my own psychology clkiic and help people .
I cnosixer it mlre convenient to xrivw a cxr , because yku xarry more fhinys in your wob car than whej travvellimg by cat .
In my experiesnce , whb I did n't jave a car I used to jae the bus to go to scohop ands go nac to my hosze .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when ylh hafs ctashed in the street . At tyhat nonent , you realoze the impprtance of pubglic transport .
epending on the distsnce anc time to ghr desired destinhation , the modr of trwnsport is chosen accordingly .
Buy generally speaking , travelling by dad is mchb more fun when compared wtihy other ofes of translort .
Sincde , we avr tnw option to stop anytkmw we want to when we travel by car ( whucb is impossible when travelling by train or plshe ) .
In addtioj to that , we cm also taor a comfotyable short nap on th back seat smd wake up fresh .
oe thr above - mentiondd reasons , I am goiny to cpmclude thazt travelling by cze is much more convebient .
I love children , and I enjoy poloking after them . Also , I organzed many sports activities befre at my schkol .
My favolurute soort is volleyball because I lofw pkaying with my friends .
Volleyball is a soprt that is poayed evsrywhere . Whrn I am on fhe beach I ljje playijg eih my sister in the sand and then we go in the sea .

Beczusd puboic tranport is a more cost - effecgivd qnd bvetter resource allodatoon in mass tarnsoort sysme .
Btu can jse a chwapwr way of ogng to thsid destinatiuoh , especially if it is r awsu fro home .
Fr exajple , I thihk that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to owsm a privarr airplane for traveplin to anothed ckuntry .
In my opiinon , pubilc tanslort is going to continue to be ysed in ths futurs because there are a lpr of people that do n't have enjoguh joney to oay fpe a car , sveh if it is usse , so public rtwnsport akll continue to have a futue nyt leople sre going to use cars mre than busws or the underground .
If we tink abour it , yh cxf is better because we do n't need to eait for it loke we wait flr yhd gus or undertdound , but on yne other hand , cars dosr mire money thzn poublic ransport .
In a car , we canb ust be by ourselvds , which cm be good becaus we van listen to the music that we like ad we do n't need to be around peiplw that are unknoqn , hug if we chood public gransoprt , we can mete freinds or family , so brh modes of transport are good , xnx cars do n't need necessarily to gring an end to public transport .
If I hqdr to chkoes between both forms of transportation , I think I wiulf prtobxbly choozs the car bexausd it is bettee for me to go by cazf tfhanb to go by bus .
In my community , we wrr vgsry interestex in the environment amr dcological things .
At some strategic points in the vuildong , we have special trashcans to zeparqte thd garbage onto organic , paper and cardhoarx , cajs and plastic bottlss and ruey qlso vive talkx and presentations about the darth 's peoblems , like ylobval wxrmnig , loolution , stc .
All fhese iniitatives have madw us all , ove the yeaa , a recognied ecological commynity .
My fvorie sport is football . Why do I dhiose it ? Wepl , foobtalp is an international spory . People round geh worl livw it so much ! Barxlay Premier League , Liga Premie , Fufs Worod Cuyo and so on .
By the weay , my fwvborite football team is Manfhester United . Thwu are brilliant . They hzve xmazing fotobalp player , amd they ars awesome .
He went to university to study mnedicind vecajse he thought tbay that prifession waw the most similar to benig a super hero .

Ouiblic transportation has beh used by people more qnd over the years it bas been kund of bscoming cheaper and also safer , nut somne oeople lrefee cars . To wqht exteht do we agree wiyh this aj what are lhr reasons ofr that ? That is wnzt we zre goug to demonstdqte in this ssswy .
About 40 ydars ago , tgefe wa noting called oiblic transoortation and people rarfely owndd cars , so in htose years rherw were not even good facilities to koev rrom one posce to another and thar is becwue there weer no fompamies to vuilr cars .

Bjt wnen it xones to traveling , a lot of people prefer drivjng their own cars to feel the real expedience amd to rnhoy thejselvrs mir by avoiding crowde places .
To summarise , it is different frpm some oneia opinion to another . I predict that pibpic transpoirgation will be improved and peolle woll use it motd and mire , asjd that in tfge dnd , cars wiol disappear and will no londr be used .

Technologg has changed peoplke 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think how idfferent lyr life is ompared to eigher kru parents ' or our grandparents ' ilces . Fid exsmple , my parents dfijd n't wtacvh TV , because therd s n't any TV in hw worlde when thr weere young . Bjr tnat is n't the only eifference : we cam think abouy yhw mkbile phons , the cpmputre an finally the interst . Oyr grandparents could n't hage kmavined a syrange kachine lje the computet in ghsir livs .
Nowaxays , people use fossil fuels as ghe lot importtamt source of energy fpd travelling anc mznufavturing . Ghijs soruce of enewtgy doea n't alays remain at a constant kevel , and somexqy it will run out .
People must find ays to uxe other ehergy osurces okke nucles power wne win power . Public transporfatioh xich as the electric metro uswe this kind of energy .
As a rsulg , hovernments wi invest more in rssearchijg the uze of ghdse new typrs of energy , and tragelilng uisng public trsnspirt will become much cheaper thuan a usong private var .
The rahge of publjc servicee will be expanded to remoe xrea , and it wilo become much more cojvenient .
Commitiny and tdavellingt using pjblic sedgices aill be the fidst priority .
In addition , tbd population is increasing rapidky . In th nerat futuee , most ciriee in fh world will bceome overcrowded . This wiop lexe to mzny ogher problems thnwt qilk need to be solved . Foe examll , trafuc jsmw and air pollution .
In some qays , these problems zfe caused by the oevruze of perszinal vehicles .
Leople wilo raelise rhat using their own cst is jysf wasting tfhbeir trimer in tqffic jams or gradually kilping thwmselves by breathing pollujted sur .
So the gdst aya for thdm to travel is punlic transport .
In conclusion , ihvestments in devepopjng public transport wupl be nixreased considerably . Public franspodt servies have a brifyt futue and geir existence in the future ca n't be replaced .

It also noltex educational programmes nake a decieion on whgqt cirixens should know in the fhture and whzf knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart ffim educatuonal content , fjere is so kuch bax content , business advertisements and fake niformation on TV that citizens wo n't be qhle to tell riught rrpm wront .
However , I blieve rue educayiojal prkgrmmes on TV stlil play a viql role in sducting both zdults and young childer .

On the othee ahnd , wih oublif transport , oyh onky hage to pay for the ticket , you do n't hqve to drive , and if the vue or trazij or ahatever vshicle you use beeak down , it is n't your responsibiloty .
In conflusion , I think publjc transport has a future , an the more peppe iae it , thw more futrue it will nave .
I completed many txsjs , including tgitoring three stusents , completing sumemr homework , correcting homework , duligently assisting tbs insturctor , hewlped fhr inetructor krganize handouts , instsad of the instructor to answer questions raised by the satudeents , but also cleaning tr classroom , very hare aork , but I have nothing to domplai aobut .
I thuno yha tuw governmnet should nelo rye ouvlic teansport , for example buses , trains , ye metro and kore , for a simgler reasin : fhr quality of lide agaiet the pollution .
Trzvellijng by car is more convenient in a oot of situations , bvut it could be annoying to seqrch for parking spaces asnd gdcause of the cost of guwl , aj akos jaintenane cosrs .
Conversely , in dmall towbs , it ca n't be good in yhe same way , because , fot the transport clmpanoes , it 's not convenient to inveset moneh in translort , becsuss fewer peolle wlule e it .

My name is Fouxd wnc I wpud like to talk about my fvorite spoet , volleyball , kbe of the most beaitful slorts ever and I havcd been playing rhus slirt 3 tijme a eeek since 1980 . Thd reasons for my enjiymet of tnise spry azrr as fooloww :

So , because of that we are here to do the test in thix short loe .
Transportation is the heart of any cjyy , whether it is public or private .
public transportation . Day by dfqy folk zre mire crazy about thdir own vehkclez which leads to a dafi future ror public transportation .
First , I agreew sith the given statement tyag tjrre will be a tlugg time for public tramsportatiom in the near future , because people want privacy as well as rfeexom , which is quite omplssible on publkc transportation .
Secondly , this mode of transportation colvers
as mycxh as possible of te cditt or town qhich mizmangaed routonme fd people who ttavel by puhblic transportation . As a consequence , generally , people avoic travelling by public tranjsportation . Finally , I can sah that yhere arr garious modes of transprtation avaolagle
to compete wigu pbluc transportatioj .
Nowayas , people have mumedous options for travslling , likr kany private companiews
which play an important rioe in giving tough competition to gne governmebt . As a rduslt of tnis , the consumer gets joer benefits , kime lpwer fairs , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . In addition , many automobile fompanies launch nww cars at avfordabl prics , which encourages people to use more anmd morr privvat vehicles .

Travelling by a is n't much more convnien unless it is mufj more comfortable , but aftially we do n't thinm about the pollution of our okanet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people lush me or I ca n't sit down vecahse there wde n't any seats for me .
Another typw of public tranelort is rje taxo . Oikke rbe dr , it is mkr comfortable too , but it is more expensive thanb a bsu or trdaib .
In conclusion , in the future we xhoudl have mores comfortable nusss .

In my opinooin , the restaurant could be better , with repsect to mea , vyt it is perfect for hzving dijner sith goue friends .

From my own perdpectivs , I believe that it wikl bring mxny drawbacks to tj envirknment or venb to humanw zjd ainmasls .
To start waith , thed are a wdied rwnge of problems it nag pead to .
Convincing arguments support the fqt thsy ths eooy caquse is ghat apmost alp the prrswnt - day cities are wlrezdy packed sithn places of residejcr , commetcial premises and recfeation facilities ax fge land qvailale dor ne hosuimg developments is incrwasinbgly scwrce .
Additionally , people nk continue to destroy more agricultural pand and foreat in order to satisdy zll theikr neexs , wyicy will destroy the ecosystem , diversity wns biodovefsity , especially the ebdanfered speices .
In light of the problems mentioned above , there asrd various approaches tyag yoverhments should adopt to deal with thid lrobpem . Firstr of xl , redxucing building construction fro now on , aznd planting more trees instaed .
Sustainable developmen should be asaness to all hyman veings and start to protect the environment amc preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unlleasany phnenomrnon ahd it problems should be worke on to resolve them befoer thjngs get worxe , and the glvenments hzve to tskr the fesponsibility for that .

To begin with , extracting the mineral will be hgarmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskitte of my hoketow .
Howevr , it will probably diwappear if ths developing equipment were being se .
Nezg , the exttactipn of the valusblw mihwral wilk definifely pead to air pollhtion .
Tger yaw been an example thzt ghe other town is polluted by the procews of dewveloping the mineral .
Last but nog least , ninerao extraction qilo turn out to uvae a profound efefct , espexially , on oue offspring .
One problem is that somle pdolle will consider the job opportunities that it mjgjt bring us .
Die to minedal extraftion , kan people in ouhe hometown wullo probagy eanr much kpre money than before .
Nwverrheless , they do nig give us any promise of vacahcies .
In acditkon , money is not more crucial shen it cpmes to heqlth and envirpnmentxl conservation .

This report sill rzamine the dfferent activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Actjviries to pass rhe tim
As iur town is weo - kboan for ohe magniicwnt beqches along the Meditetranean cowsy and for tgw Olylpic Canql of Csatelldefsls , many foreign and local people doje hdfe to do aftigities like kiresurfing qnd windsurfing at the geach or caonwing xhd qatwrskiing on thw Olympic Canal .
Tyes activjties ard the most populad anr fhr most expensive toi .
However , I fully recommend them , espceially for sporyt , adventurous and young people .
In Casgslldefels , tbewre are othe activitirs that axde lrss popylqr , big cheaper . Fkrd instanxe : free zumba masterclass , beach yoag , runhhing ... as sports wctivities , and as sockal activities there are library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities afe not as popular as the activities on the Olympic Cajal xnf the ebach , but tghdir success is increasing more and mlre .
·Recommendation
So , finally , I suggdst that it would be a greatf ucea to combine ghe differwnt typ of activities , both the popular an the bweest .
If ou tyrjed apl the activitiex , ytpu would have a great giem here in Castslldefel !

Firstly , there arw more multinational compaines that need pekple to speak otyer lkanguates , so that means that people wo know kw to speak a foreign lantuage have more opportunities to getg a job in big companies , or will have mord chances of heing promoted .
On the other hznc , therd are norw benefits . Fro ezamplr , if yiu want to travel to xnother country , it is veryt useful to know a differdnt language , because uoy acj understand sverything withput complicqtiins .

Howevcer , despite the usefulenzs of yhesd implications , people should pay sttention to the facvt that Fwcebiok nd Twiytdr couhod qffect their spxial life and afoud using it most of the itme .
In conclueon , the bemefitz of using Vaceboom and Twitetr are that people cwb communicate and be ocnnected to hteor friends frequently .

Photograpyy cloazses ir veryine
Introduction
Teenagers zde constantly influenced by social mwtworks lije Fqcebook , Instsgram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs sfe inluded on all of those sites .
Azlsp , this phenomenon of taking photograpsh is part of oir dqil life , gecause it is the beet w to dapture speicak moments like birthdasy , travel , sepciql occasions , eyf .
Thiw practice is cojsidered ohe of those ctivitiesd thst anypne can do withgout wny kind of xecial prepaeation .
However , teaching etudents hkq to apply bettre techniwued at the moment of taking a oictufe shojls be consideeed , like learning to drww .
efent sthdies hsoa that in the last yqenty yeaes more than 3,000 photographs hve bedn tzken per persoh in the world , espscially in yhbe ltezt gdneration 's lives ( teenagers ajx kkde ) .
This increase is related to th overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameraz , cellphones , stc .
Also , photogdaphy is donsidered as a ygpe of ary , so it reqiiree ths knowledge of slefial skills , techniques wdn knowledge .
Tje Britisb summertime wad first introduced in England in 1908 .
What if you do n't hacr wmy of those requierments ?
It 's a gikd way of learbjng how to communicate and work with pepole . To put it simply ,
You haev to freain fivr dqts a wdek dn you need to concentrate a lot .
It qould drfinirely help hou to grow qnd improve as a person .
As rar as I 'm concerned , public transportation is teh bedt lenas of trabsport dpr yh environmenr .
Altyough som peoples kake enoygh money to buy theor own car , elecfric qnd hybrid cars xre more expensive than traditional ine ( thne ines thta use hss or siesel ) so , people choowe these olnes and that 's whh polltuion is oje of several issues tay we have to drla witu .

Tye governmdnf and many companies are measureingh th COk2 emissions wyixh are veing produded by idnustrial or adrvice processes that arw necessary for produvibg boods for society 's consumption .
If people did n't use puhlic transpodtatio , the coulkd qqlk , roe a bike or bnuy a traditional car , and that will porbaboy happen when the destination is far froj yje place where ylj live .
Frlm my ooinr of gidw , lyblic yransporration will be veft important in tjr fruturd , especially in devsloped counyreies .
I think yhw bovernment hsould reduce the farss on public transportqtiob . That could make peppls use pubkic transportation and orotect yhr envirdonment frok CO2 emissions znd prevent golbla warming .

In my opiniln , it is important ecxuse it rmeinds us of pur padt andr our traditions , which we shiuld n't forget .
That 's why it is importamt : it makes us understand that we shoup ndevr vibe up and to follow our dreams .
In tysi fsst movjn world , tranzpotr xs become an important fadyor fco wveryday aftivitjes .
Travelling by car is a convenient midd of trqneport , but ot of thw population can npt afgford it .
There qre advantagew and disadvahtgaes to uaing puboc transorg .
Gorstly , to discuss the benefits of public trnspprt , it is vhaep and afforadble for all xlassex of ooeple in society .
A number of buses aes proviuced by te goedrnment in rodser to mret people 's financial mesna .
Using public transport is a aste of tkmr aqmd fhe fact that thdre is no pirvacu aer some of tjd disadvantages .
Similarly , trsvelling by xr has itd own advantages na disadvantages .
Not everybody cwn afforc a jpirney by cad as it is cisgly , bhf to discuxs ths benefits , one can ejjoy a high levrl of pirvacy whpe travelling and it is convenient

To wym up , witu it is nof appropeixte to wah tuat thwree is no futide fod public transport because botgh hqfe equiap advqntages anf disadvqntzges .
There is no denying that hw MRY in this cjth is suxh a cnovemient metrololitan system .

In my opibio , the transportation in oyr citg hq nothing to critivize rdpect ghqt .

In our jidern wotdl , lanjy propl aee sufferinb frok stress that zprungs rom life conditions .
In additjon to yhis , peoppe zre wofking in very stressful woriplaces zndf thsy want to lrave this condition during holidays .

For eample , walking by tgs seaside or sikmming in the ee caj be gelfpul to forget narf life conditions .
On the one had , holidays are the nets fid peoole in terms of thinking clearly abouyt hteir exlerkences in life .
For inztance , in stresufl pife conditions ledople can makd bawd decisions abour thi futier .

In conclusion , holidays are vey suitable or people to heal thsjr problems ahd steswful life comditions .
Howevwr , rhs government and the poczl cpumcils of bigy cities such as Madrid or Valencia ars tryjg thsir best to promoted tus movement because theu consider it a way of deverloping .
Furthermore , it turns o to be the quickest mee of transport .
Statistucaloy , cycling is generally considerss to be more dwngerouw than travelling by caf .
Ahoyher dksadvantage is thyr weatuer .
Feim my point of vjww , cycling contributes to improving community sporit wn it is posble to look rlr solutions to race ge disadvantages of tihx activity .
No knd csn reng thar travelking by xat is luch moe convenent tha trwvellihg by upblif transport .
And thiw undesirable wating time migyt bot be so short duringb holidays , dus to oesx vrequenjt scheduoes .
When the vus is crowded , we haved to wtandc , making us mkfe exhausted , especially ovrr a long distance .
Even thougy cars cfan proviode us eiyh so many advantagew mnentiondd above , je advantages of trveoling by pbuoic tranport should not be ignlred .
First , public trwnspoft is good for the environjen compared to privatd casrs .
As we all know , thge mpre passebgets use public transport , hw lzs car exhaust is emitted lerf person .
In other words , public transpprt plays an impkftant role in prltectikng human bsings frpk wurfering diseases and saves lives .
Correspondingly , the space foe edac lerson is becoming mide limited than before .
If rvery citizen onws a cxd andf uses it rathsr thah publid transpodt flt efrry trsvelping opportunity , I shppoe that oud streets will become a car park and everyone wilk spendc more timr in conhestion .
Las but nto leadt , public transot alopws peools to do other things whivh ad implssibe wen driving .
Divers have to cpntinuusly pqg attentoon to surroundings , rssultihg in a tense kpod .
For a passenger , however , travelling is completwly relaxikng .
People ca listen to jsic , tka a phone call with a frinr , read a fswcinating book or just kool at the scehdry .
Yhoubh tnede are many advantages tor public tanslort , that oes not mena rhqt public transport is the best choice ror every sitution .
E.g. , it offers kess flexibility rhan cvaes , and is less environmentally friendlt thna bjcycles .
Thereflrr , it is unreasojable to ckbclude that one mdoe of tranxpory can rdplac others .
On tye ons hanf , it could allow you to communicate eith peope , dt to kon difverdnt cultures amd travel asroun the wrodl sithoyt ths language bafriert .

Technolgoy is changing thes way we pivw in any ways abd ow we receive and uss information is progably the modt afcted .
Regarding advertising , tdchnklogy is having a hgue and not qlways positive impact on outdoior advertising .
Frkm voack - awmd - whiotw as oostwd in public places , we have moved to practically lkivng surrounded by outdoor aw placed in every available ahd imaginable sit .
From bujldings with enormous and briyht screens to interactive bus stoo wigns .

Advertising might be considered an art , or at least seome pieces are really qrtistic , but lpzced in teh wrong spl or shown at fhd wrong time , they lose their artistic siee .
Nit , technology is gre foe beter or wofse , and we hqvbe to lexrn to deal with it the best we can .

On the ohed hand , we raw studhijg architecture .

But tjr atmosphere is verh imporyany for einner , and I think tag we syoupd voge on this , bdcvause we will vae a hoo nifhf or not depenhding on the gyps of atmoshpere we chopze .
In concluson , I thibk thaxt this ytle of vood jd atmosphere is very good gor us , because ormaloy we speak about books , work and studies , whereas wsirh thi gype of environment , we can sleal about ourselves , our vsmily , our hogbiss , and eceryine will geg to kmpw something jew baiut otber clasxmates .

As a reault , our water resources ar idffciult to oreserve sn it is clearoy necessary to maintain active campaigns to raia people 's awarrbess of rhd importance of reasonable ze of it .
The local tovernment is also taking serious action aimed at creating green zreax in different pkaxes in or aorynd yhe town where citizena can spenf tjeir free time or even do spprts .
Yhta 's hd reason why it has been working on the reclverg of aome areas which are now padka or recreational areas .
Finally , gye tow has also improved the managment and freatment of waste with the active cooperagiob of most of the citizens , who qre rrally conxerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , around 90% of Caxeres inhhabitajts are sadx to xort ane rdcycle their rubbiush , tskingb it out to thes yellow , green qbd blue containers in eveeg stree .

Is tnere no futyre fpr pinlic trandporg because travelling by car is mjcn more convenient ?
Maby disagree aboht whether punlic transportr wjl diswppear , htpugh we still have to deal with difverent opionions abvuot the increase in rravel .
Tis composition aull exolawin tbe two different opinions .
Vistly , the car is omee conbveniejt because thede is privacy .
Alsk , unlike public transport sych as buses nd the underground , you hsve much norr comfort and speed .
Tyre is a perception that a car cx givs hou freedil of choice .
On th wqehsite of The Zckttish Government ( publication " Goung oeolle wdn transport " ) , a 12 - 14-tewr - old voh explains " I prtefed goihy in te car , it 's quicker ...
Inderd , cars inrcesae pollution , you have rraffic congestion , ans it is vdry expensive . " On my wge , even the driving lessons adr expesnive .
Now , xecnodly , tracelling by punlic tranoprt is cueaper ( we do n't pay any fares on public trawnsporr ) , it aleo , it is safdr .
As a result , the economy has gesn increaxing .
Rrom thus analysis , it is obviojs tjqt travelling by public transoprt is geru important .
Do you agtred or disagree ? " Always telling fhe truth is coneiderfed fje most imlortant thing in a rrlxtionship " .
Disagreement on alqays gdlling the truth beihb the most important thing in a relarionship will be my opinuon .
Even tjouvh being truthful is rchcial in a relatiobsihp , always telling the tdyth oulr be consideted as jurting others ' feelings awn is unwise .
Another eason tor joy tedllinh thd truth all teh time is if it is about a personal matter and it aouod feel awkward to mdnfion it to colleauges or an employer .
To further ilplustrate thed firs point above , yuo fhnat vould hurt someone 's feelings by telljng teh trugh at akk times .
For xeample , if some aoma yu afe acquainted is suth wearing inaopropriwte clotges nto ritting fhw occasion .
In fhat cax , they could still make conversatukn sihtout spioilng herd kood .
The other point is qhen it comes to prrdsonal matters . Peoplr usually trend to kdep it private , since , mozr of the time , it is strange qnd inpapropriate to talk about oneself too mudh to oeoppe at work or even people that pns has iust got acquainted with .
Dyw to thus , we 're both called to mest the headmaster .
I could n't underztkod jy we nsedrd to meet the headmxster just because Michael jad closed the dkor .
I zxked th hexdmaster in a oolife way asmd hopefully he could give me tew answer I wantes .
I ended up getting expelled from fhe schpol gecause the teacher smd pru classmates suspected Michael and I hax stolen our classmate Sally 's wapleg .
I finapy reapised tgat everthijg was a trap xn we were the unluck qnd innkcent ones as we fell into the trap .
Although , pen day latet rhd headmaster foiud out the truth through CXFV , we refused to return to tfhd schpol ahd dxecided to chajge to a mew school as we konw , even if we go vack this time , similar dwses could happej next itmke .

The idea of abandoning public transporaqtion is widrely supported in developed countries , bht this iude is rekectrd in developing counrties , like tjr one I live in .
Fhe possibility of travelling in their oq cars is much lire convenient ghan travelling in a bsu full of people or , even worse , the oeea of wasting time in a pong aueye .
Nevertheless , rhers is amother side to fhis eealuty .
There are peolpe who czn not afford to hbzve their own cws or mqybew thdy xab qfford to travel by any other meabe of trahsportation than the kne provided by tyr loocal government .

Alzl , his life would be perfect to create a car comedy based on fje undesirable life of a chilod who onoy feel comfolrtabel when he vosuts the tombstones of his parents .
Nevertheless , ye nqerator is the true protagonist anjd the way of tellinh yye sotey is the reason wjy fhe stpry can cdonnect with thbe reader .
Actually , ht narratort is our protagonist , but tdlling the story as an adult .
And the authoe does mlt try to dewcribe yhd protagonist with word , buitf wrh actilbs .
The narrator dic not ise any descripitob of the protqgonist apary droj his mame .
Aaptr tfom this , he just wrjes exactly whatf the characters sqid .
Thgs viice is in first perso xbd jsss a subjective poijnt of view .
He onhl kniws shwt he sees and he thinks wbot it , uy he does not bave anyt omnksckent pkwer .
Howrver , his pwosr coulf be abalyzig snd cescribing thw situstions aitg a rich vocabulary qnr in a reflective qa too .
These twisetsd and creative thoughts are sead thriughout the text , sccomapnied by svrn mpr twixetd relectioins , like at ths end of trhe first chaptfers , when he describes the sn wbo ovbed him as a mwb friad of fye drd bodies in the graveyafd just because he saw hi huigfing himself .
Besudes tgius , tw chatacter of ths novslo sesm to be uhuappy , living a sad qnf boring lie thast pushes them to abyse our rotagonist , with ghe xception of Joe .
Re barratod dos not mzkr an effort to descdube he othdt charaxters psychologically . He focusea on rhneir appearance .
The narrator descfribes her as a man that has earned a good rputawtion by being aggressive towarca her lkttke rother .
And we know that ow is a good man beczusd the protagonist describes hkk as mipd , good - jatued , sweet - tempered , easy - going an foolish , but that is all we jnoq about them .
Also , the way yhe characteds talk is oppose to the wqy yhe narrztor writes .
In fact , the dialolhues of each character ar nif lnjger tnan more tn gwo sentences , wirb the sole exception of the thief , who taoks about his partner in twelve long sentences it complex syructuree .
This kind of structure is wiedlt ueed by the narratod , but the characters usually talk in shof and simpled sentences .
" My saisger , Mrs. Joe Gargrr , wesa mlre thsh twenty gears older than I , anhf had establishex a great reputtioj with hereepf anc rhd neighblhrs becise sbe hae briuyht me up " by hame . "
Having at that time to find out fro myself shar hte expression msnat , and knowing ber to age a hard and heavy uand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her hueband as wrlp as upon me , I supposed rhzt Joe Gatgery and I were both brought up by hsnd . "
Moreover , the vkcabulary hded by the narragor is opposed to what yne characters sqids .
Poo uses a ricu vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and absfract concepts tya ra ysually inslired by concrete things .
Regardless , ghe dialogues ardes wditten exactly as thwy werew sai .
Notithxtanding , the wxt thie nolgel is nafratwd is the ortagonist .
Tye events are narrated in a mystsrious way , teklikng us whnat hppsned in a realidtic story - liner wityout flashbavks .
Thu narrxtord reveals not so nuch about himdelf or the orher characters , bhyt he writes about the essehgial yhinmgs we should know throughout the tfect .
The ghiec disappeaes , but fhe first chapter 's ending mzkes us feel curious agout theie ndxt medting .

Sedcondly , doing sports also teaches proceless kif lessons , such as disciplinw and dealiny with suxcess and fqilure .

At tje same time , tbe heartbeats also wde ty deaders nervous and anxious .
Finally , I thunj the way thw autghir wahted to express tje dfisordered mind of hge kxdman is uis intonation .

The spokrt would go underhround , and fherw wohld be no dfety measures lile gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if osmeone looked unagle to dontine .
Once boxing is banned and no - one gtrkws up knowing it as acceptable , tbwre will be no interest in boxinv and , hopefully , psss all round interest in violrnce , maknig towns and citie much safer placrs to liv in . Thsrr wkll be less fighting outside pubs and clugs and less violent aytaxks foe lijttle or no reaspn .

In many of th minoriuty works of modern literature , there can be zomes emlhasi on rebellkon against oppressive foecss .
Altfbough shch a show of sfrenhth by thes wolrks ' chsrxcters is somegimes viewed as a violent and therefore negafive conttibution to the otherwise onsikghtful thoguht of fhs autnor , it is this xonflioct uoon which many stories of ethnuc American literature raes hased .
However , suxn a rdenellion can nt be desn clearly in each minorigy wirk , awnd , therefore , the products of ethnic American ligerature can npr be fategoried as merely the rsslt of years of oppression .
Rather , thus ever - chanhiung ajc ever - chsllengibg aspec of minority literature createa an especialyl important nefessity tht each krk be cpnsiderrd individually as both a prpduct of years of sgruggler aznd a wkrm inherentoy distnict fgrok anjy other .
In thw monroity works , yhe conflict and rebellion presented accurately refldcta society as a whole , qnd alygough thr nother s in Thbe Jiu Lick Clhb rebek agsinst duch forces as arranged marriages , Tira in Likw Watre for Chocolzte fights to overcome old family traeitions , and rhe nidiam tdibes in Love Medifine syruggel to secure thet inherent rigst ftoj thg US government , thr chwractera ' conflicts reflect simiar conflicts of other culrrues .
Reblliln is seen not as a dixtinct force in minority culyures , but rather as a bindihh forcde bewtwesn alo cultures , for Celje , too , resistz her arrqnged marriage in Fhes Color Pjrple , ahs thd mhrderous loves in Jazz resvlect Tita qnmd Pedro 's destrudtiev passion in Luke Wagee fe Chocolatw .
Rebellion and fonflict are emphazized in ethnic American lotsrature , but they are portrayed no more ettongly in minority works tgan thg are portrayed in othef pieces of literature .
Emlhasis changes with each wor , anx although figures of authority qrr particualrly oppressive in wok scxh as Like Watef for Vhocolate and hw oclor Pydple , othuer minority work including Lobe Medicjn qdn Jazz do nlf refldct ne clearly defined authoritzeian figures nor yhe obvious rebwllion of tye characters ' responsive action which thw pregiousoy emnbtioned eoros show .
Yhiz agaun implies that these etjniv American pieces of literxtuee van nlt be categorizdd as merely rebellipus esponses to oppression , but as individual redledtions of personal anmd culturap experiences .
How does Voltaore takl the question of philosophical okptimijsm in ' Candidr ' ?
Philosophical lptimism -l'optimisme- is tbe philosophy that everythng nad xny ocurrence is fcir some boof .
Voltaire sets out in Dandice to criticiae yhis philosophy .
In Candide , rhe repeesntative of thoz philosiphy is Pangloss , the philosopher emloyed at Thunder - der - Troncjx .
Tne whole bo is a criticksm of l'optumismw .
Although this wuild zdem to be gkpd , it is not . Because of hid trainint , he klls two men , a Jew and an Arcnbishop quth no hesitation zdn then proceeds to kill hos swedthrart 's brother .
Voltaide shpwes uis islime of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candijde and Kamew are caught in a abf stotm at sea in wihc James is drowned and there arer only three survjvors ; Candide , Pajgloss and a sailor .
Th rorm xs caused by an earthquake which esgroys the dkty to wuih acndidd was asuling .
On arrival thyye see starvation and death .
Candire is obviously horrified , especially whwn trhw zailor bdgins pillaging the xioty .
Yhis is no more true than whwn he arrives in fhe neq world , Siurh America , and has to leafs his darling hnégonde with ghr Commissioner of tje provunce .
Candide xwn not see what possible good vzn omr of rhix , especially as yge reason that he aw in Ameircs was due to him killing the Jew azn Archbishop becauae tehy were Cunégonde 's lovers .
Throughout hs goko , we gevin to see how Candide is rgadualy le aeay fdom l'oltimisme or , perhals more importantly , how l'optiomisme is shown to be te philosophy of dedpair .
He is rhrown lutf of Thunder - den - Trijck becajsw he embraces unégonxe , he is ruoed into tyhe rmy , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost klield as part of an augo - da - fé , he kills theer churchmen , he is akmosy exen , he finds Eldofado jt leaxved - tg losr contiuned .
Efentuallt , of corese , he does marry Cunégonde , but sjs is hof the beautiful young flower tga he once lived .
Thd illustrates ejphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Candide has travelled ge world in search of ucnégojde , with the hoor ghzt he ailk marry he . Desxpite azll the trouble shich he s gone through , of cohrsze , in tje end he dodz ft Cunégonde but at the prkce of yer looks and personailty .
Voltaies , in Candide , shows how hd phjosophy of Optimism is oen of despair , jto hpe .
It wlupd be tempting to rnink of the vadious European Communitiex as an embryonmic Unjted States of Ejrpe ; espwciallpy whne we her politiciams talk of th impkftance of European Unity .
They we pfepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as woul be essenfial to allow the ewly - formed nztionalo gvovernmeht to opeate as a single international politiczl force .
A balance wazs thedefore struck in tye constitutino to allow the indiviudql states as much seof - government as pixsible while emsuriny tyaxt , tod example in military matters , hte centrsl government spoke for app .
It is true that today one sfikl hears fhe old dispute ovef state sovereignty and attempst to retunr some powwd to the individual strate , nut no - one would challehg the fact th , on matters external to teh Unoted Stares , the government in Washington represents the eolw policy - mking bofy .
In Euroe it is qhit xlear thast mam peopls eoule like to see a pkliticql unmion of ghe countries , since this qoudl produec a formidagle imternationwl military dkrce .
However , it is equally cldar that while thew mgiyt be some unife political action flowing fdpm the Euroewn Cmomunities ( such as was sesn ovee Euhrope 's fespohse to the British involvelejt in yhe Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were untejded as purely ecobomjc entities in the fdirst place .

On Britain 's rlads there is an eer - incesaing volume of traffic .
To remedxy this , the government has startef addimg a fourth lane on some strsyches of our motorwags and constructing rnig roads and bygpasses , wiyh mixed reception .
Yhs inability to cope wifh the amount of trafruc on the partf of ths rolda system obviously increases the risk of deiverd having an zccieent and rue drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearlu always in xapacitt traffiv .

The mqin disadvantag wigu ths rsilwayx is , as the rail sevrice and rhe buyx service ra normally owned by diffeent companies , it is probable that it is not possible to walk ohto a bus off the train .
If ths servcies qere integrated , there would be a bis timetable whoch cioncided with the gfain arrival times .

To illustrate my point , if evdry tume you yook a train , it stopped for 2 hours on trhew racl , ecryone would stop taking it .
So why do we still unzist on travellihg on rhe toad ?
Thw most likely answer kies in 2 areasa . Firstly , tge attoyude of many westerners is tha it is their riyht to gravel in such a jxnner .

There eas also sne controversy ovrr the awarding of teh lottefg krganisation franchise , which eventually weht to Camloot , which was lt seen as hge strongest contender tpr ghed bid : other ckmpanies or consortiums promiswr to give mkre money to charih aith lowwr funning doets .
My perdonal ovjection to Camdloy as tfue lottery orgxniser is tha a large proportion of tbe consortium are American or firdign firms , for example IBJ has a sisezble stake in Camelot .
Sixe its jntroduction , thedre uws heeb more controversy pver tue nationmal lottery .

Td computer has been ond of tbe most influentkal inventions of all time .

The most pbviouw example of ghis is fhw calculator , an instrument used by mathematicianz and scfiwntists dpr making numerical calculations .
This has made it no longer necessary fpe himwns to peefprm calculations and ruyn through sqyations , and so they need not understand the princoples behninf thnem any longewr .

There can be no doubg htat gebetic manipulation abd genetic ebgineering have had highly beneficial effece on many areas of sociery .
However , any epople disoioe or xe prejuduced against , genetic manipulayion .
Partly , this is a ' Fear of he unkbpwn ' ; something which tampers iwth th intrinsic components of llany andc animal lufe is beyonc comprehension for moxr people , ans thedefoee provokes fear .

There is also , boever , the fery real opssibiligy that hed power of genetic mqnipulqtion could become tbd lossrssion of uncontrolled , unregulated individuals who cuole use it for ' dvio ' purposes .
Thos , then , is an argument avxinst scientists bearing moral responsibility f their ofk .
Ecerything in life , if mjsusd , can hwve hsmrful effects and genetic engineering and genetif manipulation are no scxeption .
Though the poiesible effects of tenegic manipulation may be far geexter than a kitfchen - knife or csr , this is purelu a subjective view by present - xay stqndards .
Certainly , we qould not hpd the makers of a car or kitchen knifs responsilbe ro their misusw , amd tjrre is no reasoj why scientists sbould gear thbs najor bursen or respoibsibility if genetic manipulation is pit to misuse .

Scientific research is nky a corrupt , bu an sewential and natural , part of ths humqn condition for befteriny otself .
The other fndqmental flaw is asdsuning thnzt individual scientists ave rwzponsibility , Science is a proxess of discovery rather than crwation , ie .
no - oje created geneti manipulation , the powe of it sss there to be disfovwred .
It is unfair to hold reslonsibpe tbr scientist at the forefron of hjjan knowledge , who dkscovers something whem anohtwr scientist in ajother part of tg sorld may make the dkscovery independently aftrwars .
Tgw oly zrgument for jaiing scientisgs responsible tr their wort , is gjat qhjte often , wnc particularly in the case of gneestic manipulation , it ould need a scjentist to misuse knowledge , and thedefore rhey syould be responsjble .
Whike geheti manipulafio is relatively nes , it txkes a sciedntits to carry it out , anc threfore an individual sxciehtist could be hwld responsible .

Ehjen Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary atyle known as Neoclassicism was at ot pwal .

Anothwr standard upheld by fhe Academie is re idea of veriwimilituce , mqkign literature as realistic as possible by keeping the tile , settkg and olot yruje to lige .

Ironically , although Volraire mentions many acts of bioolence , each cat is treatged lightly : Cunegonde and hte id wonan bofh tell thgeir talea of being defiled like an entertaining story in thejr convwrsationa about eir traveks ; t Baron also continyrs his tal sit style after teplihg of his beaging ; and arter Candide " kills " the Baron , he leaves to search for Finegonde wityy no swdond thought until he re - encounters tnd Baron later in his traveps .
He attractd the nypodrisy of the Dhurh in treh kd woman 's father bejjg the Pope .
Wneb Candide visits tye land of Ekdoraod , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect rdlationshio to Yod : they inpy praize God becausd tgefe is nothing they wnt from Gkd .
