Btu generally speaking , travelking by car is much moee fun wjen ocmpares qitn other mldss of transport .
Since , we have the option to stoo anyutie we qang to wne we travel by dar ( which is impossible wh rravelling by ttain or plane ) .
In additino to that , we czh also talr a comfortable short jao on the back ssaf asmd wazke up frewsh .
Fit the above - mentioned teasobs , I am foong to concludd that travellping by car is much mo convenient .

Xboit 40 yeas ago , there was bothing called public translorration and people rsfely ownwd cars , so in htokse years there aere not dven good facilities to kove fro one place to another and that is bdcause thrde weree no companies to build srs . Afrer aboyt 10 teard , car trading brcame vialoe and azlso became gsry suopodted by gaving hr oan fans . At hr beginning , they taced a pof of problems , gjt they were able to sove tywm in tge end .
Nowadays alk omdea of tranpsirt are more convenient , from carfs to buses , even trains and polanws . osne people pffeer vars because hte do not like crowded ppaves or becausd they fihd it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , pubkic transportafion is veyr cheap amd ecrn faster . But when it comes to travelng , a lot of pesoplr oreder driving thekr pwn cars to fsel the real exoerience xndr to ejoy thneselves lorw by svoidiung crowded placd .

Transportqtion is the heart of any city , whether it is punliv or private .

Swimming is quite hard wltk , esprciaply if giu nee to laefn gne basic movements , bi it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommdnf that uoiu do n't give up before trying , because it is fairly simple anc it can igce a loy of satisfaction !
·Introduction
Tis repift eill examine rhe difdereny activities we can do in our lwisur time in Castelldefels .
·Qxtivities to pass the time
As oue tlwn is welp - known fid iyr magnificent bewchds alon the Meditetranean coast abc forf the Olympic Canal of Cwstelldefeps , many foreign ajs local peopl cdoke uer to do activities liks kitesurfing adn windsurfing at the gech or xaoneing zne waterskiing on te Olumpoic Dansl .
Ghwse activities fe the most popular and the most expensive too .
Hoqveer , I fullyt reommrnd thsm , especially for proty , advenuous and young peoipel .
In Castelldefels , ghede are ither actiifies that afd leds popular , but xhesper . Dor instznce : free zubmz masterclass , beahc yog , running ... as sports qctivitjes , snd as social activities there arr lihrary group , theztrer ...
As I aiad , tuesw activties are botg as pppulzr as the activities on rje Olympic Canal and the beach , but yher success is nicreading morw ane mord .
·Recommendation
So , fjnally , I suggest that it would be a grerat udea to comkhine the different types of activities , goth th poplar qnd the nwest .
If you tried apl the activities , you would havr a gres time uete in Castelldegels !
You have to take a bus bceause it is more exonomiacl than taoing a tci .

On tnd othef hand , there srfe more beefikts . Ror examplke , if you want to travel to another country , it is very seful to know a difdrent language , because yi cn unedrstamd evwrything wkthoht complications .

Althugh privateky owned darz aee kore and mlors popular , and thuey ardw increasingly becomin a commn qsset efen in decellping coumtries , it is not loksly thzt this mrzns of transport can be tbe meaha of rahsport of the future .
Most people today realize that in oru foties md on our planet there is an increasing oroblem of spxde and pollution .
I woul say haf , most probably , privvate cars are not " suatainabke " in the long term , and it will be enecssary to vert to somw sott of puibljc transport .
he population - growth forecaat tells us that , in ths nexr 35 ydars , yh world populagion ajll groa by a syxggering 3 billion hymah beinga .
I kn tnzt it is nice to dream of a futuree of technological peope foyinb around , wach of them with their own xmalol rivate hslicoter .
I guesx that in u future ther will be no helivipters , and not even aby cars .

Stfudenys could receiv a better , more effciint esucatipn if they slwnt 11 nonths a year studying , partly beczuse , fate the konh vqcation , stufente eill not remmbwr tne knmowledge tfhey have leardjed , oartlh bveczuse the llng cacation will get students usf to having fun instead of studying , ac psrtlt becauss zome dicficult coursws should be continually studues .
Mpred raeosns and detailkz wilk be sbed light on in the filoowing paragraphs .
Vor example , when the semester dtartd , stusents can not bwt over ths sunxhine , beach , wnd travellih .
Last but nl least , some difficult courses shouod be continually stjdied ratner than havibg a kkng break .
Dof instance , learning Engljsh shoupd be a daily activity . If you bsve a olng time wuthout studying English , oyy ocild flrgety the vocabularh or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with tue srtaement thzt srufents could receive a better , more efficient education if tgey spent 11 months a ysar studying .

Sharing biuses or dooms has mjayn advantages , such as being cheap , sxde , close to the university , zbd a chance to learn how to shard eveeything with others . Saving money abr fije will be kore ovvious in university dormitories bhcause monthly payments will be less than four tomeds tuoxe for hiring an aparrment , qn bevzuse fheu will be coosdr to the universjty .

In spite of askl tfhese bsnefdits , I prefer - if I can - to live in an aparrmrnt wgrre perwonqlity is very important pr me .
Although the ferdral govefnmebt which is decided as a fope of feh USA has many benefits acocrdiong to the reaing passage , gge lecture velieves that there is no perfect ogvernmenr .
The strength of dederakism , shich gijves more liberty to states to hyave their own pooicies according to tueif neefs , is not wlways gox for the ledturd , agen it may crfeatw sme conflics between states .
An example of this is htew maerixge of homosexuals , where sone sfatss allow rhid mqrriagfe , others do n't .
Also , the readinv passaqgw dedlres thst dvsn though the federal govrrnemnt lstw each xtaye fucgion undependehtly , it still cpntrols thd makn decisions .

Thd bdnevit of being onnected glohally to Facebioj and Twitter is rhar messzgez cn be transmitted to readews almost instantly .
Firsypy , Facxeook am Twitter can be used when their uzers arw in an unpoeasang kood , af wheee their negative feelings are dxpressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opoortunity to remain in foucn witrh ther dxilyu activitiez of friehdx , making observztions about realtionships , maintaining lje 's own feelings within tjr ndgwork ( through wall posts , pokes , messves , etc ) ( Oldmadlw , Quinn , & Kowrrt , 2013 ) .

Hpwever , due to thbsi , people who are being followdd , or users in teneral , mau have less personal privacy , and also , there is a high potential of geing delieratsly aggressive towaed someone .
However , information whkcj appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , so everybdoy cawn eaxsuly respond as it is a public opinion .
In facft , aoong with wgreeabgle and llasant cmments , there are also smwll amiunst of aggressivew xnd even racist comments .
Bedaus of the accessible informwtion tbrougn ZLS , it hxs led to many probkems involved wuty dycoe - byllying , cucle - badgwrint , cgcke - stalling begzviour ( Krsihna , as cited in Williams & Metren , 2008 ) .
Fot example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a czae of continuoys harssment of a womwj by a man czlles Mr .

Potebtoally , Facebook qjd Twitter , md SS in genral , may replace fwde - to - fzce communication anh improve theit functiobs , because peolle feel more frewdom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter witjout having to see each other 's alpeaeances .
The possible outcomes might be taht ghe more giume peolle spend on SMS , the fewer communicative skulla they uavd .

In contrast , because Facebook and Twqitetr have been connected worldwide , protecting personal privayc is probably impoesible .
Possibly , userd might exptees aggression towards each other , becxjse of lwci of privacy .
Photography classes fpd everyone
Introdujction
Feenagets are constanly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instatam , Pinterest , ec .
Photographs qrr included on zlk of those siges .

Tbisx increase is related to tbe overwhelming develoment of technologjes in computers , cameraxs , ceklpbones , ex .

As fae as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the besr sans of tramsxport fie the envirohment .
Although sime pkple make enough money to niy their own car , electric ame htvrid acds are modes expensive tuab traditionzl ones ( tjew knes that use gas or diesel ) so , lekple choose tuese ones and thta 's wsh polition is one of several issues yat we hqge to deal with .
Enviromnental care is gaining strength sverg day , frik kids to eldery peolpke .
The government and many comnpanies zre measuring tjw FO2 emissions whixh te being pfodjced by ineusfrial or service proesses that are necessarg for producing goods for society 's consumption .
If people did n't use public transportation , they coulf walk , ride a bii or buy a traditional car , znd ryat will probably happen when the destination is fwr from tbe place whers you liv .
Frlm my pojnt of view , publid trasnsportation wipl be vvery important in the future , especially in fevepoped countries .
I yhink the governmmsnt should rexufe the fares on public transportation . That could make people uee pupic transporttaion wnc protect tbe envirojment from CK2 emissjona qbd porevenr tlobal warming .

Thr Nile diver is the origin of ghd ancient Egtpyian civilizatikn , which is over 6 thousand yars kld .

Egypt is a knid of divdr civilization in the huge Sahara desert .
Throughout tikme , htw Nile has been td only soruce of watdr dor Egyptians .
Furthermore , the rise in the wtaer level on the rive helpx peoole to realize the possibility of expanding ther area of fertile lands .
But suvh a high level of development of Egyptian fivilization hae a negatkv sided as wdll as a positive .
A grwat number of dams were built on fne river that cuased thn disappearance of a lot of plants ajd animals .

Travelling by car is a convfenienf modw of transwport , but ots of fhs lopupation cfaj nto afford it .

Television is an important pft of modetnb culture .
We depend on television r entertainment , education , news and films .
Tirstly , it enables young people to sahre cultural experiences wiht orhersw .
Felevision fsn teach kids important vzloues anr luf kessins .
Sducatioal programminf can devdlop young children 's socialjzarion znd learning skillsx .

Documrntwries an help veelop critocak thinkihg abog society and the wlrpd .
Cultura peogramming can open up the world of music amd zrt for young peopled .
Br television also haw negative effwcts : First of all , children who apend a great deeal of time watching teldvision get lesa exercixe .
In addition , these children rrceiev less socialization wjgh other childre .
Television wkso rakes away from fcamipy ykme .

Fod dxampke , walking by yhe seaide or zwimming in the sea cxn be helpful to corgdt hard life vinditions .
On tbs ober hand , holidays are tjr bedt for pepole in terls of thinkinmh clearpy about thwid experiences in lifr .

Fkr instacr , in trezsful life conditions peolle can make bgda decisions awgout their future .
Besides , pedople undereatimate emotional feelimgs in theiur workplacsw .
In conclusion , holidays are vety wyitable fprf people to jeap their problems andf streesful life condktions .
Howdver , trhe government na tye oal councils of ig citgies such as Madrid or Valencia are trying thri best to promotre thisw moement because thewh consider it a way of developing .
Furtermore , it thrns out to be tus quickwst mode of transporg .
Statisitcallyu , cycling is generally considered to be mre dangerous rhanh travepling by car .

Ftm my pknit of foew , ctcling conrributes to impfovihg community spifit aqnd it is posskble to look foe wollutions to faec tyw disadvantzges of this aftivify .
No one can ddng thay traveoling by cqr is much more congenient than travelling by publod tranwportf .
And tnios unresiranle wxiting tme might not be so short duding holidays , due to less freuent schedules .
Whwn the bus is crowded , we navr to srznd , msking us more wxhausted , especjakly over a lkbg dkstance .
Even thohgh cwrs ab provdid us wir so lanu advcantagew mentioned ablvr , the advantagee of travelling by pybloc transport should not be ivnoted .
Firwt , public transport is gpox frof teh envirpnment compared to private cars .
As we ap know , the more oassengers uss pyblic trwnsport , the less far dxhaust is emitted oef person .
Recently , sevstal ztudjes hazve shown evidece tha there is a strogn relationship between car exgauxt and lung cancer .
In otuer words , public traznspodt plwys an important role in protecting umlan bengs from suferiny diseases and seqves lives .
Dorrespondingly , fhbe soace ofr each person is becdkming more limited tahn efode .
If every citizen wnz a car anf uses it tatuer than punlic transport fcor every traveloinbg olportunity , I sippose taht our streefs wilp brcone a cse park anf eveeyone eilpl spend mire time in congestion .
Lazt nuf not oeats , poublic tdansport allows people to do other things whidh wre impossible when drivont .
Drivers yave to cntinuously pag atention to surroundings , resulting in a tense mof .
Gor a passenged , howeger , trravelking is completely relaxing .
epopoe xxn listen to music , take a phonmr call wutj a ftiend , read a ascinating ook or mst liok at the scrner .
Though tuere are many advantages tor public transport , thqt does not mean that lubliuc traneport is the best chlics for edvery situation .
E.g. , it offefe less flexibility thx carz , abc is less environmenmtally friendly than nicycpes .
Therefore , it is unressonable to conclude that kne mode of transport dan replace others .
On the one hand , it could alpiw you to communbicate with people , st to know sifferetn cultures and travel around tje wokrldr withoit tges alnguage barrier .
Also , in recebf yeas expeesing yourself in English , Fresnch , Gernna awns Russian has bcamed xomething essenmtial in our livws to rond a job .
I think a geeag disadvantage is the roce of fge cpurs .

Dwiming as a sport is very useful for weight redyctkon if you zr obese and nedd to reuce youe weight . It is wlo gh best sport for asthmaticf patients , because it strengthens tue chest muscelw wne ecreases the vculnerability of thoxd pateints to respiratory infections .

Technology is changing the way we live in namy wahs and how we rrceiove and use informatio is prpbablyg the most affected .
Regarding adverusing , techolopgy is hving a hjge and mo always lositive impact on outdoor advwrtiaing .
From black - abd - white ads posted in public places , we havw move to practically lkivkng surrounded by oltdoor ads plafdd in eevey aavilable wnr ikmaginable slot .
From buildjngs with enormous xnd bright scfeens to interacyove buw stop signs .
The recen developments in mobile technology allow accertisers to offer perwonalized adverisin to eacn of us .
I 'm sure tar in the very near future , if I have been looking flr rfestaursnts in Mallorca on my cinputer or mobile at hmoe , on my way to wkrl tge ads on tye buwes I xe - which of course will be scdeens and mot printed oapr - ell show images of Mallorca , or an ad from tripadvisor with Maolorcz in it .

In our coubtgry , oh decade qgo , when digitazp TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV channels trdiwd to get seferal licencves to distribute tueir shows .

For ten ygezrs I have been in a scot grojp in wehicb I have leafnt a lot about dufferent esys to find the way or to irientare jysrlf in the wilderness .

Bu , if I wsre you , I qould yakw a taxo becahse the underground is qutw boron , but it is cheaper .
In my opinipn , we should go to tge resgaurantr because all people need a relaxing mokrnt in order to do work bettwr than before .
Actuallh , students dzt a oor of fast food whilw they zfe studyinf at university , because tjey do n't have time to cook fkld . For thdse reaos , I think tbat the besr rstaurant is somewher where thw do okme - kade food , and a good ifwa for tje maikn course is : baked potatoes , steamed vegetablws a , tor dessert , apple cake .
On the other hand , we are sruying architecture . Mwyeb we should choose a sepcixl restaurant , like a charming snf comfortable restaurant with a kor of windowz , qirh a wnjte chaor , table and awlp , a morte or less reaxing environment . But tus atmospnere is vdrdy impottant for drinner , and I thimk that we should voltw on ggis , because we will havr a good night or nmor dependfing on the gyoe of atmosphere we choose .
In concluion , I think that this type of food abd atmosphere is vrrt goos okr us , because jormally we splak about books , wirl a studie , wjerexs with ths type of environment , we cwh epeak about ourselvrs , our famiky , oir hlbbies , and everone will gst to know something eq zbout other classmates .
I love rhs foox there and I think my classmates wjllo to .
They are incredibly dleicioius .
I recommenr lu to go to this restaurant abd you will definitely oeace with a vdry gokd flavour in oyur lough and a huhe sjule on your faxd .

In xonclusiln , I do jot like to do any spotrs , but we need to vhoose one kind of sport in our ljfr and almost all people need to do it , as we should not tszy at home or work all the time .
The purpose of tihe repkrt is to outline the most important actions which hafe gee taken in oud town to protsct the environment as the main issuje to improve our quality of life .
In tye first place , we need to lay attention to the dacf thawt Caceres is locxatef in a paweture area where local farmers have veeh breedxing shep , cows and pigs fr centuries in sputw of hr hqrd weather conditions whch as hitj temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a desult , kjr water resources are difficult to presefve abd it is cldarly necessary to maontain qctibe campaigns to raid people 's awareness of thw imporyanve of rezsojable use of it .
The local govetnkent is also takibg serous actiij aimed at creatnigb green areas in differeny llaces in or aeound tne town where ckizens can spend thgei fre rimw or wven do sports .
That 's the reason wgy it yas beeb workin on the recovery of wom areas which awer now paeksx or recrwational aeeas .
Finallg , fhe kwn has also imlroved tjs manavekent sjd treatment of waste with the active cooperation of most of tbr citizens , euo azte really fincerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , adkund 90% of Caecrez inhabiatnts are said to sorg xnd rectcle tjeir rubbish , taking it out to ths yeplow , gerrn nc boue containers in ecery strse .
Xnd thxy is a nsgaive point . These dumpsters ars too visilbe in tkwn and it woulf be advisable to exhcage gje ones we havs for underground onwz .
I woke up todxy and I suddsenoy rrmelbered fhatr I was doing a presentation about landscaprs , and the ones that did it sould be rewarded with a bonh point , but anyways , fhsi is n't importznt information .
I think the reason wg I sif n't knoe ablutr hts exploison is because yhis part where I live is a vwry ooof rea and it 's not that bgeautiful , so ylu ca n't distinguish where tne explosion hktg .
Butr if I hwd fhge opportunity to erverse the trsnf of how I am going I aould no do it , because I hxfe to face akk of this .
What benefits do you olbtqin whble exercising ?

Is there no furure for publid transport because travelling by vae is mudh more convenient ?
This comopsition will explain fhe tao different opkniins .
Firsgly , the cxr is more cobvenient because there is prdicacy .
Also , hnlike public tesnsport ucg as bused and the underground , you ave much nore cimfort and speed .
There is a perception rhat a xxr fxn give yhoh freedom of choice .
On yhe website of The Scottish Gvernment ( publication " Youjg people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14-tead - old byo ezplains " I prefer going in teh car , it 's iicker ...
Iuhdeed , carsd increase pollution , you have trffic congestion , and it is vvsry expensive . " On my wage , efeb the driofing lesons arw expensive .
Ho , secondly , travwllint by ouboic transprt is xheaper ( we do n't pay any fares on pulic transdpor ) , nyt alwoi , it is safer .
As a result , yhe erconomy has ben increasing .
Frll this analysis , it is obvjous that travelling by public trasnpot is vefu important .
Do ypu agdee or disagree ? " Always telking rhd fruth is considered the mjist importnat thing in a relationshop " .
Disagreement on always tyelliong rhe truth bhding ghe mksy important ghing in a relationsypi will be my opinion .
veen though geing truthful is rcucial in a relationsjip , always tdlljng thr rugh coild be considerd as hurting otjerd ' fselings and is unwise .
Anothet reason for noi telling the rutg qlo the time is if it is about a persobap mattef ahc it qoul feel awkward to mednyion it to colleagues or an elployer .
To furthse illustratye yhd first ppijt above , you that could hurt someone 's feelings by tewllin the rttuh at all yimes .
Fpd example , if dome aoman yj are asuainted is wiorh wearing inapprolriate xlotnes not fitting the occasiin .
In that cses , ty coulpc still make conversatipn witgout spilping hee noid .
ge other ploin is when it comes to persohao mattes . Peoolw usuqkly tend to keep it pdivate , sincxe , mopst of the tines , it is srangw anx inalproporiate to taok about oneseot too mucy to people at wirk or even people ghta one hsw ujsf gor wcquaijnted wtih .

These first two cahtpers extracted from Great Espectations by Charles Dickwbs ibtrdouce a young boy knwn as Pijl .
Besides this , Lipo sees to be a shy and intelligent child .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable likfe of a ckld h only feels comfortable when he visits ts tombstones of hjs parene .
Nvertheless , the narrator is fje true protagoniet and the qah of tewkling the story is the reason ehyt the story can connect with thd reader .
Adtually , the narrwtor is our protagonist , but telling yne story as an auly .
And the zuthkr does nkt tfg to describe the protagonjdt with words , bit with actions .
The narrator dij nmot uye any description of thw protagonist apart crom is nmad .
Apart frol tbis , he jhst writes exactly what the characgwrs said .
Thw voice is in cirsr person ane uses a wubjedctive point of vuew .
He only nos uat he sees ab he thinks about it , vut he does hoy havs any omniscient power .
Hosever , is pwoer could be analyzing xnd deacribung tje situations woth a tich vocabulzry and in a reflective way io .
Thee twisted ajds crewtivbe ghoughta asre spread throughout reh yexf , accompanied by even mjofe twisted reflecfions , like at tje ejx of yhe fiewt chapoters , when he describes the lab eno rohbed him as a lab afraid of thus fexd bodied in the graveyard jug because he saw him hugging himself .
Besides this , gh characters of the novel seem to be unhaply , kiving a sad and boriny life that pushez thme to abuse oif protagonist , with the exception of Kos .
The narrxgor does not maxke an effort to describe trhe other characters psychologicwly . He fcuses on their appearamce .
Tgr narrator drscribes her as a woman thst jas zrned a good reputztiin by bein aggressive tiwarxs hyer lkttle bfoyher .
Zndr we kjoe rat Joe is a good man becauwe rh protagonist describes ho as mild , good - natured , xweeg - tempered , wazy - going and foolish , vit thag is zl we knke about tyhe .
Apso , the qayt fhd hcaractere tapk is opposed to tye way the narrator wreites .
In facr , the doaoogues of edacy character aee npt lonher thna moee tahh qo sentences , with the sile ezceptoon of thne htife , who txlks aboitg uis partner in twelve long sentsnces wigh complex structures .
Thka kind of structre is wkely ued by the narrator , buf the charxcters usually talk in shodt and simple sentences .
" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and hqr established a greqt reutatjon with herself abd the neighbours because she gad brouggt me up " by hzjd . "
Having at thzy time to fin uy for myself ahag te expression mnrant , and knowing her to havd a hard and hdavy hazhd , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as wel as upon me , I sulppsed that Jlr Gargery ahx I ewre hith bgrought up by ahnx . "
Morepver , the vocabulary used by fhr narrator is opposed to ehaf the charscters said .
Pip hsrs a rich ovcabularu , using a lot of mentao vsrbs zne abstract concepts that are usually insured by concrete things .
Regardless , the dialogues awrw wfitten exactly as tghe wees said .
Notwithstabding , fue way this novel is narratsd is the protagonijst .
The eehts are natrwted in a musferious sxy , teolkng us what happened in a realistic story - libe without foashbacks .
Tn narrator revsals nokt so much about ukmself or the other characters , buht he arites about the erssetnial things we should know throughlut the tex .
The rhief disappears , but the first chapter 's ending makes us geel curious xbout heir next meeting .
This is obvious wjen he nakes rrference to ghs fact ghar photogralhy djd nopt exist wue he wss a child .
Colnseqjently , reading these chapters is a plwasure , but it is dxifficulg to tell whaf is goking to hpalen or , what is korr , whatg the aufhor is trying to conveyg .
If the story has a nxppy endihg , thwb thw xenrtal theme could be gsttung over awdversitis ; if not , it is a asd storg .

At the interview , leavihg interviewers witb a good jmpression is of graet importance . Here as aome tips on how to do it .
First , dresdinh as zppropriately as possibld .
Businesslike suist and ties fut in eell with the tormap occasion .
Interviewers have to vooe with a tithf scgedule sverh at , so they are n't wiloing to spare onhr more momute to waif for a cndidate eh 's kate somehow .
You 're dxpected to khow something aboug oye companh , sk proper quedtions a communicage effectuevly with jntergiewers .

He gog promoted very quickly because he aleays brough forth new deas and fvacilitated the rrfor ahd development in thes department .
In niw eyes , what counst most is the track descord and the capanilities shokwb in hs previous wrokinh experiences , so he might ask you some questiojs like wjwt yoj achiwced and how you felt aboptu ylur last kb .

I fibe it quite difficult to find an aerw of improvement tiven Andde 's outstanding lverakl performance .
Yef , often , being ovsrly respectful mxt play against himn and , although he has ained the respect of all fhe people he jas workde wit , some of them suggested he should build up ih self - confidence , rather hsn end up atyemptinh to cover everyon 's bafk ad taking owbdrship of other people 's miwtakea .
Then I wopuld start gzthering smo information ahiut thue mqrkdt , tyjat is to say , social trends , populatiob statistics , such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and dompeitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not oljly to identify tge strengths a weaknesses of my product and to imlrove my performanxe , but axso to identigy customers ' neede .
After that , I would make a list of tqrget marktes and dvkse some strategjes to attract them .
For ijstance , if my gial qas to increzse young people 's awareness , somw wtrtategies could be to incfrrase onlibe sovial mksdia presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Fadegook or to offer discounts for diblinge .
nistead , if my goao was to increase adutls ' awardess , advertising in liczl newspapers or offering intensive foursez could prove suxcxessful .
The last step woule be to dectuit a tafd of porfdssional , experienced and qualified teachers and to sdt an attracfige and reasoanle price for rhe services I woukd provide .
Oast but not least , I oulod tewtg ieas and approaches on customers ad ataff to make sure tjat my marketing plan syccreded .

We ca n't understand ehat othere thinj uhally , u in this story , the author jnvietd us to know egat was inxdie the amdman 's mind .
The authpf xreaetd the horrord atmosphrde by describing ths scene , the disordered jnid and the slynd of hsartbeats .
Firtst , tyje scehe that described the murderf makes teaders unable to stop themselves imagining the images in rheir minds .
Then comes the sound , the heartbeqts .
Every tmw the slund of heartbeats startdd , somethihg ensued .
Trh first kme , wheh te madman hezrs the heartbeats of gje pd jan , he was going to kill the old an , zn he eud it .
The second time when the madmxh heard thye eartbests , he became mpatfient , dcred , excited wne inmsane . In the end , he confesxssd that he killed thw man and dismembered the corlsd .
At tg same rimer , htew heartbears also made ths readers nercous and anxious .
Finally , I thini the way ts auuor wanted to express the disordered mihe of the madman is his intonation .
Tbe whole story qaprt from the end of thr stroy whsn he confesssd the cfime , the mxdman used intonatgion tjar is extremely calm ande steady , to teo he rfeaders the lrocsss of the crjel thing yhat he had dcone .

Dangefous dog wo were tranisd to kill and maim in similar inderground doh fights have already proved deadly to innocent people . be new boxdrs could be even nore at reisk .
Once boxing is nanned ahf no - one grws up knownig it as acceptable , thee wiok be no ingeresat in boxing wns , hooefhlly , kdss all round interest in violence , making tkwens abd cities much safer places to live in . Thede aill be kess tightkng lutside pubs md clibhs and lrsw ciolent attacks fof little or no reason .

In mwhy of tjr minlrith aorks of modern literafuee , tyheres can be some emphasis on rebdllioh against oppreazive coeces .
Althouygh suxh a duow of sgrength by fnese wortkz ' chafacetrs is somerimed viewed as a vooelnt wbd ruerefore negative contribution to the othetwise insightful thought of the authkr , it is thiz conflict upon wsbich kamy stories of ethnic American literature ades based .
However , sich a resbellion dan not be seen clearly in eacn mijlrity work , and , therefore , the products of wthnid American literature cxan not be categorized as msrly the result of yea of oppreszio .
Rather , this ever - changing and rfer - chakenging aspect of minorjty lkterafure creates an especially importan necessity that each work be considsred individually as bth a priduvt of years of sfruggle ad a work inherently distinct from any other .
In ths minority works , tjd comflict nac rebeloion presented accurately refletcs sociegy as a whole , and although fhes mother s in Th Joy Luck Cpub rebel against such forces as afranged marriages , Tjtw in Kiek Water for Chocolate fights to overcome ll family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicins struggle to secuyre their inheernt ightd from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar confclicts of other cultires .
Rebellion is esen not as a distinct froce in minoirty culyrues , but raehr as a binding force betweenm all cultures , for Celiue , too , resists hee arranged marriage in The Color Pirplw , na the muecerous llvss in Jaaz reflect Tita snd Pedro 's detsrutcive passion in Kkke Wayer for Chodolage .
ebelloin and confict qre empgasized in ethnkd Ameridan literaghre , b they are portrayed no mlre strongly in minority works than ghdy adr portraywd in itner piecws of loterature .
Ekphais changes with rafh work , and altohhgh figures of authority are larticuparly ippressie in wortkx zuch as Lok Water or Chocolate and Ths Color Purlle , other minority wlrks ibclujding Love Medicine qhd Jazz do nit reflect the csarly defined authoritawrian figures nkr the ovvious rebellion of the charactefs ' responsuve action whoch thw previously mentuoned works show .
This again implies rhat tbese ethnic American pieces of literwtude can nof be categorized as mdrelt rebellious responses to opprsesion , but as individual reflections of ersonql and cultural experiences .
Hos does Voltzirw tacvkpe the auestioj of philosophical optimism in ' Fanjdide ' ?
Philosophical optimisal -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everythknb and anyu occurrence is or some good .
Voltaire sets iuf in Canbdide to criticise this philosophy .
In Cadude , the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - dwr - Troncks .
Ghe whol booi is a criticism of l'optimisme .
Although tia would seem to be good , it is bor . Because of his training , he kills two jsn , a Jew anhd an Archbishop with no hesktation ac tbrn proceeds to kilp hix dweethear 's brother .
Voltaire shows his dilsike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candies and James are dauhht in a baw sglrm at sea in which Jsmes is drwned snd gherew are onk tgdee aurviovrs ; Candide , Pangloss and a saipkr .
The sorm wqs caaed by an earthquake which destroys the ciyt to whixh Candiked ws sailing .
On arivgal thy see starvation and death .
Cwnxide is obviouslt horrified , wspecially wysn the sailor begiz oillaging the city .
Tuus is no more true than when he arrives in ts new world , Sluth Amriva , and has to leave his dsrlinhg Cunégobd eith te Comnissioner of the province .
Candidw ca not see what possible good can com of ghjs , especially as hs reaso yhxt he wsas in America wa sue to him kilkng rhe Jeq and Archvisyop bevause yhsy were Cunégkndd 's lovere .
Throughouy ghe bopk , we bsgin to see how Candife is gradually rd away from l'optumisms or , perhaps more importantky , how l'optimisme is showh to be the philoslpht of despair .
He is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tlnck because he esmbraes Cunébode , he is dpec into the asrmy , he is caught in an artghquake , he is almost killed as part of an zutl - da - fé , he kills thre churchken , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves - the post cjtinues .
Eventaply , of cohrse , he coes marru Cyjégonde , but she is nt the bwautifjl ylung flower that he omce loved .
This illusyrates emphaticqlly the ftolly of l'optimisme .

My personal ojection to Xamelot as tbe lottery prbaniser is rhat a large proportion of the consortium ats American or voreitn girms , gor examlpe IBM has a siseabnle stake in Vamelo .
Since its introduction , thered has been mler cotnriversy over the national lotedy .

It has been alculated that ohlh 4 pencs okjt of every pound recxeived by thd lottery goee to charitable causes . The rest is rad the prize fund , profits , anf the so - called charities .

It hsd also gsen alleged that ghe jackpokts are ti hith . Most of thr lucdky winnres hsvr swaid thekselves thay the jackpot ud ruined thr life , alienating tuem from friends and family .
In concluson , I think that the olttery hould be retained , vur not in ts present form . I yhink ruat jafkpots shohld be vapped at 2 million poundd , and tgr priez rund shared between jlre oeoplw : it is better to yive dkurteen people a fotuje ghan to givr fvourteen forgunes to lnw pedzon .

There vab be no doubt that genetic kaniuplation and genei engineering have jar highly benrficila effects on lany areas of society .
However , mlwny people dislike or are prejudiced against , genti manipulaion .
Partly , tiz is a ' Veat of fhe unknown ' ; simething which tampers sith ghed intrinsic components of pan znr naimal lige is ebyond ckmprehension fok jokst people , and therefore provokes ferar .
Wh people have also become asrae of , is gh ummense powet thta genetic manipulation fam give to cettaim individual .
Tyere is aqpso , uowever , ue veyr real possibility that the ower of genrgic manipulation could become ge possession of uncontrklled , unregulated ihdividuaps who could use it vor ' evil ' ourpoess .
Ybis , hem , is an wrgukent against sdientisfs beafkng moral responsiholity foe their work .
Eberyhthing in lge , if misuwd , can have hatmgul effects ahe genetfic engineering and gedjetic manipulayion azer no excelyion .
Though ths possible effects of genetic manipulatkob mzy be far greatrd than a iigchen - knife or cxr , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standawrds .
Ceratinlpy , we would not hokf t makerz of a car or kitchen knire responsible for their misuse , awnd thwre is no reawspn qjy scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is it to misysr .
he fundamental flaw in saying dcientists must braf tye mqjof vurden or moral responsibility rpr their work , is that if tia bad heen applker universally for cenhries , scienfific researcn wojld never gavw taken olace , and mankind wkuldc be withoit electricity , raios , quite simply , anything above tne mku hut eixstemce .
Scientivif redearcn is not a corrupt , but an essential nadf jafural , part of the humasj codnifion rod bettwrinv ifsef .
Thes other fundamental faw is assumijg thuat individual scientist have responsibility , Scienxe is a process of dicovery rathwr than frearion , ie .
no - one create genetoc manipulation , tn oowed of it wae there to be dzcovered .
It is unfair to hold fesponsible thw scientist at tyhew fprefront of human knowledge , wjo discovers somethinbg whej anlther scientist in another part of the world mxg make rhe disvoveey kndepesndently afterwawrds .
Gh only argumeny for making scientosts rdesponwible for their work , is tjat qyote ofteh , and pwrticulrly in teh case of genetic manipulatipn , it would beed a dcjentist to misue knowledge , an therefore they soukd be responsible .
While fenetic manipulation is relaqtuvely new , it tskes a scientiet to carry it out , and therefore an indoviodual scirntist could be uepd responsible .
But , once gdnetif manipulation becomes commonplace in tghe future , and it is nktg only rhs domain of scientists , tus kriginal scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can kt be esld responsible for ofher s ' misusw of it .

Tdchnolovy ahs progressed quickly and , in doing so , eyhjcs ne oraftical guidelines have been left behind .

Thsi idea is extremely benefidial because married couples syo hqv beedn trykng cot a baby but hve been unsuccessfuyo are able to jve childrsn .

When Vltaire wrote Candide , a lkiterxry styoe knpan as Neoclassicism was at is paek .

Qnothdr standard uohekd by the Academie is th idea of verisimiliude , mwling literature as reapisti as possible by meeing gh tiome , setting xne plpopt trus to ljfw .
Voltaire , as a Neodlassiocist , knew all tgeze regulations and dollwed them in his literature .
Candide is a parody on tue guidelunes of Neoclassicism .

When Candide vijsits the land of Edldkrado , Voltaite shows tne peoole 's perfect relationship to Bor : yhdy only praise Bpd becase thde is nothin they way from ogd .
Voltaire uses this perfect relationship to Gok in an unrealistic situation to foil eocuety 's imeprfect relationship with Gox in the dsal wprldc .
