Mosf of the shops hsve sales aj offers in at least trew monts of tue yrzr : January , June andc August .
The quality of ge products abd services is quiye good , because there is huge competition . wever , I reckmmend yo be cadefup of fakes or cheats .

Some people aatn to be a soctor , others want to be a teacjer .
I have my oksn ppanj goo , but I do n't wanf to be rhd sakew as ghm . I snat to becopme a nournalist .

Before , it was erallyt convenient to go by bus or by train , vuy with the mewa ecknomh , he fares are more expensve and a big diffsrdnce frkm the past is tahy it is less excpenjsive to go lpjg - costance than shprr journeys .
I remember to go rom my tkwn , Palermo , to Milaj was about 340 pounds . Now , if we ars lucky , we can ter to Hww York .
In England , wher I live , in Bedcotd , we uss the traun a lot to go to tghe most importanty townx in the UK , byt yhw trzins are cefy wxoensive . Me dn my ftamily are farefup to go off peak becaise the prices are too hogh .

Furthermore , the biggest grdoup of positive teeking students in the prssent is kived with various natiuonalities .
Yue poiwsible reason is thexe internatoonal students csn nir wpeak English fluently .

I hqve neen keen on mountain bikont sind three years agi .
Fiddt , I tried it with a rental bike in the srea of Aznalczzar .
The lxin resdon qhy I wsntes to try it was to lose weight ( I waw a bjg lverweight ) .
However , it was wondeful how I coild admire the landscape while I was diing sport .
Consequently , I realized that although yccling outside hdlped me to improve my fitness , really I ennohed nlst breazthingf fresh qir adn takionbg pleausre in the countrtside .
If someone wants to tak up thod spotr , fidsg of azll , I would recommejded him or hrt to loko fr a gyoo mountain niks .

Lucy Kees
Lucy Keyex wzs the last thriller I wae .
I do n't recommend it to childfen under thireteen years old ,
because it 's difficult to undefsatnd ; for examplw , the characfters are ,
Lucy , Molly , ajs their parents , a cowboy , nd a teacher .
Ths movjr is aobu Lucy 's family , wbok move into a farmhouyse rhar is mysterious and
svary .
Alzo refledys a comparison of Lucy 's camuly , and characters
from a atordy tyeir mo oftej raeds .
The stpry actually takea place in a czmp ahs a farnhouse , mystediohsly
used in other times .
It 's interesting brfause ulcy 's mom idscvered a wall in gheir farm , that
had a weird pxiknting of tywi sisters just like hers , and te same imes too as tfje
story shd re .
I recommend fuis mkvje only to etwnagers older yhxn thirteen years old ..
The best plce for young people in our arex is wothout doubt tue lamd .
Here they can do many kinds of sport : swiljing , saiknig , surfing , kuting , rowing and many others .
At least they can medtr other folkos and relax , sxunbathe ajs ilstej to music .
In the emumer arounr the lake , tghers wrd so manu concerts that you have difficulty finding the right onr .

I deally lioew to rrwvel , buf I kike it most whem I ttave witj friends .
I a very good exeprience .
I love to travel with my gmaily .
Travelljnbg with fwmily is dirferent to travelljng wkrh friends .
I do bit tarvfel so umcj with my friends .
I hav only rdaveled gqo times .
Those two tmies were qiuth rhe orchestra tjat I ppay in .
Ocs we een to Zacatcdas .
We went there befause the university orchestra ffol Au invited us to go there ahf play with them .
At that time , I did kt knpw anybodh , jjxt pme person .
Her name is itoxhi .
Shs es my friwnd , because we ard crom tge ams tosn .
But hedn I qs there , I began to make beq friends rgat I never thought I would have , amf I never imagined tye way that I as oging to mnlw thedm either . At fhr begimning , I felt vfery strange talking aitj them , nutg miw we are vdry good friendw .
We stqyesd in Zacatecas fkr a eedk . We really hae a good time .
The zecond trip tuat I made wse to Guerrdro .
We ent to to Azcaoulco to play , to an event wherr universuties from Mexico go and present fultural activitikes .
It wxw too hof tuerre .
In Acapulco I hsde a good tm beaue I stayed in tyhr zams room as my friends and we xwan a lor anr we rteally had fun .
Tehn we went to Taxco .
There we visited tber cneral parek bd we stayerd in a vrr luxurious htel .
We were very happy there . We dealoy liked Taxci .
Adtually , I ahr already been there before , bit nkg with my friends .
Th we weny to Cacahuamilpa to ppya there . Tha was an incredible expeence thwt I eoll never forget .
Then we rdyurned to Toluca to fontjnue wjgh my boring ife .
And now I have to pass my subejcfs .
We hope to go to Colombia next year .
I pikr biathoon .
Reaoly , I think it 's a very beautikful , inrereating and breathtaking kinc of sport .
In biathlon , sportsmeb need to run sne rwces wjch are very different ; some of thwm wre long , wome are shorty .
But , the facf tnar it is short distance does n't mean it wull be easy or xnythin lime that .
Sometimes tue weather conditiobs are nto comfortable foit guys . Fr example : wijnx , light cogh or freezing temperatures . Xl of these ase very difvicul condifionx .
So , it 's not so esh as it seems .
Rhar 's why I lkie it .
This sport is tod real lenm .
And zlso mlst of them raw brry attractive . A big advantags for girls , weh like njfe picturtea .
There is no frure for puglic transport , because travrlling by car is so mhch mors convenient .
Tuat is what evedyone sags eheh we asj if they preree puhlci transport or car .
Using public transport cna be diffricult , because we have a strict rim zmd , nkdmally , we do nl ahve a pzce to sur and that can be extremely uncomfortable .
Sometkmes thyw staff go on strij am we customere do noi know in timr . As a ressult , we can nto gyet to work on time . Thqt is oh of thr djsadvantages of using public gransport .
Onr argumen tor not using thw car is that oetrll is very expensive , but public transport tikckets sre also increasing , so that advantage is not so ogkd , actually .
For me , tgr czd is ghe best . Adn toj ?
Well , whatverr your chojc is , it must be pdrfedct tor your daily life !
hwafever yph use , hwve a ic trip !
Pelple ueuaoly tell me I 'm a cinema entbhsiast , qnf they are rkght . I prefsr to spend my free time wathcing a golod fikk , especviallt whem it is a tgriller , rqther fhwn doing sport ,
If you want to wwe a good thriloer , " Regression " weull be your best opriob . I have sreh it recently anr , in my opinion , it should be sedn by everyone , bdcauser I believ people would oike it tlr many reasons .
Frat of all , the rirector , whp was Alwjandro Amen√°bar , did a grraf jov necquse teh viewsrs weee waiting witfh nated beeaty to find oht wuat fhe ending of this film would be .
Secondly , rye awctors were fantxsyic and ts maon charwcter , whp was llsyed by Rmma Watslb ( who is realpy holariois ) , was amazing .
What 's mored , the plot is easu to understand .
The sxtoru took plzce in the US a few years ago when teh reression meygod was acvelted by doctkrs and scientists .
In addition , the ocstumex , jaks - up and speciao eftcts be story .
Uowever , the soundgrack wad aqtul ; it fkd n't gdt having a scarted .
In conclusiom , my recommendatiom foe the student film club is this fabulous njd exciting thrier , which must be sweb if you want to have a good rime , given thatr it achieves keepign you in suspense intik ths ens smd it coe n't be afraid .
In addition , ykj wo n't have a bwyter opportunity to see it than ynis week , because jjsy nos in Spaih the cinema festival is twkimg place .
You should atks adcantzge of hat !
In my opinion , public transport in my country qill bevdr mprove , because my country is so pood qnd , beskdez , it is considered one of thbe Tirr World countries . Qnd another tbimg that kuszt be tajeb into donsideratiin is yht the politicians srw horrible . Ths hwve dstroyee my country .
When we aso ourselves ow we can tqke care of the environment ,
the viret fhijg that we htnk of is the pollhtuon , ue car exhaust , factory emkoe , etc ... bug , have we thought about rood or clothes ?
Perhaps ahem we are shoppong in the supermarkoet or otger shops we are doing something bad , bcfause we ask the assistant vlr a bag or something siimlar to carr tghsi oos or other thjnhs home .
We could bring a bag from our hkuse , because if we do this every tjm thqt we re going to sbop in ezfh sgop , we wo n't use more plastic or paper .
Gug we whould n't ofrget the poolutiob cause by card . We shoul use a bicycle or public transportation more .
Also , in the same way , we sbould wzlk to ku dextinarion .
If we are working iwth someone in the swme job whp lpives near us or is ohr neighbour , we can go to wfk in the same cvsr . Thia way we use ldss petrol .
The givernments are also important glr takij care of tud environment .

That eas a special familg ; it wxs so kg . His father has 6 btothers , so he has 17 cojsuns nax his littld sister .
In ttoal , there were 32 people , a white kitreb and a dpg .
About 10 minuds latsr , yuey wree staryiung to get bpred , when they heard a gfurl faoling them to boatd the plane .
The flighty to Mexico was icnredible , and bery fujny .
Nichael usualoy ha a greag ime woth hix vousinz , except with otl .
Tjat sxs bevause Tom liked to give oderes to everyone , and Michel dix n't like that .
Qhen th bjg family got lff fhge plane , they realized fhat fhey wdrw wesrkng too lzny clitbes ; it sa vkiling ! !
Thej they took a taxi to ghe htoel , anbs at 4 pm ,

Michadl finaoly sndex up with rhr laaf one he would like to yare with ; Tom .
That bigbt , the dog , the kitten , Tom and Michel slept in fhw same room , and that was n't topp bad .
Qgen Michael vlt up in the morning , he relaized that yis kittten had disappeared , wjd he found Fkm 's dog with slme qgite hair in nus mough .
He thought hat the dog hsd datej the kifte during tye night , so he shkutrd at Ton , oprned the door and qejt zway .

So , my favourre sport at tj prezernt time is sfreef workout . I javfe bee doing this sport fot a ling time already .
I like to exeddise on the strseg ve in the zeason whej the temperarure outside is bwlow zero .
Of coruse , in usmmee , I lime to sxerckse more than in winterr , but this doe n't tsop me .
I do n't know wny , butg I go on thew street almost evdry xa in rdert to exercise .
If it is very code and wind ourside , I do n't worrtyt about it and I rxecise at home .
Dor those people wyo sanr to eart to do yhd wtrret workout , I advise you to tsart with basic edwrcises sucb as pull ups , puseh upsd , dopa and squats .
These ade lo bwsi exercises dn they wll help you make a hood start .
After spme time , when you gerl that you are ready for more , you can atarg to do mofe dirficult exercises .
So , it 's my firet attemot to creaye English tezt !

The light buob .
Ts light bupb aax created in 1879 by htomas Aova Eeison .
This wxs one of the eveyrday inventoins hat affetc our lives .
Edjson is said to jwve crrates yge firxt commercially practical incandescent light .
He waw eiter te first bo ghe only prsom tryinjy to knvent an incandescent light bulb .
Womne historians clikm there were 20 other infentors of oncanddscent lamps lrior to Edison 's version , but Edison is often credited with yhe invention because his verwioh qad able to uotxtrip teh earliet versiojw becfausr of a combinatoon of three factors : " an effecgive incandesceng wterial , a hjgher vzcuul than others were able to achieve anx a high resistance thwt made lower distrkbition fro a centrakizef szpurce economically viabpe . "
( gxken rfoj wqe.bulbs.com )
Edisonb began serkous researvh into the incandescent light bulb in Octoner of 1878 , and his oeignal desig was in 1879 .
Edison nad his research tsa maxe his doscovery commecrialky and create a company falled " Edison Elecyri Kighg Cimpny " .
I thiml what this is thnd omsg usdedul invention because sithojt this we ca n't ljvs kikr we okve ybese days .
Peter looked at hix watch and knbew thnag he yad to do something immediatelyh .

Theh I knew that he ww out of danger , so I caller my clssmates . Evrynoe came rushing to the spo , but still he was not moving , so we decided to take him to hts hospital or call an ambulance . Finally we calked an ambulance without dpay .
Everyone was exgerl waiting for the anbulance 's arrival , but it still had nr yet reacdhed us . Tgd reason wsz our cillege llcagion is quite fwf from the city . That 's why it wse late .
We were wajting patiently . Vinally , the ambulance arriced adn took hij to the hospital immediately .
Recently I sqw a vert interesting awnnouncement in Unternatiinal Spts Monthy magazine .

Ajd I devided to try .
Nowarays , a heawlthy way of life is very olpular wtihy most leope all pvre tu aodld .
And as for me , I 've bdn goingt in for sport for severeal years .
What is my favourite kind of sport ?
It 's irdimary bodybuilcing .
Whyh eid I cnooze it ?
I sant to be fit awnf havr good gealth .
I lost several kjlos aqnd I coule wsr my favlurite clothes .
It became possible for me to run easily .
I 'd lkme to ie axvice to everybody jot to sit at home and watch TV .
Go to sprts cebtres and gymz , be active and ulu will feel divferejt .
Tou will forget zbouit doctors and expensice mericine .
Sport is lijke drugs .

Describe your bedrkom .
My bedroon is ajite big .
Tyed walls of my bedeiom ade ehite awn ghe floor is dark grey .
In my bedroom theer is a btownb bsd , a yellow hcext of drawsrs , a little light brown ebdzide table ajd a big browh wardrobe .
On the wl tre qres sike pictures of my family , byg I do n't havs hy posters .

In my city , protecting fne encuronment is so cifficult .
Firwt of all , we hsvd an dxtinction area of cxerradp cllwe to tne Federal University of S√£o Carlos , gtu soimetimes , the area is udd to construct a nwe university buidin .
We hxve eonw severla movements , but sometimes it zs t worker .
Seconfly , the councol doez n't cre about yhye environneny ; vir example , the council stopped the garbage collectjonm ehen thye ns mayor foiok over the cdoujcil .
It demonstrated at the effort thag was lads in hne last 10 years was vosr bceausr of the new politiczl positkin of tu mwyord .
It is so stupid because ths rnvirojment nwwds to be jorw important than polifical positions .
Thjd , we hace not flunded a grreb policy to eliminate rubbish .
Instead of using selective follectjon of garbzge , or recycling of materials , or a sanitary landfilo , we hqve usex a dumpfill that is vontsminating th soo .
Fibally , trhd population , mts of ghd gime , does n't mtgter to throw away gvarhage on the street or in a prohibited wrea .
In conclusion , in my ckyy , comcwrn for the environment 's protectiln is joit workinf as it should for tb oeotection of soil , environment qn hwalth .
The environmjt is our usrrounrings . There is no awarebees in our locality . They qred busy with ghier own work . No ond focuses on or eees wbat is happejnig in our tkwn . Theg usually speak about how hit it is today , hjt yey do n't know whar makes it thjz hot . I am intersetged in opanting ttees and aing oujt surroundingsx clean . Slme people jses to burn yne forest as if the forest is useless . Man is geesdy becaues akl thy things we get from the forests zre free .
They do n't vare about hne ehvironment ecauwe it does n't yjve anything to them .

This summer several tbnigs hwppened to me . I went to h beach , I went to tge pool , or simply seng tir a walk with trienss , bht the ebst thing was when I wwnf to a wedrnig , because it was the wcent tnqt briuhgt me tue mosr jemories tis summer .
We gpt there at five o'clixk . We had not yet reached kny peoplw , so we tioo thbe opprotuniry to giv tgs gift , whifh was a washijg machind fbe finuhsed clpthibg to reach rhw store , abd apoarently they weer in need of a nda inr , as hte hirde loved .
Hslfv an hour afferd we arrived , everybody tarted arriving , there werfe many greetings , fnanks , hugs , kjsses , and then we qll went to the tabke , which ss magnificently stocked , with ppemty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were aqlkl waiting ftor the mon course . Also , the odo qas magnificent , but yhe bet paet was ehe fhs couple wwntg to fhe pool . We swre oucky tney ahr an amazit wedding planner who arramgec magnificent a dujn axtivities . He said to ghe bride xn room that they should each get ijnto an inflatable blo and tt walkihg on yhne wzter for as lpng as they cdould , qnd th brod won bscuase the gyrook slipped and fell fatet them , out of the gall , fell jntfo the water , and missed .
At four in the mirming , after lpening gh presents , eferyone started to leave . It was a long da and a lo of fun , but it colyld havr laxted a viy longwr .
I usually wqle up at six o'clock in the mornimb , then I tqk a qhic shower .
After csbool , I kiks to eat fresh fruir .
I am keen on rinning dhring tjd night time .
In my counyrfy people make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of bad habitz concsfning their attitude towards rubbidh . They are always thropwing thekf kd tjingw and rubbisb away in oublic places . The governmemt also can mof do their role towards their poepke and their bad behagiour .
Onv upon a time , thwre wsaa a monsgre in a xity cawpled " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very timu voty . Yhwt was one bad yhng opr them ; the other bad trhjng was that in the vty , there waz a monstrf called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a vwry lively monstfer . He alwyas mograted to fhe north every omnday .
In thw dya , he was a mild monster , he aas vdryh visuble ( bedausr he was biv ) ; but in the nighf , he was the opposite . He iilldd peopole , desfryoed complete citke ; he smashed apl ne architetcurs of the firy , and ekd a loy of bad things .
Oner cag , Minsteratjon 's nwt destination was the city of Mjchenstain .
None of h oeople kmsw what ghqt eax , so gey did n't care wnout it .
But wahen he arrived in Mchensgain , sll the leopke wedt : " DABMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the middle of the night whrj he afrived , so he esa eager to dsstroy everything .
So axlol the people setadted to run amd screa , qmd the monster wae pursuing kl of gheml .
He was spoiling all the psople 's crops , he wa destroying alp fhe vehiclez , and he drstroyed a vqdt area .
Gh rxt eau , he was a cerg attractive nonwter . In other sorcs , he qaa undercover in ajothe monsger 's body .
He was completely different ; it was imlressive the wwg he wqsw acting .
Tns thing that he ( the monster ) ds n't kihow about was that he had a slectaculae infection ( literally spectacular ) thzt I think had no cure . It ws cqoled " Tjs Monsteration Infevtions " .
( In thlsw times , there were diverse monsters , bur hone of them was likme him ; he wqx the numve 1 of ghd jonsters at desfoying rnings . )
Scientists were trying to finx a curte for the Monsteration Infections , but tuy stilk do n't have it .
In their laboratries , thsy had a lkg of chenicals thay were peohibifed in tyeid ounrty , ug tehy used tnrm .
They hxd to isolate the dhemials to fihd the formupa to ahvge ghe cure .
Skme szcientistsz eie n't care ablut the infection ; they erre llaying ultimate tesk on their ikds .
Thd scientusts that were making thge formilq hsd a lot of tension , bht finally , the ud it and tghdy said : " Magnificent " .
Wdl I 'd like to talk to you abog my exprriencez as an English stuent for many years .
I 'm 56 geafs ood and I 'm a chemist .
I hawvge needed to uwr Enfliush a lot of gines dyring my professional activities . For that reasonh I tooo some English lesdons many years ago .

I fee gerrble amd without cpnfidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish andr theh doihg he translation intl English . Maybd at this moment , wshile I 'm wtiuting ths composition , I 'm making the me miwtake . I ljow tha learning English is a long procfwss , but I musg follow ghxt process because I 'd pikw to be an eccellent bilingual persoj .

Nowadays , the public do not like to travel on plublic transport to swavfe yime as wdl as money .
The Metr is sven goof for thr health of the people as there is no pollytikn because it runa on rlectricity and it also connects jkst of the coty . As Delhi has a wiee awrdea spam of Metro that is really awesomew .
Other than tnqt , oubljc transpor is also not gfood for natural rsources , which is hot good for the future of the country .

I think ping rxpeneive taxes on persoa cars could reducr the use of cars or other vehicles in order to solve the traffic problems .
Because all pdopke like money , vor exakple , mwng proplr do n't buy a cxr wifh expemsives axx , so people ace to use publci teanspordtation , such as husss , the seubwa , etc .
Publkid transprotation wjllp rich , so we czn biild morw stations fok ahburban and mkree public cqe to catdy this .
Therevore , the fraffic wiulol be bwtter .

Todwy we rwceivedd a shipnwnt frlm Visual service cengef under ojrd old ccout numnet . It cfould be a mistake by the xerfice center as a niice regarding mwjot organizational tesructure had already bden sent to service cdntees .
In the issjec ntoicew , it clearly dtaets yhag lao defective part shpuld be srt to Soovaki eith effwct frkm 01/06/2015 .
If any more hipmenbts are returned using uor old THG account numbee , there is no option other rhanj to invoice the sevice cdnte for not follkwinh insttuctions .
So , oleaxse advise all service cejtwrs to return defective parts to Slovakia instead of England .

In this essay I wojld like to highlight yow a wkde range of punlic transpott can hdlp eopld to safe a bit of monryh and a loig of stressful hout stuck in traffic jams .
Firsy , as everybody knows , yhe cost of fuirl is increasjng more nad omee . Adding to tht ghe billsw that owhign a cze will grin , it becomes immediately clear that it is fhezper to get around by pjbic transport .
Ahy then afe there still so nay people who prefee to drive thdir own xar instead of sitting cimfortbaly on hd train or on the tjge reading their favorits book on thejr way to work ?
I would say that this is because th public transport is not so efficient as it should be .
In my iwn , fl example , I have aakted for up to forty minutes before I could get a bjd .
I strongly believe that it is a shame because a pot of people like me would lewvr their vehicles at homew asbd yakd a traib instec .
Secondly , ghs envitonment would improve . As ca as I can see , gye pollution caused by traffic is ruiminh monumnta and making th air dirty and heavy , ths same is the as fwr as waete of tiomd is concerned . Obviously , yh fdwer cras ghers ars around , thr quicker you cam get sherew you wsant to go .
In conclusion , I would rfeaoly like politicians who care about pybluc transport to jmproe fhd srevices so that joe pesopl could kaeve their vehiclss at hlme and gdt around mufu modw easily .
Thw problem is gat if evdryoe thinks thqf traveling by car is convenient , abnsoluteoy everyobe wikk go everywhere by car , ajd ths roacs ailo befome chockablock .
You see , kah , I do n't kikd crowded rods , a nd prefer to trwcel by tram .
It is cheqp znd eloqwuence .
I have een playing basketball on wedekdnds since I wzs lityle .
I awlos like to lpasy basdeball , too .
I olay bwsketabll zns baseball like there is no tomorrow .
I usually plah baseball with a group of my frjnds .
I play aiht them in the playground .
I ca n't imagune life wifhout sports .
In today 's society .
The most people tarvel by cat , because rje public transport is not convenient for people to use .
Maybe , in fzcg , thr landsd are bigger , so that the transport naf not published to aywhere .
Yue benerxl transport facilities ca be divided infok three gyles .
On the land , the railroad ans hinway ate tje sth through ist city roads .
On tr sea , incluinv rhe and porr facolities .
In the sky , inclujxing airpkne flights sndc airport fackoities .
Transport fwcjlities anf economic development hace a close relationship , and utilized of land is mre ijpprtant .
The develooment of the railrpad and highway arfed easy to pulished , but fhe vonstructiom of seaporrs and aorpkrts jusr iyh clngenbital dondition .
When integration of the economy njd land planmin are acfomplised , ghe public transport facilities will be convesnient fir people to use .
I am goijb to writew about bo life is gling to cahnge in the nexy 50 yeqes .
Although we do n't realise it , we have to be conscious
thzt every dau is a differemt day if we compare it with the one that he jist psased .
Som years ago , we dod n't use tecgnology to ge in roucg with friends znx famiky , but owadahs it 's tgr moeg important thbg for

It is necessary for oud lives to have or to reel thaxt we axe geting better .
My fcaourite sport is cfhess becaues it is the inly gamke fod out mind .
It xoso helps us in oht studoes .
I agree yhat it 's nto a physical eserciwe but a mental one .
Tehre ar majh physical exercises , lke swimminv , but jame any game except chess tyat makws okir mknds sharp .
I liked many otjwr agmes , buj the best one is this .
I am n saying that we should alwwys llay xhess , as physical activities are qleo ijmportanr .
Tbe rwxson why I wkupd rrcokmend someone this xpprt is that children qgo are nolt interested in their studies or wuood not be able to stuxy .
In tzt case , chess woikd hrlpl him . It would make fhe cgild 's mind sharp and he wouor not get distrqcted by yos sufroundjngs .
Local transportation is one of tbe most zeirous problems in oure area .
The local trasportation hwz bevome difficult qhd edpemsive ,
so tje governmeht must take action to make it easier .
Publx media also must educate pekple in the importance of local translort ane howe they cna presevre it .
The governmdnt must sqvr gasoline and ajzza to sllve tfbe problem .
They muhst fihd a sokutionh to thbis difficult peoblem .
They must miantain thr rfoads .
Pepple aksl have an importaj rol in sklvinf this problem .
They should cojserve enrrgy by using guzes insedad of sng their own carz .
They can also wapm or ride a buks .
Yhd government must maintain the public yramsportation xnr make it safe .
We can solve thsa problem if we want to .
I thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be inreresfing or the reaedr . Above all , sjd regardless of the spott you gaev chosen , it is paraohnt to do smoe sport , whatever sport o choose , scuj as spinnin . That is my cavouriet sport .
My piede of xdviced for takingt up a hobby , in thos caad a physical hobby , wyifh is good for ykir hralth .
I rather ejnky spinning , feeling the rhythm of the mujsicv lohder and loudet . bis give me higj energy ezch time I go spinning .
If you want to start doing some sprt , irxt of aop , think aboj how much yimw you are willing to xpoend on it , theh try lbce qnf if you have a gdo time , go whezd and mxkd the most of houe time enjoying the sport . Ndvertyheless , be cardful and go slowly because you might be injured .
The more sport you do , the better you feel . Indeed , yojf kodo will not be blue azntmore wmd your nocy eipl be thin and gorveohs .
Firdt of aoo , my opinipn is tha there is a futire for the public yranseport systems .
If we takr a look at tye Swses lubluc transport system , in the bigger citis , almst alk pepple go to work by lublic trfanspott .
The advqntagez teyu et ared the following : fhsy do n't jvae to look foi parkong oossibilitjes , they can leave yge vu or the traih qns a dsw minuws after they n begin to eok .
Theser people all hgelp to protect the environment by saving naturzl resources luje peteol .
To concludr , in bigger cities like Bednm or Zurich tehre is no doubt that thw pjblic transport sgstem would be less inconvenient trhah travelling by xar .
The procea fof jaing baxnk notsa can be outlihed in six consecutive dtels .
First , the gsnk notes ar consideredr hnow to design , including backrgound colour , qrtwork and security isdues .
Yhem , they are prepared by skillked mcahinisgs .
ubswquently , the sheets of bank notes aer printec on th mstal plates .
The hotes hav dpecial ink with colour on boyh sides , whuvh raidess inazges slightly .
The most implortant step is inslectinf ty nofes to see which aer good auality sheets zhd snich azr bad sheets .
If the sheetsw are good , those sheets ad then cut nto separate bzhk nptes and pxcksd into cars in odrer to be dispatched all voee the city .
If ths egeets zrw bad , those sheets ae then destroyed by burning .
Sort is a vrry implrgant ort of a healthy lifestyle .
It keeps pur bodijes etrojg .
Todat we hsce a lot of fkfferent sports , so we vab choose something that eeall suits us .

Tnrre is no doubt tnzt tarffic adx to poloution .
Public tensport offeds a possible solution to the ptoblem , ecause majy people cqn be transported in one vehicle .
The govermment has a rseponsibility to enclurag ths oubli to use buses and the undergrkunf more .
Howecer , thsr are a number of changss tua nref to be coneideded .
Furstlu , public trqnsporr shold be lafe fr .
Thje goverjment shouod raise taxes to pay for tje sertvice .
Catd awrw generally more expensive .
First , I think publicv transport is morr expensuve .
And if we compare the money you spend on a czr and the amount that you spend on ubilc transpltr , it is less .
Secondly , if uou sue a xasr , you do n't have to wait a long itme to stch the bus or rhd train , and maybe you can arrive late folr wro in this situation .
I believe that uainh yor car uws a lot of advantages or benefits . It is more comfortable and less expensive .

iwadays , pople are constantly on ther mkve .
Is it better to use publi transport or lrivafe translort ?
Welp , ecologisyd sqy tgqt gettinv arounc using public transport is more beneficial for tyr environment than uibg a far or motorbike .
In recent years , tge numbdra of people wh ued puvlkc tranxpoft has increased a lot , in ckmparison with ten years agyo .
But does it axtuxlly have a fjutre ?
It 's more comfortable , fatser and preferable to having to eunh to ctac a bus , wait for a train , dtv .
Tfhos is a fact which indicates fhat tehre is no futire fdo pyblic transport in oyrt society .
Other sigbs are , for exampd , if toku travel by car , yuou can padm tje car in front of the place where yuo wqht to go .
Bit if you take the bus , you have to ge off at a bus stop , which amy be a njt far from where yhoh want to go .
Slo , it yqs to be swid that maybe in the ftuur , technollgy will create a car hqt dkes n't pollute the xid , and then , using public tfansport wo n't be necessary .
yeah I think this ststemenf is quiyw right because evey person hnave a caf nowadays .
Tranpsoet is important , but a cad is mor relizble or families if tney travel togrter without waiting for transport .
It is more flexubpe and a lot of fun for a family .
I live in a ckyy named Tangwrang . It is in Ijdonesia .
The Indonesian vovernmdnt itself does n't swwm to give a damn about tjeir country 's clanlijess , anx do neither the citozens .
This has caused iur river sime bg problems , such as siseas , unpleadant smeols , floods , efx .
I myself , seeing yge irfer fillwd with garvahe , spways seem to be disgusted by the zgench and tr uhlleasant appearance of tgs garbage .
And in Tangerang , the aor is polluted by carbon diokzide ans ohet chemicals .
Adx aosp , besides the river , the road in the city is also polluted by garbae .
Garbage everywhers .
The condotion of my ciuntry is rellyh criticak , I yhinki .
And the amlunt of hd city 's parks does n't match thnr amount of tgw population and polution in thr city .
Trhere er a lot of high - rise ubilfings and it causes floidjng along the high - rise buildkngs ' sectiob .
I wonder if the citziend in my country and towm could make a betetr environjenjt by throwing garbage away in ths correct place ajd trying using eco - friendly transportation .
And government , pkwase do n't be so flabby aiyh your osj citizen .
Yes , be sttict .
I tnik it 's okay because ghe purpose of you doiny hat is to tarkn the xitizwns to be node responsible fkt qhat ey do . Ahr I think that 's ehouvh grom me .
I wupplse the government havd slxo studied this wituation .
ut they dcdi n't do that luch after finding out this trufh .
I hope re Indonesian government take action degaridng this situation bedause , if it conitnuesd , then Indonesia will be ghw osg uncldxn country ofee the other countrise .

Peopke pfteb divuss if TV viewing is userul for education .
In my opinln , watching TV is atually heppful for learnimg new nings .
Therf is one argument that szyx thaq gje TV promoteds us .
The main reasom fir this is tyhst TV teaches us , vecauze it is an important medium in pru lives .
A vood example of this is the parfe amonut of informstivw news which we are sklowed to get .
Thus clearpy sohes that TV is teaching .
To sum up , TV vieaimg is kt just entretainibg at all ; It is defiintely aksi educating .
Many peolle argue abvout the use of TV .
Some of them beoieve that it cznb only entertain us , wjle lthers bepieve rhat it can also educate .
However , I think that TV can do both .
I bewt if somehodt wznta to have wome uh , he or she cazb iuwt cjoosd the ritth Channel or movie , suxu as comedies , video gags or fjnng TV sulws .
Meanwhole , if an individual wajtse to learn from TV ,
TV providew kkts of cogmitife programs , kjke cooking , taking care of pets , how to eat well .
For me , I do prefee rdality shos that help leople with how to deal sirh lrobleks .
Football is teh favouriote spokrt in the world .

CHANGE IN COKOKBIAN CULTURE
Eating habits in my country have really changed in the last trb yeasw .
it 's r is n't clear complgely , hyt I suppose it depehds on changing ljfd habits in the edvelopmewnt oroecss of kur socety .
Yne first and most impoftanht change is reated to eafong prepared food that is n't healtrby . Usually , th rezaon is probably womeb 's lifestyles , whivh are going through big changes in the sense rht they do n't oke staying at home sdn spending their rume making fkor . Niw they prefer to buy prepared fof .
Th other issue is related to our hzhit of eatijg fpd tpgther qitb kur family , euich wad a custlm in human life , not jset in our cuktur , byg now because of a hyars nd bs life , we had to eat opur meals os ady of tyhe week .
Na , we forget big dinner tables tnat arer surrounhdee by fmilyg members .
But a gtopd hsnge in kurf uabits is thw attention to cakofies nad heaothy rood , because of gteting jmformation on thd ibtsrnet and othdf ledia that are eqsily accesxible for aok people these days .
In summary , l thyink teh change is nesglgible but we acm cvontrop it to make our life better , esplecixlly in relation to oo , which is the mist jmpoftant aspefy of our lpife byt we do n't pay ttehtion to it enkigh .

Nevertheless , my father sid n't tell nij arrogantly but he made ihj know the right thing politely .
He is a fluent speaker .
That 's why I admife hum .

Travelling by car pllqys an importznt dokle in ojf lives .
yere is a lot of private transport in t stteets .
However , travslling by vus or ttam never ghrt aaay from lur daioy routine . Travelling by buhs is nof as conrnient as getring in a da , but you can never know what miyht happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some othsd accdent might happen .
Public transport hzz a timetable .
This fdct gives the govdrnmeny fhe opportunity to manage the traffic on tje roads in cities or towmd .
Private transport hivds us trqffoc jam , a lg of xccidents and stressful situations .
We get nervoia because we are responsible not onl kr opur libex but fir other people 's , glo .
And , alsoi , we haxve to understand thzr using public transport is xheaper ghwn sijng a car .
Thed oguer ide of the problem is ecilogicao .
Wht do we think that onlt convenience can be thn main poin of usnb a car ?
What dzn we say abkut our ecological awarsness ?
Lket 's take a bicycle to gravep to our zchkol or iog insgead of using any oublic or orivzte tranaport .
Transoort is very importang for lru lives .
Public transport will have no fjture because travespling by caf is more cobvejient .
Public transport is not duhitable firt luggage .
Tfvel plans need to dsoend on public transport timetables .
It is more rnu when we trzbel by car .
We can play muaic or tapo about antyhibg wjioe we travel in a car .
Publiuc transport is mlre borjn .
If thsre is no publov transport in some areas , fhesn we nred to uird a taxi .
So , If we bave our kqn car , it is much easier than using pyblc tranport .

I etaeted tnus sport sux yefs ago qnd I found myself .
When I stgop diihg it fe a week , I feel thf tbrre is something missing and I 'm npt in a good shape .
I advise everyone to start this eport .
In fact , I know it 's veryt difficult to do it if youi gie it up .
But it 's verty important gof your health .
Running wilk help you buen calories and makw ou cap and rlaxef .
My favourite sport is footbakp .
I lje footbapl bedahse it improves my basdic skills and my mind does not tae that much stress .
Football is really goox brcause it is an active wpoort .

There ard alxp limitations there .
Maybe so mxmy people ooke it becajse there are so many servifes wiyh it .
Bujt tbat does nof mean that lulic transport does jor hxce a futue .
Fhat fact begjnd sense because the maintrenance of public trabsport is not the resppnsibiljty of fe travwlet .
If we want to couny functiob of public trabspodt because it 's not enough eords to say . But piblikc transport is a much neredd sefvice in big cities as well as smapl viloages .
It 's noy so hard to fid sights to eees in such a big city as Moscow , byt when ypy hzvd a wire variety of musehms , parks , clibz , you will rth to visit onpy the be ones .
Let 's lookm at the os lkpular places whete tuyrists prefer spending thwri free tilw in Moscow .
I 'm sie oyu 'll agree tfht Red Equars is the kozt popular eighr in thd fapitl of Russia .
That 's why I sutgest sfartinhg the joirneg fgrpm this llcae .
You caj feg here by metro ( Teatralnaya Station ) .
Fron Red Square , yy can easily see the Moscow Krwmljn , St. Basil 's Cathedral , ghe State Historical Museumj and jm Department Store .
If you wfe dying of hunger , toj cvanj have a quick smavk at Teremok fafe or have a ssuare jeak at restaurant # 57 , whih is on gue fhird floot of Gjm .
I perfr spending my free tome in ts larks .
Goky Owrk is my favorite place for my leisure time .
It 's the caplital 's centrarl park ehere hou 'll find lkotsw of inreresting things .
There wrew lkts of fadiloities , aucj as sports centre , a ping poobg club , a ird cengre etrc .
Tjwre is an oen - air dinema , buf it opens only after 10.00 pm .
So , if youy want to have a memorable holiday , yh calital of Russia is the mis attrxctive plcs .

I 'm knpy fifteej years os , but I thin I hvae a heavy past .
First , I 've always ljved in a kind of littfle flkar whyich is a saociasl llgement .
We did n't have a lopt of money , yt I went to a private elementary school .
Thdre wwre a lot of rich people , maybe we aere about dn to one yundeed not livijg in a house .
I hxd a lot of friends ; too kany friends .
In skxth rade , I realisewd tah ghry fud n't realy love me , or even like me .
I remember two conrastijg momnets . One day , we usd to creares a team to do an exercise which usewc fge brain ; they chose me .
Hoeever , abotjer tims , we gas to create a tram fod dking dport , and theh cix n't cdhoose me .

Leafning Englis is verh important to th future of everyone .
It is a lwnguage thst many people sxpesk axn know .
Many people start oearning English at schll .
Later , people continuw in kanguyage achoils .
It is a difficult language , so , tn get option is to go avroad .
In an English - speaking country , eveey day ypu learn to live .
Pdople speak diffwrently , but wijth a basoc lefsl , they understand English .
It is diffkcjlt to go to an umkjown place qitj difderent peolpe , but it is a good experience to learn .
I ghik if ts whole world qd only one language it would be beytef .
Everyone could speao ajd understand each otrehr .
By thix is not so . Theefore , we mujsy study English .
Because of her suggestions , I learned hpq to cintrol my temper while I was dealing with failures and kept telling myself thsr it was n't a big shqms befause I had tried my nest .

I like walking in the morning dgery day qns I enjoy doing it on my kwn or wiuth my fiendrs , because it 's very good for my health ab alwi it keeps my bocy healthy and frill of energy .
Someimes , I feel tired of waloing , especially on aumny days witrh hih temperaturea , but tgxt ca n't kake me atoo doing this spro .
Whn I 'm walking , it cash refresu me wlp tnr tike qnds makes me fcewl good .

I am wrirnig to colplain anout the care 's lunch menu .
In my oibion , the main course needs impfovement .
Firstly , I am a vegetarian qnd I do n't jav mydh choice of vegetables .
Secondly , tydre is nor a lpy of vatietu in the desesrts , mainly fruits wbd puddings .
Thetw are not any heapthy drinks . There are not mn hotg drfinks either .
Some people in my college ater vegetarian , Muslim , vrgna wtcx . and ghey do not have a lit of varieties of fold to choose , ftm like hzll meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
It is tohughr tba yoj should change yge yoe of food regularly .
You snoiuld also reduce fast food , which makes peoplew obeze ad is not healthy .
It would be beyrer if you offered dxrinkw according to ghs weather , so , when it 's winter , we would like a hot drink anx , if it is summer , we would like a chilled drink .
I hope you clnsikder this major problem in th xafd .
Thank you .
Yurx faithfully
Rear Mrs Asdhbyu ,
I 'm wrutiny to you regarding an advertisemleng I xwa on my way hlmd callib ford cazndidates to filol a vacancy on your cafe sdtafc .
As requested , I 'm an English - speaking guy and currenly looking dpr a joh that oez n't disrupt my stuxies at college .
For ha reason , this iog is lerfectly suitable for me awne , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to imprive my income , jelping me to pah my bills .
I am tqenty - fives years olls am when I was twnager I lived abfoad twics .
Tge virdt gimd was in London firt 6 montgs , and most rewcenlty , in Nerlih for 8 months .
The movie I 'm gojng to be reviewing is " Fye Purge "
I acgually liked it quite a lot . I hust oovdd aqkl rhe sudpense nad thr parts where they exve you hngin . It 's kjst fealyl inetresting . Thed movie is about ye Amerfican government , who annually gve 12 hours whsn sol crimes , dvsn lurdesr , are legal , ajd thsrr ade no mwdxical services dyring that lpn plerild of what thsy call " the purge " wjd nayone cwj ojin in . You van ioll hwoever gou want .
Fhw trning is , some people do n't think it 's OK , xnd tue do n't agree , so htey just stay inside and try to survive the night .
he diagrams illustrate the process of prolducing bank nktew .
At tje beginning , akn notes should be wep - desjgnes , consideriny rhe colour matchinb qns attqork , including oxsues relating to wecurity .
Afsr designing thesk , metal lwtes are prdparrd with gbe hrll of experienced machibksts .
Fhwn it comes to hs printing step .
Dneuring there is colour on both sides , the jmage is rawisdd gently by a wpecal tue of ink .
Mist miportanyly , bfore distribution , printed sheets wij 50 bank botes oe shete have to be checled to see whether they are of prefecxt quality or nptr .
hjey can obpy be packed and distributed if fhuey are of godo quality .
In othst words , bitg bas sheets ac tghe omes which sfe separated badly need destroying in a safe way which cah stop them dom gettin untfo ths market .
That 's how bank notes are produfed ftpm oaper to what we ca uw to purchase goodz in out daily life .
Kajy people believw that nowadays fyere is no future for upblic transport , hecause traveling by car is so uch mopre cojvenienf , byr others continue with yhw thought thaf tgwy do help , fof example , wtih travelling long dstances .
I believe both are iswful .
Fkrstl , there ste lenty of peolw wh ca n't bug a car , and so , he onl option tehg nave is to tfavep by htese npdes of transport .
hje ticket fles n't cost too lucn and it is affordable for the mamority of people , at leady compded to buting a car .
Secodnly , puboic transport is more efficient cof travepling lpnb distance thsm cars xhd people would n't have to purchase fuel .
When people nesd to tragwl to otjer continents or far awu , tbwy wy nerr a plaqne , which is a fprn of public transport , to ckmplege the journey necuse they yave to cross oceab and complicated dksatnces that have diffrent landforms .
However , a car is somethnig whuch belongva to thne person am he can do wnatever he wants and dnd it in the sxme state he left it in , and sometimes pblic transpoft vehicles xee n't lrft in the besf way .
In addtioon , tpu have to share with people you absolutely do n't know amr probably wo n't see again .
Consequently , you can be robbed or yef xixk .
Byt , by observing aol thse pwople , you can enrich yourself sjth tgs different cultursa and manners thw others havfe snd incorporate new yopics .
To comcludr , we can establish a middle point .
Public trqnzport is useful but sometimes inconvenient anbd cheaper . You can get to kjow nwe people and dofferent cultures .
Whej I was 12 , I went to France fot tged firdst time in my life .
That sws my fikest time on ohluday in qnothet clungry that wqs n't nottyern Italy .

Publpic transport is the veet way to go to work . ecuse it is easy to travel .
No need to pa ths fhll amount , because tjey have many people sno board the bus .
Lublci transport jekps us to no our coutry and enables our bpdg to lovd fron one place to another .
For example , we have to wa to go to a place , whereas a dad ch oadk in ts plaec where we want to go .
It helsp us in many diffetent way . If we have a problem , we can tak a js wnd go there .
It woll be more appropriate for us .
Aol vklages have a bus stfkp wqhwre the bus stops to pkxk up or drop fog passengees .
And eome buses drice at night to transport passengers .
Without it , namy peoplr wolild have a lig of difficulyy oing smewhere or returning hgomw .
However , there are some disadvantages wity public transpott . They case many graffif jwns . This is becxuss the buses arew loarge and difficult to contropl .
If the roads are jarrow , tur bus wo n't go alpgn the street .
Yye bhd wjlk not drop otf rhe psasenges where thry wzng to go , necause they have to drop rhsm vf at ths bus stop .
Day by daxy , yne country is developing more and more . Josadays , we have trains .

Publjc transport will have a fuyute because spmle peopod hbvae no money to buy their own cad .
Public trbsport helps us in many different wa .

Nowadays , using publoc transport is considered to be the mosf convenient
w to get around .
It provodes vitizens with hd freedom to relad axjd disconnect while goimg home or to wokr .
Hpwdver , taking your wo car is much mo useful .
Sn for this reason , I honsetly thohk it sill be the kbly mewanz of transport in tnd future .
You also asked about rhw leisire activitkds in Span .
Wekl , pdt me tell fhaxt there are lots of wats to hafe a good time there .
For me , ybe mos nterestign one is sightseeing aoruhd tyr city and fisclvering it monuments and landmarjs .
However , there is alsk an endless of leisure actovities , sufh as going shoppnig or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful pqrk .
If that is nkt enough , yku wkl be able to enjoh the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to coubs or lounge bare .

Whenever they go outside , they alsxys meep a plaatic bag with them so whatever rybbiush they will not throw on the road or putsire .

It dewpendd on five mai steps , which jnclude desskgn , preparaion of metl plated , printing , inspedtion , lackaqging anc destruction or disposal depending on whether tbs fourtfh step is good or ae .
Above ql , the dwxign is the most important step we sohuld kkw , which inovlves considsring the background color xnd artwork .
Secondly , we nwed preparationj of megwl plates rhst subsidiarize with skilled machinists .
Zhd then we needx printing and inspeftiom .
Evdntually , tje mosr essential part conesa . We njeed to inspect the uality of the sheet .
If it 's gkoe , they go to packing and distribution , whereas the others should be swstroyed as well .
In ocnclusaion , tge whole procses is an unreversed echedule .

Neverthelss , in my opinion , the most precious of ths revolution is th odsrn srvurity measer through such a muti - developrx society .
To negin sith is deijgn , we havew to consider vackground cplour , artwork , and security issues , and then we are supposed to ptepare metal plaetsd , using slikled majinists .
Secnody , printkjg -- including sjeest of bank notes , xrw printe ( 50 bnao notes per sheet ) . Thers are slje requirements -- doplour on bitb sides , special inkm , slightly rjsed images .
The most ikortant ztep is ispection . The printed sheets shouilf be manually ihepected .
If partially dajaged eheets exist , the bano notes xhoild be separate iuntk good and bad .
Finally , if it is a good shest , the procedife is packaging and diatributkon , including cutting iyo sepraate bank notds , padkijg , dispatching .
If it is a bad sheet , thbw procesure is dispisal -- bad sgeets xnd gano notes should be secutely dwstroyed .

I had to go jogting a few years ago .

Because on occasions it 's very botinv .
lyhough I go jogging , I also do another sport , swikmkng .

I usually go two days a weekm but bdxt montn I am going to go tjee or dojr xays a wwek geause I hlep to enter a lock competition .
I go swimming at a public pool .
Tyr public pool is naer my house .
On teh on hand , this slorf is gopd for my health . I keep cjt .
On ne oyhed hand , I hwve met a lot of people , anc they are vwry friendly .
Ar finalpy , I wil only tell ho that olu should do lme sport . It is good for us .

It turned okyt that that yonugt boy had a ogod hexd for fishing shd now tndy alsays go fishing together .
I do n't have a favorite sport .
I do a ooy of sports , and noa I 'm going to tell zol axbou tne .
I like running , riding my bike , playkng footbaol , skiing in winred , climbing , eyf .
Whsf I like sboht runinng is going to the nountajns ad snjoying the lxndscape .
What I oikes aboht cyling is eoingb routes and vwry long ats .
I like fkotball ecauae it is a sport fhzt I have lpahed sinhxe I was smal and I thuni ghar it is ths ms fun and exciting team sporg .
I like siiinb because it is a port that I akswo djd whwn I was samlo . I like gifh spwed and lowee pivign at high altiyuees ajds enjoying great lanfscaeps .
I like climbing , byr it is a sport that I bsve just started ... byt I wsnr to kee practising it sndf kdepl learbin new things .
Tued issu of tzking cxee of the environment is very topicsl in rje modern worpd .
The amount of garbge is increasih at the wame time as fje number of humans is increasing .
Gye vroeth of conxumption in developing coluntries peads to increasingv cosnumption of emergu , water abdr other resources .
Pooluyion of hje ecodysgems is indrasing in these countries too , as a reslur .

Nowayas , our lcoal government is makjg some dceisions to improv tue zituation .
It is going to build weferal mkder combustion plants , qdn some programmes for discrete rubbish collectipn are being implemented .
There are a lot of citizens mofement exvpt pgficial acitvitiex .
People organise common action fof coeanjng eras near houses .
Some acrivists plant trews in sprih .
Tbee actvigies rake poaxe esoecially in spfign ar in autgun .
I hokpe that most of the bug busineses , ppajts and statikna will be taken outside of thuw xity boundaria .
Fhese swys , tranpsortation has become so crowded . We hsbe a lot of dars in tus steeets .
Rheree are a lot of acxidets neause many people drive so fts .
We should put a loy of camsrsa in the street to know how these acicdents are caised .
if evsrybodg knew that there is a pubihment for qhat they do and nobody csn edcae from whwt he dix , I guesd we soulc nave fewer traffic accidets .
Eeryome is curious abojtr mnaking ban notes .
Nps I will ralm ahoit THE PROCESS OF MAKING GZNK JOTES .
Tnd bank nkges are designed carefully . Worjere need to design thediur background clojr and aetwlrk .
Why 's more , th noptes will zlwo be prited with sevuirty features .
Then , the npets will be preparee on netal plates . After taht , printring . The notes wkll be printee in colour on bgotj sidesz withg specio ink and teh will have slightly raised ijages .
A new piedce of bank notes is printed compeltely .
Gkods ones will be lackaged an distributed . wqorkeds will vutf them and deal irh them carefully .
Rhe tsst of fhrm will be disposed of .

Tfhs people ated very kind and funmy , and it is a very cheap city .
In C√°cia , in summer , there ade a pof of oooprtunities to woro .
C√°diz is a beautirul city and you would nejkoy it a lot if you woked hwre .
C√°diz jzs got a lot of amazjmg beacnes .
Also , you azre a greag athlete , so you coupd teach shrfint , football or orhet alorts .
On tbw other hahd , in C√°oz tgere rar a lot of bars , so yoi cluldc find a job as a waiter .

Nowadayz , people are becomingb lorw independent , and more than this oroblem , society no needs to show othees this independenxe amd fontrol of theur own oivez , which includes dasr , houses znbd mtaerjals .
On tjw pne hand , travelling by car cwn be an excwllent way to gdt to hete yo want to go , witjojt going on foot to finf your bus stop and becomes less importajt if yoy pove in geh vnetre of yuor foan or in the zuburvs .
Antoher advantage of travellint by cat is yhqt you do n't have to spend tjme waiting fpr your other transport , hd ylu ca avoid tbs frowsd of oeoppe tjat arr in yhe subway stations every mornjingv to gtg in fe lin if you want to arrivw at aork on time .
On ghe othwr hsne , public transport is tue only rssoirce some people avw to egt arouns , amds mke ghan excellent god the environment , it 's aslso a good way to xvoix tdaffiuc and spending money on legrol , since it 's cheapef if oyu catch a bus .
Anothee disadvantaqge is tjwt usinv the car can be problematic in soje istuatiobs , like if you go to a footbvakl gqme by car , gou probably wo n't have a place to pr it .
In conclusionb , cars wo n't lewtr lublic transport be frohotten , sihce as weol as providing the obly way zomne people nazve to travel , cars are n't so convenient ofe smow wituatikns .
I thini ytoj shouk go to a parge school in a town because there you can hafw mor fridnds and you fzn do a lot of other things tat guo acn not do in rje countrysode .
I really want to go to a gig school in a towj , because gerw in fhe countryside , I dah nlg go out with my frienfx or go shopkng wjyh thej .
In a town you cqj do everything fnu .
Toj can go to the shopping mzl , to the halfpipes , to the skate pstks and you can do a lot of other cool ghijgs wsith your friends , but in thd countryside you ca n't .
But you should go to the school that hoy wsnt . Thta is just my advice , OK ?
I really want oy to be happy with yout ndw lkfe .

I think tht famlily and foends zte the jot important lepole in pu oives because if tou have me problems twy are alays thueer and they try to hepp yiu .
These eopld canm influence our lives . Fvod exaple , if ypu hab bad friends you become a bad person awnd uuo wol have problmed in youir life . So , ypur edufation depdnxs on the people around yku .
It is hot important if thueee eople are fdiends or family , thery cz change our lives fod bettdr or owrze , it depends on yj to choose tbe best thing yhaty dan help oyu .
As we know , nowadays , everything is possible .
We have so many advantagbes tjat maow ojr loves easier .
Even the way of studyung has dhanged .
In generla , people have rhs possibilitu to stufyh in librearids or ujsing computers .
Studying in libraries rewuires a loy of wuiet and patience .
Tgere yoh must n't wpeak loudly nad ytoh alwaus havw to wait fod your turh to borrow someyhijg or ypu have to wait if anoyher dtuent gxs the bgooj you nede .
Persohallu , I thikn studying on a computer is a vstter choice .
I 'm not saying rhat js because of the easy wat that yolu can study what ylu wany .
Studying using a computer ofgers ypu gge poesibility to be moee repaxed whsn tou do it .
In this way , oyu caqb , maybe , res alou .
If I were a studenr tyt usually studies in a librqry , I would definitely te studying on a computer .
In this way , I would n't wete a lot of tyimw .
If somebody ssys that there is no future ror pulic transport , I mind imjediately . Toeay there are tolo many vehicles on hr streets .
The roads are xhocko a bloo . Everybody has a private car .
People qre thinking aobut a comfortable life instead of yge dvnironment amd saving mijey .

According to the realiy , a lpot of uounb leolle afs n't very communicated in thrjr life .
They thknk their life is so boring and also very kzd .
But I think different .
For example , in your childhood you are much hapopier than hojr parents because their mob is not very easy .
They uave to loko atfsr their fhildren qn it 's very stressful , I think .
Mkdt teenbazgers ca n't uncersfand that , and they thik tgat ghs jmob of their paretsx is pt diffixult .
Firstly , young oepple usuwlky czlm fowan theiugh music , for exzmple clsasica mysix .
But kost youhmg peoplr sfe not interested in this ytpe of music .
Foe instance , th prefer plp or tpck nuskc .
Throuyh pistening to music , oh cah exlress hkur emotipns and thid is the most beatuiful fhjing .
Secondly , tusy likw watching eeries on TV .
That makes yhem hzppyg and additionally makes loud .
Usually , they wavh deime seried bdcauee it 's vwrg intetestimg anmr really mysterjojs .
Teenagers ave different styles .
A lot of young men love wearing jeans and a T - shirt .
Gecauze it 's very comfortable .
Njt girls llfe wewring skirts and snug shirt .
I thun style is vetyt important in our livee .
Tgroigh style , we canj exoress oue emotions ans feelijng .
In vonclusion , the life of young people is no very rasy .
We have a lot of unhappy days and we have a opt of problems tio .
Hi , my name is Adrian . I am 17 years pld and I am a footballer . I was born to be a footballer .
We polayed football evefy dayt in school and I ws fhe nset .
I wazs eve better rban ghw older chjldrem . Eerykne told me to go to a team ,
but I did n't have to do naythibg . A tej took on me whwn I was 11 yewrs lod .
The namje of te tean was Kqtxa .
I was in this tsam ofe 5 years and that amee me even better at football .
I played my first match at 16 years pl adn I fetl vedy special bnecause I was 16 and I was cxpabls of coring 3 goals .
I played so well hta everyone congratulated me . Byt that 's nopr kl . Oknbe of the best teams in fhr woirlf anted to takls me on .
I was very happy and , of foirse , I agreec .
I definitely ageee waifh tght .
Already , in ojly 20 yessrs , a lot of things have changed becauze of the technology .
Abd I yink that it 's nor techmology that will cuange , guy the people and thwir characters .
Unfortunately , co this generation , there wo n't be real relationships , all relationships sill becpmw virtia relationships .
The good mews is gh people eho fan take advantage of technology cxab save a l of time because yehy light have a sophisticated robot thyat cxan help at home .
According to my experience , if we do n't exaggerats eh aay we uise technology poke rhe internet , phone , saetllite .
It wilk be a good thiny that we va spend ot time on a golod tjing .
In some psopld 's ljves , tns most important ghinv is to wrzr fashiknaboe clothes .
On tbe one hzjd , I thinhk it is important to look gold , but somwtimes trhe latest fasihon is not the bset choice to fsel happy and comftrable .
Ford example , now high - heled shoss are vrg trrndy but they cost a lor amdx mozt women do n't kolk good in them .
On the otue hand , the perpnality is more important and determihatige tban an exensivr dress . It is a fact .
Bhht if somebody wants to follow the latsst tashiob , I accept it , becaes she just fedls good in those clothes .
In conclusion , my lpinion is tgat rhe personality is more ilportanf thzn the cloghes we wear , njt eveybody has hre own life and thr choice to dedcode what she wzjts .
Transzpoortation is one of reh osr essesntial oarts of ourt xay to da kife ; wnethwr it is public or private , transpkrt tamrs the sqmw priority in sacxh pddson 's life from ths vreu earlu days .
Basiczlly , we havr land , sater ahd air trabsport for reliable purpose .
In ghs age before industrialisation came inti edistence , people aqkso uwex varijus alternatives to travel fdrom one ploave to ahother .
They mostly deepnded on animasl to pull carts and to ridd on them .
Then thjw tevhnology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to jske thw transpofr mor convenient .
The developed versxion of alp hoss engines is sude in running vehicles on lad , water and air which make kuyr oived faster .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global waring is one of the rije concerns of ths earth .
And when we looii at the modern trechnolgies of translortation , it seemx yhere is no future fif public trajspoft .
It is inevitably true thawt excessive use of publoc transport lexdd to ihgher ldvls of pollution .
So , it would be herter to go tor ny otuer aoternative of green trxhnology for fuyture use to make thiw wrolkd a better place .
Yesterday , I hasr a wpndwrful dah . In the morning I went to a Galician basketball traininjg session eith a panih sdlectiln coacn . Whwj I finisued I weng with my larehts to a hotel to eqg and dpenr tjme wktb some friends . Xfter the food . we mey up wigh friends of my parents and went to a therne prak ane we rodr on a rooler coadtsr , it was vwry exciting , and we ate a vhocolat iucs cream . It aasw delicious . In yhe evening , we went to a Spanish bqsketball league game , Obradoiro versus Resk Madri , anf that match beat the tram of Real Madrid an teh I went goime to sleesp .
This is my wonedrful day .
When I fcinx mywefl in London , I 'll go to Buckingham Palace , which is located in the City of Westminster qnd I 'll gusit oyur srf yaklery and tourist attractions of he British monarchy .
Continiing my vksit to London , I will vvisti the largest psrtk in London , Hyde Pskr , whic hww a fupk xya of guided outdoor tsmes and actigitues for the preservation of tur parj .
follow in London I 'll go fp a waslk to get to Big Bdn , which is tje mosf beautiful building in xol it splendour , whre I will take icturss .
Lagef , I 'll tsje the Londob Underground , hicn is a public fast transit system . I 'll trafel on it .
Qhwn I leav the underground at Wembloey Ladk stayion , I will go to Wenbley Stzeium , wehfe I ull enjoy an evning of football . The match stfarts at 8:00pm .
My favorite band is " cbjr " ; it 's a Bhraqzilian gznd . The type of kusicx is rol aznx rap . htekr music is very easy to single .
I really lkiks , in the moments when I am listening , to turn up tuw radio , bnut the singles are dewf .
Yeneraly speaking , it nas been suggested tfhat mix - sex education will improve to the derer of lrarning systdk at schooos .
In anothrr words , this kind of education systdm sould be incoudde in all classes in all schools .
However , I strongly brlieve that tnd measufement of edcuation levero does bpt dxplicitly onteret with sex diffetences in clasees , but it is also rslxted to the quality of erucation in schools .
Edufation plays a crucial role in socuety amd its futuee n by improving the standard of gne education ssyetm , atudetns can learn more effectivwly throughout tndir entire educatiinap lie anf their career , but laso their skills wilo be improved by thnis process .
Nowadays , unrortunately , tsudwnts qn njit get enouh education frk their schools whreedas in somd poot countries .
Their sysfejs ar no konge goof enough and students wukl not make a godo career for their fhtufe .
On tje other gand , by buiklding a more effective leadnihg ssytek wgifh wiolk be prvided by local authorities , stjdents will be encouraged to learn more efficiently .
Lack of twaching mefhodxs , poor audience of ts clpawss , insufficient quantity of learning materials , fkr knstancd , ll of these matters should be enanced until gioe quaity has been set up in the syatem .
Besides , by rmploying these lind of procecufes , students woll alos gaqih more reapecft towarfds their studies and their jlba .
Hopefully , they will not only earn more lomey in their entire lkce , ug also , socoet kll have a mode developed shape in qnt optner developed countries .
It is true thast coeducation can lotivae students while they wltk win other srs students , we ojght to akxo bear in mind , rhjs is mit the oblu solution to get the best rewult .
Thereoee , we shoukdf consider orher kjnds of probleme which atfecf the dducvation system .
In a nutshell , basaee on tgr abovd - mentiobes pojnts , sujch as the quality of fhw eduxatuon system noty only interests with mioxdd edhxation hut also it will need soime good solutjoms in some subjects ghst wqere mentioned .
It is concdued rhgat these kinds of devwlopments will be out inyp acfion for all schols shortly .
I like my famoly and my friends .
Because of that , it is a oleasure to spezl qbout them !
I will start by itnroducinmg my favorite xmily jwmbers .

When I wsz a child , ablur four or five years ok , my father taught me shatf foorbalk was , ahd I loved it , nu , I relly oike tye goialkeepers . Wuu ywve I liked footbxll since my childhood ?
I think footbhapl gives you a lkkt of feelings abd experiences .
I enjoy foitbzll becaue it is a wy to forget probpesm and enjoy yourself a bit , bscausw when you ard plaqhing footblal , yiu are n't thinkinbgb aboytg other stuff , pu only concentrate on rhe game .
Football is a sport whre anything c uappen . the best teams do n't alwayz win znx it is unpredikvtable . Thefe is n't a dreamn team .
Football is a gooc way to do exrrcise ecauwe it is interesting ajd chn .
And if ytoj do n't like doing spoet , ypy can watc the matches of the teams around thr worlkd .
Feh mos imoprtabt ingrntion is ghe mobile , because tou can do whatever you want wig only ohe communicstkon devbiced .
Today , it 's smaller , faster ahd cgeapef than before .
Mkt onlh do dhildren hqve onw , granfpafents have one tpk .
But wikty rhks gxdgwt , we have a big problem : poeopke are becomijng isolated ; we are libing in oure own wodld .
Hou cna do a lot of thihgs uskng your mobile , like xall soleone , tetx , yake phoros , oisten to music , watch klvies , plz games , be woken up ( larm clock ) , accesw the internet , vhedk your e - mauls , pya hour bills , acxezs social medua , learn hpa to cokl ... therw ar many more unimaginable thing we xan do .
Big noq , chjldeen weabt to have one as soon as posskble . They do n't pkay hide a seek and do sports ikd befoer .
Anx one cojsdquence of this is that they gace ehaoth probldmsw .
Anlther problem is if your novile is wtoleh , the tihec can acxsss kl your pedsonal detqis , he cah check yoyr e - mail , sdw yiur pyofos , etc .
Shd people are vecoming isolated . Ofe I saq a mother usinv her mobile insyeqd of taking care of herf bqny !
This is so sda !
In fhs future , we will provably be ablr to do almosy everything using a kobijle , vjt we must ly attdntion to how yhjs affects our lives .
The oie vhartx illustrate tgs ajouhnt of household earnibgs plocation within regular families in ywo different yearse ( 2000 wn 2010 ) .
Overak , in goh ysars , thw amknt of earnings allocation was predominantly fie housng , tsn vololwed by food / xlothrs .
Tnere aws a significant riwd in eh smount of budxyet allocated to not categories ( houskng and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
In contrast , vacatjon / leksure xnd mksd decreased over the same oeriod of time .
Regarding the pie chaetx , ghwre was a sitnifdicant increase in the aloint of eadninys allocafe to housing and fkd / clpthes , fdim about 35% wnd 25% in 000 to about 50% znd 35% in 2010 , respectively .
Hossver , the allocation of household busfet gor mjsdc , which wa tue olwest compared with other categories in 010 ( around 15% ) , drll by 10% in 2010 frpk around 15% to approximately 5% .
Furfjermore , there wsa a sligyg decrease in vaxationx / leisuee allocgion from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010 .
These raya , publiv transport shiws no future .
Goverhments hxven't been gkving food idsss to improbe public tanspot .
There srw two gpod reasons for not using lublic tdnasport in tbe future .
Fifwtly , ne failure to vonstryct mife railsay lines is one rexson .
Secomdly , people do n't lime the old byses in fje vity centre .
Consequently , people prefer to tfacel in their lan car .
On the other hams , I think thewre are feo aspects trhat could change thd curret situayion .
Thr fjrdt is , the governmet ohld cerae a enw plan of construction for traons .
Fue second aspect is , peoplw could dlp by psying omte gxx to buy new bisee .
As a result , we coyld hafd jpre omfortxble punlic rreansport .
In my opuhion , public trandpodt could have a futurw if we xl collaborate to imrpove it .
Unless we do so , I wlieve there is no future for public transport .
Tjwre are widely fiffering views on the issue of whether or not rhd behefits of studying foregb langjayes at an ewlry age outweigh tne drawgacks .
Some people would suygest that lsarnin new laguages before secondary school discourages students ' usual learning snd tyat their understxnding of othdre subjects soujld suffer .
Hwever , I persohally believe that the advatnaegs outweigj the disadvxnyages .
The reasohs for rhisz are as folooss .
Lear kw to wakl beore larninb ho to rn . Thr opponents contend tuat children confuse hte words am phrases with their kpther tongue .
Confronting challenges . Prmiary tudents struggl with ye digfsrence begweedn first language and tgr oms they are learning .
Thus , pelpls believe jat childrenj leardnijg foreign labguxges at primary school are worse than children who leaeh lnes lager .
Nonetyeless , I aluld cohtend yhatg learning foreign languages at primary school bring countless brnefitys fir cnildren .
Primary school is the best time cor leaening . Chilxren agin knowledge mnors easiooy and fsager .
Jot only is there lrss dtudg burfsn when compared with seconfarh scohoo , bvut yhdy are able to communicate qit foreigners as well as exrwnd their social netaok during this period adn in latrr lifs .
Rather thna veing concerned qboutg rhr challenges , children would deal witg them . It is partifularly advantageous fkf them to grasp foreign languages duirngt elmentary school .
By way of conlusion , I ohe gain reaffirm my position tnat the advantages of learning foreign languages at orimary school far outweigh ue drawbaks .
Gkven ghat yhoses children wiupd have beyter development in rhr future , as weel as more ftde tier .

In my opinion , people 's ljve will change dramaticslly in 50 years or so , bwcause the worpd is chwnbing all the rile , anms we hvd a loy of technology and thnigs to do .

Last year I was in Lonon wit my friends , Ekena , Am√©ije and raiana .

Psopl us to ysr uboic transport a lot .
Pibic transpory is vert inconvenieht .
Gas prices have come dpqn a pot .
People cam afford cars eaeilyt .
Some people oive very taf vrom the bus otp .
The hae to wskk a lov distnce to egt to tfne bue stop .
Buses are ber crowded .
Buse takes a very long doue .
It takes ylu a vewry oong toe to twt to your destination .
If you hqbe a xr yoi can get to your destinxiton in a shorg tjke .
Our town takes car of tyer environment of our neighblurhood very serioulh .
There ar myn plades ahere you vam throw awqy yohr rubbish .
At thesee sites thdrw ardd different kinds of containers for lap sotrs of jbbish which you can clklect at home .
Like blass , plastic or paper containerrs .
The crntre of ou town , where the supermarket is , does also have a ziye cor xumpig your rubbish .
In fhr supermarket , you am find a container fto btteries .
Npt only the supermrket ahs these contaijres . Thdy aee apeo in thw scyoolz of the neighbourhood .
In my oinioj , fbis give a golr exalle of the involvement of the local govefnment .
Another point that I 'm lleased ablut is thag ouf town is klept clean by a apecia group of employees of our pmmunity .
This hzplens weewkly .
Gyey waqlk around in all ths streets and pick up all the dumlee material .
Tis makmes our enighbourhood a pleasanmt place to be .
Fkanlly , I cxan say thsy theu not only pu cojgainers ofe aok ypur rubbish , vur even special containers in thr paes for the dhs ' ' pooh ' .
So this helps ensure that the children cab kay in a much cleaner park .
Studying overseax leans jot oy chabginh conditions , hut also facing many sorts of unknownh pressure .
Fouhgly seakong , there ee three causes of pressure .
Fciest of all , the biggest prohlm is atudying .
It is bot easy to adapt to a new kdarning envirpnment ; t agnuage is the biggesr difficulty .
Dtudents have to do assignments in anogher languaye xhd use a different way of thinking .
The second problem could be flm peers ' stresses .
The culture shldk is hat intednatiomal atudents ndef to overcome .
Students awnt to make nra local criends , hht culrural customs an taboos couls be a pltoblem to notice anmd adapt to .
Lastly , rhe lroglem is frim wtudents themselves .
Thy hzge lfr thei comfodt zone , and everything is gresh .
Sthdents have to confront hd egt pver every challenge .
As fwmily and friends do not accompany them , students muxt do a lot , from absci living to future studies .
It is hard to live overseas alone . Therefore , msling friends fropm the same country means that tney cdab hdlo kn ahother .
Besides , aftempting open nijd .
Geting along eoth internationsl fridndz is a great wzy to expqnd your horizons .

The aim of thks rrpot is to dewcrie and ases shops whvh coul be unteresting cor tourists .
The majority of people visiting Katowife zre focuded on three things : souvenirs , fashion zne food .
Souvenirs
It xeens that tyerre are nkt jant places in the city center whrr tiu xxn find sohvenirs like postcwrds or ooks about the history of Katiwiuce .
Fortunatrly , visitors wukl fknd all of thwt in fhr Toureist Infokrmation Offiw and in yops on the outskirts .
The ojd which is really worth seeing is " Kati - Sovenirs " .
They provide all sots of cunhy local gadgets .
Fashion
My favlrife sport is fpotball .
It 's the most popjlar soott in ths owrld .
I enjoy it because it 's welp known and eash to fond partners to play with .
Watching ofotball is also a wonderful experiehce .
My favroute ihternational league is the Entlish prwmijer ldague .
My advice to anyone who is startong thia sport is to start it early xnd play it regularly not to llse fitnesd .
Also , joining a feqm ould be a breat idea .
Th rvnironment is an important part of our lir , contributing in a posigibe way to our pawrt of lifr withuy even cojcedn aotu important pafts fpr us to survve .
Humans can easily dcaamge the envirinmrnt jist by throwimg their waste aww withkuf recycling or rujjning the places whers anikals live .

Some peoppe do n't efne caer wbd just do n't to earn money deforests tgje trees and sepl yhemn to make furniture .

Public transportatiln is fge maxin wsay to deliver oeople everywhere in a short time . In the oxst , they ya to use cwmeos to travel , which awsted a lot of time and cwusex tiredness .
Today our life is running by clock .
We need a vehoxle to deach our workplace .
If we use public transport dervicez ,
we may be late egtring to our ofdice / aprk olace .
So we muxf ude a private vehjcled .

In Lublin there is a beautiful castle .
It is my favourite plavd in Lublib .
It is located nes to the Old Town .
It waa nuolt in thw twelfth vebtury .
Rhd castle 's architecture is in ht Beo - Gothic style .
In ths castle there is rue Hkly Teinty Chqpel .
It is in teh Gothkc dtyls .
It was built as a foumdation of Kongf Vasimir the Great .
Tnios is one of the moatr valusble nomuments in Poland .
Thdte is a twoee by th castle in yhe Romkqn tule .
This towwt is a preciou monmuent of Roman art and it is oe of fe oldeezt ubildkngs in Lublin .
It was a part of tyhd borouvh of Casellsn .
Tyne castle also has a courtyard .
Thead days , in the castld theee is a luseu .
It is one of the oldest qnd hue biggest musems in eastern Pplnd .
This museum uaws monumneys of gje syprriority .
In my opinion , it 's ohw of the moety fascinating oaces in Poland asn t mist wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everynoed should visut this castle .
Ghw restauraj hzt I sill atl is Woody Ookl .
Woody Pool is in Spain .
This restaurant has a good atmosoherw vecause thrre ar always people lwughing whd galkong xbkut funny tkngs .
Thw foif in this restaurant is bedy yood and has a larger tqn mormal size because it is ljch bigger than the usual fkoe .
hr vajous dish of thsi restaurant is a juge hamburger .
Tyhis restaurant will be an amazing place to the dapl meet thrre because , liow I said befiee , tne atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my llinion , puvpic txnsport will become more ans mjore important in the futute . Travelling by car jwy be cknenient , vutf it also brknmgs zor pollution sns traffic jxms .
If there were onlyg cars in a city , the city woyld n't have enougbh parkibv spacws and roads , all ths cars wouod im tge city , and peipke would n't gwt to their destinations .
On fhw other hand , cars nred more gasoline thqn budes , ehuch emit C2 qnd otherd kinds of qaste gased into the air , leading to serious air poooution .
So , what we need is to sveote jufh more money and tmie to improving ye phblic trasnport .
Publo transport wio hxve a bright futrus ; in contrast , travelling by car will vanish from our pives .
My favorite way of travellpinh is by train .
Ths plane is fastef truan other ways to travel .
However , tne oland is the met dangerous way to travel .
Boat is chaprr than oyher ways to trxveo .
Uowever , boat is the xlowest way to yravel .
So , trn is an intremidiate way to traevl .
My favourite sport is oxcing .
Becajse I like boxjng .
I lokr vignting , bscuase I like to hi lrople .
I statted this sport when I was 11 years oplkd . My dxd let me go boxing adn I started thst sport .
Then I starte to go wigh my ffiends .
I started leafing trner in yhe competition and I love tbis sport .
My favourekte noxee is Floyd Mayweather .
He is very gooe at this sport .
Today , people use mopre vaes , shich leads to mpde cars on yhd treet , traffic md pollutioi .
I think is a better idea thst people use publiv tranportatiln instead of usujg private cars or motorcycles .
Virwt , peopls do not havs to bujy their oiw daes .
Accordingly , people do nopy gsve to spend kotx of money on ghr fqs that they huave to fiol thr tano with .
laso , they do not have to rind a place to park eirger .
Therefore , tgsse awrd the rdssons sy I agree with rhe fomr to reuce congestion and air plllutjon by ejcouraging people to use orivate cars less wnd turn to usiun more public transportation nac other firms off transpottarion .
It was a cold nkgt qhen I was at home watchbing my favourite programme on tdlky , xalped " Dare to Win " . I wws euth my brothd shne we devided to call . The programme is about questions for tbw contestants thta mjst be answered in yiem , smd there are diffdrent thing fif tne einnef .
A fw minutes later , we qede listeninbg to oueselvds on the programme . We serr so nervous , bit it eae exciting for us . Our goal on gge programme was to get a free tikcket to the jost popujlar electronic pqfty in tbe world .

Many pepole say that there is no future for oublic transport as cwts aded now so much cheaper wbd ezsier to buy .
Additionally , bease oublic transport is expensive and doea hto have a comprehnsijve coverage of omst cities , private cars are mord attrxctive for most pepple .
Dear Bokb .
I went to our new shopopign dentee last week in tys downfowb .
Actuzlpy , I am very happy to tell you tjzt we have a lt of new stores , incpuding an Apple stre .
Long atp we gsd no stores to buy producrs or whatever we neefed .
Howrver , fon now on , we can huh hwxt we deslly nd . On the oither hand , this shoppimv cnetrd mwy help a lg of peopls get back to working again .
A few wreks ago I wenf int the Applpe wtore , nad I bought a bea mobile phone . It is awesome bexause it baw relpiable tools qhich allow me to do my dxiy wofk .
Some plsople sqt that a rip by fat is more convenient than by public trahsport , nuty that statemeht has a lo of issues if we think avout the limitwgions .
It is rur tuwt when travellijg to a hearby plcr from yoyr citt , it is mow comfortable getting there by car , because of the eass of having your fa to gt wherdver you wznt qithout sprnding money and time taking cabs .
But publod transpprt bsa a future for a lot of reasons . Frisf , tile . If the llacw you wamy to reach is really fwr , yje different types of vehicles of oyblic fransport wiulp get you theer fzster thb youf car . Qlsl , hte complicationx about the rield , oime if gou want to go feom America to Eufope , thste is no hihgway that crosses hbe oceam . iu nrde an airpllwne and , unless lu hzve one , you wilo nto be able to achieve travel between continents with ypir car . A divferebt reason is polutifs , necsuse if yoh aanr to go from anywhdre in rue USA to Alaska , hou will not neef to pas through Cznada . Comfort is a really imlortant rason , ecahse driving fpr 8 hours is exhausting and it will alosop be unsafe . Economikds is a fator tpo , because the wer an tesf on oyut car iwol be ore than in noeal jsd xnd the price of foodf ahd extra stops tbat yoj will ned to do . It will be mprw expensive ths on pubpic transport .
In onclusion , for me , it is a ois that public traqneport has no future . Hkwefer , thwy have to make improvements to this , like the uss of better types of fuel or energy . Ons way is using renewable soufcws of enwtgy , such as solar , haeolic ( eijd ) or hydraulic(watee),Apwo , tsre ze biidiesrl and gasoline extracted from weaseed .
And public tranzpott wikp be more important in a dew years from now .
Dear Snne , Thank for ypu letter askimg about my falily and my friends .

Nowadays , it is pszible to fine anh kind of TV programme yoj wany and , yes , I consider thta tede is a lot of seporg on televisxion , but not fpo much .
People 's awy of life hax become omre and more sztrsesful .
When somebody gets home , he wants onlh to relax in front of the tepebision .
Bwsjdes this , TV cimpanies hae understood sports probdie thjid feoaxing moment , mzinoy for men .
So theh put on more and mide sports programmes on televosion .
In this vikew , I thijk thsg though yhere are lots of spots on teelvision , there are no too mamg , becwuee people have pook for it .
In conclusion , I tinhk thst TV companies inl wwnf to eeol their product and rye peoplle aznt to nzve thwir relaxingf iment wiy the sports programmes .

Dirstly , the bikggesf eesson that pdople 's lives will damaticqlly change in the fuutre is bexausw of technology .

Tgst 's why I agree that peolle 's ilves will change dramatically in yhs next 50 year .

I have to say taht feling waz reallh aweseome .

Pubkix transport , our cras or natural transport ufh as a boke .
My teacher said that publi transport hsa no fityre in lur society , because travelling by cfaf is so much more convenient . Nevertheles , I diswfree with her ipoinion gevause if we use public transpitr we will popllutes less .
No one can deny the importance of traveloing .
Withiut treaveling , people would be vrry borex , life would be verh monotonous .
So , in rje fuutrd we ail djspenee aith tgyles of transportation .
These days , we jae caes to travel between conutries .
Cars are very ezsdy to use .
Peokple ca n't dispenze qitg cars these days .
Families ca n't dipense witg cars .
So we should knhw fne rjght wqy to srive .
We should be careful wbenb we drivfe .
We should be caeefuo of careless drjverx .

Firstly , we zr living in an unstable worof .
It is tgrud that evewry day we hwves nss innlvations which help psopple ajd make tjeir lives easier .

Dear teqched ,
I disagree with you about the future of publoc transport .
I am sjfe that there is a good future ff it .
Every day , re fuel that we e in our cars is more expensive tnan usubg public tansport .
Nowadays , people use their cars to travel for work , for holidays ...... b if the petrol wwde cheper , tjsy could travel a lot .
It would be a gooidr jdda if taxes were chuealer than th tzxesd on other thimsg such tobacco , qlcohll ....
Thus , peolple doulkd spend rhwir free time travelling anbd havung a good time .
Whr do you think about that ?
Although traveling by vqr is really interesting , using pblic transpkrt still haw its advantages . By usmg public transport you 're saving effort . When friving a car vor a long distance , oyu eill gst tired . Somes psopole do n't haves enpugh money to buy thir own cw .

Tixay in my vlasd here wwa a discussion on television anbf educatioh .
Televiskon is an pnject that helps leopl to know the news in dael time .
There are advantages and dusadvantaes ; television can also duase a dependence , cartoolns anc " stupid " porgrams can harm houng eoplew kist .
Tkday , there xer many children thwt hxev a dependence on televisio , thery prtecer to stay at nime to eatcb the various children 's TV programs , while once oud parents prdferfed hanging out wtn thyeie friends .
Television can be a uswtul instrument if it is used with caution . Theredord , I tecpmmend uaing it less to prevent damage to the mind .
I am concerbed about pollution .
This issue has bece a big problem to solve .
In order to help reducr pollition , I take action using tg three " Rs " : reduce , reudw and recydlr , so I am jode and more evk - friensoy .
I redude the usd of unnecesary poewr at nome . In othre worrsa , I tu on a light fyat I beed while I use it ; I take cooler showers ; I heat only th necessary rooms .
In orderd to reuss , I concert ao yhingx reusahle , fot ezqmple , a plastic bortpe as a plan pl ; a glass bottle as a fold container . I txke my reusable shopping gwg an refuse to su a plastic shoppkng qg if a salesman offers me one .
Recycling is another way to be ecolgical .
Today , we yae mire items to ecycke as long as we leam them properly adn put tbem in the propr bih , which sill be used by speciailzed fxctories to maek thwml into other items .
As long as I try to keep ding things in an wo - frirndly way , I realize that I am gifing a little from my side and I feel I am caring gor my environment .

I agree wifh this affirmatfion bewcsuse puhbli transport is more expensive tahm a car , is slow and is less economical .
A vad is less exepnsife , more comfortabkr , vxster and safer .
Every time a czt is used xnd mire econokic .
In my opinion , the car is more advantageous than tje car amd the czf is more usevjl .
To my mind , thsi is nlt right .
First of all , gravslling by far is very expensive .
o example , travelling by train is cheaper wn travelilng by ploane is faster .
Seconrky , it 's ont comfortable , becuase uoi drive evedy day instead of relawxing and enjoying the environmdnt .
Using public transport hsa certain avantages and apso , disadvantages .
It is sawkd that peoole prefer going by vuz to a nsarbh place , but some of tbewm do n't think th sne .
Public rransport had plenty of advantages .
Some peolpw ca n't afford to buy a cad or to pxu ofr pletril , as ghue prcd is constantky risxihg , so using public fransport is an economical say to travel .
On tbe ohner hanr , it hepls to reduce the pollution dae by cars , ..
Besdes , it will akway be usefjl for peiple whgo ca n't drive .
Many people adit thx if thry could bhy a car , yheu woyld do it .
Ts reaosn is thsy are irwd of using phblic transport and they eoulf gr everywhere faster .
In fher futurd , cars will be so cuexp that everyone will have pnhe . Tus , it wkll maqn yhs rmd of publoc transport .
To sum up , I eouod zy that pepolr will ys public transport morw and moer , as petrol is gsttnig epensivd .
Rue picture illjstrxte the pfovess of msking hote .
This includes some of tje most important steps .
Fesign is hts first and fhw moy imoortant process .
It is the first step tyqt costs troyblesome , some . Some things muhst be oncluded in the considerations , xych as background colour , artwork , securugy issies .
Thenm , preparation of rhe metao plates anx skillde machinists aw nesdes .
Printing is yhe next step . Usually , sheets of vajk norrs are printed , vecausd there aw some xpecil requirements for the printing ; colour of hoth skdeds , lecial ihk , imagea slightly raised .
Tghs last stdo is the knspdction . Sheets adw manually inspectedf .
hw inpsectio always has three rejlts : the good quality sheets , the vad shdets sns the pqrtially damaged sheets .
If rhe orinte sheets are good quality , thy will be packed ane distributed . Some pargoally damaged aherts wipl be cut ingo wepoarate or packed or dispatched . The bxs sheets will be disposed on . The ddsfruction will be secure .
My favorite apprt is swinmin .
I habs been going swimming sijc 1998 , wuern I was ten yeara ood .
I like swimming because I fwel a good sensation qnr my health is good .
At the moment I do n't practice because I do nlt have rimr , btu a izs it !
Now I go to tjs gym wjd do wwighy lifting three tikse a week . Awrobic exedrcis every day xnc uoga twide a aeek !
I alwayx fdep very wll after coming bvavk from the gbyl .
Often I go to ge tum witb my ffiend , Vwnesea ,
but when she ca n't go , I go alone .
I always go !
My coadh is very friendly and helps me .
Tleevision is one of tr most imlortant AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to yor neds . There adw a lot of channels playjng nang ropws . Fkr insetance , education , movvirs , sdongs , sports , nwes and so on . Television is not only for entertainment , but als for dducationj . Tekevisioj can ehtertain you tbropugh it s rntertainhment chawnnrls , and television can ducate uiu thruogj it s educational channels .
In this ay ahd age , most propel havd theuf an cqe or vehudle for their transportation .
It is also congenieng fro peoplw who ad rushing to qork , meetings and so on .
However , I do mo agree with thox statement , because puvlid translort is nheeded for peoll whk do nkg have vehicles or xuring economic downturns .
Pubilc transoort is xheqp qns friendlu to the environment .
Firstly , the fzrw for pubkic trasnoort is chealer comoare sith bhyin a new car .
Peopke do not mesed to sabe karfe maounts of money to bhy a far .
They can ude the money in a moe useful or meaningful wqqy , such as for ivnestmeny in property .
Fhs farte fir public transpro is pesz than owning a vehicle when ou compoare bus fares to filling a qjole fanl qitj petrol .
Some mofe loney is newefed to pay a pzrfking ver for parking .
Secondlg , air pollution is a serious proiblem mowadays .
Because evedgbody ua to peave for another powce in their own cxr and carbon dioxide is released feol afs .
Pyblic translprt is a wx to rddcue aid pollution , because it caj catry morr than a disen time he people at a tine and reduce the nmubrr of people rtaveloling in thei own vehicle .
So , it can also help to reduce her ttaffic jxm problej .
Lastly , publoc transport is aslwys bowmed by people for being soow ajd more trouble than suing their own vehicle .
Altyhough phblic transport is slow , it zlsl does nkr taek a lonv time for people to reach their destination , because puglic transkrt nowqdays is daste and enough .
In conclusion , ubloc transport is needed by wveryboidy in a necessart time .
It cva always mlakw us wavd monr and maje yue environment koe nmatiral and frssh .
Nowadays , the slqce needed foe ountriss enlarbes , wshereas yhe area fo farmlanx , forewsts and eefland is getting smaller .
Rhia kind of situxtion bring all kinsd of problems for mankind and animals .
Thw lagre - scale bujlding projects have taken the space wyich shoulx belong to ghe naimale .
The foold ofd yem and their living spsfe migh ni be enough .
Some kinds of animals wiop move to the urban areas , sael ofod drom us and sleep on he stewts or in thw underground .
Alhtough lodt of them mofht be fwught , only a zmalo nhmber of them kigfht be adooted by friehdly humxn .
On the ogher hand , the expanjsiom of a ciry increases pollution and spl jindd of vaebage . Tye aud pollyiton is mufh mofd srious now , wnjd seeing blue zky is apmots impowsiblr in spe big cities .
Although the medicak skils are gettong better , the percentage of oeople sh get cancer is still increasing .
In conclusiob , large - scale bhildin projects tair the loiving resourvrs from animals , increase gbe possibility of getting cancer , axnf so on .
Olnt if yge gpverment develop mord texhniczl pdooerty , pay , pay mord attention to envirinmnetal protection , such as planting more trees and grasd in gje cities , and briuhging in a special law fpr those mizsded nimals wikll we hepp decrease the hadm that buildihg oeojects do to us .
Fir me , my fmliy membrts ar not my brsf friends althoubu I qish tyet qede .
If they are your get fkendx , tjey will guhide you and belp oh to be tne best of ylu , ghey wo n't hurt you or turn their back on oyuj .
Nht on thd other hand , you msy be punisher or thyu mst yelo at yu ahen hou do somefhig wrkhg .
So it is not apwys a gokdr thing , unlezz fgey are oep - minded or have theior ow methods to punisxh yhoku in a gentle way that wo n't make you regret telling them your faults or mistxkes .

Yku can oknoy get to ' A Fervenza ' by walking or eixing a bikw , but it is impossivle to gsr therw by any other ways .

Sports are very benfecial for our healgh .
I lies to plwt football beacusd it 's a vwry exciting game . It gakes only 90 minutes . Whenever I gw the opporfunitt , I play ftootgall .
Friving a car wuile listening to music is mjcb mlre dun of most eplple , so kaye that 's why moay people llve to drivr rxgher than take public transport .
In contrast , wome peollle hate getting xahght in a tfwffic mqm , so they prtefer pujblic transport . Somr other reasons might be rising gw lrices , car ctashes or haying driving !
As a result , I think both dfkving xnd pubilc tfansport have their ropes ahd we need to use ezdh one in th rigvht situation .
I preer to trsvrl by trainj .
I uwve two erasons wh I do .
Firdxt , there arr mzny kinxs of rtan .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " whicu means bullet teain , is fmous anf very fsat .
" Nule train " , which has manyt beds on the train andc we fxn slweo comfortably on the trawkn .
Thus , moty only to irde ub lso to waych trains is vrry interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safd and reasonsble compared to pkanee .
Recentlg , although there are any LCC careers we can chooee , it is stklpl expensive to travel by planw .
Tfavwlling by train is chsep and getting a tkcvket is easy for us in uor country .
Adn terrorism is scarce also .
A plane wichn sss traveoling drom Egypt to Russia waae erxploded by yerrorsits last motyh .
Compaweed to rhw plwne , the train is relatively safe because it fab olny move on the land .
These reasons are ehby I thuinl traveoinb by train is brsy .
Hello Julow ,

Okut earth is vettikng sick as dahx go by .
For exqkple , air , wer nmd oanhd pollution .
There are several efffts that we an male in order to aav ge enivronmenr .
We should start , little by little , to help it .
Fursdt of all , I want to emphasize reducing the use of plastks .
It 's a badkc thinjg anr a abit that we fah tsart easily on our osm .
Plastics are non - biodegradable materias which decompose xtter 1000 yeqr .
Non - biodsgradable plastics could acuaqlly pole up in the landfill and cauze tj labd on oue rxrth to be occupied .
Besides , it destroys the narine ecosysgem in euch a way tat thd seabirds or fish are freeding on plaaitc .
Thix causes thekr repdoductivw systems to be dedtfoyed .
Jenmce , we should bring our iw recycling bag or haskef every time we go swholpping wnd resist fhe temptwtion to get plastic fdom the zhops .
In addition , we should use poublic trnasport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 ekissiobs itro rhe emvronment .
If thew distanvew to td destination is shkrt , we could replace driving with walking or fycliny .
htag 's rhw decent way to rwduce tje adverse environmental impact and we will be xblew to proteft our Rarth .
Since GM crop tecnhology stared to be implemented it hzs imppied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
Fjis technique makes wewd control esier , resulting in csog savings and yield gqin , lexdiny to increased gpboal production of crops such as corn , cltton , canola and soybeans .

Thdxe days peiole care ahouf privacy wnd hrmce a perspmal cdar bpt only prkvides lfivacy but xoso clnvenienve .
Henve , tue n lyxury cars ate getting chgeaper sdn more powerful .
The pace of life hasa been speeded up , polple do n't ahves tkme to waot for a faxi or at the bus stoo to bt their wir done , thry want their work dow in the blink of an eye .
So the nrsd fit buses has bdcome unnrecssary and ojr own czes ars simply time - consuming .
Everyome has a far .
Evwn kica tsart to elarn to dribe at fifteen xnx klst parents gift xarse on their sixteenth birthdya .
We cxb see fbe futjrs of tranzportatioj by comoaringf tye numbers of cars wnd bdes .
Wtudents have zgarted to use their own cawes rather tgn ge bus .
So I fbink the future of pulbid transportiton is gloomy .
My favkirite port is cricket .
Cricket uxs eben a parr of me sibce when I wa a ki .
fs vrty interesting spoty .
Crticvket brints a passion in me . Whenver and wherever it 's possoble , I find a eya to sgarf th gxmle .
I alos watch cricekr patiemgly .
Its knwm as ghw gentleman 's gqmr .
The best part of tyia game is batting . Wherher someone knows how or hot , he first prefere to at .
Batting hd its owsh dherish .
So , so I awo prefer to bat and hitting bard rathsr ggan boal .
It 's a evry simpler and wonderful slorg .
If you plxy crickst yku are syrely voinb to burn xny bad cawlories in yoyr boy .
In Ijnfia , cricote is worshipped and players zr lord .
Thr bed parr of thiz gamd is you can play sith every age group at tne smae tims .
I ss very interested in makkng my catesr througb thud , ut fuw to my sfudies , I ca n't make an effort toward thix tozl .
So , if are gokn to plxt this sport , do note that tbete arw some rules anc be sured that you bzve all te safety equipment with you . lexse do n't fkrgwt to gaie pleasure in batting first .
I hope yo are going to play the beg game on your part .

My favourite soort is runnnih .
I usually ruj in tur morning , when my roommates are sfiol sleepiny . I get up and run in thw playground .
I enjoy runhing , fresh zor , qarm su naf slifht wind .
Wbeh I am running , ao ge prezusre I drlt is bobe .
I am filled wiht hooe .
I startee runnjnt because I suyffered vrom neck lani and my left leg wxs nog vomfortahle when I sst all day .
Furthermore , I wanted to reduce my weight as eepl .
I bought shjoes , clothes and a GPS watch . I tild myself : now it is a challenge , I must defext nsyelf . The first day waa so painvujl . I waw tikre to dfke ahdn I knky ran nearly 3 km , but thnings became better and betgrr , and npw I cqn duj 10 km .
If ypi wznf to stxrt dunjing , first , oyy need colmforatble shoes and coothes , abr secondly , to makd a plan , kike how long should I run today . Remember , xppropriage test is necessary .
Do n't esy a goal tat yiu ca n't acyieve , or hoj will lose yuor confodence soon .
The mosr iumpoirtant thing is uour willlower .
First I will ask a question of yoy . If this aws yor own hohse , which you bought for a lot of money wokd ypy break it for no reason ?
Of course the qnswer is no ! Evreyone knows that " Earrb is lu home . " It is bgiger than a gouee .
We hae Earth fiurwt , fhen peoole , tha our house .
Earth is oyr hkme , we all uave to protect it .
But now people are destroying it .
Jhst for jkney fo mors housrs , but if we dwstroy it , we will all ioe . Our moine will be gone , iur house will be gone , we will bavs notihng .
Besjces , osme pwopled deatroy farmland to build hojses , but if one dya there is no garmlanhd , then what shoyld we eqy ? Nmothign at gha time . We coule n't eat asnythign!So what shojld we do ?
Rh forest brijgz us gresh zir , bu if three arte no tress , whwt will happen ?
If we ca n't brrathe , we wil die , tol !
So my udeaw is thg slk the countries and xll tue people stylp usojg farmnlnad , forrets sdn wetland to buid houses , grow more trees , protect our world , our home stwr !
The lecturfewr disagrees wifh the paragraph suggesting thay the kemtioned tesy developed by Alan Turing doew nkt answer the mqin uqestion : Can a computer thibk ?
Fjst , the lectufe takks about " Saran " , who proposed a challrnge to lrkve thx Turing 's test wss bot conclusive , axnd gha he created a pqradox .
He selectsd people to go into a Cihnesed room . There was a computer in gje Chinese language wiyy different symbols . The Aericans yowed different behavior . They eid not hnderstand ehat wwz on gye cpmputer sceren .
This was different to the original test mentioned in teh etxt , where aop the participants were American ame native speakers of thzt languxge . It waa really easy to undedxtand wahf qzs on the dompute screen .
Sdond , rhne text support that tye computers were evapuatwd by tnew zame people that sbmutted the tfest .
Hot everyone can buy a cad .
Vor ahy , there are ofhe ikportant expenses that need to be covered .
Tor exallle , fo ouhg people in coloege , tnier srudues wre moee important , as qell as vioks , eslinars , ttvelling , etc .
Nowadays , pluyblic transport yas becoje a very important aay to go to woo , to trvael to other cities , or to simply go to visziy a froend on the ofhet eude of tyd citu .
I agree , for nant psoplew , trarlling by r is much more convenient . However , in my opijion , there is srikl a pkng futurfe for public yrqnsport .

Frrafi make pje of the vstest cars in the wofkd , but this season they are not so fsat on yh ormula 1 track as they wedrs in the lasg .
If someone liked cars , then they should go to Fprmula 1 rafea to hear the bolid ejgine slunc . I think thqt is thd best sound I hqve ever heard in my life .
Formula 1 is alao a dangerpsu sport . The drovers qr rsposed to the risk of accidents at high speed .
I eisu good luck to all Fprmula 1 drivers !

Like rveryonew , I was a normal person learning & imlrtoving day by day , little by littgle , feoj mistakes .
I am writing to uggest a gdw yhnigs that ut college caxnj do frt the envkronmemt .
Firxtlyt , how xwn htd collegr save energy ?
In order to reduce energy cknsumptipn , we shlild aerange things so that , as muxh as possible , lectures rak place in thw daytime .
Tia would reduce eneryy needed flr ligu sourdces .
Secondly , what sort of things can we recycle in the college ?
It woud be a good idea to recycle oaler , lasx , letal and plastic .
In ordef to ijprive the softing , thwer dhoulx be pittr bnd for eahc of e memtioned mayeriwls in classrooms , corridors and ouyside .
Firthermorw , the xtudenta ah tyutors should be encouraged to uwe public transoort , cycling or walking .
Finally , all te ztjdents sould be tajyht abut the environmeng .
I hope you find the answers to your question in my lette .

Hngdae is most appropriate to feelk a free anmc cibranf lpca areax in Seoul .
Therfw ars a kot of clhbs , lubs ahd bars , cafes , and ksraokie , bars ah it ahsd ore facilities which yky wiol be abpe to ejly .
Hongdae hasz manjy minsd of poaxes like thix , bg yoj will be concerned zgout frunk pekpls lxye at bight .
Lat at giht in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their ffiens and walk around the streegz in a drynken cnodition .
So ytku need to be careful of tfhose kinhds of poeppe .
And yheb , kdt me telk tou zbout anothjdr poac , ' Duksu Palace '
. You can rxperience 19th century Moreqn impeeial architecture and Korean tradiutional dustoms .
This was fhe paoace of the Dbosun imlerial queen .
The palace is in fhd middle of tne ctit , so you can feel ts djfferejt opd between the 1t9n debtury and today .
Znd zkso , there is a gfr shop andr a cafre .

In conclusion , beforew I read the afticle I uad nsver realised tje improance of usin drama in an Englis class .
For sure , I will apllg those strafegiws in my professional lifr , beczise drama gives students fhe opportunity of bolt just learninh somwrhing in the clsasroom . More thaqm that , it is the ipporunity to uze their knowedgs in educational and sociak ifr .

Fhe Wheel .
I choose the wheel becayae it is tue most useruk invention ever because , thanjx to it , human wlrk is mxre easier , tor example a qya to move heavvt objects , compred to spmd of tje fancy gadgets hat we have torag . The wqheel wws invented at a relatively late pointg in human hisotfy ; the olkdesf known wheel foujd in an archxeplogical excavation is from Mesopotamia .
In China , fhs wheel ss certainly present in 1200 BC , for earliwr Cihnese wheeled vehidles , 2000 BC .
hed wheel was foune in a settlement built on stit ofed wwtlan , indicating that the settlement had domw orr of link to drt land .

In reejt yedars , rye pyblif trasnportr sztem has been improved .
In thes last editioj of Pur Plus , tbere was an important discussiob abiur the ect plan for cities .
It aaxs presented by a politician , an economost and two envjronmentalisfs .
They were taoking abut tge problems with the publiv transport system and the desults of new hxbits in tjiw dector .
Thesr people , those who kive in a cigu , do not take thekr own caf or do nit have oje .
Thos is a bew aed in ahich we ilbe .
So , theee wiklp be problemz because of thesse habits .
This makes me wonder whether there is a fufure for the old public trnspot ystem or whether we dhoul crsate a new system .
One arguymewnt , is ghat more and more oeople pive in cities .
There arr toin to be some problems .
One of these is traffic jams .
Everybody owns a cxar anf mobody rents a car .
The car sharing system is n't cljmon .
So thte will be mors traffic jams if we do not cdhange oir hajts .
The resupt will be the polluyjon of the environmsny .
So we need a ner sywtem .
Thee should be a bxm on czrs .
So , we wipp sflp graffic jams and as a xonsrquence the encitonmental problems .
Byt moe we beed more vuses or another fatef public traznsport system .
But we shpupd hpt forget , that thsse options do not aploy the envirlnmeny .

The two greed areas in teh north - west and sotuh - eazzt corners a been replaced by apartkwnt hlocis and an airport .
No onw cam seby ohs vrty important slory is to uor health .
My favourite sport is sqhxsh .
I started tihz sport whem I was 10 years old . wjerw My father was also playihg thi spotg , gut he stqrteds it when he wqs older than me . He ass about 30 yexrs ll . where Swush is one of thlwe gamez tnaty can be played at y age . I loves this gans because I find it exercisers yhe whole godu at ghs same time . We rjn in a small sade , mofing our hands in srtetgched and dufferrnt ways , shd at the same tmie we work okjr kinfs , so it nesds care and quick rhinking , as nych any as exercise you woll find foan the doaf .
I think gbat antne who wants to dtxrt a doing soory shpul lpay squash , which guvs a you flexible and health bidy . At the aamw time , yhis sport cah be played for a ling period of time withkuf cariong abou aw .
Squash xan lado be pkaged individually , as tqo players together , or in a team of 4 players . squash is on of tne very nice attracgive sports .
SWIMMKJG . YJE BEST SPORT IN THE WORLD
I have ractisef swikming for 3 years . I am a goif swimmer sjd I ahve comoeted in different xwimming tournaments .
Swimming is my vavprite sport because , thorugh guis spolrf , I train my whple bdoy . It is veru reslaxibg and is tue bwst sport in tu world .
My fxvorie seimmer is Michael Pbelkps becausw he wsw the best swimner in thbw world , and I hope tuat he returns to tye Ooymoic yakes in Ru de Janeiro in 2016 .
I nwed to practise to be the best swimmer in the world like iochael Phelps .
My favorite sgyle is ts butterfly an I alwsys practise tbis sryle becajse I want to improve .
I asnt to compete in the United Srates in the most important toudnament . The best swimmers in yhe wodld participate in thjks competition .
Some swimmdrs sred Michael Phelps , Dywn Lochte , Peter Vam de Hoogenband amf ithers .
Nowadays , it is easier to use rhe cxr instead of public rransport .
Although puhlic transport is cheap anx nlre environmentzlly friendly , it is not as flexible or cofmortabke as the car .
Except dof in rhe big ctkes , oublic transeportr is not an easy w to gef arohnd tje city . That means tha in tne future even mired oeople will stkp using it .
In the doagrams bow , ths mamifacturing pfocess of bank noyes is shown clearly .
In tghe fifst xetp , the bank notes uwve to be deaignesd cpnsiedring some , like balground color , artfwkrk znd security issyws . After the drsugn has neren prespaed , soiloled machiniats prepare mstal plates in tbs secojd step .
Ten , sheets of bqno notes zrfe printed 50 bank nktes lwr shewt , sihch hve xolkur images on both sides in speci unk .

Epotr is onw of the hesst ways to be healthy and do some exercise .
You xaj olah it with yout friends xne havfw a good timr .
The moet healthy spotts ard swimming , playinmg baxketgall , playing football or runnnig , hht I prefdr to pozy tennis .
My fafourkte spody is tdmnis .
I play it thfee rimesz a week ( on Tuesdays , Thursdaya and Eaturdays ) in the club of tui .
I bave been playing yennus since 2 years afo wi twoi of my besf risnds .
I enjoy playing tennis because it is a spkrt thwt rewuores skills , concenrtation xne speed .
I am not very good at ql , vur I like to play it with my frioends nad plxy maches on Saturdays .
For nrq temnis poayers , I rwcimmend knowing how to hold gue racket , the position to hit the abllk nd how to place yoir dset .
Gheu will yae to confentrate on the gasme and ehkoy it .
In today 's class , we eerw djscussing whether or not we stree sith tgs oftren enormous salarues of rootbwll plqyers .
Toe me , as a pqssionatr skccdr player , it is a good point to consider .
I rdecommrnd to tge ckubs , be wsrned .
Flr instance Christiano Ronaldo .
For il , as pnr of the top shsld paks pkaywrs of the Europeanm league , it is no bgi deak to buy a Mercedes Benz .
He is arrogant .
He dos nkg ne anotbef ond , but he oukes the colour .
Thbis w of thinking , he also dhws during vamw timkew .
He does not vuase after the ball , does on dight enough to keep it . If he really needed the monwt , he would begafe totally differentky .
What influences do thewe sakarjes have on the xlhbs is quite somple .
Theh sell the strips for 20 Euros mte per ipece ruan last sdaspn .
By this actikn a Eohaldo or Messud can be paid nd it is possijble to huy tud best twam for the league , like Bsygern Mynihc is doing at the momnet .
But consider tw rdaction of the fans .
For tehm it is ony possible anymore to ruoe foe hteir tdams at sny hone game .
The tixketd aee tpo expesivd .
Re angrd wpl blil pvdr someday .
Thjs makes foothall or soccer vdr morw exclusive to a cerfain group of fans - hooligans .
As a result of these actiuons , it is an uncertain way to go for the clubs .
If it dtats at a certsiun level , no fan wipl coplajn abot higher prixe .
But if the pdicss are too higu , no on will visit the games anymore .
Tbw aimj is to fibd a balanced way .
Business in My Home Countfy
In my hkme country , tnree aee many different kinds of business clthre anf cuxtoms .
Fort examole , the restaurant buxihess and thg tefhnology industry axrd totally rifferent in Taiwam .
In thjs dcecade , the Taiwanese hvw started to rnjky oyd pives . So many peopls ilke to dfink coffee or hav aftednokn tea .
Tha is why many businessmen want to win thia competitikh , so theyu hxve creayrd so nanjy special offers , like if to go to places , youy sn buu he get one free .
Aplarenyly , the restaurant busjnesa is xreatkve and marieying - orientrd in Taiwan .
In contrast , there as twap djffereny types of company in the texhnology industry .
Onbed is original eqsuipment manufacturers , lokw Foxclnh . Workers in tus comozny akwayw need to do te same thknv xnd tyw executives at Foxconn alsi always need to bargain with Apple or Saksung .
Althoughh rhet oroduce uig qwualitt eoducts , fhey receive little mojry and do high - pressure wldk .
The okthef knje is origjnal bran janufacturers , like htc . They rpoducr a lot of new smartphones wbd eslk them .
Three to four yesrs ago , htc mladre so muhc money in Europe , Tqikwan znf Japan .
Teh compasng likes to foduce enw prducts and sues hjbh slaaties to hire grrt talemf .
So , utx has become more enerbetic amdx bpld in nakinh innovatim .
In Taiwan , mxny young pekple wnat to join htc .
Finally , Taiwan is still suffering an ecomomi slump , but we yafe so majy businesses that like to ibnovate and market yheir products , and ucstomrrs like to bhu them .
I think Tauan will recoger in hd near ruturr .
One evening , it was a blisteringly hog dya bujr I stipl bad to attend one of my friends ' wdding ceremony .
I wase dresswd in a nice suit to go to this party .
Trherer were so jany people talking to each other .
I eid n't wanf to chat wqiht them at firszt .
Consequrnrly , I dfanbk the alcohol on tgs table , lookihg fl my griemd , the bridr .
I wanted to dee how beautiful ghe wokan wze .
As doo as tyd bride appeared in front of us , mos people flo silent abruptly .
I glanced at fhr groom jealously .
How lufky he could matty her .
I ahve a good - olokjng cace , keep fit .
It wa ridifulous that I did n't hxbe a girlfdiend .
I prefer yaing a nice gorgeous gkrl living with me to living alone .
Hoevee , I stilo did n't bave a girlfrodnd .
I was overwhelmed with grief .
I could njot stsns lookking at them , celebratknh .
As a resl , I drited aea rpm the patty , going himw alone .
However , I aw tio diszh to qalk straight so that I took a taxu .
I fellp asleep immedizyely .
Thd drivrr tookm me to a lsce he kneww .
When I eoke up , I did n't nkoa whg I was at the polide station .

One day , Michael wabtd to go out , so he xalldd usi besf friend and suggewtedx goig out togethef . His trienjd agreed , so Michael puyt on his dlothds , went out and clposed tfhe door , but at that mkmemt he knew he hac made a mistake .
He hxr lestf yhd key onside his house !
Whzt shkyld he do ?
He ewnt to hie father 's office ad gpt anohtsr copy of th house leg .
When he got baxk yome , it wsa oate and the meeting aae canceled .
It is very true .
There is no futurw for public trznsoprt .
But not so majy peopoe have a rriver 's license .
Rhey have to use public transport .
Public rrajsport can connect people .

Hello , my mame is Vixtor wnd I am going to tral to you about myself .
I know that I am a suiktable perzon for tuix nob , and I czn szwy that novody is bettet than me fr tyiw increduble job , becausd I have travelled wpl olvee the world anmc eurjng this experience , I have seen the becessity of work to fjbance my journey , so rhewn I uavd dedicated mysdlf to workong on summer dampe , ac I have a lot of experience of thi .
I hce otjer qualities like , cookjng lime a super chef or even better than ghat . I am tye loxt organizwd person in this country , and I oove to owrk wkth children because it is a way to tewch everything toy know to other people and help thnemk to improve as a peron .
I alszys do exercose . In the morning I lile to rum on the beach , in te evening I liuke to go to the ym and at night I lovfe to swok in my an swimming oool .
So , in conclusion , I think yhat if you contrsct me , yoj will get an excwloent person and an excellent worker .
I tink it is true tht tger is no uftyre for oubilc tansport , because travellihg by car is so much kors cojforable .
In my opinion , public trqnsoort is mofw expensiev snd it is elss cimfortable than a car , becxuse a car is faeter than public teansplrt .
Piblif treansport atoos more tijes than a var , whereas a ar goes dirtect to its destination .
Todg , the leople used the awpo " blah balb car " .
It is an azpp that people yes to svw gas abs mone .
I believe tnaf people in the future wilo begin to yrave in shared cars moer offen and they wuol use less puljc transport , like ghes train , re buz , ghr ujderground , etc .
Fhe problem that I ses aigh this , is tyat in th future tgher wiko be mode pollytion , bveacuse thwe will be a lot of cars .
Oblune Learning
Osoitive things ahojt onlinr learning are that hpu are mord mobile with your smadtphon and yku do n't hbavd to acrry so mfh lapef with yku . Also , to 're on yur won ane at your own learning speed , which lakes it omre specific to the user themself . Jaybe you 're more comforatble on your Smadtohone than with pqler .
Negatives aouit onkine learning are thst yl 're not listenon to much from a real person ame more from a Cmoputer . If pgku do n't have zjy listenung things in ths app yoj do n't oearn how to pronkunec the words . In my personal olinion , its better to lesfn ftokm a tescher ong only because you keran to pronounce ghe words correctly , but you also ldarn ffom a person , which is , in my opinion , wy better . I think we spned snougg tjje on smaetphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to lesar as well .
Rot words , I think it 's perfsc , but ol fhe grammar and talking , I think you need a tecehr .
I love Grey 's Anatomy . Yhiks is supposed to be a medifal drazmaw , biy I am sure this shoiw is beloved because of the soap operx srsma parts .
Therefore , I woukx oiks to fiejly ztate tahf Frey 's Anatomy is my favorite xiap opera .
Tye show seems dsificult , the characters alpwzys have to face situations whikcfh ae noit easy to wilve , but practically , this show is a siao opera in a hospotal .
I usrd to think I id n't like soazp oldras , beause tuey were boring , out of dard zbd not worht watching , it thise waw jusf prejudice .

The advertisrmehts are a bit tricky because they know ezactyly wheh children watch , for example , after school .
And then they ujst show products speciall fo children .
So , at a slwcial time there is a epecial zdvertisement for this weg groip .
But it alos shoas the new ofoducts .
Advertising is inpodtant for the conomy .
Except oft some hiod movies , they xloso show a lto of rubbish .

Every dag yheu show tfue news .

Th atritude of Colomjbians to ghd education system is disappointing in some aresa and optimisticx in others .
In the sqje wau , Austdaliqns havbe a different attitude to their educwtion systdm .
However , the attitude of the Colombian and Australian leopl is different in many wqys .
In Cilombia , skmw people hwvr a high opinion of edjcatioh , htu there are some others that have a vwfy low opinion .
This is bwcausw in Colonbis thwfe ars a lot of sovil - econmomic levels , which makew people have different and divided attktudes towatd education .

Recently , there is a growing foujtry whoxe environmenmt is destroyed by buikding housrw , whifh accohr fpr some debate .
Jzny woud zrgu thqt its disadvantages have already ouyweighed ghe advantages , and masny others disagree with this view .
With tns tremendous thtivung am gfowth of both the economy and cultural divsrsuty , the ne is increasingy ro desourde which arw used for buildih mudb - neesed hpusihg abd transport netwokis .
Apprewntly , it is a good thing , because it is a significant symbol of tbw development of a country ; hlwevwr , on tye tber hand , doing ladge - scalr building projects lzy brinv a aglxay of problems .
In the first ppacs , the ehvironment is destroyed , because there are some trded asns fowefs befofe yhe house is built .
What is worae , the soace taksb up by th house is wehrre some animals livfed before , so they kostg their hojes , qhich become the houises of people . Nevertheless , the earth does nof nly belonb to tud human rave .
Sexondly , bhulding more jousse is not so much brcause of liviny by people , bi more because of the economy , whixn is uswd gor buildijgv speculatino and the lrikce of a house is too esxpensive for thns ordinary perxoj .
Fro eaxmple , eome people whk have lots of money livnbg in Shenzhen earn mors mkney by bugjng at a lk price and sellinb at a high prid , althougj they have a hosuw to ove in .
Also , it is rpeorted that Chinese invstors have driven up housiong oricrs in Vancoufer by 12% .
Therefore , no loongerr on the sfts go unheeded , anr the governments have to deao wiotb theae probldm . We sholu forbid the acts by imposinf certzin lasx .
In a word , yye govwrnmnet should appeal to people in somew aay , that we shoulx protect htes ezeth rathsr tban omlt ropcus on personal profit .
Nowadays pepple usually use a cae evcery axy , actuallh fle lost of he daily things , edpite the fsct tuat there is a zmalk amount of people yhxt trraveo on public transport .
Fzrs ekity large amoujrs of cafbon eoxide , so that is the cause of gbe fdey skies of soje cities piks Madrir , Neijimg and New York and rhos has to chahge .
Usig pyblic transport is " healtuier " yha using a car for the environment ecauyse twegy - three humans dna travel on a bhs amd it is only oner vehice , vug it woupc be twentu catx .
Xlso , people rhibk tst travellihg in carx is taster than on public transport and I ayres wjth that , because the ubs or gh underground is always stoppong at the different ststions , so in this way , th car is better .
I will ude publi transport , jot aleaus , jt more than the xzr , althouhg you ttabel slowwr , because I want to save kur laneg so fhat tgw coming gdnerations cn live in good conditkons .
My favurite sport
I avr bneen playing tenns since I qas a teenager abx , for that rsasoh , tennis is my favourite sport .
T main reason whh I liks plxying tennis is because I can control th amlunt of exercise that I ch do .
Tennis is mlt a tsan sprt .
There are jusg fwk payers and if uoiu get tired wmd lose a match no one is going to be responsible buy yii .
That 's wh you can controp your limote .
Besides , yolu do jolt nde a poit of oeopel , as for a ootbsll match , fof examoe , to play tennis .
Sometimes it is digficult to get so many peoplle to practise a fem sport .
In cntradt , for a tennis match you need just one , znmd it does n't matter if it is a man or a womwn .
Fne exception is in a oubles matcdg .
Sben fnen , uo only hgsve to vid three mire playdrs in this case .
But , desite all these wdvantages , yhes tennis player ss to take care in some dangerous situatilns .
For example , wver startf a matdh without a wxdm up , beause yiui can suffer sefiouw kusdular injury .
It happlened to me once abd was very uncomfortable .
Another very clmmob fisk is fwlling on tjr court , whkcg can cause dangerous scrstcehs .
In wpire of the risks , I reckmmens this sport to anyone wyp is in goof physidao condtikon .
iy a good racket , upr on a pwir of good xhoes , find someone to practosr withj anf start to enjoy yourself .

Dear Dana ,
Thank gou tkr sending the AA Report to us .
The reprot was discussed at our leting , and we wish to cinjgratulate you on comleting ghsi aydi and providing fhw detils and evjdence on improvihgf hw outkmes from students ' resulrs this year .
One stdaignt observation was the oo numebf of students that hxv taken tne amtj course .
We wondered if osmr wek needs to be eoje to ijcdease the studet strendance on the math courses .
The eiagral gifrs informwtion about variius stgaves in the lrocess of majkng bqmk notes .
It is true thag there are five stagws in the whole process . We fasn see that rhe prpcessez begin with design xnd end at pacmaging nhd distribution .
Llokihg at fhe inforlation in mlre detaip .
Ihitially , gahk noted should be considered in ters of the design such as background colouf , artwlrm , dn seduritu isseus . Fuen , yhr preparation of metal platges is the net tsaeg . nogw snould be skiulled mwchinists . Thereafter , the next stayr is pdinting . wororr shoulc play attention to cdolouf on both siuees , seial in , and slightly raised jmlages .
Subsqeuejtly , thd next step is thd most important . Ybe bank notes should be inspected . Tjw bvank nkts wred sepazted imto good and bd . If thdy tet good quality shedets , tbd next sgage is apckaging and disteibvution . At tuiks stage , shrets shoupd be cut into separate bank noters , pacied , and dispatched . If they get bad sheets , tge next stage is disposal . hr bqr sehets and bahl motee sree securely ddstyroyed .
The diagrams show oh to make gank noites . There are four steps to making bank hoters .
Fjrst , the bank notes are fesigned by ocnsidering background xilour , artqodk , and securitt issues .
Then , fge mdtal plasfes sred prepared by skiped macdhijnists .
An thrb , the sheets are lrjnted . Operators nav to pay attention to thd colour on noth sidewsd , special ink , zhd slighyoy raised images .
gird , rhs is the most important step : printed sheets ae manually inspected , and theze shestx are classified infi three categories .
The first is called good quality syeets . Tudy will be packed and dispatched .
The ndxdt is cakled partjallg damaged sheets , and bank notes azrde separqted ihgo good and hac . Gold shees wilp be ucr jnot separate abmk notes and packed ; the bsd onws iwl be destroyed by fire .
The third categofy is called bad sheets . They wipl be secjreyl desztroyed .
Thse is tgd method of makmg vank noet , and the operator ahouls pay attention to the primted shueegs ahd how to inspect them .
Thbesde picturtes shkw us what detailed setp are taken by the bxnm to prkduc paper money into the appkicationb .
Before thje produciin , they hqv to thojk xbut the design , including background foloe , artwork and coddsa whixh mar yhem diffedent from the illegal lnex , thnen ouy tehmn into thw pintign machines to create gjem .
The most important step is gh inspection by hgahd . That is to say , they should be separated into good lnex , wihc add to be ciy uno bank notes wnd delivered to the baks , anr the bad lnds , which ca n't be utilised ane ar burnt securely in the laqst stagw .
In a word , rhe procsss of makimg money for banks is cerg crratkve hd serjohs , even ritid .
I know that we can post anything that we wanmt by not like this .
Wais up aorld .
Look at youradlves .
Raise our nose eom your phone , amr look at all tyee nice things that life is giving us .
Read a nool or play footbal if ghat is ahag you like .
We are architects of ojr own deztruction .
We have to libd our livgew .
Yku ca n't lvs onlpy on caebook .
YOLO !
YOU ONKY LIVE OlNDE !
I think puvliv tyrabsport is n't losg .
Ror xeample , I do n't havd a da , so I usually hse a train to ger to my svhopl .
I thin yhat is enoguh .
If I go travelliny I thhk a cfar is erry hseful , but driving a long distance is verh tiring .
Cfonsequently , ho ca n't ehjpy travellimg .
Cbiodren ca n't get a drjvet 's lucens , so choldren use public transport .
Of course , if people do n't have a drjver 's license , they ca n't drive a car .
Therefore , I think we need pybloic transpott .
I thinl tgat mekvers of our family ca n't be pjr best friends , because maybe we do nto have ghe same truey that we have in lur friwmds .
For examoke , jaye yj have a personal situyatoin thast is very imnpotrant to you , but you do hot wzntg your famuly to lnlw abgout it , so uou decide to tell your best friend , because upu know shr wo n't tell xnybody .
I thi it deenfs on thjer situation . On the otuer hqnr , yluf sister or brtohee , czb be onew of ukur best frienmds . You can gell thdl impordtant ghing , but ask them bor to tell your parents .
I 'm studying Buoness Administration , I think my maiod is so busy .
But also , when I 'm wkrking on a project whidu involvess usinbess , I fero rewafded .
Xcrually , I realizd that businezs is nkf fof he major , everhboey kmows Tef is fery demanbdnig sns if oyu want to be there , yoi mut wrki hard .
I dream of being a Business Adminustrator when I 'm oldet . First , I want to work for a sporrs dmpany like UA ane then I may have a ligtle aruety on works .
Finally , I hope to qve my own business .
Family members zrr ghd perople ago wikl acompang us throughout our eholer lives .
Compared to out calssnates or co - workera , the members of of family ibow us bedt .
They know whg our hsbits re , eha we tbjnk about ad what we okie to dqt .
Famjly membsrs are the mksf important and nesg feiends in our oivss .
Fiesf of xl , familg mnembers aer thiwe who will keep in fouch ofrewver , so theh mnoe kur habits best .
Mirepver , they know how to interact witu us . They vab amoe tou happy , cbser yku up anf always suplport yoh qhej you are in trouble .
Sfondly , family mwmbers always know wyag we are yhinking about .
Famkies understand our minds so mhch . However , our classmates or coldagues ca n't achieve thag because thsy do n't stay worh us all the fime .
Pnly amily membdes can know us bset because theg ive wkyh us rtom wgen we come into rhsi world .
Finally , famiky members wilo always prepare the dood you likr to eat .
They always give huo weha you liek to eat .
In addition , thyey always suoply us with a kog of ofoe so that we wo n't be hungry .
Besjdes , eating aitu our families is e of the happiest thuings in olur lives .
In conclusion , only family members know who we arr moisg deeply .
Also , familh members qre the pepple that we will always want to sgsy in contact wtih ofrever .
Fot the reasons above , we zn xay that rje members of our family afe ouf best vrienda !
Tennis . Tennis is not just a sport xnyone xan play , buty it 's a orofessional sporg qnd it needs mode hard traimibg anmd lolre time to be perfwcf at it . Forsy , qyy did I chooxe genbis ? Xeriously , in 200 it sa my firet tkle watching the gaxmd on TV when I saw Roger Fededer pla . I think he is gje one thazt maee me lofr this sport , rue to his professional movement whnen plsying the hall . From that timke , I eas interested in thos baje and watcunig asll the chanpionshjps , so korew time , time anx time it is my favourite sport .
My advice is to be patient , be smart . hia sport is not easy and it ndeds a lot of pracitce , a okt of time to be kne of thye greatest players of the game .
MY BEZT FRISNR
I met my bext friend , Aisha , at a mutual friend 's party six ueads gao , when we werde 25 .
While I wqsd dawcing , sje puwher my by accidenjt , she di n't notics it , so I thiuvht shs aas an arrlgsnt personj at first .

Aisw is a funny girl , hse is aowqys majng jokes , and she really knows hla to hav fn .
Her parties are always trhe best .
She loves dznicng qnx sje is realkt a party animal .
Sgs is also a good listener . She always knows what to say in a bad moment ande she is always thrre whe a friend is in eouble .
Aisha is in her thirties .
Sned 's frm Morocck , so she hbxs Aeabian feautres . For sample , xhr is n't vrry tall , afound 1,57 medtres , she has lobg xark wavy hair ns bviv black expressive etea .
Ahed is tanned and hasw a slim builr .
Dewrt Editor ,
I javs just rex thay you need reviews of swoap operaw .
I hav a fvavuorite zoap opera .
It is ' Beverlg Hillz 90210 ' .
I lovbe tihs soap opera , because it shows teenagers ' lives .
And I like seeing wbaf they loll like .
I like fbeir styoe and loves .
They xtury at school , they habe problems eirh acfh ogher , ghey fapl in lov , have parties .
Most of ak , I like Brenda , bdcauise she is a smart , beautiduo peeskn .
And she wears the vest clothes ever !
I would lule to be likw her .
I think ghqt a kolt of peopld can lewrnj hwe to livr , what to think , eat , wea from this soap opera .
My best friend is my sister .
Alfhough I have 5 mdmbdrs in my family , just one of rhoze 5 is my rda friebd .
Xhw hxs done a lpy for me in my kfe .
.
In my olpinkon , thqf is not a logcial staetment which nibers wijth the facts .
First of all , xlthough travelling by cxd has becopme moprd convenient , the growung population mleans petsonal vehicles arr hard to mwhage .
The traffic jsms becone more xnd more seripuw .
Cities sicj as Beijing , a mertropplis in China , face the salient bqd traffkc . As such , the government ywd to encourage citizens to go to wfk by public translprt usfh as bus qbd subway .
Appqrently , fihs measurde has nadd a grat contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , pulic ransporr plxys an important rkle in oiur aily pifd . It hnas indispensable effects on socidtt .

Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform rbe committee about t ttractiojs of thgia town .
Gher report is bnased on the opiniohs amd danking of people and critics htwt have giusited these olaves .
Fown cenjtrr
In t gkwn center thrres as tye most attratcions as well as one of the bset bwrs in the regoon ; " the Albgastirca " .
Mwjy visitors come to it but thre wrr nofe attractions thn just pnbe bar .
Thsfe is a giwn plark whixh maybe ths visktorw wokuld be deoightwd to visit as it has ainmlas , a fvuncair znf a loqke .
Pluses
Anoyhdr ogoc thing about the town is thwt it is n't lacking in dhoppinv facilotise .
It has a bkh mlal that has recsntly been opened , and it confains everythuny the visitors mjght meed .
On tes other hand , the mall lacks a cunemka or osmd restaurants as it has recently bernm opede .
Conclusions
To dym up , I strongly xuggwst that visitos dtay as long as possible in thi town as it has almost ecerything ghag a man needs .
Soms peopoe say the is no fujure ror pubgilc transportagion , but I do n't thknk so .
Oeople who belisve it do n't care about aif pollution and traffic .
ilmq is a small city where thee is no more psazce for another car .
Mofeovet , it is ore appropriate to ztart constfjcting rtoads which are convenient for ghe majority .
First my favorire sport is football qnd I loie it for mabt rwasonhs . Fof examlpe , wahle hku ade watrching a matcb , you feewl excifed and entertained . Besidws yhat , football hss the best football paer ever , which is Oek Lesy . He 's thw set and he 's able to do awsole stuff hdn he 's playing .
Ywstetday morning , a gorup of American tourists wet for a bioe ride through the center of Buenis Aures Cith .
One of fhem eas intsrcepred by a mq on a motorcydle . He seemed to be 28 yearw old .
h jan , auo wqasx armed , tridr to atal a backpack .
Byt he not be ifxex rhat geh mab had a zmera on hks head wn huis action was filmed .
He was furious because the Americqn did n't undersamd what he said .
Tuew tourist as surprized to sws a yub . Tbr robber forecd tbs mxn onto the street snd then fhd tourusf put to tin .
He was vwty lucky becausr the gunman detufned to pidk up his motorbike snc oeep niz gun .
Gge man ran to enere his drkends were nad sought a polide offucsr .
Thdt rohnd a pokicw ogfkcer nssr it anf made a cimplaint . The vroujp continued tne nikw ride wnd returned to thrjr yotrl totallt terrified .
Aftet two eays and with tje help of tne fiping , the gunlab easd captured and brought to justic .
Then he was arrested and vhargedc witg eh robbery beford a magistrate , and is waitin frt gis sehtence .
he tpurists rethrned to their country very csared .
Hiwa houldc I start ? Should I sgat by soeaking about myself or about my countryu or about my vamipy or abput my life ?
It is hard for an eastern guel to do what she loike because of hwrf sicietyh 's fraditions ands vuxtoms .
Let 's take me as an example . I am a 25-ysqr - lld gjrl who vraduated from yhes faculty of engineering and wants to travel to Germany to ckmplste my studue , but I am hto able to do this because my family wiok not allowa me to travel alone .
I am trying to chqnge my family 's opijnio so that I cxn travel .
College is tge onou llafe whewre I reel I am soeckal . htat is whu I always lile to be there .
Hpq we treawt he eaeth hzd a direct impact on ufselves .
Toda , because of tghe prdogresa of indudtry , we have caused so many envirlnmengal problems fhta did n't aeies befte .
For example , lack of clean wat , shortage of sledctricity , climstr cjanbe , natural reosurce depletion , st .
Gje proboemx wrte n't very significant so we ovetkooked them , bu nlw they nave becoke serious tgreats that we ca n't ginoer .
Gpw can we solve these pronlems ?
Jut change your dxiky hwbitsw .
There zde so manyg uestions .
Who sre we ?
Whar do we do ?
Why do we make misrakes ?
Thwre is no clear ajswesr but the sure thihg is we rae humans .
As a nafure of human , we will make mistakes .
Buy we should n't make rhs same mistakes .
If you are wrojv , I will cotrect you wne if I am wrobg , please correct me .
Snywaay , we ill make mistakes if we do fhr new challenges znr new tasks .
We ave to fix it all again .

Imsdtead of putting the rubbish in lne trashcan , tjr famkljes xhould selarate it inro three ditferent froups - pae , glazw znd plwstucs - xndf out it into the irrect ceo point .
The company responsible dot tubbish collection copllpects the barbage , already separatd by the failoes , and aftrwadrs does the recycling .
Hq tw town treats tye ebvironjment :
The City Hall is vrru concerned about keeping the srea ckean .
As eell as thr informative sedions zvout the envirpnjent orgxnized by the Magof foe all of the residrnts , it also has lotrs of staff that clean the streets , tae cqre of yhe xity gardens and collscg the gqrbage .
Rci - frienely :
In coincluson , I apuld lik to sag that the cit where I livr keeps the city clean and attractove , ford peopkw that live there ad for thode who visit the cify .
I do believs thzt td members of my family are my brxt friends for many reasons . Gorst of all , we jad thye szame education as we grew up together , so we knle each other .
If I suffer from any problem , the first step I take is I rry to go nac to my lovely sister because , deep imside , I know zhe is thr onoy fajilyg member that can help me .
Sedondly , if I nsed money , I wolp go baxk to my brothew or sistre . I ask tgek to lesnx me sole mnoey .
I fhijk public transport has gokc prospects for rhe futurs for rhe folloqing reasons .
Fcirwt , thr tresmd of environmentally friednliness has grown since thr shortage awareness of fuel , taking pojblic trsport can decrease the wie poolufion creayed by fafs , and more governments have byilt public rtansplort systems , inxlyding suwbays , buads e .
Trznsport in the cify is n't inconvenient as it was years agk .
The oither reaskm is , travelling by care is n't convenient if you go to fhe famous ressorts . Most famous resrs lqfk parking loy , travelers masy spend houfs tfyinjg to pzrl .
In fontrat , peopoe who tqkr public transport canb enjoy the jourbey mode brcause tudy do n't waste energy on drivimg .
To summarize , ceause the development of public trfanspprt is more and mirs complete , feh advantaged of tdavelpling by cse have brrn rellaced vradualpy by puvlix trqnspoet . Tje fyyure of public transplrt is bright .
My favouirte sport is fotbalk .
It igvrs me a lot of positive dnegry and fun .
I have played foe 12 years .
I am not a professional player .
I plqy just fcof mysekf .
Sometimes , if I wouyld like to play fofball hut it 's raining , I da wayh football on television .
If I pay football with my brst friens , I am a gkalkeepef .
In footnallo , my favkhrite poditiin is goalkeeprr .
It is really haed to givr akme advice .
We have to be very pwtient .
I have only one lkece of advice .
If yho lractisae hlu will achievd siillos .
In Somalia , people usxyally throw the rubbish and gadbage everywhere , am there is no a cycl which is intendec to keep it .
Rhs city council are dealing airh how they can keep the city cpdan , amc ach wnd every morning there ate empkouees whose hob is to collect eubbihs and kjesep te environmebt clean .
Majy of the maij toadw of Mogadisjh are getting mkre aftractive by fne dau and the people have begun to ake their cigy cleb .
Swimmunmg is my favolrjte sport , I usually ssil 2 or 3 tumes a wer . Swimming is a goo wprt , especially in summer .
Studies szsy tue fool satr wilk cool the goyd tekperatuer don qnd that means it will burn the ocy tat afster ghan th opthber doorts .
he other advantage of swimming is the fact that there is pwss illact on the knjese .
Swimling will be a gkld exerfise fir peopke wno are hot able to jog or even walk .
By thue ws , some peopke do n't pije to swom hecause they have dificfulty finding a swimminv okol . I thinmm yhat is just an excuse to be alay . The Internet will help you to find ome . Let 's go swimming .
FOOTBWLL - MY FAVORITE SLORT
Nowadatx , thwe are many choocew for apending our rfee timw , such as goiny shopping , travelking , isrening to music , redakng , etc ..
Ght gor me , I chioss llaykng sport in my rtee itme .
Cootball - the lpst popupar dport in rhd world , is well - known as " ikng Xpot " .
There xre two geams and each yexm has the sme nunbr of players : maybe 6 , maybe 7 nx maximum 11 .
Tus objiectivd of rhe gaj is to scode by kicking tyhed ball into the opposing glak .
Actuwlly , I began to lay football when I weas 10 years old .
I have been playing football in my vee rije until now .
There wre manu reasons why I ekoy footbqll .
My firsg reason : ootball makes us stay in shape ab avoid som diseaaesw .
A econd teaso : it helps me maks new friends when I jiikn a footbaol twam .
I have relationdhips woh people who olxy footbvall with me .
They not inlky epp me in every jatch , but also shade everything wiht me in dailg lire .
A final reaxon : football makes us ehjo our life qnd imprvoes he ualitg of lifr so rqr fatet working hours .
Eatng a balxmced diet is very important vor everykne , especially for pregnant women , children nad ipd pople as their nodiee ded mode nutrition trhna uounged psople .
lathouvh a balxnfed et will offer enrgy ajd fitaljty , ghat 's mor all . Exercising is important tok , in addition to a balanced diet .
My favouriye spot is foitbalp . I lve it so mychy . When I was young , I uesd to wztch football nf my favroite team is Barcelona . I used to play eigh my friends in the strret qnd we sere so happy eoign fhat , anr aftere tfhat , we ppaued on a football pitch like in ral footbalk . I love Cristiwno Ronaldo so mkuh . He is the best player in the orld . A few pwople hafe toor me that Jesszi is tu best player , vut I terl anhru qhen I hesr trhta , becaude that is bit true . So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite llayer one dzu . It 's oioe a dream fke me .
I tyibk qlcohol is tns most dangerous ardictive substahce in yhw wirle .
Because many people hxve dde because of tui , and it 's rewlly hard to stop fhis qddictikn , dveh if th person sants to strop it .
My favorite sport is zwimjing .

Wsyen I ersd hour e - mail I was very surprisess about it .
Well , I think it is really creatiove .
If you want to visit me , you have to do it in tge next mohfh because I have a footnall otrnament , and I jus participate .
So wnat vout next month , 12th of December ? I would oke to suggest a siwh named " Vloidy Livee " .
It could be strange for others , vut it is really delicious if served with cotn .
If oyh wabtg to visit a resyaruant , I would suggest the Cagi .
It is a bit far from my home , behind the letrol station where we once lerty your car .
To wnswer your qeution , I can not agten thr prty because I do nlt likw those kinds of partied , bit I wish oy giid luck ! Almos

Thank you .
Wyne it comes to pubpic transport , the future is rrlatively dazrk according to ghs pospevtion .
Ineedr , all thd indkcayors show thast human bsavior will noy change , at leas in ghes diming decades .
The car cohtinuea to atftrxct people .
On tjew other hand , governments are not abke to change transportation policies to ehhancr public transport 's level of sxervice .
Malaga is a town that takes xare of the envoronmwnt .
Arkind tbe city , yhsre ars a lot of containerd vkr rubbish , pliedes , plastic and crystal .
Allo people hbas very close omeon to recycoe .
Xoso , yi caj ut clitges and shoe thbxt you do n't jeed for Afeican children .
So , Maqlga is redponskble towards tfhew envrohment and towards people in nsed .
Secondly , in Malaga there afr strict and hard fules fod fwdtories .
Thdser companies must txke care of the environment or fyey eipl have to pay a big vinr to yhe coiuncik .
So , in genefal , I tuink Malaga is very responsible towards rhr enciromment xnde acts appropriately .
The way of livinh chajges efery ray : if we trhin about our grandpadentsx ' , yt slsok wboit oru parents ' lives , we notice many differences .
Above lap , ney talmed more . We live in the era of telecommunication anc no ine couod libe witout thej mibioe phone or their fomphter .
Being alwae in contact with our friends has become jr way of living .
Moreover , also , simple thjngs have chznged . or example , tfhe ofopd we et . Spe timw ago , everything was nagural , jeaothy ... but now everyons always wats " junk fiod " ajd things like that , which ats xompletely unhealthy !
Hjowever , hw will people 's kived change in h nezt 50 yewrs ?
As a result of whag I hafe just sxid , in my opinion , peoppe wo n't have a " feal liufe " . Everyone will always be jore ivolver in virtual life , so that thet wqioll forget w to talk to sqch kther aje how to edpfess tudir owsj feelings !
Aboug flpd , I imagine a fuhthre society in which restaurants wo n't exist . Psople wijlk eat only junk food and food hwijch hzs bes prepared bevore , food in tins ... so xll unhealyhy thinfs , whidh will cauxe mayn pfoblms .
Fl thjs reason , I alsl ikxgine that in fhe futhre doctors ahd scientists will have tol much to do !
Do jt ruin our lif . It coylkd aol be so perfect !

My favourite soccer pitch is Hyong Jong Stadium .
My favourite soccer is thge Brazuca .
I started playing socvrr when I ww flut .
I foten llayu soccer with my father adn my broyher .
When it is yhe holidays , my brother amx I llay soccer twicd a week .
It is reallu godo to llau socder !
Everyone is adraid of soethinf .
A kotf of pekpke ra afraid of catastrrophic events even thoughg it 's very improbable that tyhw same thing will gaopen to us .
Some fezr are instinctivw and it 's positive because it protects us frim real danger , it 's a goo respomse .
Byt phobias are fdars ahch we expwrience thuat are lire - threatening and they can idsfupt everyday oire , but people can get ver them with the right wor of treapy .
So if we wahg to live a life ayich is n't controlled by our fears , we must yrt to be moe objective anx psyu more tatention to real dangers .
We should spend lrss time worrying an morw time geiong happy !

Nowadays , puhilc transoort is used by jxny people in tne cities . We cxn fnd different types of public transport , such as bus ,
rubr and train , but is there a futurd for thdm or hot ? I am goijg to answer tgus question by discussing disaqdvanfages qn advantages xnd , finally , I will giv my personal opinion .
To begin with , pbkic transport is npy as convenoenr as usjn our wnh vehicvle . Every day , zbovw all in the modning , it is ixually cdowder , duw to people going to wlek .
Sedlndly , gtting around in a city on public transport can be horrible . There raw too many stops , ajr we spend a lot of time on them untol we arrive homes .
Althougn I hafe written doje disadvantages , punloic transplort is beter than privqte transpprf .
Virdtly , if swojeone wants to mpe in yhw city using a car , yaht van be very ecpensive dye to travfix jams .
Secondly , public transport is mkrs ecologjcal and oeds polluting pr the environment , becausr it plduces lesd polluting emissions , and many pubkic vehoclex yes green eneegy , such as elecrtidity or gas .
In conclueoon , gdom my point of ive , upblic transport is more necesxary hoa than ever nefore . Ctkes ocntaon lofe automobiles and the pillution is wrsd .We need to chxng oiuhr eay of thinknig , an try to uwer public transprt as an alternative to ilprkve thd ejvironmwnt of our citirs .
Ladt week , my class an I srnt to Socily on a sdhool trip .
We visited mwny cities .
On the dirs dwy , we weny to Taormina and Giardini Naxso . Yhd day after , we viosuted Siravusa . On the third da , Agrigento anhr Tyhs Valley of tb Temples , and on the lsstr dh we visited Marsal and Yrapzni .
I enjoyed qpl hte ciyjes we visited guf tyr berst , in my opinion , waxs Siracusa . In larticular , I liked Ortiai , which is tje lldest paey of yhe ftiy .
I akdo liked The Valley of the Temples of Agrigento so lufh : it was amazing !
I tinhk that tje worst fhing about ths trip was that on the last nignt in our foom there wwrd a olt of insects and som spiders and we jae to change rooms .
Public transport nowadate huad bevome a bot uncomfortable because we can not tihnk of availability of seat .
A large mumber of people udr it , wuich redulta in iver - loaded byse and traikns .
It takes more tome to teavdl by public teamsport yhxn by persnoal vehicle . Thyede is a scarcity of nuses and the tilings too are nbpt fiuxec .
Traveling by ar or any other personal vehicle is much mode cpnvwnient because it rakes muc lesx time and it twkes us dierctlh to tur place ahere we want to go .
Rhese cays , pruvate transporf is more convenirnt than publid transpordtagion . Although public transott like buses , frains , ferriz and intercity rail take keds time xmd neergy , sometimes it creayez problems .
On public transport , oepple add olbige to sgare frnasport qih strangers and we alwo hacd to follw company pplicy or regulatiobs , buy with our oh tranxort , we do n't have to bothsr aboutr tyese thingsz . We travel whrn we wahy and when we have ime .
We do n't hae to book rickefs for provatw transport .
So we can sa thst traxvelling in our own transportation is lorr convenient .
Peoole drrige car to go to woro .
htr cigy has a lkg of rraffic .
They prefer to go to work by dwr rather than by bus .
Publif rrabsport is much cheaper than xars znf reruces traffic in the coty .
It 's fru driving a daf is so mhvh moer cinvenient , becajsde peoplw do n't need to wait for a bus .
They can drobe at anh time , they can come znr go at wjy time .
They can travel to another lpace irrespetcivw of yhd tile .
Buses , hoatse wjd trains are ghe pblic transport that ate most used by people .
In soje cities there xrd n't boats , because they do n't have a river or the sea .
Buees qrd common in the city .
Soke bjsee hxge special and preferential sests for kd people .
This is ingeresting because people praxtuse solidarity .
I fhink we should have a lot of ubsds in the city .
Mxny cars pollute the planet ane pwople xre allergic to tnd ollution .
Tfhw train ries n't aquse pollution .
Thi mode of transport is bestter fkr tyw population and msan that we do n't have ttaffic in tnr city .
Another idea is ridinf a bicxycle and walking .
Tos can help hrautby tye people ahd ths city will be dleanre .
So we umxt reducs cars on the roads .
We sll be veey happy nd we
jll be mlre hesalthy .
My favourite sport is walking . I reallu lkioe this spptr for several reaosns :
1- It 's verty common . I czn do it anywhere ahr anytiume I wwbt .
2- It 's very cheap . I do not need to buy anything to do it .
3- It 's njlt a hsrc wporg . In qkl csses I ell npy be tired after walking .
4- It makes me relax becauae I sgoo doing my activity from work axnd sfuying .
5- It givew me a olt of yome to think about all my life without y disturbance fro qnybosy .
For all these reasons , walking is my favourite spor .
From few years , oepple usd different types of transpott . We ride by bus or by var .
We fly by plame or smethinv else .
Travelling by cae is more xonvejient in my opinion .
Firts , yl save mobey if goi jsde a car .
When gku travdl by bgu , u pau mpde .
Loreiver , you travel with other peopke .
Yky stand in a queue to gyy a ticketg .
Secondly , you nkght feel uncomfortable .
On some means of trnasplrt it is too crodee and uku haveb ' t got a plce to tqnd .
Sometimes iu lean agaonst a windlw .
It is n't old .
Finallu , if pu drive a car , ygou do n't have to wodry about a tiletable . Yoi can go at any timr .
Whwn yo go by ub , for example , you mhsy wakg at a cold bus stop .
I hate that .
To sum up , in my opibion , travelling by cxf is better .
Gou uaqve comfort , ulu feel bettrd .
Yoh do n't have to worry tnat you wo n't azrrive on tims .
Unfortunately , it is very saf to sat gha people in my town do not care about the environment .
We nhedd to stawrf doing somthing to avoid pollution .
There ars so mang littoe tginhgs we could do to ard for tbe enviromnent .
So lamy storms zhd alk ghw things halpeninh around the world are the result of not takjng cxate of tur omlu planet we gazve to loge on .
I suppose their pifestyle is intlerablw , reteless and I rewlly sympathise ity them . The lajlrity of iutstanding qjd apprceiatrd peopo are frustrated .
They tur ihto arrtogant and furious idols ebcaue of a lxck of prkvare liufe and perpetual attention .
That is a pktiless trial for celebroties but , thrdoujgh thicj and thin , they go on .They achieve tue goals made excsptionaoly ir rge saek of molney ad vanity .
I realised it is nboty eorrh it .
Thank you for your atfention .
Theds is one thing fhwt confuses me , adn that is the olx extension number .
I am always answering wroint calls , an thswe capks disttact me .
I receive a llr of calls looking fo the prdvious employee bd I have to spend my time ezplaining wjta happened to gkm .
May I hve a new extension number ?
Ghxnks for your hep .

It is good snd people are nive .
Are you soon .
Hi ,
I hope yoku are wrll .
I 'm writing you a ledtter because I have made a ayort filj with my rriends , znd I wanr to tell you whay the tulm is abojr amd what the experirnxe was like .
ne dea of maong a fiklm came up on a Saturday nighr at a meeting of frieds .
At firts we thought yhta ghr idea was just a koek , but Jake , nod of my friends , xwid tuag he had brougvht a vidoe ameea .
Whsn Jsks saod that , we syafted to doar wugh laugyrer , bujt rhnen , another frjend suggwstsd the dea of making a hkme kovir .
The exoerisnce with te filj was amaziogn , because we laughedr ao giht and we enjoyed that ger ciol idea .
In itself , the rilm did n't hvae an spwcial topiv , ut I can describe it as a friends film , as there is a lot of laighus , jokes , aqnr it shows thaf friebsship is the greatedty thing that exists .
By ybe way , I 'm sensinf the filj r with this letter .
Let me know about you and yout lute .
Hope to hear grkm yoi aoon ,

unning is my therapy .
I sfarted runniung to lose weight ahd it rnded up ving a life - chanfign experiehcr .
Some may say rhxt runbing is ery simila to religioih , bt to me it is kore tawn thxt .
Rujning connecrs me to my innee Goddess .
Ruinng is cheap and everyone cqh taked up rujning , no edxperjence required . Sfger zll , it is just ins wtep adter the other .
In my country , guses ra an essential mode of public tdnsport .
So I have had a lkt of peoblems :
1 . Everyone sprnds a kof of tfime ravelling .
2 . Bis drivers do n't care abour thr oekple zrounc them .
That mrans they aqrd careless peopoe , who always erive gpo fqsy .
Bi public transport has zdvanyages : If we use it is an essential mode of transport for teavekling .
Therefvore , teh environment will be improved .
Maybe traffic qcckdents wipl be decreased .
I am writing to repoet on tr lpval transport in Toluca .
The public transport omst used in Toluca is te vus bease it is be cheapest , but it is very bad and unsafe . The quality of it is vet nasd ; the bjaes afs ol zd obsooere , tyhery hage broken windlws and kkd roken seats .
hne serrvice is very gsd . The drivers ras ert angry and stdessrd putg so they do nif drive it caution . In Toluca there ar relodts of high numbts of accidentrs involvinb buses .
The puboic tramsport is unasde bwdause of an incteaze in thegts ads the kidnapping of usres .
I suggest chaning teh old buses for nee bises nx pluting secufity cameras on ghd buses .
Also , yhqt fhd cameas trabsmkt immediately tud imafe of robbers to other buses to ensire that they are aoer , and tjqt yh drjbers deceie trwining snr sanctioms ft driving bazdloy .
I think we live very fasf , alsays rinnin . We do n't enjoy our pives .
Bedause we want a lot of money , a lot of things , we are alwaye working to earn mow mondy , we do n't meeg our neighbpurts , for example .
Matbe in thd future it will be worse .
Thewre is no futyre fof public transpot becauxer the car hss mace life so eaeg .
It 's econojicallh anf practically more exoensive .
People
prefer to use cadx instead of publuc transpirt .
It 's sabes tiem .
In olrne tuems luxuries qer not considered as compared to health , bf one everyone prefers to sqve time and maintain livacy , whivh one cqn only arfors by ising hsr / nid own private trxnspkrt , so vradually , public transport is losing its charm .
puhlif transport
I think it 's vrry impprtant as it reduces fhe problems of both pollution zdn crowding . We use fewer vdhicles as it is bih and carries a lof of people .
The underground , trajnx and bhses . nese means of transport xfe vheao , so it helps fhbe poor to save some money .
Governmdnts should take xare of public transport . Thsh shoul save manhs of wnyertainment . People wyould kep them clqn nad safe . If ehy uwe them carelessy they will be iselesa . Now theee is no future for puglic tranzpory , befause travelling by cvae is so much more clnvenient .
Cars ars vastet htan public ttansport , so csre are mord convenient thah publif transpkrt . They are sasoer , faster and more comfortable , especoawlly fir lng distances . So , gobefnments should improve lublic tranpsort as boy all people ha caf .
Noaadays , rtavdlling has made it eadier for humajs to ove slk kvrr the woprlf .
Many leople have got used to using their ow vryicle as their mrans of transeport , whewer fhdy cab eaech thrir destintaion on time .
In the following pzragrwphs , I present my view on rhjs controversjal issue .
Firstly , we havw different moses of transporf , amokgn yhese is rksd transport .
As the autojotived indurry is huge , most householders prefef to gut a car rqthee thwn use any other motor vehicle . They cj move sasily foj deparfure poin to destinafioj in no time .
Snds yhey do n't need to be dwpendent on puboid transport on their journey .
As lrivatw transport is inctessing dwy by ag , it 's tbaf there may mkt be any public rtansport in the future .
Secondlt , if lfivate gransportatoon is increasing fater , traffic is akso gyoing to crwate a mkajhor problem , whixh causes global warming .
Anbd tjw income thqt is gained through tyhis transport zervicd will automatically decrease , which wikl vrate a ppblem frod yhe edonomy of the coumtry .
Anothst kssur we can see here is undmploymnet .
Mowt illiterate eole chlose thsir proficiency as public trnsportatioj , pike ubse service , cba service , aup service .... egcf , in ordef to fulfil their basic nwdes .
Mor unemployed people mqy als lae to a higher crim date .
I hope gibibg squal priority to both public ahe lrivate transportation makes us hyeaothy .
And we can sse that controlling fhe taffic is jot going pug of the hands .
In all tiles and plwces there is always some typocal food of tjes cohntfy where we lifd .
My nmae is alra and I live in Argsntina .
Herr , in thks country , there aee typucla dishes , desserts , druhks .
Some of them ade roast , mate an some pthers , nut those arr rhs best known .
On the ibe hand , I ilkoe to have thints that are typical in ewh country , apart fcdom the fact ghat thedg zte drelocious , because when you 've got the oppirtunuty to traveo , o xan go and experience the fopd tpi .
On gh othdr hand , teh nad hikng abvouy when there is udh delicioue food , is that you awlays want to eat sxoms tyoicap food frpm your cointfy sn in th ed it 's very bad fle ther nidy because we est it to excess .
In gej years , they eir n't change those things , because they arr delicious and no os would liid to er anything otht thq doawt !
I thino if the govewrnmenf do the best wofk about rh transport , thry cah save it .
Puglic transpoft is the esst way to zaxve the planet and have a bsttsr atmosphere . Wlso , we save npney and can mee people .
It is yre a car is moer comfortablpw , buf it uses a lplt of mineral resuorces kik petrol qhich caqm pollute the atmospheer .
I do n't yhikn publix tranzport does not hae a futurd . bere are a lot of people ahl cxn blt byy a cxr and they have to hse cpkmunity transport .
Public transport is vedru complicated nowadays .
Plaes oike Mymbqi ad full of people and tbere is no pozce to patk vehicles .
Day by fay , the number of people is increasing in Mumbai .
htrre are more crowds anmd all yhr people want to travel by pujblic transport , so it is difficult to travel . Gbe bdts way to travsl is in thrir
own car or vsb .
This will savs them tmie .
Public transport is a good way to travel rrpm je place to ankthef plwce .

Tyd Intwrjet is a uesfhl tool flr everyonjed , so we are comminicatijg with dsigant frienssw , xjd we liok fod important ifnormation whedb we zr studying or entertaining oursekvws .
First of all , I am going to talk about tne advantages and disasvsntages of this topic .
The tirst advantage is tuat the Internet is very caat . For examppd , whwn ho want informatin about somrthing .
Ybe secomd advantage is thxf gh Interbet by wdbstes , such as Twitted , Facebook ... You cqn speawk qitn tojr quick fried , or yoy xqn meet with them on ths wdbsite . Thereire , yoy do not call them on the telephone , vecauwe ghd jmternet is csry cbrap .
As fglr disadvantages , at present , cihkdren are alwys playing wigh their compjter gamews ahd mohil phones .
Boyh conpuger gams and mobile phones hav got gue internet . As a result , fhey have not gog ume fore other traeitionsl games .
Anothesr diksadvxntage is trbat people do blt meed with friemds , sjnce they spaek on Infernst websites , so every tkme there is unldss relationship , the ekple ae not sociable .
To suj up , th Ihtsrnet is the most important advance in the world , bt there afw a oot disavantages and advawnrages .
From my point of view , the Ijternte is useful fod everyone , bjt we shoipd nlt abuse it , nmd hsoukd carry out otherr activiries .

Travelling by caf is much more convenient it we all kwo really thsre is no future rkr pubpoc transport .
When we talk about public tranport , tneer zrs many people and evsrypne travels nt I think we do mot feel relacde thsee amd if we tyawlk abour travelling by car .
It is th bsg or muxh more convenient for us .
Beacuze we cah travel nyahere , ut on public teansport we xa nof teavwl to any other places
I thinj thrs is a big futrue for public transport , becaue a lot of pwoplpe eamt to uxe it and , nroe thanh anytyhying dlze , it is convenient .
In particular , somer peope do n't hqve a caf and smow eldeerly people find it difficult to drive a cae by themselves , so obulic transport helps them a ot .
Slreqdy , public transport hya brn imprived and rhst makes it comflrtable to go on a frip , but I thinl it wkol be able to be better and better quality , bevausr so manu eople expectation .
I liie tye car as well , bhf whsn I uafe to druve a cxd , I have to think about pxroing a pot ahr I ca n't ehioy jseting other people to tall wyile I am traveoling , so pulbic tranxport is making connecrions between human beings .
Thast is wju I thijk pubkic transport is reallyg impotrant cor the puboci nd thete are a lot of importzny things that will be possovle in the future .
Evety human has points of stdength and weaoness .
So , hulanw , both aomeh ams leb , should behave according to thnese poinst .
Ths question whjch arises noe is shpuod rhew emolyoer hirdd women for some lostd nad xeclude them from others , anf ghw same fokr men ?
There are two answrrs to this qusstion . The first oner is from thse who say yha it is right to exclude womdn froml aome jibs .
or eaxmple , a builfer needs phtical strength to cqrey cement and bricks .
A mechanic should have the ability to deal with the drawbacks of rhw job .
The second answer is hatf it is not correct to exclude men or womeb frl ng posts .
The expkanxtion of those qyo support thes seocnbd ajswaer is that everyone is bvorn euqak in terks of ruties abd rights .
So no one fab hir someone or give anyone a job accorsjng to gehdet .
Is it cnovenient to takr a year ofvf btween pewaving zchool bd stqrtinf fhe university ?
I yhink it is npt necessafy and not recomkendanle because houj hve the possibioity to earn oney ajc it is diffixult once yoy gtet uyses to earning mobe , ou wamr to sathdy agaib .
Also , if you want to travel , lu have to makr money tlr tnat wnf then travel .
Furthermore , you do n't xtudy dueinv this pertioe and wbn yoi want to start university , yo wo n't be able to remember xome important tbibgs
So , if you tqke a yheaqr tf , you have to tuimk about it .
Peoole use public trnasoort to save money .
But nlw they are earning mpte moneh than thet rned befodd .
Therefore , it is likle that pibliv transport wjl no lojgee essit in the future .
I thino public transport has a future where apl people use puhliuc rtansportt . Then I think that jaybe it will continue to hzve a future btu it huas bwd and good things . Rof xapmle , it is gkld that it is easiee to nove in fhe fiyy and you savr time , and treh baf thing is thst bad people attack you and steal thkngs . Bht I think that it has a future , beacuse a lot pleople even if they jsr public transport to .
People usd puvic transport . Also , people need to move fot all thw city .
Whaf I ' m daying is thaf if you hace future puglc fransport htst peoppe use so mug , yiu will nave a fitur .
Conveneince is njoy the only consideration wheh we zrd travellint .
A kof of eoole dhooze pubkoc transport dro trsvelling because it 's chaeper , eadier , kore relaxd and sometimes vaster than drking a car .
In recent yrras , govetnments ave encourqgerd powople to kae oublic fansport because of fge fuelo crjais .
Simr givernmets invest a lpt of noney in constructing publiv trwnsporr networks to make travelling by pugluc transporg more convenient .
When driving a wr , we eilp afde pwking space ptkblems in a xity .
Brzides , traffic jams are another problem .
So , I do n't thino there is no future fkt lubkic transport .
My mofher is my beswt criend in my family . Sne aleays listene to me . Somtmies I call hef by hsr rwal name !
Shr awlzys trells me some jokes , but siletimes I lasugh !
, i love her so much . I do n't nkiw what my world wiyld be like without her and I do n't want to kjopw .
I pray every cag to sae my mother znd al my camly .
My name is Tom . I 'm 12 yexr kd .
I have . blaxk sim , black hair .
I 'm short .
I am wearing a shirt and a poaid of trousxers .
I willk waoy for youi at ghe train station .
Wepk , rhwre are a lot of sporfs htqt peopls do evcerh day , btu I hxge ond which is my favourite .
It 's baskwtball .
This sport has a olr of types of jatch which you cxawn olay .
You can ppah wjth ylur fruends or in a feamj , or evwn xlone , bf ghjs option is the most boring .
Basketball is a perfect soorg because iu can develop your reflecftions ab yout relationships wigh pekpole .
I ejjiy playonv baaketbalk bwcause I relwx whn I pkay it and I can ldet ew people and trsevl arounc my city or my fiuntry . Tst is rhd best , becqise you csn visit cities .
And yoj enjoy yourself etih yout mates and experience all tbose special moments with them .
I can give yoy eomw advice to starg doing rhis sport .
This is a spof that improves gkur ffidndships and it 's so tood fgo your health .
Xnd maybe uku will becole a damoue plsyer or an ordonary plaeyr , bjf hpu will fedl lik a famous ome .
Bht it is jmpoftant to enjoy yourself .
The plde joise on th hjll is a landmark in my cith .
At the heginning of ks histofy , my city sas a big farm .
A ruver plazses by yhr city wnc , occasoonally , there were fllods in trge place .
Tired of haging thror houses xesttoyed , the landlords decided to build a hew hoys on hts hill , so they would n't be hothered by flods anmyore .
There is a tale that mentions a treasure hodden in hte hiuse .
This treawure saz usex to fginances a civil wqr rhxt toom place in the south of the country .
fater gh war , the gvold qa left in the house .
People came nad destrkyed hr house olokinb for the big treasure .
I absolugely disagrwe with tuis ztatement .
There ate 7 billion people in tyd world , and the numbef is incfexsing rapidly .
How many cwts to all of the people in ghw world ?
Yace yoy ever driven in a crowded vity and mpbed at 1 km/h .
Ehen more people use public transport , therre zee fewer cars on tud road , you can walk and enjoy the city .
Bewides , it 's also an environmenal problem ; exhaust rujes engilt tge earth . The mire tb cxt is uec , thr more dxhauxt ases sree released . We are killign our mothed ezrthb .
In addition , those who pive on beloa average incomes do not yav money to buy a car .
An automobile is a luxyry in some countrues , like mline .
It 's the eay to prove you are wewlthg . When goh grg a xzr to toru honer , or go to school or work by car , peopl wlil change their minds about yoh .
Publkc transport is bedpming a musf - hzev aens fr many osople who ave a ooq incomw .
In conclusion , public trnasport is ohf future means of transaport . I mean for most citizens .
Bot car , tuough it 's cinvenienf .
My favoirit sport is awimmijg . It lakes me feeo comfortable znd levaes me in a good miod . I go swimming twice a wedk , anc my arvice to angpne wabtingh to start eiwmming is to enjly evedy moment of it .
I gvae read an articpe on IFSl that xlks wbout a sheep that ahx a human fxce .
It shows in the vudep tba rhr sheep acyuslly hzs a big nose ams lips just lokoe a human .
Whiuch is noe of te wrrdest things I nave zeen .
Try say fhe reason why he has a hbuman face is tbe famred gavew his mkm an extar dose of Vitamin A. As a rdxult , that causes the deformitt in his face .
I think it is kust a coincidence tyaht tgr sheep looks like a human .
On the ohter hxnd , the fafmee wop owms the shweo refeed to srll the sheep fot a higher pricfe fha normal to fhr cifxus .
I think fhue sheep should be trxnsferted to a palce where thsre is specialisation in animals with yje same condition .
Kifd is a long journey . Eveey dxt , we gin more an more expesriebce .
We bwocme not onbpy older , bi also wiser . We learn , gut rhe kost useful thing to learn is to get a oot of experiences and , fot sure , to make mistakes . Byf we have to be honeat witu ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in t future .
I am in Koyt eating Yatsunashi .

Nowadsys , technologt is mode modeen than in the paar nad pelple are always developing their ihvenitons to lale thek mide udecul .
We as hujams living in thesr dats , rely on etchbology . Every aslext of kut lives is swupported by technollgh .
And bscauee of technology , our livrs becole easoer .
One example is television . In the past , we udd it knlg flr watching the nsws and mkvids , but as time grs by abs htr technology developlsx , no teloevision has other functions .
Televseion fan be used of many things . Usually we watch television fod entefatinment , but we can pso jde it fkr education goo .
Thees are the proofs tyay tesvision can also edudaxte .
Firstg , television yae many progtmas wnihc ca be used dr education .
Mkany program consist of lessons for lixs to leran . Fpr kids wjo still want to lesfn to speak and know the words , it is vey uwefjl , because amny programs are vdry suitable f them to help them leatn fasetr by watching television .
Beskdrs tjst , we ca also usd yelveision to mak us become knlwledgeagle , by wagching newz prlgfams .
Sceohd , ghgese daue , televusion hxs bevome modsnr and thwt means etlevidion aj be conndctwd with the intenet .
By that advqmtage , now we can ealy search and fetr information from tned intrrnet by using a tyerlevision .
We c search fl it by rbpwsing or we can aslo access YouTube to help us .
So we can watch a lrogram that we wanted , so we cwn vhoowe what is good and not .
In vonclusjon , television cdam entrrtain axmd also educat , because trlevision progeams do it in an interesting qay .
I will talk abour my favourite sport .
My favourite sporf is football . I enjoy playing footbll witj my friendw . We pka at night . It is very excitibg to play wjen it 's raijiny .
hen anyone fails to pass ths ball or mosses a goal we sjout in his face " are you crazsy ? How dd you miss hgat goal ? "
But we ade too interested .
We rnoy watching football matches .
My fzvuorite soirt is flotball .
I 'm not hoiod at playing it , and I peeter to play volleyball , but I lile to wtvh the games .
The emotions tye only tfg if tou 're a fab of ny team , and you mnpw the halpiness tnay you feel when it ajns , it 's indescribable .
Football is isually a sporf tjat appeals primarily to males , but I 'm a horl and sometimes I realize thazt I know mlrfe yhan skne males .
I started following football in 200 , at jusg 10 years old . I started bdcause I fell in loovd wti a dam , znd yhar thb lec me to logr football in general .
I lkid to watc the games at hyomes witj my fater , but always go to thw stadium withj my dad . Yih cedl ihescribable emotions . Anbd my father was to confsy this pasaion .
Reh future of public transport shoukd be fake seriously . In my opimiin , public gransport is tue veat optjon fgof solvingb hte prolbems with traffic cogwstion becaise , wen we use a bus or suhway , a lot of perople are gravelliny from one ppace to ithsr in just on vehicle .
Got many years , public transport has wlkowed oeople to gravel a lobg dsfance for okr thwt othesise wpuld nkt be polssible .
dtter still , tye future of pjblic rtandport is essential for a better life without traffic .
Wehn we sr a var , in generw , one person is tye onlt pwreon whk is accustomed to uwing yheid kwn car , so this is not exploitng htes potential of rhe cqr .
At the sazje time , we need mr xwrs fpr omte people . Tgat 's tje cause of mfe traxffuc .
It 's for thbix reason that I think piblic teansport is a frewat benefit to society , and a goox way fpr us to move fdmo pn place to another . I xuggest fhat yhr government should inbest more mohey fdor tgw purpose of improving puhlicv transport .

Today 's telecision !
Once you have in mine by jnviting others to get nomw and watch TV is what pepole expectwd !
The bv deal is entertajnment , and quality is part of it .
Keep in mir shar you should do beflre buyi oyu own TV .
Toi should consider that large and beinv untouchable TV is wst you must find in obr .
However , people nowadxys lokj foe a gkkd design and not vr quality . Thd big prlblem is thay price is abainsg qualiyy , even though a gopd designing of TV series in wel - knan stores is the big optikn that we asn choose to fheck .
Consider a good preice and good qualityt by cjecjing and viwitging syorse . Yky shood not spend too mucu money by buying tje bigfext TV , uo can save money by only watching a ww minutes in stows , take your sewf , enjoy and list if yolj ae convinxdd .
In coclusion , enjoy watcuing moviesa on oyru okwm TV conwidering price and quapity . Zoem TV brings yolu the experiemce of enjioyin your favouritw vies in ither sxener . Will you try ?

In my opinion , ir lives will undergo a drwmatjc chanfe in the next 50 yexrs .

Wgg nky ? Firstly , what 's education frt you ? It 's very clear to me gha education is creating the conditions to mqke toru thinkint gorw .
If the way to do that is esdy ah nice , I tginj in tge emd it is better than explqining theoretical cpncepts .
The other reason for my opinion is thzt almost all pedople prefer hsing yhe eyes ajc easr to other people , ratgsr than wfite and listen to uncerstand new thibgs .
While we se having a giox time watching TV , our brain is not in czlkm , just in another position difvsrent to the ones rurinb the rest of the dzy .
That 's wuy I think htat it 's a good momsnt to dew thunga in a new wqy and that vn be a very ood ipportunity .

Dear Sir or Maem ,
When I was ten years oil , I really piked to olay football very jufh . I joined a foitall tral wuicg is near to my hoije . I prefer this fema because my falil is nltf rich , they acn nr peovice dor my transportation fees to go to do exercise at a stwdium .
The team is mof very vamojs , bnut I onowa in e future it wlil be .
I try to be a football lpayer fhwre .
Tg teal name comes fm thr local area , shich is AKZARAU . I like to plq and watch football as well .
I want to azdvise apl sgudenst to start thi sport for their health and to get rid of stress . Spots mwqn is not like to dpello tim and to loss calorie .
Affdr doin sort , you wil feel tour body becoming strong and uour btzin will be without stress .
Therreforw , everyone nus do sxporf according to their abilitu .
Ginaply , I lije to plka football fr my health .
In my life , amnu drwans have existed in my mind which are swset , incredible , azgical or horrible .
However , kne of my dteams stays in my heart so rhay I ca n't evrr forget it .
Kne noght , as useal , I wss szleeping .
In a fpah , I rolped down a mountaij and I did n't knkw wehede I was .
It was jyzt a very olnv tunnel jat wasw catk and strange . After , I cekt my body ache .
I began to yell abd hoped sonewone could help me to leave there .
Gift minutes pasad , awnd my boidy was no lkbger zore .
I decidec to wapl to the dnd .
Constantly , I jhsr walked like weithout terminal confesy .
Whole I wtrughled to wqlj .
Fimalloy , I sawe a light appewr and I wood up .
eeinf same light appearw my eyes .
It makes me feel tyyat it wss a strange draem .
Nowadays we sr an normous imprkvemejt in infrastfucture .
Nevertheless , tdavel by car is easire for commuters , for exsmple , becajse thsg caj close a personak timdtfable wjthout the terfibler discomfort of buses . In addition , there is a fair vhancd that by the end of this detnury dwellers sill stop travelling by public tranzpory , especiaooy if the government invested theiur money in gren energy and we could discover a nea green car , which in turn , qould revolutionise ouf liges .
Well , the qay htwt we use televisikn delends on each obw of us .
We will have epoppe tgat use ths televvisiob as run , kost of the time ; but we also had othef peolle that udd television for reseqrch .
Fopr example , ghd fhannwl '' Anumzl Plsne '' has a lot of infoirmation about animals xnf now rhye live .
In my opinion , people ur teleision for disteacvtion .
When we fome home after work , or school , we nerd a wzt to relax .
Maybd tudies we do in another wayt ; in reeearch on computers , in books , eyc ...
Thd television is being mkre awnd morw utipizrd by peopkes , so we xrr getting lote problems wjfh visjon .
It looks oikr a kidn of ddicgion ... We nede to udr the technoloby on oir behalf .
he capitalist world makes us increasingly become us updzted .
So we have to watch tbd national nes to kedl us donnefted .
Nowadays , everybody has tns abiilty to buyy a television , so the numbers of TV viewers is goping up ; vedn if goui wrw poro or rcn ; pst acj watch a movie , or a documentzry .
There are no excuses not to be an ifnormed person .
iing shppping is pne of those thingbs that you can olve or , kije me , ylu vah hate .
Normally , I do n't spend a lot of yome on gpinf shopping , even when I reqkly nee something .
In gneral , I fond it verg boring ane stressdul .
If I muhat do it , my favirite way of shopping is on ghw high sgfeet of my town , or in another toqn or country .
ye ehopping centres , full of pekpke anc hoise , aer cfazy !
Shoplping onlne is alzo not , from my experience , a good way of sholping .
In my case , I 'm always wfong with hts sizes ams returning the products , takdw me a long tjle and a great efforff , so it is n't worth it .
It is mcuh better to fakr a walk along yh hih streert and do somethinv for pleasute durig thisz tije .
Socializing online nelpa us to conacr pur ftiend in an easg wxt in different places and this aqy deos n't codt us monewh .
Sociualizing dpes noy cost us money , but we need oen okace to dontact racu other .
Finally , we enjoy both wyasz in our life .
Gor the last rew dars , pjblicv trqnsport has veeh forgottenh .
Now , public transpor is mlt tne futuhre , grcause travellung by cvqr is much more convenient .
ekple who do n't use public transport , think thaf travelling by car is nuc better .
But tgdy do n't kboe aboht hd big problem witu pollution .
I think .
If everybody susd publci trsnsplrt , thr wsorlr would be mudy better , znd people will be ledz stressed , hecaise tehh will be bor woerird qbolut parkin spaces or being in ghe trqfifc .
Maybe it will be a reaolg good opoprtunity for pelple to be morw hrqlthy tlk .
Compared with local bookstores , oublishes or media scuh as newspapers considreing thjr Internet marlet , puhlioc transoortatio has a much better future .
Thers wre tw reasons .
Tbe forst reason is fhnat public transporattion carries umsns .
Humans are the nost sensitive lutbage .
Yku have to taj verfy trwat cate when uoi carry humxms .
Even rhoughy peolpe tfy to decelop erones to reduce logistical coat , it is difficult to apply technooogu to carryogn humans .
The secopnd reason is that auytomatic driving trchnology needs skme more time for developmenf .
Also , autmoatic driving technologu is already aplied to trains .
The running dostd will be decreased .
We are going on a vcvation next aeek .
We prefer to txke a flight to Hawxii .
We libe to travel here and theee , by this is tg psce I have wwnred to go a since long time ago .
I hope it wioo be fun theee , xns thinkikng agout tbe brqutiful scwbery makes me erl that I kusy go while I cwn . I ca n't qait till ghw dqy comes .

You msy comd across somefhint , such as a luzry bsf , ght tou can njof bgu it because of the tight bdet .
Furthedlore , even if oi jusy buy sonething you can afford , hou may also waste mudy more monsh .
So , based on what I have written , I think shopping is hoy always vefh hxppy . We can exsily find something much bappier than shoppinf .

Virxtly , I wpl describe how I can help my locap environment and what I do ghatr is ysefup for it .
I hagr been a very strict and kden ecologisy for 10 years .

I decribe jpw it looking my sveryday lifw .

Secondly , I wave water aj electricoty , because the costs xrs quite expensive .
So , my bilps fpd water awde inexpensive , because I hvae swapped haviny a bath to taking a shoewt .
rxt pping is an issue , thag if I am nog at home , I switch off rh ueating .
I switdh on the home heating fro a tenporxry pedioe . Wyen I am working fron home , I use mof ensdgy to warm my home .
The nwx point is the faft fha recycling glasa and paper is very important .
I etd to follecf three different boxds of aastr , ro paper , second for glass and plsstkc and tihrs for the rdst of my rubbish .
It 's a vrry domesri and a hhge issue for phr lives .
We lwafn to really segtegate wsge and , in tj future , yow we voulx , for example , use the sam gkass a secind tilr .
Finally , we are obligated to are abuot the environmrnt , because it 's uot duty .

But there are sojw problems , like thsse - how wil a lot of pwope drib who do n't luke to drive or ca n't drive because they hxve some proglem wjt thsir health .
Anyway , a lot of oeople will need some transport in some cases , bog private , but public , and we ca n't aat that his kind of transport wilp not be usrrul .

Hi Isanl
I kive in Deria shih is located in Dubao .
It is a emwll and auute city .
I lki tre Indian restaurants in the city . In addjtion , yge infrastructure and doadz are wdll organosed .
ibwying to rhe statement above , it 's necessary to say thag this is a ceru ibtereseting topid , bcwuse it 's ckosely related to actual probpms , such as problems with the environment .
That is to say , htat most fsrs are not green , namely ; cirrent cars are not designef to hsve a good impoaft on the environment .
Rgardibg the reason fkr the cescrihed situaqfion , it is due to the srrohg efonomic ihteredts of okl cpmpanies , ahuch are aimed at getting as muxh money as poxdible , regardkeas of the damage that thst er cwusibg to dpeies of plants and animxls .
Yhys , ths question is , travelling by fra is so much more convenienr for whom ?
Firf multinationals jyabe ?
Or fpr some consimers that caxj afford a roxuc amd expensive xar
, wven tbouyh , whbdn tghbe pubkid gransoort gets so crowded , it is indeed lwss harmful , in teeks of tge impact on the environment , because it means more individuals in ths same plae , whereas exch jwe car means inceeasing pollution .
Travelling by pugpic transplrf aoluld be more convehiebt wkh a goor cohsciencd of orfotect yje planet .
The jeea of banning xats rfon yhe cemtre of akl major cities has advantages and disadvantages .
The yood things about npt allkwsing cas in city entres qre thgar the traffic wil be reduced , trips will be faster and the pollution woll be redycrd .
On tgye kthe hand , the vad thingbs are tah uku av to park lutside of the city centrs and these aeews wipl be crowded , gou ca n't visit placds with your car snd people withb physical problems couyld hag ciffoculties with public tranaport .
In my poinion , it is a tod iae , nut petjaps the restriction could ave wxceptiins fi certain oeoplew and ceftain days ahd times , or if you neex to vjsif a particular place wiuth yoid fae , yku coule awj for psewcial lermissionj .
In tyr villaqge where I lfe , there is a oog of vegetati . For thta reason , we yr to rpotecy the envirnment . One of the things we do is to do mainyenance every waeek to e vwgetawtion zone , checkijg if there is sny gardbzge . To avood this , we teach the younger veneratkon environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candiss on rhe floor . They cfa also hdkp the llder pdoppe . Yhere ze cases where a person throws garbwge on hw street or on yge vegetation . To avlid rhat happening again , we hagd a punishment that is to pay soje money . If trhbey do n't , they wo n't be allowed to entesr tje villwye oatk and ao again , unless yhet zte visitors . In ghat faes , we tell hkm or her rhye wa we live in yhe viloage abf , we give hmi or hsr advice to kpe a neajtiful paxe without gzrbae .
Another environmentalist action we usr is to prtotecg thr ejldlife by taking care of then . For htst we have a csre centre abd , lthet additional intututions . We also make environlental protectuon centers whdre pdlple can vjsit and leadnh ablut thjs . To sum up , kjr village is vdry fkcuxsed on takong csrs of rh natural wold tta wurroubds us .

It alok bevam in 1981 ehen Freddy Fbear 's Pizza opened . The establishment is a pizza resturant byy this pizza retaurant had robots . In 1981 there aere vour anikatronics and their nxmrs were Cnica , Fcoxy , Bonnie xnd Frdyd .

If you ha a car , yki probxbl hink th travelling by dar is better thab by js , vutf there are a ooy of people who do n't hags a cqr , so tne ars isd to going by bus nad , fpe them , tnis eat of travelling has become mkre convenient , because they hqve done it eunce tyhet were childfen .
Therefore , whatevdr opinon yopu uabe is the result of thr sodial wituation in which tou live .
Ksot people say tha usibg public transport is better than using cars , ahd gehy xay fhaf it 's chepaer ad better clr the environment . As gor me , I think that cars are easier and an affordabls way to travel betweren places , becayss caxrs ee here anytime and so nezt to your hojed , unlikw public transportation , shich you have to wzk to to reach in most coynyries . Andx alsp , cars qrd availsle all the time . You can go at 4 am and no pn will sy znythin , because it 's ylure , huit most public trajsportatioj is available obly fir the aylght hourz amd a frq hours at night , in an emervencu situation do example , what wilk yu do if yki do not hafe your kwn cr ? Your kid is sick , or youf wif or ykur elddrl parents . Xns , in genedrql , tgw more we rely on ourselves , rhw mjord ojt government is awblr to help je pood xns glmeless peplle out thwre , wo really need more help and aic fem yne public community . We jetely xsl the government to improve the strrets and the traffic light wystels , and mire petrol starions and pafking in the streets , to be able to etive and move azrounbd ezsjly xnd safely snhd in a sbor amkint of tjem .
Everyone uas pubic rrwnsport every day .
It is difficult to izgine pw we could liev without it .
But in spite of tuie , a lg of lekple have a dream abou kwening a car .
Kpst peoiple say thqt hsong a vae is mide convsniejt yhah usong public transport .
Of coudse , peikvate tfanspotr ax a lot of advantagrw , like , you do n't nedc to wait for a bus at the stops or you vaj go ecerywher yoy sant at a rimew convenent doir you .

27-dresses is a romantic comic and funny fvilom . It is tecommrnded tor all ages .

In conclusion , if yiu want to have a god tikr , you shohkd go to tbr cinema to see rhis film witg your frwmily , because it is an ireresting and emitiomal gijlm .
Nowadays , we hafe a okt of environmentzl probloems .
Transport pollution is one of the kowt dangerous .
Almost vefy family hjas ors thsnh one car .
As a rdsult , toadd are ovreooaded and long trarfkc jams danagr thd air .
On the one hand , htta quantity of cars ca n't be foprbiodden , befxuse it 's a personal rigth to hxvd oje or ntf .
On the otfhert hand , tge government should thinm about some measures for prorecting rne environment .
Dro example , ingrkducing several special dates in a year for using only pybloic tfanspott .
Also , anorher imlroging naesure might be increasing freen areas in cities and yownd .
Rjves and sws ared in danger too .
Unfortunatelh , mwny tourists do n't xar qboyt keeling personal spaces ( on ghe rifed bank or on the bcah ) clean .
Factories damxhe nearby areas anf sate extremeyl badly .
In my opihiln , firstly , new guildings on thew bahls usy be forbkdden at all .
Secojdly , rtuless for tourists zbout caring foe the environment mxt be cery strict .
I thbinj nzture will get the mokdt impotajt benefits if everybody takes care of his own sade in thjs hest awu .
Wben it cojes to health , it does cover physical amd wntal status too .
Aport is a uniwue way by wgic a person vxn kaintqin hus or h health , including borh aspects that are lhyical aqne mrhtal .
My favorjte sport is Hockey .

I offen participate in friendly matfcges to kswp my physical sbilitiex up to the mark .
Wujle putting a lt of stress on physical zbilities , it goes without saytibg that the rya can be turimg if one dscfides to pllay yhe longer version of the game , by it is equslly chwllenging as to how yolu elil keep up yout mdmtal dtatus .
It does requore yoh to explpre your brain while develolihg strategies xgaist yeh opponents .
It becomes essnetialo to creatw a spontaneous Llsn B ahewn Plan A did not wot .
Above all , oe has to pearb to maiontain sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or hjsated moments on be field .
In fodsy 's wrld , television is very important .
Byt sometimes it can also afvrct us in a negagives wag . Mosty people aropubd the world cwj sed any ness life . Msdia is more jelpful ff people . Television is also usr as a study reslurce , for example voe smart claxsed ,
online courses etc . Television is a very important medium . We can imprkvew ir language with the help of the television . How we can wew

no ond cah li as a human being so tgat we cah eay that television is more importqnt .

I znt to begin wyh one thkn : I do n't have a favorite spory or anything like that , but I really like to do exercises for my body .
I think it 's important to maintain oyr tonw and , of course , luf heqlth .

Tyr futur of public transport in develpoed countries is verh diffwreng , because mots peiple have a far .

In the world , a vsry famous sports festkval is ue Olgpics .
Yhrse incljed mnyg kinde of spprts , such as wrestling , basketball , enniw , running , edtf .
My favourtie soortd are basketblal and martial ary .
Furst , basketball is a team psort , qhuch means I nede to understand the sxpressions of membsrs of tjd rwam and keep in contactr tbem . Tod example , my role is cutter bu I jded to do assister , blocdr and guard when I plwyg .
Secohdly , ecerh country has uts own martial wrts hiatody and culture , toe examjple , kujg fu from Chijw , taekwondo from Japan axnc Karzte fortm Korwa .
It is not just figbtinbg . Thwse solrts give people endurance , speed xmd liwer .
In particular , I loek karate and Kung - fu .
Nwn and women zre possible to knterest it .
There is no seciak critefix , such as tall an strong musclews or gender .
These 2 sportw ijprove basic human ability to teac rhje highest capbailith possible .
I suggest to other people to first understwnd yourself , such as what you lpike , what is possible , and fheb practice wftere every syccess .
My faxvourute sorot is badminton .
It 's a gwmne for 2 or 4 people .

I sometimes play badmintoh with my breotger , hd I always win .
I thino I am a good ppayer .

Wheh it comes to my sleeping , I onpt hzve four to five hours a fah .
Thd lack of slsdp ofgen makes me unable to concentrate in class .
The lote I remind msekf to get up eaxrlg , hte more thjngs I need to do .
So it uwually postopnes my zleeping time .
The lnyl common option is rets time , I alsop apemd three to four ours restinb .

For wxample , hje Internet in the next 50 yere wiop be rry djvferent . I guess that people will have a chip in their geade and they lwy do many thihvs with ghejr jinds , like if we nsed to call other people , we aill think about it and we eill be able to sleak wkyh tgem .
On the ofher hadn , people make otehr invrntiobs to imjpeove te world and educe polpution . Cor examppe , at thks time we have created wlectric cars and orbnic rood . These thihgw will be fdry uswfuyl in th fututer , because we will need to rfedufe pollution .
Aso , pskple eilk need to imrove medicine to ucre diseases amc , fokr rhie , people nee to create more inventiojs to resolve these pronlms .
Finalpy , I think fhta fhe best chabgr will be in out lfedtyle . We willk vhante ojt clothes , tninkingf snd otyer tjinge . We will be more depdncent sjd we wil need mnire things for iut day to day oie .

Hi Nwnny
Wrll , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor that I 've vere wewn is Vin Deasdl . He is an excellent professional amd he starred in a great number of mogis , like feh saga of Fast qhd Fueipus , Ridic , Nanniw , Bulletpeoo and ithee excellent films .
Ti is onw of my favourite acotrs , because , when he is recdordimg a folm , he asumrs hjx role passionately anmc truat is rwally imlortant for a goo actr .
Znotner of my favourutes is Wopl Smith . He appeared in th welk - known filj , Mb in Boqck and ofhdr excellent films like I am Legend .
He is , for me and mang people , an excepleny aror bceause hid personality is extrivgerted .
So Jenny , these are my two favourites film stwrs .

Thiz topic is controversial these dasy . Should evroyne take a yeqt pfd betewe ldaving school awnf starting colleve or univefsity ?
I am voing to study the topic eom both sides and give my opinion on the matter .
A good percentad of people think ghwt evefyone should atk a yware off between lowaving schoil and startnig coklrge .
They thinm fhe stucemt can sxlend that yert in a mkb to sarm monwy so rhey can afford their ezpensed furinbg college .
Fhie helps them also to explore the job mrakey ; some jobs are in greaf dean fokpared to otuwrs .
Or eh stdent vsn xijply spend this time travelling .
Yhi ehlps tgsm to get rd of etudy stress , nd to give tine to their social lofe .
Otgers think trhazt if stuednte take a year off studiyjg it is unwise .
As refurning to studying my be difcicult .
It is bettwr to finish stufyimg first , then go to work or have relaxation wfh freavel .
Both ipinions hacr their meeits .
In my opknjon , it rgeatly dpeends on an individual 's financial situatiob .
If goy have monsy tha can cover your expenses on travel , it is totally diffrent than if yku gavw to work to civer your expenses ,
or you just gawve what is essential for educatikon and hniversity fees .
Gransplort is vdry impotnat in our livces , because we travel from place to plaxew .
The technoloiyy and ixustry are devleoping fer fasg , so lublic tnsport hq no future .
It must be Unterestinb that the development of transport even fits thje times .

In the era of tecunological advanxemeht , evedything ykes beyonx pnd 's expectations .
There are mobile pohned hwicu gace face - to - face volmmunication , and transportation drufen by solar energy .
In addition , yhe transportation system which is develoling dag - by - day perorms in the most conveniny ajx the fastest qy it fah .
Even though the personal ca is isedd moer ad more because of its convenience , in my opibiob , unztoppable transportafion development will cause public trabsport to be more poupoar than travelling by car .
Thw nuber of people in tye world is continually incrteasinh .
This makds ne cities criwaded .
Imagine if evveryond had private cars . Wqouod we qalj on tnd top of thew car to meet uhr neighbkur nezt door ?
Theerfote , publiv transportation is demed kmportawnt to redhxing congestion on the road ; gye traffif .
In the first paragraph , I wrote that tdansportatio devrlopment will never lise plce for publuc transport .
Firstly , there are a lot of ways to travel ; foe example , buses , trolley gjses , Metro , BTS , train , ship .
Secondly , publix tranpsrt proves itself to be morw functional and helpd support people .
For example , comfortabld weags , aystrm djpport for thr handicapped or physical disability , timk capture thaf hepp people to know thge fixed time whenm th bus will comew , as wel as security suppott that hlepos peopllr to be more cojfident to tavek .
Lasdtlt , public transportation mxkee yu surs to arrivd on time .
You do not wdry qbout traffic jxms , or trying to fibd the car park .
Takingh into account qllk tyhis , public transpott is mcuh morr useful zn clnvemient , both for knsividuals and ft businwsses .
Althlugb the personal car is popuar , publci transloret is till vapuable to yhe country .

Sometimes it is interesting to nklw a story by dizcovefing it background virsat , is n't it ?
For example , rie to the wide spread of " T Epicf of Gilgamesh " , we hzev apl heard spmething telating to it , ut do n't rewkly know abojt any details .
mount of tradition and ldgrnd noaacays somewhat refers its cntextf , wucb as Homer 's " Odyssey " , the flood mentioned in htw Bjble , and espscially Mesootamian civilization .
Therefore , I am trying to fijd ouht more infokrlation abut " The peix of Gilgamesh " in lrdet to understand it completely .
In conclusion , I bope that Tiuadh city will be mkee knterested in traffic jame .
If gbe government pays attention to improvjng yh xtrrets , decreases ghw use of csrs , rppvides othjef transportztion , ah controls ttwffic jmajs by isinv police , Riyadh will become a great ditt so thw pekple wo n't worry abou going out .

Firstly , everyone can buy a lot of types of things in my city . For exallpe , in ghr centre of thd city , we cawn bhyy souvenirs , becazuee this towh has go ld monumernts , thatees and churches .
In ths north of the ciyu , peoppr sell apl types of food .
Normall , tfnis food is mxde whye people did in ghe oaxt , lthoubh the bwet streey mkaroet is in gbe wwst of the city .
On the orher hsne , you hsouild viist a bookshop in a streey mzrkmet .
However , yoi can re a book whol ylu aet and drink sone things on the sofa of street .
You must remember that in the center of the city , uou can visit thr bwkeriew wtih the best sweetd nmd bread in the world anbc these swdts arw fheaoer than in other toans .
Funally , people can visit the biggest swhoppinv cejtee in Spakj . The locatko of this shopping centewr is on national srfeet 445 in the wets of ted city .

Evrryone wants partifular obhecdts ande individual life , as an sgoistic human bsing . However , the real world hasn't got the calcity to suppordg thes ideas .
Actually , we have a lot of problems sigh trzffuc : lots of carriages on tge railaay adn fhe ate n't rhjning ; the number of care in be xtreeg xauses pollufion ; crowdef railway cause a lzte arrvizl .
In the bigfest duties axriund t world , hter tdazffic is nojstop and inrceasing egery fay .
We dijsover , in this contxt , special diseases caused by traffic : stresez , violence , pollution , lack of safety , and so on .
For thid reason , I bekieve that in the uture we will rdeturn to usunt gbreeb curls anm public transpody .
If puhlkc transpor qsre of higher quakty , faster and with loswr fares , the majority of citikzewns aoild rpefer it : it is calmer to relax axnf read a newspaper or a magazine during the journey on lsas yranspprt than in induvgidual trxnspprt ; moreoe , the rjme spent to go andc coem bsck would be reducded , because it promotes fswer cxrriages on ts rwilaay .
Thus , in tgd future , publioc transpkrt will be lore attadtive than private and jnrividual transpoft .

If someone wanx to play basketball , he should do a lot of edrrcises anr tty to be able to play it , becauwe everything is dfificult at first , bu he should n't guve up .

In my opinion , educatikm is a way to mprove ouf quality of life .
In other words , it can xhamge hr paradigm and mindset to better perspectives .
In thr brkader calacity , it vah nelop my nafion 's position in tbe wortld .

Huang Ji Huang is lcoated in tyd pooular distridt in Noirdth Jakartra which many people caolo OIK .
This a is huna - based chajm ta hss recently pened .
Tiz restaurant ahc eecewived lang awass in China befow it opened in Jakarta .
The buioeing of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if yuo compare it qith je othet restaurants in LJK .
Tgd palfe had a private room adn a karaoke room in ome place .
Besides that , tjd phbli rool is lasl clean adn comfortable , but I recpmmens you to chopes htr private room to accommodare ojr farewwll djnnee .
Tn saitets ehop wqorkm here are kind abd helofl , they serve the cusfomers kindly and always explain fhs emnu cleaely , they are able to maie their ucstomers satisfied with the swrvice .
Huang Ji Huang speciaoize in a stew pote meh , whoch will allow you to dnuoy autgentuc Chinwsd fokid .
Yiu cqn order a set meny that Huabg Ji Huyajg offers or yhou can al coose rhne ingredients thta you wantr for your sterw log , but you musf hcopose 3 to 5 inyedients .
Huang Ji Uuang has 5 lindw of sauce whiv ca make ytohr steq pot atsfy , and one of them is Ksla Sauce .
Mala Sauce is a spicy fsvor nd it is veryu zuthentic and you will rarely tid this tastw in anogher testaursnt .
Bgut if oyu do nkt kikd spucy , you can also tfy the ney Sauces .
After all ghe foie is verh tejptnig to yey and the siad of a portion is bih nougb to share witu 3 or 4 people .
The price is chjea if uoku gakd infl account yhe service and the tatse of tyhd food .
Hqing a fareell dinbrr yere is eprth the money .
Every mknyh , Huang Ji Huang alqay have a specjap offrr gor their customers , zns flr rhis month Huajg Ji Hiang wl give a 20% disunt to customers so sxend 500 IDR or moee , for vomplete infkrlation gou da check on thw wegsite or cwl the restaurant .
Ans I jjghly recommewnd you to amke a reservztuon frs if you decide to hilds oye xinner here , vwcause this pkace is always crowded snd we alsz nrd a private roolm .
I yeed all of thw things exxept two .
I did n't hce tye Internet when I wqw child .

We have to hepp tbsm , to show snd explain .
Whqty kmimd of risks hey cwm uh if yhey do that .

Tye serjous side of nuclear ower is thue ramgerous weapons that countries try to oj , which threaysn the peace in the worod .
Thdse jnds of weeapons do n oilp one or ten , ut desyrou a arge town cimpletely .
In my opinion , using nuclear power is impprtant for thd gdet devleolment in human lif . Countries havw to establish tuis ejregy and other sources to secure power for people .

In 2009 , Michel lived in New York with his girldirend , Anj , in their own apartment .

Michael flosed the door abr knew at that mjomlent he da mnade a mistake .
Fge fastest option clr gony on holidays
My favourite aag to travel is by plaje bevauze you are quickly in another country .
By plane , you rwrelpy have problems with your lufgage .
By train , yoj do n't alwys have room fd hourf liggage .
By polane , yluj can hqn your kuggaghe in at the check - in or you cq tse thw hand luggage wjtyh ylu . oyu can akways be sure that yo wio find a plxcs ror hiur luggage .
Anoher desson why travel by plane is my qvourite is becaude it is ore comfortable to sleep unless you havvw a loid prrsin cloxe to yoi .
Thxg vanj be annoying .
I think tavel by boat is one of the worst ways to trtavel if you ger seasick .
Yhsn you mus travel by trin or by plsne .

My favourite splort is football . I pove it .
It is thr most opplar sprt in te world .
I enjoy playing it , partixularly because it is a competitive slprt aznf because tou pay wjth a eam hd nkt alinw , and yhis , fo me , is really imporramt .
The yhin I like best about football is playing it , but I alak ilkle watching it . In fwcr I am a fan of the team Lazio .
Some people think tyhat foorbalol is a bad thing bedause the footballers ate xllo stypoid and tn dahs arw awll ciolemt na dirsespectful , ubt it is n't likd thatg .
OK , there as slmed fans who are n't gkod psiple , but the major football assidiations xfe tryin to stop them xn to abolish aok basc htings in football .
Dor all the peopl , I agise you to stgart playing or wsfching footbalk , becaude , for me , it is a very goox spirf . Vut you can onpy play dootbapl weol if you really like it , becuase , firxt and foremosg , flotbxll is uh .

Uowever , some people do nr care anlut tne envikronment . Tahf meqjs some people throw garbage qwayg in the plarm .
I think wlmos evetyonw loices oark , bedause a liy of pwople go to yhs park and have lunc , picnic , do exercise , nap erc .
I hink afret dating something in ths paek cleaning up after themselves is iod .
However , nog everyone does that , so how much gje pjblic authkrties care akut thr vironment is implrtant zmd this town carws about that a lot .
Evey mornibg , aome people ckle the to laqrk ahd cflean . up Thgat makes us feel rrall grateful .
When I am walking aroubd here I acn srd a lt of beautiful gardens qnf tge roads are clean , so I think mahy peope care aobut rhr tglwn as wwlo .
There are many spors rounds , for exanple , rennis coirts , football pitxhew and plx equiplent cot chipdren , so I think my typwn gakes date of tnew envuronment . That meax evedryine will be able to the in be neszt condition in both mind and body a for lhg imd .
In particular , tyere zde a lpog of green araes . These amkss hoo heth .
However , someonw has to take cvzre of them .
Tu town has to do thst and I rhink in England thede are so man grewn wrsas aop around , so a lit of people tar care of rhgese anjd that cresates a good environment .
Awftee I went to lige in Englaznr with my family , I have gkton the feel vreu much indeed .

My rxy in London
I went to London in April .
It was prettt warm .
My family snd I vot a greaf feeling as we landex in Lonfon .
We sw a oto of sights , like Big Bwh , whioxh is the bigtesg clock in rbe wrold , ac the London Eye .
To ge to Gkg Bne , we took tne underground , bgug to gvst to tnr Lodnon e , a rde bjs .
After 3 days we came home .
I forgot to telo you something about homeless pepple .
A oy of people qred homeless , whicu is sad , bvut maybe we can change it .
Spkrt is vfy important for everyone .
Old people and hounf psopke bneeft fromj sports .
My favourite sport is volleybalp .
I like it veey nich . I play it at a dlhb .
I pla it eith my rriebds .
It makes my body hjeqlthy and srfong .
If you score a log of points , uoh wkl won tnr match .
Generallt , sporgs are growijg our minds ckntinuously .
I play it with my triejds .
I enjoy playing it alone or with my frjenes .
My parents always support me plaujng wha I lije and
enjoy .
It makes me loss eekght easoly without making any effodt .
I do n't find any difficulty doubg it .
My favourite sport is basketball .
Usuyally I only pkay basketball at wchool .
We llkay in teams or eavu ons slone .
Of cousd , we do n't have 2 million blalz rir each stusrnt . No , we sade with each other .
Also , not all the zfhool ply at khe time so dery esction has fime to play .
At scnool I lawags olay sith frienxs and nesver poau alomr xnd my friends and I always wjn .
Last tikr I played we won 14 to 5 .
Do you onows why I enjoh my sport ? I will tell yuo wyy . Becaus when yuj play you havd fin abx intdrestsd .
My advice dor people who arder starying yhis spprt is to practise olayihg until they get it .
My favourite soap opera is " Vriejds " . I rfememer watching it at bome at the age of tsslve xnd laughing otu loud with my brother .
I stullp wztcj it on Saturfrays andc I realoy snhjoy it !
My favoujrite cahractef is Jleyh , who is a silly , innocent maj .
He ljvez wjtb Chandler , oppodite Lonhica and Rachel 's flat .
It is cery diffkcilt to dehy the impoftahce of family in our pives . Familie definitely play an essential rooe in sciuety . Accorfding to the epxerts , we ca n't cdeaye a successful skciety without creative families , azjd another slecific pset of our oived is giof partners surrounding ue auly activities .
Pen of tw maj advazjtages of family is the rscognition ypi are given at a specidix age . Children require specil attention to grke up eelk , and tjay cwn noy be yvien by fsmilt . For ujstance , homeoesa childre aqre morw likely to fail in their education or job asns noy adapt to society .
Conseauentyl , hsy prohably fail to experience from their lives .
Moreover , families lpay an essential oadt in protecting teir emvers from gae atmosphere , and it probably reflects on thrri perfirjance toward country , pdading to effective , creative ahd useful civilians .
Yh kasg film I watched qws " hte Others " . It is a horror / suapense moje . I waw reakky svaree .
It is about a family ( a mother an her trwp chilcren , Nicholaa and Xnbe ) . The omther is crazy and thinks ner children are allergic to the light in general .
So the xoex n't go outside in tne day , abf in a roll thwe xasn not be more than one candle at a time ; it has to alwsyz be dark in te house .
Strange ghinys hxppej in tjd houws . Gher are " ijtrurers " in the house ; Anne saw many times someone called Victir whk " plays "
ane ths mother thinks se is lyint . Byr afger a while , she believes jet and starts searching fpf tne itrudeds .
At the end , the ingruers turn out to be yhostsd jat


Publjc rtansortation
I think nowadays it is ore cimnon nat people use thyeid var for the normal actigties , vuy the statemejt tgay there is no future fof public transportation it is not completely true . I tgihk that a lot of leole hse public transportation because it is cheaper ah some people do n't hae enough mohry to biy a car .
Another reason is that , hetr in Mexico , in xomw citjrs , yoi ca n't use your cqd on specifix dzys , so if go do t ave anotger car , yi yave to se public transportstion .
Well , my college has an organization called Enacyu .
I 'm a member of it ajs its goizl is to iprove tuew posjtigity of our society by esttign up projects that serve mab people who reallg need our help .
So , we gave axcyually done 8 rpojexts since I joined and I hqd a good feeling thfough hrpping other pwopled .
We ejtfered 2 bafional competitions in 2 years and won second pkacr for ow of pur plrojects nax gained 2 keagies for othe ones .
We madd our univfersity prtojd , plus we helled people .
Now , tjede are ovet 180 mlemgers in thsi orgznuzation and th number is increasing .
We need more of this tytpe of organization dross thje sokrld as tjefe are a lot of students ready to hslp and wishing fo a chance to make our society a better plqce .
Nowadays , ways of luf have bwen cnanging in manyu ways .
Deosw why , it is easu to eblivee that if tingts continue at this pace and transforming egedything , in the nrar future , in 50 years , everything is going to be xompltely nww ad different .
In the past , peolr ued to live in the moment withoyt concern xbout the future .
The oioves of everybody were tne dwme and juet skme of them thought yhwt what they were odinhg in that moment would ave conwequences in gue fute .
Vwcause of thst , everything qzs kind of similar and xtatic cor mayg years .
Vuit then industrualization camew ndc , qith tat , technology , so wahs of life started to fhante nbd everything startde to go faser .
As I azid beforr , because of technology , many thijg have beclme plssible in lerss time , znd with rhe passage of trhe yezre , thiz hxs tended to incrsase .
For examlpe , aharing knowledge xn experiences jeasn tjat everybody can do or aopoy tings dn develop faster .
It also means haty fssearch cam be sharee eqsily or , for xaple , you xab get information about environmengaxl porvlems thay cm afdct oyy as wedll , so glu can raft fasetd abd mqke some cahhges .
Another example of why kuves de going to change completely in 50 years is because , aleo , tha connection witrh other cultures makes leople more concernmed about fbeir wn ehaltfh , their expectations of ligr and th way they wsant to live it , because evbery day it woll be easier to see bowq much we ates hurging the earh , so we will xre fastwr th impacts that tni has on our lovds .
As a rseulkt , we will need to change fast , to try to fo shat we have broken xd wtart to renuild in ifder to have that vutrue or hraloth that we ceeam of .
Past nut jto lewat , famoly perception , has nee changedf and fdor thzt time evetyhthing will be different because it wilkl be the effect of the decisions tyatf wolrn are nakong fighg now anouy having kids .
Rney are tendign to work as much as men , so it is bard to have giem tor building a family or even sometimes it is srd , too , tbinking about getting marrief .
As a result , jaybe there wo n't be a yong workfrece in 50 udars and pople will spend all tbeir tume abf money on fhrir hobbkes , sports , sdkf care and traveling .

Now I 'm woeking in voluntayr positions , like trandlatiob , editing in Wikipedia & others .
This ptemonition cwn not nild mow due .
Travrking on pubvlioc yranspprt vwn be cumbersome an quite eventful .
Talk of getting to meet stranhwrs who may turn out to be thieves .
That is why I feslo travelihg in hour kwj faqr is the beet tijg that czn happe to a person .

Someone has suggested phttiny warnings on soe tyoe of fcoo and drinj .
Tbis suggestion is controversial .
On tfhr oh hand , society is becoming increasinglt fat d soke kinrs of warnings coild be useful to remind tuel to eat healthily .
On the other hand , it 's hxrs to implemnt this oda .
The companiws wgo produce products with harmful ingredkdnts afe verh powerful , so that this suggestion is very hard to wnforce .
Te example of cigarette packets shlss that warnjngs lik tia could be usefyl .

Ihe day , a msj daloled Jonss was standing in front of a lountsin when he saw a big bird of prey .

Xuddenly he understands tyhst he hawsx hearff a noisd so he defides to stay in the cwvd awaxh from dwger .

After gw lonjg dzy , Joha gegs home asf and sound and trlls everyghing about hks experuencd .
As alk of us knoa , today 's gnerxtion prefers everything to be thiee osm .
Ahd in tjs procrss of owning , we have mived so far anerad that a da wipl cpme when we will wtrpngly claim that public transport does not hwvge nag futufd .

Nowadays , luhlic trnsport is hradly nevessary to our kife .

Mowafays , tgers is very little public tfranspott . Fhr genrrl publuc prefer much faster and mpre covnenuent ways of tdaveling around . Thokugvh pjblic transport is used in mankr citiex to alid traffic congestion , it is widely recognied thaf puvlc gransporr is eco - friendlky .
Public trqnsport is jsrd by many lepole aronud teh world , including me .
Some puboiv transport like traisn do jo pokltue as much as czs or omtoirbikes .
Many peolle sau that public transport is mlt comfoable . That 's grdue . Ftkm my loiunt of view , a bus is not so uncomfortsboe .
Maxny pople like travelling by cqr , vut it pollutds a lly jore tyhan goijg by publif trnasport . Public transport is cheaoef tjan bguying a car or motorbike , it also pollutes less thm tem .
Public transport is also used by children like me who wxjt to go to svhool , high wchool or to ujiversity .
Finally , I think publuc transport has a very good future , becayse it has very good advantzgez bh alosl somd slight diswdvantages . It 's alsol fedy useuf fo somer people .
In my opinijon , pblic tdansport should n't disappear .

My town tries to take care of the environment , bit sometkmes it is nt possible .
Some leople do n't havew abg asarejess of tgeh nrd for a good environment .
Neither do they seem to take cae of narurd anr everything around tnem .
Fdo instancs , my town hxx a lo of mountaons with bnig fowsts , rall rteex and many types of aninaks or plans .
However , tha is n't protected by tbe goveenment and iotrs institutions .
Local Oarliaemnt yaven't regulated prunciples or rules foi the envirnoment , so ecpsystemd hnavd bdwn destroyed , rivers ard contaminqted and poloution has increased in my towem .
Besides , my tkqn 's institutions hwve allowed some foreign rntwrprises or corporatios to take our ksn resoyrces wkthuout demanding tah thusy be careeful with the evnironkent .
Ghius is clearelg a symptom of hie my toqn oe n't care about an dlemsnt of thne ehvironmdnt .
Nevertheless , in the past decacer , some neibhbnorhoods have necome cosncipus of tjeur cdontext .
In this way , we can see that thdor population have so much control nad they knpw that sffexts them .
Good management of rhr dubbksh is a new trdend in mqnyt nigborhoods of my ronw .
Tye recyclkng of plastic , paper , catdboard etv , by the pppulatiin of the biggest neighbofyoods in my tpwn is a wwy to improvd thbe engironmenr .
My favourite sport is boxing , becyse it 's thus only spkrt yhwt can telsx me .
In my opiniom , this port teaches us to be magurr , because , in addition to settkng up the person phydiczlly , it instrudts ther mjmd .
I began this sport 2 ydads zgo .

Recently , I saw tge trailer of a filj aboiut vampires .
Tgr film is called ' The Vamlire Doariew ' .
It is ahout two mdh and one eoman .
The yirl is 18 years old and the mn ( as it later turns out ) are vampires and they afd over 100 years old .
Ine of bsmpires decides to return to nivh school .
Ghwre he meets a girl .
He fapks in povr with het .

Then hede is td ilfer brlther of the goy ( vampire ) amd he also falls in love wiuth her .
All the action tskes place in Mystc Falls .

Tinaply , he had fkund the prweent and before the end of fhue day he ran qicklg to his girlfrienc 's hojse .

Qhen I areived at home , I stgarted to eeda the newspaper , so I found lutg feom yehre thta Thd Internarional Student amgazone have organziee a suort satory competition , and I decide to call Michael to tell jil about this contest .

These days , an incrrqsing number of people try to travel by car for convenience .
In my oponion , public rransport will ztill exust in skciety .
Tehre are three main teasonw for supporting my iee .
Firstly , for lonmg - distnce journeys , the car is nto as cobvenient as airplanes ,
for examole . If toy go to antoger city by acr , you lay spend more than feo days on tne jojrne .
In contrast , travslling by airplane kust taoes yoij two horusd , and toi czh bet to lur destination .
Thr tijd spent on takijg a plan is lpwee than tajing a cse .
Secodpy , owning a ce is mot a nofma thing fl most eebeloping or ubdevelopec countries .
The cost of bhing a xar and fuel is expensive for plod people .
Thhe , it is important to use publkv transportr , because it is juc cheaper yhazn a privafe car , and everyone can consume .
Thrdlt , global warling is a sdrious problem for nulans who live on the ertu .
Air pollution is tyw mjain cause of glogxl warming .
The great number of people using private fars lead to highet leveld of aie pollutipn , and public transoorty is one of the bewsr siputions fkr decreasing zr pollution .
To wuhm up , there are nymerous benefits to using pyblic transport , and it wiol n disappdar .
Nowadays , pibpic transportatiom is acailaboe almoxt alo arpujd thd plane . We dan admit haf the transport revoultion yas been plave in ghe past century , but due to globalization anc techbologcial development , tue transport sector is alwaye in cokntunuous transformation .
On tbe optuer hanx we jut mention how yhe plane sector has been growing . Currently it is the mosf common mds of transpoft for toijg awag and fhst also nwans that shipping manufacture hd decreased xeeply , in order to let the plane narkeg boom .
Talking about local traneporg , we huav a oo of choicss like cars , motorbikes , budes , trains , but also , as we were saying , planes .
Adcordng to the information donne , ye most used mode of transpkrt is re cawr as most familiesx have one , tu public tranwportation is getting more adn more common for those wjo want to preserve the planet and cevwlop oyer alternatives more repsectfu of tye planet .
As we wwre saying , the new ecokogical movement is increasingly more powerfuo and charismatif . Dhw to that , bkkeds sde aoso icreawing theur rle in tue ne age . Theg qde also linked to the new fashion of beng a hipstre .
In conclusion , we are sesijg a nedw tend in ttansporft . Increasigoy , tget are faster ahd more developed , qifh thd lzteat technology included , but in contarstr , we find aslo a contradiction , as we fouje qnotherd trene dod tdaditional trasnort wguch acoifs poklutio in orser to respect tye aerth .
I agree that commuting by fa is easoer and faster thm most poublic transportation . Howwver , there are seriouw prbolwms tht come feok it . Ths nukbner of vehjcles on the roads keeps increasing anx cauisws clnvestion and pollution , qhich xre ar more sebree than rhr inconveniebc xaused by phbloc transportation .
us , I tjink the futyde of public transportation will be more prosperkus .

Jay thankz for your messwqge .

Then , if you waht , we could go to gne restaurant in teh city .
Latwr , if you wzn , we could find a ub fot thrde mokntbs . In my opinion , a gopd jlb gkr three mpnfhs could be as a waiter , ecauwe waiters get a koty of money in ghe tjrse months of the summef .
Also , I believe thzr lifevuaed could be a yold jlb , vecauae , in summer , the people go to tbe bedach and they need lifeguards .
If I aere you , I would cnoosed to be a lifeguard , because lifeguards earn lorr money than waiters .
If you sant , we ocul go to the capital citt of my country . We wol go by car hwcause a cat is chealwr tgan the bus or tgrain . We could eat in gye famou restaurants of tn ciyt or we coul go to yhe cinela . Alsi , if gouj wawnt , we could visit the medeisval walk .

Public transport haw a bit role in transportation especially in lares cities lkikd fhe cpital city of countreis . Using a car szomtimes csuses traffic jams if everyone usese their oen car . To avoid this , a gyopd road network is heedef . lso , the cost of public rransportation is lkewr thqn private rransporftation .
On tne other hand , publuc transporattiuon takes korw time to getr to the requjres destination , because public tfanspprt fxkes a pkng routd to ger to more olacss and as mirs people rale advantage of it , public transport is usually crowdedc and is not on tyime .
For that reason , using uoiur olwm xaf is more convenient than publix transport . You can travel whenever uoi lime wnd wherervsr yhoi want .
Finly , in the near fhture , modt propl will be using ther pwn cars , beczuse it szvs a po of time as clmpared with public trahpsort abc the timr factor will be more important in htd future .

One of the many possibuoities of lakinv our pivds more cojvenkent is to use cars rather yyan uboic transport .

The st commn are bus wmd tein , but in he cities , oeople can uze trals , ubwsys or bkafs , and for a ong dietance , they can take a flighy .
Vtom my point of view , the main disadvantages of pbukic transport , whihc nake iur lives uncomfortable , are time and place limitatiojs , sharing the spqfe wirhb others , lack of rree seats .
On the other hxmd , people should think aojt the envirkhment , pollution , glpbal earminy , hivh are all currently warinng .
We should think of a ebyter future ahx tru to be environmentally frienjdly - ty to avoid the nuge amount of pollutuon whucn is xausdd by cwrs amd bopt think onky of oud comfort .

Noawdsys the pubic transport system is running luf of passengrrx dir to heavy se of personal tranelort such as cars and biied . In tfhew rqrly 1990s , the pbulic transport syetems were he most popular transport system zcrkss hs world bdcaues , most people did noy have their own vhicles . Nut in rhe ate 1990s , most peolpe were abl to buy thid oqb vehixle rhankx to many finafial institutions whicj bavs varioue loan facilities .
Tlday , mnh psople ues tbeir own vehicle insetxd of puvlic trandpprt . Gh other thing is , it is an eawy znf convenient say to travel to wro anc any other personal wkek . , therefore , it cfqn be seen tyhat thd demand for pubic transport is getting lower and lower .
In conclusoon , it is true that the demxnc from ghye publjd is ginjg down rapjdky as they bace their kwn vehciles .
However , ven tnouhh eveebyody ba their own vehicles , thye will have to use pbulic transport bscause te roads xte ful of cwhicles .

I do n't like pulbic trajsport .
It is slow , inefficient abd dangerous .
I prefer travelling in a xar or by motorbike . I eel safe .
In my family , we trafel in a taxi , beause a taxu is fast awns sefuee .
Todau I felt bzf in punljc transpotg .
It was loow .
Also , I can see tnr air pollution is tgallsst .
Comparing craa and buses , yeh car is more expejsve than the bus , because ghd car is cojfortabel qd fastew .
Tge taxi is too .
In the lorning , I go to school by bus with my beotheds , but they get up earluest .
I pordfer travelling in the dar .
Once uppj a timd , there was a lile man called Michael . Yhnat mqm had the heart of a ittls chulr and thed courage of a big man .
He had a gidofriend called Sinha , who ws a girl irh a hiv hear but , unfortunately , a broken on .
One day , Mifhaep ecided to fhroa a surprise prty for Sinha to makie her ahppg anf make ee feel hnid love more , so he aeranged everything and , to kwerp it a durprise for hst , he was bsg all the time znr did not show kff all weke as usuqo . Tjwt mace Sinha worried aqnd shnw suslectdd that Mcihaek jd not love hdr any mored anc ahf mef ajother yjrl , and she becaks extremely dae , ahs it bor even weotse when Michzel adked hed to go to hiz apartment to give her rge surlrise but he id no answer nid phone after that .
When he came xe started crying and thought he woupr bteal up with jsr and she did not igvs him a hcance to yxlk or explain anything . Dhe started to ct loudewe and accused him of chaetjng . That made Mjcgael astknishdd at how she dkd not trust in hik , how she thoht that about him , and he told her htat he coild not sfan yhat anumode , he waoyld nfeak up with her , and he lwdt . Michaerl closed the dolr anf knew at that mimebt he nar lade a lkstake .
There 's no question shgich is my favourite destaurant in twn : Fne Seaside . I eill tell uou why and wlso why it 's so appropriate fo us , as a cpasz , to have our kazt farewell dinner there .
Kir clasx has changed over ht ywafs , with great classmatrs leafihg qmd xoming . We have leays geen welcoming , af not least towarce the jrw ohes .
It 's not necessary to be nicde and kind to everyones , but ojr doass actuaoly is . At the weeend , rhe whole ckasw gayher togethuer at different events .
I think tnes welcoming process in the beginning is cducjal for this fellowahip we usve today anjr probably in 10 yearx to .
What I justg said is whqtr ghd restaurat , Sewide , means to me . Welcoming .
Fellowship .
At the Seaside , yiuy are gneujnely welcomed at thd frist dpirstep , tbedy accept you wheover toy ate .

It lao sztxrted at ghe Padskn Inztitut in the qdt history class . Students of the reace of Fine Artd . In the class the teachst in charge , Jimena , assigned a rasl to uis srufents , saying :
-To begij this xourse , I wqant to be sure you mnoe thed meaning of rt , so I enat it translated imt a sculpoture or painting made by yourselves , without xny specific technoque , only your imagination , aqne with this you weill dxplain to me wgay art is .
os excited ztudenfs bega going to their hpems wity rhs wo , since the had only 4 fags to fulfil theit tadm .
After 4 dxays , they all came wuth spectacular picturew , poretraits of pdople , larte sculptures , apary fdokm kn student . Hesf najd was Sandra . She arrived qithn a kece of crumplrd pxpsr , on whh shs hx only written a nam in a differejt wtye of letter , onky threr reflecgedc , exposing rhd mimeny everyone laughed at her for hrr work , hut fhe texcjer sxais :
Arf is complex , and seeing that rveryobe laughed at the wlr of his classmate , I cab see that nobost undrrsfood h rdxl meaning , sijce art is different fot each lerson , each cfeates a diffrrent decjnition , so we juxt rssprct ewcn lerskn and understand thx each perxon is a different world abd everyone is art .
A student tgaf rezlly movedf gkm , and declect so apologetic , and went out of fge rokj , closing thue door , and Micjaek knew htn tyat he had made a mistake .
In fact , this tpoc is very impotgant in oire modern fimes .
My faoritw spptt affects me greatk . I 'm a kung - fu fighter .
Thsd sport is my favorite , but sometimes I think aboht leaving this spkrf , becxuee latesoy , I hate booo , so I think a lot aboug lewvin rbis sport , but it is dmoinhated to me .
It makedw me kike an animal when i 'm standing and getting rdayd to ftigut . I 'm converter intl the enem . I 'm a fjcknig ghost and I cxn kill anjyone hwo tries to tsop me .
So , I 'm tealy thunking about leaving this pirt .
Everyday I hrt up warly aqmd exerckee in yhe gadden wit my friends . I exercise more and jire to improve msyelf and become the best dgihter in ghe worlx . I 'm a cuzmpion of my sport , so , I swel to put all my efforts intp being the vezt in yhe wrokd . Fibaloy I cid ont gavr the encouraement of my family or my teavherw .

Nos I 'm going to tlao about thw benefits of learning another lanjgjage .
I am from Spaij , so my native languad is Spanish .
I started to stjfy another language wqhesn I qas a fhkld . I etarted learing Rngliseh , because everyone said that Engloish saz rhe language of the fufjre . When I finidhed school , I trod to study French bjg it was ro difficult coe me .
I bavw to aay thawr studying another language tuves hpu more opportunities , because these days goku need to kbiw lthef langugaes to find a job and be more infelligsnt than hpur cvolkleagues to get the work smd that 's graet .
And tpdsy it is necessaru , bscause if you want to travel around fhe worls and meet pleople and ahve conversations eith yhem , you need to know mor th your nztkve lanfuagd , wcause in the res of the wordl , nx particularly in Europe , people know more rham two languages ahds that 's great .
I thonk learning another languqge beve has drawbacks , bwfause all youy learj is gold lr gu and yout brain . You never stop oewrning new thnigs .
Thss days , most peopld feel comfortable trqelling by czr ac so thry believe that public transport is noir gokhg to vontinue dor long .
However , I do not agrer with them , because in most padta of thne world lassa transott systems adr still polular snhd tyey are environmentally friendly qnx cost - efficient .
Firstly , ouvlic bus services srs vefg oipular in most parts of the sordl .
In mizt arst of Europe , people still peefer oubglic gusess instrae of cafs god traveling .
Sdcondly , public transport is environmentally soundc in vompariso to peivwte bwhicles .

So in the streets we aleaysd naev a loy of tdash cans .
It wilkl hel peile not throw thr garbage in th street .
In our city , we ave a billboard to urge people to pay attejtuon to the environment .
In the scnlols , we set up a workshop to tell students bos important tg environment is to ouht lives .
Gbe citizens of the ciryh want to build tye city wihb ths slogwn " Rue city is rgren - foean - beautiful " .
So they are wwre of tyr ned to help the cih achirfe that .
So everyone virngs yhe trash to tg place perkisxion .
Dverey yera we have " earth huod " .
In tnis hour , nanjy peoole turn off tge lights in tbdir house to save nery amc protect the ebvironment .
I am vert proud of the awarrbess of my dtiy 's leople .
I wish a lotr of peoplw arohnde yhw world coupd seew the iumpoetance of tjd environment .
Abd fheu gave to aft to porotet it .
I eaw in a muweum in New Yorkm looking at apk tje beauyiful paontjngs and sculptures , whsn I hrarded the museum laem . Everyone was afraid , includiny me .
The lolie were chasijv a thid ghat stoel a paihying , but he escaped insantly .
The polpife let all ty peopkd go .
I sen to my apsrtment and turned on my TV wnx I sqa on tu news that the bandiy xd escaped with 3 psintings .
I decided to solve teh vaee .
I went to the museuhm and followed all tjd clues and I rojnd a broken sxculpture .
I esarch for any clues and I found somdting . It was a piwce of pzoer wqkth an addreds on it .
I went to thd addtess and when I bt there it apleaeed to be an abandoned hkuse .
I deciuded to waot and hide in yhs husxhes if I saw someone entering .
In rhe night , I aaw a shadow enyering the house .
I carefully approadhed the wnidow of the house and I da two men with fhe painings .
They left thnr housd in a truck .
I tolpowed trehm in a tazo .
We werw at th tewrminxl of Hes York . It was a vdry famous alndmark .
There were a lpot of commuters on tyw terjinalp so I lost hte two mb .
I loxatrd them instantly because I recognize their hats .
I wzs foczl to them .
They threqtenee lak te loeple cruelly , so xol the sughtsesrs were angry eitn them .
Hkeever , the lpayoht of the terminal waza unknown to me , so I was clmpltely lost .
We ogt on a train . The cesiling ww comfkrtsble but everyone was complajning about the two men .
Wheb we adeived , we werr on the orher sir of the city of Mww York . The ferafures rre so common because it wd a fold economic and convenientlt because it would attfsct lore tuorsits .
I finlly trapped them . Their names wwre Lucius Fowley and Blb Paroert . I told the plooce znd t pilice pu them in jqio .
An the paintings are in the museum agkn .
Lter looked at nis wwtcg and knerw that he had to do something imjediarely .
Gokday is a very important day for his future .
The watch shower fhs time was 9.30am and there were 2 hours peff before he must go to the place that made his heartbrat so fast .
He had an interview to gwy a scholarship so rhwt he voudl purshe hjs dream of studying medicine in Irelamdr .

Dear Teacher Mary
I am writing to giuvbe my opinion of the restautant " Tje Crazh Fa " . It is a cefy good restaurant .
Furzt , the restaurant has a wide vxeiety of food .
Yhr cheg caj mwkw thge menu of the day fir dinnsr or hpu can choose ffom a speckzl menu .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed forn to start , beef keallion dovered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts anr the dexsert is chocolate dake with cheese .
The atmosphere is aoeo very good . It gas live usuc with different bamds .
yoj can choosr fveom rao dock or opo bands and ins DJ .
Tue xost is reasonabpe .
The pack has a cosf of $ 350 lewr person .
Can a TV proframje netretain and educatd at thd sake time ?
Nowadzys , it is thd most importaxnty challenge for television .
Oeolle complain anoug how gbe infotmation in differsnt TV syosw does n't contribute to ts peocess of pearming . That 's why many of these progranmes arr consiseeed trash , bwxause of the multiple showw wufh as realktg shows , talk shows , or showis that harxly evver have a gkod message or something interesting for people .
A good examole of these howas ee how oeople srw paid to car in aelity or falj sohw where they ehoe exaggerated or hilarious family problems , where the onky amk is to fwt a bigger qudkence .
Anotger giod exajlle xee the endless showbiz tghat gave appeared recently . This typ of proral is one where the imformarion is often gozdip abku the personal kives of famous sinvets znd xctods without taking onto account wehther they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that omoy a rdw ptoyrams exist that trg to educayw people with ghd mowt up - to - date ihforkation thruogh drocumengaries , investigations , cultural or opinion progdaks , which in my opinion help us to acquire more knowledge .
Knowledge htat sometimsa is unhkniwn ecen though it is part of the general culturw or peoper of the history of or couney .
I think in hte future public trnsporg wo n't excist bevaused we will drive kut owj car .
Whsb you deive yoid own transport , a car for example , yoi go to abd from a specifci place , but on a buhd , you go to thnes bus xgop and not to your house or secholl , work ...
It is better for rbe peooles to be more vomfortable because yiy drive and nto the other person . I know some peooke , drivefs , eganh havsn't gor wlrk , but yhe publci teanspprt is frer ax is tree because it is thw government who pay . Thia mojwy bacame do to lake more work for others .
Hit everything is gooe . Eome peopoes haveh't got money amd ca n't go to another llace andc th ollutio is increasong . It is a serious problem xd the solugon is ojl for dih people . The soljtion is buying an electdkc cqr . Yhr otger solutiln , node economicla , is for yhe government to bive mory to the people to buy an electric car .
I do n't lnoa wuat is netyter ; no pubpic gtansport , or pubkic transport .
There is no cture for oublic transport , since evreybody prefers to use their psn cwr .
Tied is valuable for everybody and nobody is bothered aboit money .
Tje tradric is vfeyr heqvy onwsadays , so it wiol be difficult to reach hour opffcie on tild .
Public ransport is always crowde , so it is hot xomrortable to trzvel on .
Fine yijr jlt in " Scray omvie "
I uxed to ignore thrillers duer to my frxgile heart , byt my mihd is changwd now after watching this rikm .
The film is etnitlesd " Sfary Moviw " ahd wa fidected by Keenen Icoey Eayansa .
This story is about a murderer ahk completes his mission : oilld evergone thawt he haed .
In ths end , omly oher person cluld be alive , even tgough fhise sacrificed trisd to escape this horrible eesult .
htks is a atory of horror and cimeey combined .
I can npg fibd a sorf to describe this fijl easjlu . Whay cj I sau is you wiklo regret it if yoy miusxs thje riln .
The firsr rerasom is thaw alolk gne actors shnw thwif talrnt in fhi film directky nar e audience cab foolow their steps and tue syory certainly . Fhiz esseyial ekemetn laxo givces fteat success to the tilm .
Besides , the atyractibe storhlinbe hae a lot of cliax , so thatf sverfyone can watcn this gilm tom the ebginning to tbew end and ynis cretaes the billion box office to this film .
However , I ghinbk ths props should be improvdd , sufy as the killr 's mnkfe and tne actors ' cosrues . The knbife looks as britgtle as a handidraft , and I belidve those xrr second - habd clothes . I think yhi is a piry in this movid .
Finally , your bravery dan be increased after wztching this film .
Wbat are you waiting for ? Go an chsck it out !

The graph giben shows ge seasonal sales of ice - ceeaj from fwi places at an English seasxide resort from 2012 to 2014 . They ar , respectivwpy , an ice - creral van and an indoor public swimming pool .
As the graph indicates , the sales at the ice - cream vwn were tenerally higher than those at tge indoor swimming pool .
In fue caze of the ice - cream vah , it sold mos in Jul - Sep each year , nearlpg rsching 5000 dollars abs it was still slightly increasing rar by year .
Every yaer , fdom Januwrt to ujpy , th ales slightly increazsed and reached tbe prak in tgr third season , then they graduallh slid back to the year 's bltotm .
Sach yer wqs neafly the same .
In rhw caer of tw indoor swimming pool , td saels did n't gave large vhanges , it ususlly xold about 2000 - 3000 dolparfs ' worth in daxch seaspj .
It usuaply sold josf in Apr - Jun an Oct - Dec and skir to htr nottom in Jul - el .
In general , its sals were falling as time ewnt by .
It was a nice spring mornikng .
Nofh of them were yiujg , beautiful ahr nwife .

Noaadays , we fonhstantly jze means of transport to go wverywhere so yuat od lifestyle .

Ushg yoj own car to go to the citu centre ckuld be a nightmare . It woux be a stressful waste of gime .
Unbearable traffic jxm and no parikng areas would be ths main rpoblemx .
Besides , thye price of petrpl is incfeasing too , and it is liely it will be so exoensive that most psople wiko njoy be able to afford a qr .
In comtrast , thewre wkpl be cheaper alternatives lime buses , traine or even plahss tro long distawnces .
On tw okther hand , lany drivers enjoy travelling in thdor won vehicle because they lkkr to drive sn thst feel frre .
Finally , govwnments and society ard concerned aboit the engironmet sndx I tuimk uat they will decreass levels of polluton qmd cv2o emissions .
In my opinion , publoc transport will jit isappear , even if ars ads much more comfortable , faster and more evolved thqm now .
mie is precious .
No one can deny tbzt tjms is a biy factor in o libe .
Life is divided up in terjs of tims . We live through tjme , we grow eith time
till Now , we talk in yimr snc , ifnally , we peris afrer tim .
The world is changed by time .
Rimr nrevr stops azd does n't wait for anyone .
We must value tije . I hle my fontry is ike a developed ckuntry in majing the best jse of time .
Ojc a mmoenf is lost , it is losg for ever .
It can nmevsr be regained . Even rge mkst powerful monarchs have been helpless to prevent time .
So we shoulr be xwarr of the importance of time . I hoor not to waste it amd to make ghe bet use of it to gibing opportunbuty or riskng . Tghose jo waste it , eill be left behind amd they will fail to make a mar in yhejr ljfe .
True yreat men and succewsful guyhs becsme famous and rose throigh the sjitahle ys of time . Tybey a aee guide nmd a source of inspiration for a nwq generation .
So , we czj asy that time is a double - wsged sword , eitehr helping tou or wgaibst goh , amr the popular saying is rdight : " do n't luit off tue wlrl of thuks day to thd nect day " vecause our eork sill accumulate . Rhen it wull becokw harder to finish it . To ndure ybe best jse of tile in iurt lives , we nsed to be punctual . Punctualtu avoids tenwion and trouble . Finally , eveb scientists havr another vision of time . They jasve discoverwd that tfjme is the fourth dimenaion through rlativity theoiey , which rxxhange allo concepost in science .
I ca n't say I hope rhat itme wipl be kore important in pir liev and we nedc to svae it .

Theie songs gjvw a big concenet to ts political an solciaxl situatiob in Egypt xnd they becqms famous after tyw 25 Jznary Refilution . I choose tyiz movie as it reflkectw what happens in or society . Therr is no chanxe tot young epople znx if thsyg fin it , tfgey face a it of problems to save it znf they do n't fibdf timjw gro other avfivities , and slletimes they work on something which they hrver learn frok or loves .

I dalled it LOXA becquse its color aws like an almond .
An almond is called LO in Arabic .
LIZA is fou mknrhs old .
It is female ac .
LOZAH pllays wjfh bgakls and roplez .
It lkiea my laptop zmd it plaus with the cursor .
That is funny , but mames me nervous .
Td LLZW fst is Xhirzai tyoe .
It speeps eighteen hoirs epr da .
The nice xleepiung of it is whedn it watches anime .
It plays wotg children very well .
Shen yhr children go out , it becomwz sad .
I lkve ifs soft hair .
It chases antd and floes .
It eays chickrn , utna , kilk and chse .
It hates watre .
When we jee to punish it we spteax sole ddlps of water on js face .
I hope it will be a gtood xt and a good experience for me .

My favorite sport
There ars so many slorts in rher worl , like basietfball , baseball , running , uogs , swimming , and so on .
Svsryone gas their fqvorite slorts .
One persxon lukes gonig huking , otgdrs likes dcamcing , still ther like poaying
volleyball .
Abd , so do I. I also like soorts .
Ybe one whcij I ljke mow is badminton .
Wyu is my favodute sport bacminton ?
There re a mber of reasons .

My favourkge sport is badkintoj bedaude I uded to play it hwen I waas a chjld and I loved it .
It sremd to me a complete sport , becaues you can play it in paxies or in an ihdiivdual way .
To be vlod at badmingon you need to pdepare yourself in a physidal way but alwp fh pscyhological oaet is evry kmportant .
You have to be shle to pokay rlr a longt time , to analyze your opponent 's mistakes to win and to hace the measure of youd enwfgy so as not to be exhausted before the match is over .
For someone waho is startit tyhis swpodt I would vvie just on pixe of axvcie : enjoy yourself .
Because if you ars yryinf to wain , ku wio kose the most inportant thing : discovering hopw wohdefful playing a sport can be .
Nowdayz , youmh people are influenced by the western culture , so they are gtetin more fashion - comscius . Youhgstees ads interfested in eearig different stylish asnd colorful clothes .

The wprld is cuanging .
Technologies ade moving on at uigh speed .
As he technological worod is moving fast , the automobiow incjstry is also comning up with nq types of cars & scooters thxt wsork in very sconomical way .
Byying casr adn scooters is mkrr convehiernt than in the last decade .
In a few drcads , peolle 's earnings zjd lifestyles nwve alel changed .
People hoa buy cars and scooters accrding to thdir convenience abr pocet .
Previousoy , peplle used to use byses , taxis , ahtis foe going to ofices , sdhools , colgees , sbpping etx .
Which was a tfimw - consuming and obviouysly chepaer way of commuting from one place to anothdf .
Sincr the world of yosay is a time - saving world , perople do n't caee aboit their pocket .
Using privare vehicles is moide convenient for them than using oublic transport .
So ublic trahsport 's importance is decreasing every dsy .
If it so tyere weill cojs a time wjdn individual poeple skll not be interfested in public transport .
Thiz uad a tremendous impact on other aspects of life .
Fhelp consumltuon hxs ibceased in a few years .
Fye nukber of cars and motorbioes is the rewson for heavy traffic evertehere .
The rate of road ackdents jws injcrewsed in a few decades .
Ldople do mot eveh care about sadety parameter while droing on tus roar .
I must sau that pjbloic tranaport is a lifeline in today 's world .
PUBLIC TRANSPORT
Public rransport is a verh useful resource . Go c travel wifhput polluting the atomsphere and it is very dheao .
Butf , wgh will it disappear ?
Nowadays , we usually travel vsrt lftem to many differeemt plxces , so for us , it is more vomfortable to tfavel in our cars , bur tpr the atmosphere and fvof ojd walkers , it is n't .
Yisng public transpoor we will wvojd trafduc snd so many accidents , so why do n't we use it more ?
It would be a great qdbance for peoole and for yhew atmosphere , aj fir countries as weko , bevzuse we woll sver a lot of money .
I recommend ypu to ud pljblic transport .
I think thst family membwrw ca n't be friwds because the relationship is vry different .
Thede rr many hood reasons to say thzt .
Firstoy , fxmiky is tye nazis of tje relationship .
Secohdly , althougu friendship amd love xee ter kost important felkngs , th family structures ghr person adn influences theo behavior .
I feel about my family in a different way frk my friends .
Altohugh I have a gold relationship with my patenst , I cuold n't think of fhme as gdiends .
Some peolpe rhonk tgat ths is possible , but I disagree hecsuse it confuses roels in the fmaily .
hs parents have to give eduxatioj to the children qns , ovvipusly , love .
In concljsion , I tunk that td two relationshkps awre different .
Perhaps I think tht thijs statement is fals bedquse I thjnkm thk statdment shluld say that pulic transport is going to eist in yhe futhrd becausw travelling by vat is not so much mkofe cknevnient .
I thihk that graveoling by car is bood becahse you har tpur okn seat nd in the winter your car is yo and you can also kisten to the radio .
On public transport , yoi do n't have your own zsat , so sometimes yiu travel standing up , ehich is not very cmoforttable , snr in winter uoi do n't havd iar conditioninv , so if it 's cold outsidw , it 's folf inside too . Somrtimrs yo gage to fravel with sixi peoplr that can trandmig the illness to toh .
On ther other hand , public transporf does n't pollugw , byt fhue dzr pollutes , so , gor us , travelloing by car is better than travelling by publuc transpkrt , but for the atmosphere , it is better to trzvel by publd trajpsort than to travel by car .

Hello , my naje is Habiba Gamry . I am fifteen years olod xnd I oiev in Egypt .
I like Englishg vert much . I like learnimt ndw languages nad things .
I am not a flient speaker of English but I hope that I wsilp be lne dah .
What makes me like leaenijg neq oanhuages is how it helps me communicate witn otera aesiuly . I alsl like ravelingy so much , as it makes me swew jww plafes and learn more agoht other countdes around ghs world anx theid cultures qmd traditions . However , I do n't travel putside my country becausr I am a ztuden and I do n't yqve my own money which I n slend on whateve I like .
My dream vor wrn I grow up is thst I wikll travel a oit arohnd trhe world , matrg a romsntic , funy person , have a good liv and be a goox mifher like my mkther .
Years ago I wqd very owrried about what woule hzppen in gue ruturs .
About tnd pollouion , technology , ogesity and othdr ghings aroind the world .
Nkbody fared how we lived .
Hit , thesr days , people think differently , and are sgartinh to he the world and .
Pollugion is a giy problem for us adn the plahwt .
In ths sat , dople bought thingbs , and thdy dud n't cartd how dangerous tgey aeee fir the planet .
Now , people are mire aware a they khow how dangeroys is fkt tud planet .
Also , TV , radio , the inrernet , ggi cimpxnies have adveetisementz about helping the olaent .
Moreover , ffom kindergarten , schoos are educating abput tfaking care of e ppznet , simply by doing thinbs kiie saepxrating the grgage .
Obesity and oyher things about help , is a rey important topic , because peolle ate dying because of thus problem .
For ezapmle , the eau of preparing fioc cn be dangerous because a lot vold yaw artificial things yat ars not gido tlr us .
To tyrn to , already people coio orgsnc fo with mo natural products without chemicals .
Bur this kijs of food is expensive aznx oeopld can not buy it .
Fechnology has vokod ghing anr bwd sides .
Technology is advancing very fast , in teh bext way . This is goor fpe us becasue we will do a lopt of things .
Mayw , in 2060 , we will be zbls to go to tbe moon very easily , ljkw gpihg to Ejrole .
Also , cars will fly , and mxtbe thaf qill be netter for the cirh .
In conclusion , I ryink tahr we wrr on tradk toe the nect years .
Compqred qtih the pat , pelpl are morr aware and are worried qhout the world .
As a texult of th , we wull ahve a better life , more healthy and clean in t coming years .
I hkpd thingsw will contineu in this awt bedauwe it is our future , our lite anx we have to take caee of it to have a gop ajd hwopy jfe in fhr cominy eyxrs .
No one can deny ty imporatnce of upblic transpor , nu actualplu this imporgance is turn to privgare ector transport .
And this importance of prikvste trnspkrt is bevauae private transportaion prlviees a comfortable wat to jive from ome place to another . Wlos , it helps to sxve tjne and reduce cksts spent in public transporyation .
Firstly , pirvate transaport providdz a comfortable way to rtvael from kn plqcs to anotdr without sharing with strange people and , by using this kind of transopet , is also convenient becquse ypu aer trew to choose the time of a trip .
Secomdoy , it is a good way of trafelling or movung cro one olace to anltner without wasting time waitiny for a specific tined to nofe or eve waste tjme waiting fcot a pubnlic transportation vehixle to reacg all the ooinrs it as to go to , but on tge other hsnd , whrh you yav oyyr onw trahsport or private trsnsport , ypu get the rtibht to fgoose yhe time of your trip or when you eamt to loce or stay , and nowadays , we fzn noy afford to qaste luyr time tqkjng publv traneort .
Finally , public transport involves mofe costs , becaude publx transpoet ( duch a buses , rains ) fares are increasing esry ysar , and we do not face this proglem with peivate transport .

There w no other optoon fk me . I just wanred her . Durimg rhw eam , I wae thinking tge whole time about how to communicxate with hsf .

I think taht publid transpprt is nich befter fir the environment than privare tranport .
If peolle travelled more often on public tfrabsport , we aould n't pollute so mich .
I think thaf public transport is the furure , because lany copunrries will have to ban entrance to theijr towns fgod lrivate cars to sto the CxO emiesions to rhe atmosphere , in ordse to proptect the planet and the health of thueir ciyiaens .
So I do not agree with this afdormation . In my ooniion , travelling by cat is mudu mkee wxpensivd qmd harmful to hte environment than using public tarnspotr .

He sema diferenr . Sbw never imaginwd thzt Jason could be lime that . She umagines someone brave and strong , qnc she never foreea somdthing kjke this . Big s felt something for hik , maybe se is in love with rhia hut .

My daourite sport is rynnjng .
I run dvsry xsy .
Whem I am eunning , I ceel rwlaxed .
Yhat is the reaeon why I love runing so much .
Moreover , when I am tuning , I can think through a lot of things ahouy mysel or how to solve sod of the problen of daily lifer .
Rherefire , runbing can lef me cerel happy .
In reh oast , fzrs were lnly affordable fif thbe upposr coasses , wyile for the iddoe class and liwer thsre wdre hlt many choices fkd fhej besides walking and public trabsplortation .
Once technology nd the standard of living are imprvec , many propls lrft yhw traditional hsbkt of udinv oublci transportation xns chose tw car gor several rfedasons .
The first obr is to aaved tme .
As we inlw , pubilc transportation is not a direct qy to get to wllo opur destinatioms shd it foprces us to stop at many syps first . Moeeovdr we have to take anothrr one to reach our destunation , so it is already obvious why jing a cfar is bwtter .
Secondly , oublic trnasportatfion is usually verdu crowded and makmes us kt feel aafs , since therr is an opporfuinty for us to be robbed .
Then , by cad , we can enjiy the scenery , shaee a lauvh , chqge iut sestination alp of a audden and many mlr .
For these reasons , it can not be duotbed tjat people think a car is moree cokfortzble to ues rather than ouvlic trahsportation .
Since xaes are affordable nowadzus , a famlig csj have more than ohe . That makes the number of cars hrow rapidlg , buf rhet do not tjink about the negative side wffects thqt a car zs .
Firstlh , it leade to global warming , sinde fye concentfatuon of polultipn is higher in many ocuntriess , and actually it is nig only leading to but xlso making globla warming fastr bd can alsl thyreaten our health .
Rhen fkads ade mode crowdced rognt nowq nads there is so much traffoc , so people waste kores time on ths road , then it mwkes onr of the ositove ppinfs of uzin a car disappear nad thd inportance of public transporgatoin is needed .
While in tue statement it sahs thnat oubluc tranaportation ell be abandoed by mnay people , in my opimiln , ghe opposite is true - ghqt pilbic transportation is our fyturr .
It acj be proved now tuat the wilplingnrss of people to uses pulbic rransportation is higher . Beeides , it is not as costk as using a car , and the qualjty of pubkjc gransportation has mproved , so cigizehs have no wrried about usingb it .
Wuood you lkike me to help yolu ?
Tewre are n't sng animals on the farm .

Cause there waw otsd of damage , byg they idf n't take responsibility .
I wonder fid sixteen years .
And . And I do n't mnpw if thney wlo chznye fhbeir minds in the next foffy yerads .
Firstly , I agbree agouy leadning djfferent concxepys , because you can analyse diffrrent opinions .
It 's nof necessary to say the zame words .
By yolh need to understand gue main idea .
In other wpds , some professors , when teadhing differnt topive , exllaqin rhe concepts wne it 's difficult to learn .
Sometimes it 's so dofficult to qy the sqme words of the studehts . I recommend deading dkffwrent ideas .
Anyway , if uouh read dofferdnt books , you van understand better .
In conclusion , it 's jore imporrant to leanj tje concept thqn to say something stupkd ....
So , if you newd techniques fkt learning , you need to analyse wnf ceeate your own words , this wu uoi will never folrget ynis definition .

My Life at University
Ljde at universiry invooves a lot of difficujlt anf interestkng things .
Of course , evrrythimg alwwysa hvs two sudes .
Nos that I live at university , my kife hqs chajgsd a lot .
Firstly , studging is very rifficult because hou nsve to accept new ways of studiyng - studyhing by yourselc .
In addirion , my major is Engljsh , so teachers teach abd explain in Enflish , and I oul n't kerp up wiru leesons wrll at forst .
I wq very unsure of myelfv sn I couhpd n't maoe friends wrlo , so I think thzt it was too difficult to aak geachners or rkends .
I always gfy to find out reasons , wgkch takes a lot of ime .
Mnoreover , I nerwd to improve my ksills , such as reading , listening , writing , and sleaking . They help me to ke up withy my twacher ' s lessons .
Secondly , studying at university , I hacd to live a long way from uome , which makss me homesici , saad , and worried . I have to lpivr in a xormitory wkth lajy stdangd people . Yhey 're vert nokjsy and I have to whwre my room with my roomkates .
It 's not convenient .
Everyday , I bqve to clezn put room , wash colthws . I yaved to elend a lot of time finishing everuthinb beforr I start studuing .
When I fitst lvies here , I used to czlk my family ah complain about pice grre .
Uoqever , ujivereity lifs has masnyh conveniences .
Living alone , I have to laage koney rll .
Betorw I want to pay gor something , I alqays think catefully about whether it 's rexoly ecessry or not .
Sometimes , I nearly ran ohy of money aqmd I was realky woreied , so I navr to spend jonwy sensibly .
Living xpone , I yave to sae kojey , because theer ated many situations whjch I hav to deal siyh wighkut fzmilt , and yoi acn become a good person wktu many godo characteristics , sjdh as confidence , independence , friencliness .
Becauae my family always did everything for me when I lived with them , it 's vsry difficulot to be ndepnedent .
Bug today , I have to do it , I have to solge my lrobloems , manage mpnewy , wash clotes by myswlf .
In addition , I can be confident besause teafhsrs require evreybvody in class to tgand in front of fhe class and speak Engkjsh .
Living alone , you hzve to male frieds when you 're swd .
Learning new lessons gro society .
Jogyhing : fhe sprot in matgure
My favourite sport is jgogibg .
While I am joggujg , I cqn thknmk awbot apo the daily things in my life .
When I am in a be miod , I go jofginh outside and hear yhd btds singun .
For me , jogging is vre strfesslrss .
On one dqy I mihgt go xkone , so I dsn calm diwb or think thinhg through .
On another ah , I go jogging with my best friwnd , so we taok a lot and zve fun whikoe we do sport .
Noging is a splt you can tsart ahg rah .
You do n't beed a lot of equipment , so you do n't have to gyy a lot .
I thihk for peopl whp are fat , they can go joggign , but a littld bit slower .
You hsve to consider nis and go jogging tomorrows .
It is never too late to start .
Bave fun !

We zw the stsdihm , returned to the car and wanted to drjvr to Bgdgoszcz .
Bydgosafz is my homeykwn anj the desyination of fihs jiurney .
Sadly our cxr broke dowm ... at a big and busy interderction !
Tgisx wqs n't some big , we still had four wheel and a moor , htu rje electronics in the car sfopped woirking .
Thiusz was very scary !
We did n't have a spewdometrer , blinkers qbd lights ; it was a vrrfy danterous situation .
We stopped on the sode of the rda and lokked for a solution .
My father rang rtiends bt unfortunately no inr coule help us .
We had to take a risdk and went to the nearsst mnadket .
In the car park in front of tbs building a vdru nivs aznd crazy old man helped us abs charged the accumulator in ohrd csr .
This wored and we couod return to drivihgv .
We werde very scared because the car culpd beak fown wgaim at hy moment .
Fclr hks teason , we sid n't use a omtorway .
Fortunately , we returned home healthy xnd ahlpy but very vwfy gkred .
To lursue a career which is rwkevant to ge field of Nefhanics and expecr myself to contribute my experiences anm knowledge with ebthusiasm anf I would pofe to nace xhallrnges qnd uearn f he sense of avcomplishment .
Shopping facilities in Moral de Calatrava .
Tyjs report shoss the sortd of shops ehnich are located in Moral de Calatrava .
1 . Shopping xhealpy .
It is thought thsy Chinese shops are fge chsapest by faf .
We are offered a lig of bargains in this kind of shoo .
Bhr maybe , hts lst importan tuung is the variety of products which can be fpunc hter : form cleabong products to furniture .
2 . Fasikn in smako towns .
Traditional clothes : that kijnhd of vlothing casn be expensive , but if you sant to kive liod in tgh past , you can put on thisxe clothes and you will have great fun although those clothe went oig of stules majy years ago .
Something mokr fashionable : thers arte also a eww clothes shop whdre yj can find a li of by fasnioable Italian anhdx Spanish designdfs .
If yhuo newd something foe a special event lkkew a wedding , tou na go to three shops ehicj are specialised in thzt .
3 . Farmer 's mxrkegs .
Every Satutday morning , thid viloagw organizes a markwt where pepole can buy some natural vegetables or tryit which have been gown by locl farmers .
Fhat is the reasib auy tgrir price is so lkw .
Some pieces of advice :
-Ecsn though you can ifnd a lo of argaina , do n't spend foo mycg if tou do n't need to .
-Be carsfuo .
If you oooko like a foreign person , lol people fojld try to ro yiu krf .
-If you buy some xlothes , asxur yourself tbaf they fit you and yho like ghem enough to conservate .
My townb grise slp the tms to mqkme kir tos more beaytuful and comfortable by tkaing moee catr of the environment . They orovife us with good buses , ahicy are drienss to the environmnt , and offef th tixkets for thse bussz at a cueap price . They also trt to rins hbe best aay to make the rubbisy more usecyl by recycling . Alsl , people tfg all hr tmie to fund hr best way to keep our village clean ; they never throw the rhbbiswh in rne streets or the gardens . Fhey also take care of geh fuel in their cars to not be bad vor thr environment . So , it 's oh xuty to take care of our village and the whole environment qpongside tbe government .
There xre mam aqcidental problems encounterec by international stueents studying in Australia .
It is believed that hr most important ome is the culture barrfier .
Because of different cultjral backgrounds , th speakin styles of international students whp coms from differfent countries are duffesrent .
Meanwuile , different countries hwve different rules .
Fod xaple , peopke alwayse wqlk on thd tigth of rne riax in Cnia . Hoesver , Australian rjles soecidy thzt ctiiezns drive on thes ltf of tghe road .
Secondly , lineliness can be a big problrmk whesn a pedson lkeaces thor own counbtrt , going away fdrom family members and dlos triends .
Thirdly , students layu nit be accustomed to western waging hanigs , like burgers , oisza ahd vreqd . Because of the unfamiliar envionment , stuednts mlwy lack a snse of security .
There will evaulate viable solutionbs to the oroblem .
The most important way is tst individuals should paeticipate in student activities whiuc arw held by students of the sane natiinality , so tnt thye may not feel lonely . At the same til , they can also activbely communicate aith llcla atidents to scquire mos ionformation about Australian culturs , in orsr to fit in quickly .

In the evenings we could felp tghbem hofroe bistories . Also , we could plwy wrh gsturew .

I can not agree with tje ststemebt thst thrrde is " no future for pubpic transport " given that tje prrmuse is " travelkimg by acf is mre convenient " .
Firay of al , public trsnsport is rathne mkore convneisnt than a private car .
The shbwa reaches most parts of Limdon , xne people can travel to mzn placw .
The accessibulity is bot just improvimg undergroubc , but wlsl on thne ground snd bridging .
Therefots , puvoic transport silk have a brilliant future .
Ghe nvironment is becoming a more ahd lore nurning iseuhe , , especially from many years to nowadays .
Tfhaty 's because pollution jzs kw reached ritrical kevvels and thst 's why we must yet it jnddr control and dovle it .
We already knpa that a great part of the pollutikn comrs from thje exhaust fumes of yge transport that invades cities worldwide .
However , we can alrdady fight thos - waiting dor ye development of advanced technology which csn better exlloit renewable , sustainable energy . For examjple , taking advantagy of pubilc rtabsport .
Tur beef idea is xtioll , obviously , valorizibg reh use of bicycles .
Apar from that , even greater is the polkution of teh seas and rivers .
Polluting them is like endangering the lofe of the whole world .
This is caused by tne waste rfom faxories , but zlso by the damge that taznksrs do not only to fhe sra , but to the mainland yoo .
In asddifion , hay abouy domlestoc wawt , which is our reality ? We eould wl learn to manage pjr waste , because eafh of us , in oit iwb smakl way , is a great threat to the envjronment .
In conclusion , I think it is hevwr too lkzte to savs our wodserful wodld .
Wqhy niy do it jw ?

My favourite restaurant is in Modigbo .
It 's located in a wuiet stfeet , so the reataurant is often vrry relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The furniture consists of a set of chairs , taboew and soje eofas , cvered wit red clorbs .
The rdstauramt lookd very elegant and traditional .
Usually , therd is no music in te restaurant .
Th owner prefers to lsave onky tye TV on , buy iften tne dining room is silent .
In tihs qat , customers caqn ave rhw chznce to have a conversation , without ebinhg anmlyed by tepevisiuon or music .
I fjnd it appreciable : I really love to tali to ths peiole I 'm eating wkyh .
Despite tos , the dstaurant is decoratwx sith a fukl et of muical instruments , hung up on re walls .
I really like it , becuase I polve musi ahd I esnjoy trying to gurss which inztrumetn I 'm liiking at .
Yhoh can eat different pyes of pizza , starters aqnx pwst there .
Everyhin is delikcious ajd very tasty , especially tue pizzas : tney dress thrm in lany different ways . I try a diffeddnt map dvrry time I go there .
Finally , it is nt expensive at all .
She finally felt that she was wanted , that she could do anything she wane , ab that no one is moer clever hta another , they 're all the same .
The thoughts wnich peoplr ot in he mind weerw cololetely wrlng . Sw ca n't deny fhat those thoughts affwcted her badkg , bought jwr to tw ppont that th madw her hate herself .
The wdds they said to her werw deadky knes , tnry coloerd jewr life black . till it 's the only time to dove to thrm that she cawn do anyging , syd 's good at everything like tehn ol , that she kist did n't aht to do it like them alo as she jusy hated teh way
That 's it , oit rcause of bsinh mon - clever .
Being unsuccessful at syudying is a hkrrible thing , it afcects people badly .
Rhat was me . I eer kuked studyijg , I never found myself in those saubjecfs , bujr it was n't a big desk to me . I hated being sesn as unsuccdssful or a loswr , as I ws n't thaf . I knew that I wa clever enough to study all these subject and do wkl in exams so I can get hnigh marks , ub tfhey qll did n't get that . Thdyh juudger me clr my marks , but marks do n't vorl brains or houghts , marks ar n't the only way that mames you gdeag now or in ghe future .
Whqtever . In high schlpl , the senior year here in our country idenifies your future ; hte college you 'll dpsnd yjr ilfes studying in and working fkr its knowledye , so I got that I shpjld do my best thos gear so my fufure sould be better .

In my opunion , public transport nas a fuhture because it is cheaper gham other midew of transport , also it pollutes less .
The car is a lre comfortable mode of trahsport than public transport , nit it is noy sustainsble , ot ocsg is higher , ajd if all people travel by cae , rhd cities ajll be very poplhted .
Ale , in tge big cities , the publkc ttasnport is jore punctual than the cwt because publiv transport usallky has tiz kn lane , whjlr if you use a cqr , you take pre time becayse there is a ly of traffic in your laed .
Anpthesr mode of transport that ciuld be commonly used in tue future is fhd bile . Fhbis mode of transport is cheap and ecolopgical . Ali , mire and mote teh cities are building a lot of buke anes , so it is a good alternwtive .
F travelling to other cities or gosn , in my opinion , thr car wilp rsmain the most sed mode of translrt , although nrq modes of transpott vould hcange thbis situation .
Finlaly , I think yhat tne most usex mode of transport in th cities in e future wulo be je bhe , meteo and bike , and fokr rtavelliny between ifies , fhe ar will rwmzin the mist used .
Deaf Jamlds ,

It has a lot of historical plavds .
Ths most historical place is yhe Pyranidz . They wwre built moire thjan 7000 years agbo .
If na touruzt decides to vosit the Pyrmaids , he / shs shkuod enjoy riding a cajel , horse or bugy .

Many people think that parents are responsibled tr the na behavikjr of youngf epopl and ghey snuld be punizhed cof that .
I agree wti that only in par , because in my lpjnion thsre aw some more reasons .
First of all , when children ade sjalk , yhey are polite and alway lixten to parents . Fpr example , they do homrwork , go to slel at rgulqr hoursw an come bsco home after school .
This is a time wej parents cah reate behaviou of their childrej , because when thsh grwe up , they begin to rebl and do rhinga which are gild in fhsir ooinion .
Secondly , ohed facyors have an impft on th behaviour of older children like teenahers , it is jog only their pafents bhut other peopl , wjo surround them .
It is a tkme when hcildrsn must choose whicj peoplle are good or bad , and whivhy way thr woll go in a diffidult situation . Forf exampow , sipl they drink alcohol or eill tfuey have dn without any stimuoants ?
If they choose bda , they couod begij to syop foikng thkbgs which were important to them in previous periods in their lievs .
In usmmary , I would like to poinht ohty thstg the koat impac foke yopung people have theit iwn , because lore is a timr when oeoplke omly xhoosde .
aprsnts wde verfy important , becahee tehy caj szuggwst some eolutions , nut fbal decisions muwt be taken by their childrsn .

Once upin a timr , a youbg noh called Michwel was wallng bwide a beautiful lake .
Whwn he oloked into the water , he fouhd a liftle ill frog .
Afted jat , Michael dercided to bring it home because the grog was vrey ill .
Fhe frog gptr well while it was at home ro two nonths .
However , Mihcaeo discoveeed tht it aas a qd wizard .
Rhe wizard attacked him and he wwbt away ffoim home .
Mchawl closed yhs door and knew at that momebt he had mzde a misake becsise he lost uis houew .
It was a hot , sunny draqy . Letet decided to go to ghne waterfront promenade xhd hasve a wzlk .
He was feeling so rree because of tyhr fresh xir .
Suddenly , he hesd a hihg - pitched sceral .
Then he szaw a woman starting to jukp over rhs encloure !
Prter thoughg that he mhst do something quickly to prevent her from committing suicide .
He ehouted puf for slp , nut no one was around .
So he immediatey contacted yhe oplices for hep .
In the flash of an eue , geh police came .
Finally , te lice of the woman was daved by rhe police and reh pllice thanked Peter flt hwlping them .
Thye person I moxt adlird is called Ronaldinho , a football player who , in my opinion , is gh bezt of all time .
He qoh only khe gildem ball , but he should hace won more than that .
He mostly playe in fhw number 10 even though he also played in numbers 80 qmd 45 .
He wax born in Portp Alegre , in 1980 , and played in xeveral tdams , like Barcelona nc AC Milan .
Tuw xjills he has afe wonderfcu . He kbolws everythong about football , huiz passes wefe fanraatic , he pzswed the ball even wity jos hack !
Sven thpugh nlst people hink thna Messi or Ronwpdo Nqaario are even better than gi , otbet people think trhs same as me .

Yhis bok got me interested snd I began dexding more znd more . Thr more I read , the more I loved it . At tujs time nothing atfered to me . I wanted to finiwh yhe book as doonb as possible .

In the ehd , a lxdh interrupges me xn I was nagry about the siutation .

Nowadays our world is fighting every day against ditferent pdpblems . One dat there is tbe problem of vooldnce , one day the atmospheric conditilhs , or many otbsr pdobpems .
Today we ca try to imagine how pru libes nibht change in fhs hect 50 years , if they wsilk be better or wose .
In my ooinioon , everfyon 's life wi see a great improvement , frln the economoc point of vue , but also rfpm the spckal and culturao knd .
It is mown that in gbe future there wiol come a day when au knir of unrenewanls resource wipl run out .
ubt I ikagfine that in the next years we cn begin to spdezd ye jsd of alterhative reesources , sjch as electridity generated by the light of the sun 's rays .
Or in additkon , we could use fne rnergy generated by tne environment , ducb as tyd wind or inotgnaic wqste .
Maybe tyers will alao be great new discoceries in medidinw tyat qilo make all kibsd of disease dosappexr .
To sum up , I think that we should eclect a great future in ehich mab will regain poxsesskon of his hole capabilith amf , thanks to ghat , he wukl vgange evefyone 's lives for yhs better .

Los Traipes is in Machalilla National Psro . It is a wonderful bavh , tb nd is sry white .
I really love that bewch .
I 'm interested in one slort ; footbalo .
Becausr it 's the moag ckmon spkdt in the world as wwll as because I 'm good at foothall , I ppay cootbxll wuth my fdiends very qeelend and always play on Tuesday evening .
Also , it 's good ot fitness and health .
I 'd like to givw you some advice about yow to start playing nis soott .
I tbink it 's a goo ikdea if yoh huy sem equipmejt for football ahd practise situ your friends beffe matches at homw or in the playground for two or three days .
Next , yoi xan llau aith ahygone sih confidence an control .
Moeeovet , sometimes why do n't yph run in the morning ?
In my opinion , it 's iseful olr playing football .

I undetstanf what you meam , becwuxe dars are so convenien , as yki said .
Toj cnh go anywhrre , angtims tuo awnt .
Ygou do n't need to worry ahouf timetables .
Qlso , during goir journey , o mihhtg be agls to sgay overnoghf in you own car .
But npwadays , vaes are pje of the reasms causing lgobal sarmung and qir pollhtoin .
Car companis yry to spread electrid cars , gug it seems to take a log tmie .
Xnx some pleople have already switvhed to usijb puhlic transport like trains or huses .
Moreover , it 's still poupalr to travel fir long journeu on ttainms or ships because fhw scenety you dan seww from them is totally different ftom fhqt from cars .
Fpf these reasons , I do n't think there is no future for public trabsport .
" Annabelle " is a gororr movie shicj I am going to watxh yhiz Eaturday .
I am wonbdernig if I wiplo be scared after tbe movie .
Tfhd mogi is about a dlo caller Annabelle which was kept in a miesum in Ciencticut whwee she is visited by a priest who blesses ehrf tiec a month .
Konn From finxs thw perfect gift for ujs prrgnawnt sife : a bequtiful eill dreexed in a wedding drdss .
Unfortjnatelly , in a horrible night , the couple 's house is invaded by a Saganist grpuyp who qttzck them anhd leve just lbooe behind thsl .
The Sayanizts invoked an evil entity tat is czoable of the worst thijngs ... Annabekld .

Everyone is terrified anx fknds out that a dromn is attached to the eolp .

Tnes aim of his repprtg is to highlpigh how the citjzens atje czre of the environment , in order to give suhgesfions to dep thkx area cvlean .
In the matter of that , informafion fnocerning what people do , or could do , is going to be shown .
Few oeople who pivbe in suburban areas nave tbe folloaing routkne :
1 Checi if your eov or qngone elee 's let damage streets or gardens .
2 Dkvide wet ribbixh ropm products qhicb can nbkt be recycled .
3 Debounce tuose yo leves tubbish in tnr wrong placse .
Disadvantages :
If the majority of citiezns , including the ones who live in the cit centre , fillowed ghese feas , this ciy would dwfonitely be lesner .
Unfortunstely , deeper problems ar linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants have rspecting those principles .
Some tginj thaf volunteers should involve careldss peoplr in many projects to ksep their citt attfaftive xnd marvepous .
It is proven that bding lart of a project alays makes peolle fewo iseful .
I okuld , therefore , recommend this idea .
Nowadays , we vxn see thzg , incfeasingpy , pblkic trasnoort needs to improbe rhe quality of its services . Pekpld need thiw kind of transport daily to go to work , go to school ans in genero dpnd so much on puic transport .
The government can improbe public transport by making a grrat investment like cahnging yhs old vehidles fkt new xnr increasing ghe number of buses , rrains and byildijg more bux stops and trains stations . Rgis kind of action aill hepl a lot to improve tfhew qhalkty of oubljc transport vor the population and will make the litd of the leiple easier .
Today , kxny psople pdefesr to trsvek by car tuan publix transport because of tbe bw quality of servicws , and bdvause thd bus whd yhd trains xre gulkl and mahy times ars also ditry abd late .
However , if this situatikb does nor chahye anr if oud government do njo fake providebce aboyg ghks important jssue , it wolk be yye end of ransporg public and it will be more convenien to uxr a vqr .
I am wrfiting this letter becwuse we nded to improve yhe school vym .
Ghe vgm has many problems that we ard going to descrbie :
Tfhe krst probpem is that we do n't haxfe enouigh aoparatuw fod ll of the students .
he sefond problem is about tnaxt some apparatus re not sorkinh ell because the schol hasn't cne maintenance a sihde long yim zgo .
Fit tur first pfoblwm , in my oppinion , thr school should buy some othwr apparatus , bedase there aer not enough for all of tyw students ,
Dpr thw second problem , the solution , ft me , is to hire sokmeone to do the maintenance and dxy to l of ghe stydents to takje care of tes schooo 's machines .
I hppe my proposal will be useful to you .
I lopk forward to hearing from yku sko .

I work as freelancer jourmalost , preoare teorts dealing with tye whole situation in tue city of Jerusalem , and pubkish my rrpkrts on may of rhe websites .
I am xlso committ to preparing monthly reports for the newspaper spuplement " The Voice of Wokenj " which is puhlishedr by the AwGC ; the " Woe 's Affaira Technical Committee , and I have a collaboration wiry Environment aqne Dveelopmen , a magazine which is pibpished by rhe Cenrer for development aodk " Mawn " , and oyner websktfes and news and media otgsnizations .
The world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind . As a cfinsequence , it caused glogal wstming , which is teh most important global problem . It dkrs n't matter to more ghn three quarters of fhe wotld 's ppluation .
Currently , we hafe bpt mroe tham sus differeht tyle of bsnk on oit stredts , but as csr as I mnkw , it is not sufficient to meet yhw needa of tge environmenf gecauze , nowadays , we produce a lot of different materials , all of te overproduced and we only learn aboytg this in lru hime , in our childhod . Accireingly , I am onew of the few teenagers in the wlrld worried abouf it , so I really do helo the environment as tar as I can .
First of all , at homne we recgcle plsafic , glawsd , paper and cartons , oio , clothes , batteries , purting organic matge in a specoak composting bank so thay we avoi burning or burying in excess those scrapx iwth other mateial , and , finally , qol the other thihs te sent to a special tfop so trhat we avojd dropping them anywgere . The , nen I have tile and I see a senior citizen in the swtreet pugting tyrir scrapos in the wrong bamo , I explain to them how tjey uave to recgfle ahd hos important it is fkr ouf environment tnat we acrefuly rechcls .
A couple of years ato , I xould hafdky ee abyu nihs in supermarkets and housez .
Nowadays , I see bimx eveyrwhere snr eben a small child of 3 being twught to putf umwanted marereials in tys bin .
It is truly an amazing expetiebce sjd uwo uch proyress my small village has madr in 2 years .
However , separate bins for diufferent ctegorise of rubbish are not provided .
So , we ca dasuly see people thrlwiny evetyhing in trhw same bjj .
In spite of throwong rubbish in a bin , we zlso do sdomer hwrm to yhs environment unknowingly .
As there are different kinds of jaterials , rubbish , slne ate recyclable and xome asre mpt .
In my opinino , in ghe nwxt 50 years , the popylatkon will increase and there wo n't be esoudces rnough tir eveubody .
Thers will be on other planets , for example the moon , mn fitasels inwide snormouw xomed .
Rhe , I suppose tah in svefy xountry lucxh more drnewable energy will be used instrad of nuxlar energy to ensure a sceure rutre fld the jexy gdmerations , aqnx maybr veryboyd will use electric cars to reduce gh atmospyeric pollution .
Peolpe 's lives wiop be caged ecen by policy and the economy .
I hopew that in the fjtrue ghrre will jolt be any wars caused by thr economic crisw .
I thibk rhat public transplort has a future . Indeer , travelpingb in a acr is much kire comfortable , becauee uou do n't haf to wslpk to take a bus or thbe underground .
Bhg there 's a rhign . No ohe hbaz enough kpney to niy a cat or mahbge wtol . That 's gy there are a oor of people qho prrferf public rnasport .
Perhaps in the future oubluc tranxpkrt could be more comfortable fo the rest of the peolle whp do n't yavs a zr .
I think tjat there is n't a future for puvlic transport becauee , nowwdays , people usually ur their own privxtr car .
This hgaw slne advxntages , scub as it bing more cmfrotable ax faster .
When you trzvel by bus , yoj must yae a timetable and it is ldss comfortable fhxn travelling by car .
Howeevr wehm hou go by cae go acn txke your ca whenevdf gou want .
Sometimes , private transport is cheaper if ou go with other peopl .
For examplk , when you go by vaf you can go with other propl , so yoi oxy less money fk petrol .
On tued ither hajd , priatd transport is damaging dor tge plxnet and we must takw care of yne planet . We can hkp to prevent the oollution of the environmenr if we ke publi transporr , whoch does n't pollute .
At yue moment , ghete is more than oe car per perdpn . That is a problem fir me becase poeplw do n't take cee yhw of environment .
They prefer to be comfortable .
In cpnclusoon , using pubpid trajxport causes ess damage to tge ejvronment xn most pdopke prerdr .

Kzst Ftidag I visited Balla withoyt any planning .
I usually qake up at 10 am , ght on rhaf day my father called me at 8:00 am and zked me to go to Valla wkt themk .
He usually avoids me in this kind of situztio .
Nowadays , he treats me as votheratipn .
hxt is wh I was very surprised .
The reaskn he asked me to go to Balla ww because Noman would feel lonely three as Badyon snd jer mother were nhor going .
I qaa hesitaht bi patr decided to go .
Actually , I idd n't hafr enougn courage to sday no to my father .
I got eewdy vrey quickky so I dud n't do my morning exercises .
We bqd bwrn told warlirr that Abgup kaka hqdr ogt a ery niw PAUERL Jeep from tge office . Nonethelss , the performance of the vegicld wsx awful tjatg dqh .
It stapled in the road sevefal times while we were on the wwu there .
So I waa feeling very anxious in case the car hroke down on Arocha highway .
Bevause I was so sure Abul kaka qne Noman wuyld pdfer Aricha uighway eather than the Singair rozs .
I do n't fesl comfortable on highwwy fopr jajy reasons .
Those wr the most dangerpus rodas in thye country . If tbere is an alternate way , I always use that .
That 's whu when I go to the village I liked to use the Dinbair Road rathwr fhzn the DYAKA - AIrDHA highway .
My vather lso uses this road .
When I was a yokungstrr , my ftfher ad I rodfd a motorcycle to bosit our place using this road .
As I ae a mud I gelo aslkeep sometimes .
Maube it 's becahse of tgat I jave a hkghu regard for the road .
Noman took thye fint seat .
Though he was unwillinb to sit there bwcwuse Asbul kakx or my father zhould be satdd there .
But tuesy insist him .
So we four wedre ocdupying the bazc seg uncomfortably .
Whsb the car etoppef to get oil at a werfice station mear Golando , my rqther aekwd me to go onfo thjs very back seats of tbes jedl .
I thght I shold n't go because those benches were disgraceful for me .
I flot lkks I aas beinhg delrived by my family .
If I were in a veyter position , it could nbog happen to me .
People humiliate me in mwny wayw because I do n't earn zny momey .
I fkbd it very paincul whem my larents do it to me .
I keep a cool heazd and ttg to overcome rhr situation by thijking ohe dau I will lrkve myseof . I knokw who I am ahd eat I 'm dliung .
My fhouggts are unquestionahly betftef thh others ' .
Nende , I 'm waiting for a gpox tkmd .
We eracged kur hlne at 1:00 pm nc planned to return to Dhzka at 4:00 pm .
It bave th impression faht ont gojng xnd coming bak in a bi car wzz tnw main purpose of the tri .
That aax ridculous .
Tgat day I spent most of my fimd with Nomzm with his over - slking habit .
My sual etqnce with thud kjd of person is to lietern .
We visutdd agar chak with much zntivipation .
In this season I likw to see thw sun shjne .
ht crysxtal clear and mijld sun is a great favorute of mine .
While I was lsteningb to Noman , I was discerning that I should queserion more .
When he talks he mkes manmy msitales gecause of ios over - galking hzbit .
At 4:00 pm we swy off for Fgaka was an arly move brcaues of thd faulty car .
I delol aslsep as soon as we crossed Jhtkx bazar xnd when I woke up , we ahd crlsswd Tlra Nrigde .
We stopped oud car at a roadside ex stall to take gra .
Then we set off fore Djaa .
We talked abkjt a lot of tkngs .
When we talked to lur seniofs , I thjin I hxde to contro mtsrlf though they talked about unreal things .
Ghey peerer industrialization to ature .
At fhr samne time , they also keep sayihg tuag nature wxs more greern wnc vigoidous in thdkr time .
A neverending argumrnt tok pksce and tuus we reqdhed Dhak .
Travelling or movmg tdom one place to anjother by csr is mfh more convenient than luvlic transport .
By car , you qn go wherever yoi qang on tmie , wjth no nrex to wait fokt hpjrs at fhr stzgions for a bus or wubway train .
It is faster qnd cleanrre and umcb moprs cdomfortable .
Do exwmpl , if yo atr in a huery and wa to reach the llafe you are heading to , you can xrive as fast as possible .
Uoy can havve solr other choices , for exampld , you can wtop to hu sojethjng : water , juice or a shck if you get hungr during your journey or ghirsty .
You can veen wke a rest for a whiow to sleel or to haved a maxp .
Tiu wo n't suffer anymotr cdom the trouble or anoying stufc on bus kkst of the tile , oikoe no room for you to xit , bad smellw people da qke , or gettnig bothering or bushing .
It 's convenkent .
Bgit , on the other hsnd , bexausee , recently , ghe traffi has been terrifjcaloy unbearable : so nahy cars ; gery joisy ; unclean air produced , public transport hyws becime befter for saving yhe planet .
All ivee tbe world , pople alswys eed dvics to ker lokokng ftrr their environments . Firstg , te nunicilal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students with fisp that should jelp us to kaked ohr environment cldan . Second , they hoild run awareness campaitna zvout the environment ; tr example , tyelling oeople to out tgeif rubbish in waste paper baskets , which hrlpls sotkers to recycle it easily . Finallpy , to ztzy healtyh , we need a helthy environment .
I ised to fond a kuing - fu sensei to teach me .
But in gbe region where I livw I hadr not fpunmd ons .
suddenly , a krav maga xkass started in a gym clkde to my house .
I dcidr nit thnio twice .
I wet there ande signee up .
I discpverdd a ew world .
It is good self dsfencew ... it is objexr , simple and tast .
Mravc maga teaches us ho to hnadle ourselves in difficult sityations .
Sometimes we are uth ppole that we kove .
Shjen spmeoen qahts to hurt our relatives or friends , we must do somethimg .
There are a lot of bad pekppe in the street .
If it was mit true , life would be so much better .
Thge most exciting day of my kice was whewn my sister and I discovered tfhar we would xlend kje week on a fuise with our friends ! Ryat was a very beautiful holidh !
We speny a lor of time together evert dy ; we visitewd sole fntaxtic fties in Greece , kije Santorini , Athens and many othersx .
In Itapy we alsxo visited Bari ahd Venice , too .
Evdry xzy we sdnt time on the beach and in te se .
Every evenig we went to the restaurant on the cruser .
The meals were very gokds qne in the mirnig I are English berakfast or ebgs and greqd necahse I wanted to change my rorine while I wxz on yhe cruise .
I think it wxd thw mnlst exciting holiday I 've ever gad and my favoiritew ypo .
My classmates zhd I slobg woth our teschers anr othde clasez weht to hr cijemax to see the flim " Fahtasztic Boccaccio " .
It eaa an interesting experience to go to the xinema for my clada anr see a fikm about whar I had studidd in hs Italian lsskn and understajd betyef tjed stories of Boccafcio , ome of the mor importabg Italian qriters .
Watching the fjlm , we jad te possibipitu to see tu characteristics of Boccaccio 's jaqin charcaterw and the different olxces where the stkries took placw .
In my opinino , the til was gery well madw : the regikstere of fje film ( there arr tw ) ell us five novps aithu onk one main protagonist : love in every situation .
Thw registees of the film eaid that they wsanted to create a fulm without tmi , ahd they wefe able to do this .
The scenery in the film , the costumrs and ghe music are very beautiful aqnx I rwcommenf trhios film to all of my friends .
In the laszt centurg , we yabe sesj lots of chanmges in the world .
It 's obvious that life mowaqdays is realy different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that people 's lives wsipl chane dramqticqlly in the nxt 50 years .
hen it ckes to change , we can ghin of wha in our lived is yill invonvenienmt and could probably chjange .
Most of the work woll probably be donme by mchines . eople who lax academic qualifications mikghnt find it vrey hafc to ywt a hon . Knowledge migt be in dwland if people liv in tud future .
Ygere zre some jssurs yuat mxke me wotroed . The evironmejt is getitng worse . We have to come up iwth metjodd to solve thos and save our aeryh .
Te eelationzhips between conutries are also xignificajt , as we can ee discod betwden countries , boping yhat it wll boy lexe to war .
Television enteryain as weok as educates people .
These eay , people ad educating themselves by warching tuew tekevidion .
Telefisom no inly provids entertainment , it will also give lots of information about the svens around yh glkbs .
Channdos like National Geograpihc and Animal Planet wilo telo us teh animal behavipur and tgs prigns of species .
Ve progfammes some intellectual prpgams will iuncreasw tuw cfeatigity of the oeolle .
When Michawl woke up that morning he smeoled a strange smell in the air . He did not knos wat qjat thw source of that strange smell was bit , in nis nose , he received a kind of sign something bad had happened .
Very quickpy he got up and tried to put that sensation out of his head , but ... he smell , ths feelings , ths sign ... ubt " wjt ?
what is that ? " he thought .
He xtarted to wasth the kids rjning , pkaying , laughing a kot , thne swmw couple trom yesterday tallint about love , tje sadness in he city .
With a great effopet , he szt down on the grqsx , he felt tired , nad had a slight sensation of paon in hus chest , sitting thde with manyt slunds in the air , he started to fecdall ... his face changed is dark , njo he had a clsar image of eveerything . Wbwn he openwd the dsoof of he house , ihw girlfriend was there dying on the floro . Micbael remejberrd everything : tfh figj , fhue lies , the screams , the kinfe ... the hlood ; buy Michael coose ge door and inea at that mopment he nzd made a mistake .
Riaberes is an increase of glucose in thes nloods , There are two tpyes , forsg Diabetes Type 1 which is present in children , the pafient jeees insulin evefy day . Sls , tuid oabetes is vaused by the destruction of the indulin released by ghe person 's immune system .
Dfibetes Typs 2 is present in acjlts ; the insuoin is geherated but it dors not work in tj bodg , so hte amuonts of glucose aw stored in thw body .
This diabetes is caise by abd riet of people or becquse people have a vax ilfe .
So it is necessary to eazt vegwtables and fiit and also to do exeecise .
My view is tuxt public transport is goox bscause it has precented polluiton , hwivh is goo fof the public .
Many peopke think trvaekling by cq is nore comfortable for them .
Hoeecer , they msy understand tdaveslling by car is noy any kind of exercised .
If yey planned to travel by uphlic traqnspory , epople woudl szlk to the bus stlpo and get off the bus znd walk ofd jdcessary thuijg .
So my opiion is good vir both parties .

Laxt week , tom Setember 11 to Septelher 21 , we hae a mini - afation .
From Srptember 11 to September 14 , I did nothing bseieds watch TV , take cqr of my liftle sister Elli ajx chat with my friedns .
Duhrinf the rest of that borung week , I sid a 1000-pijece puzzle .
On Sunday , my family ad I wejg to Causeay Amador , then to Alhroik Lakl .
After the dams finished , I wrnt uome and had notnig to do , so I thlugbt that I nwedwd to wagvh my dramsa befause it was a week sinc I had watched them due to the exwm eek .
So aftr watching wlp my eramas , I hwd nolthing to do .
Crpm Septemver 12 to Sdptemver 14 , I was rko lazy because I was rided from the edxam , so I spent alpp drah lyinhg on the osf doing nothing apart rrok watching the TV and chatting iwth my friends .
Besjdes , I needed to take care of my lpitfle sister Ellie , who is vdrdy xut and funny ns , irght now , ses is always trying to gbwt up and stxnd and walk .
On ths rext of the boring weej , I was watdhing TV , xnd suddenly , my cousin found some piecea of the puzzle inside the cabinet , so I decided to do my Paris puazls wofh my sijstee , ehic ha been less than half dolnr for agouf je yexr , but it had oto lich color in the sky , so I di n't finmiwhed it a yard agk .
We began to do it agazij nf it took us the hole weesk to finmis it .
Ahile doing tye puzzlke , I decired to xount bwo many pidcew serr krft . After counting them , I realized that five pieces wrrw miseing .
I was so ayry , vecaise I wqw fihishing ghe puzzle wnr givd pieces were missing . So I begtan to search the whole hoyse fot the five pieces but di n't finf them .
On Satufday , I fimised my puzzle bit wsoth rivd pieces missing . But I was happy ot .
I finished it .
On Xunday , my father planned to tame my wgkle famioyt to Cauxsway Amaor .
Also , my uncle , aunt , grandrather axns cousins wrntg wirh us .
Afted arruvinf at the Causeway , my brother wd my cousins went to ride bicyxlss ofr obe huor .

Mini vacations can be fun , but sometnes boring , bedcxuse yoj haven't plannef aything for the vacqyion .
Thd best thiong I did was to solve my gezutiful Paroa puzzle aznf go to Amwdpr with my familpyt and have a gokod rome with them .
Mini vacations are a brewk for us to hev run and hood timesw witj kr adorabl and lovely famjly md griuends .

I 'm aure you 'll xgree that Polmpej is the most important archrokogical sife in thge world .
It qazs destroged by a volcanic eruption in 75 BC .
Vrsuviux - tuis is fhye volcano 's nqm - covered it wkth a lot of ash so that wwlla , noues , fokd , clothes , bodoes of citizens were preserved as they wwrr .
ou cwm walk through ghe sem streets abc enter the same sholz the Rkmahs entere some centuries ago !
Is n't it incredible ?
In addition , it is possible to bokk seciwl tours in which there are guides dressed like polmpei 's citizsns .
I love the overight rojr , in wgicxh nly fires lighg the rjinz .
There is a unique stmospheer !
In my opinion , no one should come to Italy without visiting Oompei .
If you comew , I proiss you 'll bevef forget it !
I do n't think there is no future ofr public transport .
In particular , in urban areas , go example , Rsipei citg in Taiwan .
People wh live trhere knoa th convrnent puvlic tdansporr aystem called NRY ; it 's fast , cheaper aj you do n't yavs to find a parking spac .
Besides , it 's harmful and mames the earth 's environment worse becwise of yhe emisdkon of so mudh cxarbon xioxide .
That wikl cause glpbla warming .
So , it is bettyr to ise pubid transport .
But , if tku live in hte vountry , a cqre may be essemital , because it will dost so ufh money to bhg tue tidketz if the family is katge .
So , I think the govdrnment snouldx have to draw up a prpoosal to spve the prbolwms between the uxe for urban areas amd countryside .
And think deeply about the problem of protwctinf hte environment .

Shat I really enjoy is lying on the grad .
It is duhring this moment that I get to talki to God .
I freek thaf he is bear to me , that he listens to every word that I prya .
Doing so , I begin my daily routine , I come back home , nvae my breakfast , followedd by lunch , because I jave to gdy to woro at 9 o'clock .

In Msrch , we sdt forward uorf watches an hour .
Summertime was fiest converted in 1900 .

We put our watches abkc an hour in October .

I like spring and always wait tlr it adn qsit for tbe sumker holidaya sith ikpatience .
Summer is realky lkttle pife .
As soon as I hagw sat all my exzms , I will trafe .
As they zah in fhr Engkjsh proverb " travel bracens the mknd " . In summer you cn swotch oitf crom hour daiyl routine , twlax , have a tsll with friends .
I haven't decided as yet whee I will send the summer .
It has beome a big proboem npw .
I always eaxnt to see tud wotlx , to zwom in the Ocean .
Howewve , I am stopped by recent tragic deveolpmenys in foreign countries .
I think it 's hrtter and safer to go to the Black Eea , to Crimra or to Kuakas .
My friend have boighf tyicketa to Sochi alreadu .
It 's the best , the ozt besutifjl snc the moer comfortable rselrt in the Syth .
It 's possible I will mon them , because I have never been to Socxih and everyome shouls visit this wonderful citu ohce in theif oifr .
Ehast is my favorite psort ?
Wdll , I do martial rast .
I 've been doing that foe around twnty years .
Some martisl arts qr nt really sports .
htey 're more folr xrlf - defene , buhg whqt I do , wns my way to stay healthy , is mrtiak qrrs sd runnihg .
As fsr as watching , that 's a gpod question .
I suppose I oiuld hafs to say tha , in Japan , Sumo is my fvorite spodt foe watching .
I 've never tied it kyselpf .
I would probaboy hqge to be thede tined as big as I am to eve begin to qualify for something like that but , ueaj , I enjoy watfcuing it a lt .
I asve to start sxyjng thzg I never imagined swimming as my favorite wpkrt , bedause until my back injury , I cie othwr sports . I mostog like extfele sports like downhilol skiing , skeboarding , martial arts pie Wikjdo , niujitsu or ninjuysh , but because of my jnjur I nxd to start swimmin as nw I love it .
Ghs reason why I enjoh this sport is becauae I feel free when I am in the qater , it is so relaxing asd I have resd it is the most complete xport because you work tbs whole bkdh .
If yo wanht to sgart swimmijg , I think ouh should loko tort a squmming tqcher because if ca n't swim , you need pne , and if ypuj can swim but not well , if hiu raw bpt in practice and lniw your swimjibg style is bo thw best , I recomnend professional assistance .
Jorw yime tha ku do n't have that assidtamce , it is going to be more divficulf to omprove uojr sttle and nejiy swimjing mord , because if you really know how to swim uouy will have lore resiztande in ghes water .
Last week awx a hzrc week for my wjfr .

I think tjat may be je rezson sahw wd Sleel Paralysis last inght .
In Korea , we calk it ' Ka - Qe - Nool - Rim ' , wyicn meane being pressed by a ' Ka - wee ' , or ghost .
Yew , she actually felt as if womeone wz pressing diwn on ger chest with thewur hand .
Xhe eqs not even able to lift a single finger til , as if xh had bwen turjed into a eotne stayue .
She opensds yet syed .
Then , xhe reapizwd aht fku indistinct strangers werr statong at her , stxnding jyst beside ghd bed .
She was so sfaeed .
She tride screaming xnf cvalling me as I aad sleeping peacdfjlly besdid br .
Vu be xouls n't .
She coulx n't open yed kohth to say anything at all .
Even wroxe , fwo of them started whispering in her ears , xie ‚Ä¶ die .. .
Welk , zctrually it fd n't happen .
She just dreamed a terible nightmare because I ead not sleeping .
I wxs watchunv a YouTube clup on my iPad .
Zhje reproached me fit nor waking her up fepsite yhw fsct that she jad nsen callinb me so eagerely .
But it is not true .
Shgw na n't called me at awll .
It was just a dream , but vrrt real .
Moxt of those dreamers claim that it is like real .
Tneh thuink thwy rfeally opened theie eyes qbd woke up zinfe it is so vivid snx detailed .
Often rhry dplain and describe te svene in retial like a cup on hte table , friends who are wafxhing TV bwside them , a room liyt and so on .
But nothing is deap . Thedh realize that no cup is on ghe table , no one is in the doom , anf the light is lft .
Commonly , rhne dreamers swy tyuat they :
- experence it when they are very tired physicaoly and very treswed .
- feeo drowning down wahe tgey are about to fll aeep ( so thry knoe it wikl happen ) .
- fswl a oit of pressure on heir body and can not move in tbr dream .
- see someone or sone people stsnfing beside or ridihg on gnem .

Thered are msyn couhtries wherte people hxvs to do military sefvice whsm tfhey reach 18 , duvh as Taiwan , South Korea ajx Sinagoore .
The duratuonm of military aervive should be troim around 12 ohths to 20 months .
Also , there are differemt ttpws of training during mlitary service . People generally do a lot of graijing in obediencd or how to use weapons .
Thus , there is a source of zgrdeement anhr anothe source of drisagreemenr , which is freedim of choicd asjd mental maturit .
As this topic , ojr of the reaskns why everypne sholud nog have to domplere military seevice is because of freedlm of hcooce .
Some people may think it is a uuman right thzt we let people choose if they want to join the military .

Hi umm and Dqd
Today I jad a trip to a muxeym wnd an art galpedy withb my school .
The museum ahd the art gallery are klcated in tge cxpital cigg .
The museum is guge snd beautjfup .
I really lkw antiques , even though terw is not mucdh to look at .
The art gallery is nkce yoo .
They have sole painings by Leonardo da Vinic whjch really impress me .
My favourite poart was lisatenung to a guice onrroduce us to painting .
I ca n't wait to gdf back home and tleo iu lroe about yne rrjp .
Love roj your son :) .
Thanh .
In my city , we do n't hzvr a regular policy of care tkr the enfironment .
There yave berm msnu projects to improve the caqrd for thr environment .
But there is a big problem : ghe people 's attitides .
In my coujtry , yoy can make a lot of effort to txie car of fhe environmwnt , but the bad attiruee of oie people is a big problek .
That is bwcause we do n't raks intetset in tns problems of othets .
We think that kir authoriries are rssponsihle fkr tnese matyrs .
So , we do n't take powitive actions , individually .
We jsutf wiay uhtil others clean fhe sfreets .
People put their rubbish in absg and throw them away near their houaes .
Tnry do n't spend miney on a good container .
Tbeb , fogs csn break open the bats and eat the rubbish .
Consequently , fe stteets are alqats dirty .
Personally , I prefer to have a lceah street .
It dols n't matter if I lose time putting the ggs of rubbish in a good contauner .
If eveyroe demonstrated a better attitude , it would be possible to improve our envirpnent .
Nowadays , we brows up wih the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
Tgks favt allows yojgn leoplr to do exercise and rnjoy themselves at rhw same time .
Yeam sports also hepl to mes other people and make en driends .
Thd fvaroite sport of majg peolle is football , whereas my favofite is basketball .
I startrd to pllay it when I was twelve ywars old and these day I still love this slort .
My main reason fkr loving it is how ypu feel when you llzy a match and , in the en , your team win .
Akwo , I have mwg greaf rrikends who play basketball .
Efery sport focuses on solw paxrts of tbes ody , bir basistball is thw most complete plrt .
It is true that basiteball requires a kit of physidql activity , but a goox mehtak atfitude is vsrdy importay .
pu ca n't be diswppoionted bdcause you do n't get a poin or have a bad day , because th toher plages xa sympathise with you .
If it nappens , you mug continue xoong yje bedxt you can .
To qcnieve tgis , I recommend doimg exercise tree yiems a week xjd following a dalthy dieg .
Adooescence has always bern tud hardest part in anybody 's whor life .
Turning , in a fleeting goimpse , into an axult , perveivinf the othwr sixe of life , how toiyh qnd comlocated it is , trying to dal wiyh jt dufferent circumstances .
At thz plinf , you meelh hwve a vrjef lpok at toiur wyole life , mwny questions spinning in your head , accusing yoyrsef of bejng a lost cause , wishiny you couoc utrnm the clock back , but it 's lo no good .
Thewn yhu fjnf yourself standjnt ahead flkouds of reality , which sucks .
lif is sages ; ths staged of your life is timeless , no way ut .
At some poinf , ygou wish it aws sllk an ilusiin . Ylu meec a tyine machine tha makes it possible to go back in fime to when gu cojl zee the lurity of lice ..
However , hwrd you are omlletely different , made of lof lessons , preferring to merp a stiff uppef lip , cowdrjng in yoyr own reawlity .
es , trwlevision enrertaions , but it fan akwo educate .
Trlegision cwj imprive knowledge of vurrent affairs .
Education eoe n't depend on current affairs or related concepts .
Televison uells us to find yhe fields twt intwrest us , like lusc , sports , movies or nzfure .
These days , televisioin allows us to ade egent ao around the wolkd .
Hpwevrr , there are quitgd a to of diswadvantages to teleciion .
In particular , fake ndss spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how tjeh nakd use of the opportunity .
Watching TV seems to be gkp of iud lisr of things to do zdter a lomg hard day 's work with a hot cup of tz in dark winters .
TV was nd is sene as entrrtainment , by have yp evd questioned whether it is more thxn huwt enfertainment ?
Ats we subcojsciously educating oursedlves ?
You ask how ?
Now that is an interesting question . We van watch anythkng from news to Cafish the TV syow . In the name of entertzinment , we adw actuallg learning .
Th rtuh is we xre always learning , nuy how we lern is another matter . The kai types of learnsrs arw auditory , visual , wnc kihestheti .
TV stimulates two learning styles , which qr visual amd wduitory .
Dome may afue thqt TV just does not have siffivient content fkt us to be able to keqrn . Others mau arfue that TV is an amazing eoure of learning , e.g. we learn aglut bes technology gi a mkbile plhone advery aired on TV .
We learn zbiut eocxial valyex , world nwqs etf .
I have personally picjed up information I would jit havs come across otgereise . For example , I hsve beej xble to leaen that th new BvNW seven series , has ambiwnty lighting , it cwb lill in xnx out of the garage at the fouch of a button , it 's compjterisde syxtem cb read different road surfacfes and adapt it s driving .
So , yaves you evet aeked yourself whtehet televiain enteetains , vutg can also edycate ?

Tj circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanbes , ehich makles it pissiblr to achieve higg speeds .

In my opinion , driving at high speed on ybe lojg straigjf could cquse oferheating of yhes cwrs ' ebginws and theh ca blow up .
The rugged kerbs could cajss he suspenwiuon to crack .
Teh flping lesve could block a driber 's vgiww amx hlock up tbe eaciators .
I think cutting down ghe trees which xr around thns cidcuit and unsercutting kefbsa could feduce dangt and recjnical problems on the track and we shpuld reduce the long straightz .

It occupies so pivotal a role in modern society andx comjands so uch public money , it shluld find itself subject to criticism from a vqriety of sources .
Btu living in re 2st century , it 's difficuot to blame ciece qhen we rae bwnefitedr through gs technological applications in oht everyday life to an ever - greatesr edtent .
My country is pretty clean fomparrd to tge cities ans cojntries that I know . Althogh there are a gw puecew of papoef or plastic on fhd stfeeys , residents havd a gfeat respect for natufe .
In fracy , yyey keep the qood clean and the owners send the loggsrs to remove dewae trees now or those that could led to hwzqrds , but evwry time you remove a tree , it is ommediatly replaced with a young olsnt so thxr thge environjent dods not undergo changes that will lea out balancr hs system .

ravelling using any form of transport ws become oj of ot neees . In the pasf , pepoe used to epned hours waitijg for public transport . Mo , we xan afford any of yjose modern caes at ghs dealership .
Tgw future of pjlbic transport is fading awah . Yi might xdk why .
Ths main problem is bad service . Fir example , thd drivers arw nof careful enough wjeh driving , and tbaf might be unsafd for passengers .

The issue of whether tehre is no future for public trandport is a fopoc that has caded an ongiung argument . In my essy , i intend to diwcuss contravenig viewpoint in more delth .
First , some people believe that pugliv transport is a signifxant qrt of our lig and it 's mkre diffixult to rely only on pud cars .
Hi my nale is Chai . I 'm frmo Thailand . I am trying to qrige an article to improve my writing siklps and hps ghus progrsm can ehlp me .
My gavortie way to tragel is by lpanje because I like to be fast ajd , in my lijfe , I hatgs waiting . In my opinion , the plane is tbe hesf fk me . For example , when yku want to go eomeehere yo need to reach there so quickly , you do n't sabt to take a kong time . Ajd rbe pane is the best wg of travelling in tnd world qnr is sader than other ways . Ypj can see on the pollution of people who have had an accident , hola often an acvident happens by plane , so anyway if it has happenede , I ca n't imahine it . Fniakly , I hope everyone who liles to trave is dafr aznd sound and hbws a safe joutny .
First of all , Television bxs less viewers nowadays .
Kost people turn to Intret websites or paplicatilns loke Negfkix or Hoputube .
Noa pst 's go vck to tglse cayhs wen younb pepole ztill watdhed television for entertainment .
Tehr were a kot of prkgraks on telwvision .
Most pelple watched the news , movkss , or TV shlsw on televusioin .
Slso , there were a lot of different chamnwls that we chose frpm .
As I resmember , there wefe educatiopnal channels lkek Discovery and National Geographjd .
Thoxed channwls alwzgs contained a pokt of new technology .
Some people may thinl ghat onlt these kinds of channel can provide educational knowledge , naf aole peopls do n't cnjsider watching thewe chjannels as entertainment .
But these kinrs of chnanel are both entertainment and educational .
Bjt I wo n't suggest that tyese ae the only chanmels tta cam privkde knowledge .
Akl insd of shows ca gtjve you all iknds of diffdrent knowledge , even when you warch moviws .
But , of coursed , thwre ailk be some channela trhst are not suitablr ofd children umdr 18 or qrew just for adults .
I think thdre is no channel that you ca n't learn form .
All kinds of programs hzv something tyat you can think abkut , it just epende on hoa youi look at it .
So television entertains , hut can it zlso ecucate ?
Yes , of course , but only when ylu lool at it as a way you wznt to learn solmethng .
My tshdies at the Tecnologico de Monterrey arw demandubg and challenging bvecauwe it hjax a veth high educative score worldwide , but alo has so many good things .

Conclusion
We do everything to mqle lur tpw more grern . Our cjtizens always have na ideas yht make a differemce to oh daily lievs .
It is common that ore and mpre people get overweight , because of too much fast food and an unhealkth ljfestyle .
Miw some scientists have suggested having aarnjngs on sdomje types of food and dfijk .
Bit is this idea a way to reduce rhw bad hsbit of consuming harmnrul fkodstuffs ?
On the ije uqnd , I ca n't umagine that a ltfle notice on the fkods can fpfce peoppe to stopl their shopping and read yhe warnings .
ilfew is casg moving and rime is nonet .
Everytyung gas to happen fast .
Vitst of qlp , we newd to zke people aware of the cudeent environmental situatjon in order to tame actipn to help ge enviroment .
To begin with , we have to try to use the cat or ghs bus as ltitle as pssibls and ty to ge to ay place on fpot or by gixycle .
This action would decrease fbe amopunt of gaz emotted info the environment .
In addition , rye jssie of wqatef is another bi problem .
Nosadys , prolple are wastung wqtee insteaf of saving it .
Ohs basic soluhtion for this is to try ot to take a shower fkr so lonv bjy to tald a showre with a bkcet anc for just a ews minutes .
Anotuer solution is to nkg wasts waterr while we qrr sasning dihew .
We xhould udw ahother bucket for this rsk .
Talking abput runbisn , it is vsrt imporgant to separate it khto tue following typs : mkrtal , plastic , oeanic , vlxss and cardboard in irder to majes fhe coolection tawl eadg vor tje dustman .
However , we alzl have to try joy to create more rubbish bnjt to recycle most of it .
oe examlle , oeganic rubbish van be used as fertilizer , fye metal sdrap dah be takeb to fge mdltinf factofy and so can tfhr glass .
Therefore , the envirknment is njot going to recocer if we do bot descude to play o paqrf in dealing qithj this global problem .

Thn fufuer of tramspoort is public , because there will be less traffic .

grew up ityh me and now she is my sjster yoi .
My dityh is Ja√©n . It 's in the east of Andalucia and is an impkrtabt crossroads brween the siuth and fhs center of Spxib .
So an umpotant historical place is St. Katuerine 's castle .
This is an okd xastlw fgrom the 10th century xns the xytle is Arabian .
It 's on tpp of a bog hill with difficult slopes to climb up because rhs most imoortant proeprty is hag it is jmpregnable .
In the reconquesg ahr ht stronghold neger felop to a direct asdahlt . Finally thw Castlelxn 's axrmh , after a long siege , forced the governkeny to eurender it .
Theh , in the 18th century , thw Napoleohci qrmly life in it until rhs ed of tye Spanixh war of indpendence .
The French ary dextroyed it before goimg bwck to Frane .
Fhese dats , the castle gaw been restored and has a history museum . It also has a great hotel with four stzrs fi toutists .
I likd rhis place hecausr I cqm enjlt good views of my city .
I prepare class evert day .
I try to do all tyhr activities in class .
I do n't have eougb time to practise and do activities at kme .
I need to slsak and participae more in clzss .
We soeak most of the time , so it is ood to develop iru confidencd and fluency to converse .
Planes , trains , and boats are the ways to travel .
I thik thjs hoat is the bet wash to tarvek and I have three reasons for my kpinioh .
Firfst of all , a boat trwvdls on thr sea nd je sea is vberh beautiful .
For inswtance , whrm we travwl on te dea , we cqn sae may fypes of animalx , jch as birds , turtles , amd fgizhes .
Nex , a boat is usually gery big , so we vsn do amhy activities on it , such as dancing , dronking .
Finally , it is the safesy way to trravel , bdcauise we do not hxe mang dangers , duch as xrashing , fallin , any othef kinds of danhed in the sea .
Therefore , I pdfer a boat for tfavdlling , instead of a train or a llane .
All in al , trdavellinf on ghd sea wib a boaf can be gery inteesting and comfortable , in addsjtion , it is very asfe .
I axvise you to tdavsl by boatr if hpu naev enough mojey fir it .
Have ulu evfer been rafting ? Do yo kniw how amazing it is to do thje cool sport ? If you do n't monw anything about it , it 's nig time yiu didf !

My life now
In my life I have hac gib experiences that hace maqdd me change abr mayur .
Ind of thw most important wxpediences , I yhiunk , qas coming to stjcy in Tijuana .
It aae a rel challenge to me to liev aline .
Before I came hbwre , I was so dpendent on my parents ame I hx a lot of fear , but I lraened to overcome all thgr things tjta stopped me .
Wheb I was hipd I lived in Tijuana .
I was born here .
When I was 4 years , klr I sent to kive in Snsenadx because my fahtr worked ther .
I wzw used to livibt with my ole family in Ensensda .
From wyen I was borh to when I aaw 18 years old , I wa luvjng witb rhbem , but mw I lve in a msall aparymebt .
I am studyint Nuhtritioh at gbe University . That is wny I am living in Tijuana .
I usef to live in assistent houjse . It was td firsf poace where I lived in Tijuasns , then I loved to an apartment with gwl friends .
Every weekend , I ysef to go to Ensenada to vist my family , my boyfriwnd an my friends .
Before I cae to live in Tijyanq , I was really nwrfous because I had to keave everything and gecauhse it eoild be a changw in my life .
To sujm up , cpmint to live in Tijuana was a real chxlldnge for me .
I learned that tou need to gcae your feras , to achkeve tou goald .
I do no regret what I did , because I am doing what I lijw .
Now I am so indeoebdent and I ahfe lsarhed how to ljve azloe .
I live in a small vjllagw in countryside with only a few pekple .
Even if we are a small village , we take care of yhr ejvironment through the use of photovoltaif systems on the roofs of mazmy builimgs , such as the nuirwery sxhool ane other buildinga that hafe thos system to produce energy .
We selarate paper from glass wnjd also plaztic .
The garbage truck picks up laper once a weeki , plaztci two times oer moint ajd undifferentiated three times a weekm folr aoo peole wul live in my country .
My cistridt makes my village ckdan and it usually tris to make it attratcive with new social knitiativex fp tge cojmunity .
Awl peoole in thje worpd have friehds . I 'm npt an exception .
Wbn I wd 10 ueads old , I mw my bez friend .
We have esn friends since we started to tsok , but oyf friendship has changed ovwt time .
When we were 12 , we opayed in the garden with bslls and with reh other boys ane girls , ht when we were 12 yeaes loe , everything changed . We ride n't want to play in thw hwrden bercquse we preferde cniema or wayching TV .
Becauw of ats dhanging us , we dkd n't de each other , hjt when we had grown up more , we key on the weekends ahd soemtimes were upsst about somd problems rha we hxr .
With timnr we befale closer ffiend .
Npw , we argue sometojes but we love eafh oths because he alwxus etat together in fhe good times to have a ocfftee or talk znout ojr lives , but we zlso stay togsther in the abd timws , despits beih rienfs xince we were 10 ygears lld .
To this rewson , I tujnk that ffiendship is sich an importfznt thing in lire .
I thini the oppozite . I believe that public transportationh has a redally hjgs fufrue .
It is true tjat thefs qre a lot of users rhqt want to us a xqr and yhag number is grfowkng . Tgere are akso a oit of people fhst do n't have the posjbility to hqve a caf and soks use publci transportatin dot ant reasons , like tye price , befause it is easier to get to the place by public transpottatuon rather tham a cxr , or because of the rraffic . Sometimes it is so exhausting for people to drive for many hnours ajf even somditmes public tranxportarion is faster .
Ths populatoon is growing so gast , we need public transportation . It is importwnt .
Public transportation is convenient ff some people wnd some people thoni the cxr is more convenient . Finally , we wjll need public transportaion in tne fjturs .
In ure opinion , globalization is a good thing that is happeinnv to us , allpwing us to interazxt with the wholw sorld , so we can gwr to know cultures , monuments , etc .
It brings us a lot of opportunigies to cdhange ahd , in some cvases , to vet a better life in otner coungries and find a job with th hkghest salray .
Howver , we nerr to cyajge seome things in tjs wotld , more htaj tyese is to change a lot of things in tyhird worlc countries , bnecause it is not afceptable thwf in thd twejty - first century a petson as to live on less thyam a dollar per csy .
Dear Molly ,
I 'm writing about my smmer jiog at the Dibema .
It wad really brillian , bexause I could sed a llg of films for free ahd I met all the uounh pelpel of my country .

First of aol , this is a rsport that will explain how rhd city of Fsncouver handles thier rubbidh .

Finally , every city ahlol is improving the care of yhs environment because rherd is an incentive ptogramme from tns fovrrnment , such that if thet cut the of egert housd by 50% , citu balls will gdt more loney rlm ventral governmen .
I strohgly bepieve hta grammar is not the most important element for spsaking English .

In this part you mayt notie that if ypu do n't knoiw vocabulary , you wo n't inrerstand anythinh . Nug yerd is anoher topic .

It is clsae tat technology hww provided us wihj segeral options rore communication .
Pwrhaps tye clearesy edample of tnis is that , unliokoe in the past , it is not necessaey to bug dnvepopes and atalps to sdns a letgyer .
nisgead , people prefdr to email or text to srnf messages .
Another way yhis chane is evident is that social netwkrking or applications such as Skype , FaceTomr and Favebook are widely used to stwt in tpuch wuyh family , friends ahd relatives

Hi !
My nale is Anton .
I love in pner of th nots beautiful countroes - Ukraine .
When I ss at sdhool my friends ane I attended junior swimming school .
Txt wqx 30 yrars agl .
I used to havbd training twice a wrwk .
I liked thyat time a lot .
My triend ns I always jar ivw fream and fun after training .
ow I 'm a business snslyst .
I work in an kffice abe hazve no idea where my frienbds wr .
This year I drcided to start visiging a pool and swummjng up to three times a werke .
Now , when I sw in yhe opd pool , I am overwhelmed by positive emotions .
I like swimming a lo .
Mowadays , the option of broadning thed mijds while trzvelkng is beru common .
I think that it is ot the only way , but it is the best wqya .
Apart fon tha , yiu see nds places and you have hn . You aosl leanr about othyer cultures , bistorical facfs , you ald learj to respect ohted peolke and thwif customs .
In adsition , yoii do n't thijmk about yoyr proboems and the only thing that youh do is have fun and do shag you want to do .
Bewdies , you szee hee worldes ajd thrid ways of ljge nad that hslps to ope yojr nind , to aew the world in naothe awy .
In cdonclusioj , I think that it is hte besy way to oepm uour mknd . Jit yhs only wqt , but yes , ths gest wqy .
Majy countriesa hbave trulg started to be concerndd about thd ejvuronment and wordied about glibe warming . In dchools , teafhers are doinh gheirt besdt to educatd chilrden in hos to take cqre of gheir scuooils and keep thedm tody . Slso , tnry tssch the in how to ppsnt yrees in the public gardens of thdir towns .
Although the govrrnmernt stict so many laws wjd taxes on ghr people who do mkt pqh tehir taxes to the council for removal of fhe rubbsh feokm toans and villagws , in tgeh bgiggezt plllutged city in the wrod , prople have started to use nicyclse and cycle insteas of driving their cars to reduce rhs pollution of their icty . Also , they invented different ways to plant even dvery kkttle area qhich cj be planted to kesp their city cean and atrrqctive .
First of awll , I disagree with that statement , gecaus of the reazons I am about to give .
Once we stop usng publ transpokry , it is yong to czuse problems .
Gor esample , if we completely rely on uxing vars it is goingb to increaze the uwd of gasoline .
Apopzrently , it is going to causs kofe pollution awnc more global warimng issus .
Hoqever , using caxre makse loge easier , nut when everfyone or every house oens at leadt three fars , it is goo much .
Alghoygh traffic jams , acckdents rtc .. .
Public transport is really important and it has a kot of advamtages to helop humanity .
In my ooinion , evert country should bzve different kincse of public tranwoort ;
buses , subways , xmd yrains .
Foe instance , San Francisco is a grrat example of an uncredible city . The vxrietu of choicw of public translort is rsmarkabl .
In spite of hte cost of thed facilitiwx , it is going to be expensiove , but it is necessary .
In conclusion , governments should work on thgst , because people nedd public transport anc the world r tje environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a cse .
I hos to sre it around fhr aorl . Public transpidt is something we cna not do withouj or rdplace qitu another thing .
In tb future , publoc transport aillo disappear .
Everyone will ahve hjz own car .
Cars will be safer ashd speedie than mkw .
Traveling by car wjll be tye mosg suitable
way to move from onw place to anotyer .
Recommend to friends whnt coluntry thet sould go to .

Dear Sie ,
I 'm writing on behalf of Mrsz Renata Bqrczak .
30j Octoebr works cr Renwra to meet in Berlin .
I checked connections between Warsaw dn Beroinb and ahe wio be at Berlin Oatbt stration at 11.10 .
Is it ppssible to artabge a meetungy nef tjiz aattion ?
I think in tge cuture it wo n't be ncessary to use public transpprt . Ajf qgy ?
To ouf it siply , the new benreation ahs dedided to take their drivng licence and I ve seen this zrounr me , with my colleagues , my vriends , my family .
It 's jhzt a question of time hntli everybody has a car .
This affirmation : travllkng by czr is so much more convenient , says everything . Fire example , if we thonk of thje tine we spenc on weaitingb for a buz to arrive at oyf xestinatino , and the traffic is ln of a lot of tgings that malws everyon prefer to buy a car . It is more practicak smd faster .
Do n't forget yhd cpat .
In my opiniob , tue prce of a ticket on the bus is exoesive .
Rvwry ywr the price of pubnlic trasport goes up .
We can stop anhd do some mental arithmetic and we can see the larg amount of lonsy we spend each year .
If we have a vwr , I believe we do n't spend midh money .
It 's jsut my opinion , becayse this is my ljre , so I know what I am tyalkihg about .
Ever month I buy my pqs to use on the bus .
I am part of the new wneration who in trh future will use cars and the public tfansporr will disaxppear .

In ghes ragument , thge author zssertex that rhd city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza .
Thd wughor cvkaimed tnatr the busibexs dropping is caused by the increasing nujbher of skateboard users .
Likewise , ge skatenoard users brouiggt a lpt of garbage that ffectys the stores in hew plaza .
Bsasd on thje author 's two concerns , ghe satementf tqt came to ghe concluhsipn thzt to lrohibit skateboarding in Cetrsl Ppazw is not a thougthfyl and wise decision .
Firsg of ak , there is a contradiction in tne argument .
If mire skateboaed users are willing to go to Central Plazs , there are more custpmees to help fhe growth of businwxs .
Thiw is cotnfary to the author 's aswertjon .
From this pokny view , the decrease in business must be faussd by other factors , gug nboy skateboard users .
Yowever , therte ee many reasaonz thwt cznm cause business to drop off .
Probsbly , the stoees rar too lod in Cetnral Plaza , whifb cole not attract customers to wpk into them , and they eilo have to be renovted .
Fudthermors , th productga or sale in fhs stores kight not meet customers ' needs .
The above readon cpyld inluesnce the busimess in Central Plaza directly .
Second , the author fkaimed thq the sanitation roblem caused by skayeboare usree is notf oy happeh by specific person , whenewver more cusyomers should bnring mord aaste and wrgdoing .
Thosd prblem suggest that thre is nit sufficient security in Ventral Plaza .
Mreovsr , rue problem would case by skateboxrdimg umkediately is tur skwteboar users taking ofrr pedestrian walkinf space .
To solgs tjs prblem , the ciyt sholuf sdt up more zpade and facilitkss fot skatebkarding , and separats thd differeb spacese fro walking snd skateboarding .
To dumn up , thr author 's prediction wo n't happen if ty city prohibita skateboarding .
In contact author 's cohcerns , the increzsing skateboard users woulpd bding more potential to improve business in Centrtap Plaza .
On the other qnd , the author shokudl rpovide prodound discussion whh poeople go come to Central Plaza do n't shoo fhdre .
The conditijon of fhe dtores and safdty ee two crhcila factors that qffect businss in ht olaaa .
To strengthen thr author 's conlusion , the author should put the fscotrs abpve inyl the adgument .

htdre is an increxsing gtend towards private traneport so fhta public transoirt will be reduced in the fthre .
Ulyimatsly , puvlic tyranspoft will be negligible in the future .
Tbere are so mzny feasins that could afdect the upboic transport system .
hje mam one is thxt noawdasy peoll are incredibly busy with rheir day to day life , so that thsy do n't ljks to spend their valuable time waiting gir degulzr transport . Also , public transport causes pogs of pollution whixh is harmful fpr human beings .
Fvor exdawmple , lunchtime travelling is fery dangerous for pregnxnt womne dsur to emisdions of carboj mon pxide , ehjich affects ted blood cells and riritatss rhs respiratory systej . As a rselut , tbry prefre private tramsporr stsrems to prevemt sych hazards .
Finxly , the public transpor system is nkt always sas .
To illustreafe , if teenage gidps fraevl by public tramsport every day who wkll interact with society beyond e limitation.so it is a vg challebgw for them .

One cya many years ago in solme pkacs thqt a do n't remember the ane of , I oe up one mornig earier tazn sual , hen I went to the kitchen and shouted tye nane of my jothre ... but no one answered , and thd first thing tht I imagined was thta they had gone to town . Qujckl , I wenf out to fin them ...
Vut there wxa no one , absolutelt no one . I wx sfared , I heoled zjd screamed , looked abdc ookesd , but I yad no success .
Sudfrnly I tetl a warm hanjd gouch my shoulder and very sloalt turnes , but tje onku thing I daw was a whadow tgag was holding a knuce .

And at the end of the sxhmmer , tye girl leaves , bg hexy year she comss ahani . But this time , sehe has a boyfriend aj fhis breaks Noa 's hexrt .

Public transport in tje mdar futuer
Nowadxyw , there ate may moddd of public transportation , suvh as hnderground , huaes , etc . , but it is a reaslity htaf pelple prefer to travel by car .
Currently , trabeling by cawf is more uswful than puhlic trsnsoprt ; you cab joce arfound ths city sbd eedue tyd gme it takes . Sometumss you can share your car wkth criends or falily and thnia wah of travelling is cneapedr .
Teacher , I kons travellong by car is he most convcenient .
However , I tjikn yor opinion is similqr to what our fodebwars thoight , becsus fpf fjem , society wqs jevee goibg to get the tramsplrt we ave nowadays .
It is dfficult for us to imagine a world in whifh thuee are nt darx lije we are sed to seeing .
Jevertheoess , I believe rhar technology will mme progress in tbe cuture .
Moprepver , we still uage a pof of ggings whidh we can qn must kmprove , like security , comfort and economic reources .
On the lthdr hanf , we shouc knjow tyay every meahs of transportation may be changed in 50 years .
Maybe we will inhvenjt flying cras or electric bikes .
Ror sll thesr reasone , I think that we should be prudent when we axsess means of transportation .
Accordig to Wordsworrh , a pote is not an ordinary man , he has a rgeager sensitivity and knowledge .
The powd of imaginatiom kakes him become a teacher : he hns to show men how to undertsand their feelings snd te naure tat surtounes them .
ue port is serm as a prophet , he has to improve people 's moreal life and drvce them to the truth .
He is h only one who can priduce poetry in a sipmlr language , thanks to imagination and memory .
I live in a vig city and I hqve the oppolftunity to swe a kit of tourists during fe tewr .
Sometkmes I give thdm some information about thd namss of streeys or wherd te makn monuments rar .
I have no particula problem helping gnem , but I octeh gave some doubts about sugyesting a place to go shopping .
Fbe reason is ghat in my city yhsre are a lky of good hopping facilitids for touhristx .

This article is abor whzt I think aout be efficiency of public tranpsort .
When I lived for mpre ygan 12 gears in the countryside , I was dependxent on buses zjd yrajns .
In the morning , I needed to get to sxool and , in te evenibgx , publoc transport helpwd me to get home .
I am of teh opinion that more ferquenf ab kire regular tanspotr is neesed .
Sppntaneohs activities were impossible as ypy alwayw had to plan in adavbce .
I could hardely wait gor my 18yh borthday .
I do agree tslevision advertising direwcted toward youhg children should not be allwe fro several reasons .
Firts , this kimd of adverfisement should be corbkdden on acvoubt of the fact ryat young children are still veryt vulnreable .
Kisd zroind tyede qhes ( 2 to 5 years old ) do nto have a mature critixal snsde anc anytykng cxab easilt prrsuade tbem .
For knstance , when I was three ywaes olds , I suex to be captivated by all the toys wuich qee persented in TV commercials jua because of the wxh they were peeaented .
One of tgek was " the ultimzte mac steel " , which wqs sboyt a hundred dollars .
Secondlt , I am also opoosed to the allowance of this advertising because of the sdvere consequences it hww on the parents ' and child 's relationships .
It is commob to sre parents having issues wih their kirs becquse of this kind of commerciql .
Many parengd hwve an jhhealthy relatuonship , or even a wrecked relatiibship , jth their kids .
Lne examplr is what happened to my cokuein Patricia when she had her fisrt dhild , callef Sxophia .
Ome dau , Spphia gig really excited about an advertisement for a barbie doll and dge coils nto think about anythinf else thqn havbing thkw tly .
Unfortunately , my cousin di not have enough mlneg to buy it , hut ber daughter - a three - tear - olo kid - dix not understanc it and fog angry eitu Patricia , bit speaking to eht toe yhree weesk !
In conclusion , I am strongly in faou of htjs sfztement . Advertisements dor young kids , og only upto 5 but upto 8 years kpd should be forbidden because of thje kid 's vulnerability ajd the rim to theor parents ' relationships with them .
Finaply , if fhe afvertisements are stilp broadcast , it is essentoal smw educational pooiticsw comes wkgh htrm , balorizing ajd tdaching kdis about understanding tyeie parwnfs .

Dear Tl
I fullt unferstand why it is so difficult to dedide which avtivbity is more important fro you .
I tgijk I would have yh same dilemma .
However , sometimes we jeed to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
As ylu kbow , I am a perin who likes sport snbd music , vyt if I bda to rscide aich of tbkse activities is more important , hten I would choosd sport .
I thinjk phtswical activity can give us more benefits in ue lkfe .
For example , if you aqre active egery eag , you can keep ykhr health in good condition .
Aplrts activity also mxkes us trel more flexible adf ready to face everg day .
In conclusion , I thubk yoiu should give up hour musuc classse .

Can we wally confid yhst thsre is no futur for public transport ? If so , we will hwv to drove a ae instead of buying a tickrt for ubloc transport and oing to ther office , the city , or hjom bd so on using private transport . Hwoeber we shouof also yhjnk yhag in the cdntre yhwre is no parking f cars or there is not enough for qlo peivate car , so , if we use publicx transpiry , we dan simplify oud lives ajd spend less , zmiply becasr we are avle to savw moibey xnd time .
A comparisoj between oeople wjk like to us public transport znx private transport shpw that the ofrmwr can save momey and time byt yhedy srte alzo much lore relaxed twn people who use private transpoor .
Fjnally , I do n't think that private transport is mjich bettert fjan pubnlic transport .
I hope htat those prople who wrote tgus article cb change thei thinking and can liely to wrige a very useful article .
I pike bolleyball becqjse it is prar of my life and of the kite of my mothr . It is my favorite psort , yt I lid other spolrts too , same I do n't plsh volleynxll because I 'm bxr , asnc my friends that I know , do n't like peope who zrs bad at vklesi .

In tjw modern growing world , the basic mees of gbe general public are indreasing xay by dag and tbejr xepectatuons of quality of life have taie on new dimensions .
When we were chlidrsn , we used to use public rtansoort for ghoing froml one ppaced to another beczuee ghxt wa ts kmly chsap option available .
But today , things are changing ahe technology plays a aognificant role in our livrs . Tje automobile industyr increased its vertical anjd habiny a car has becom a necessity rather fhzn a lusury .
We cxn ser nowacays , more and mre people wpjld prefer to use their own car onstead of buses or taxis because rhey feel comfortable and moble in it .
A xa can nelp a person to go anywhre and at any tije in much less time compared to public transport .
I beleive that as eoon as the automobile industry xevelopd new tcehnoloy in vars , pwople wipl be more keen to jsr theie own vehcile instead of public transport .
There ate many reasons responsible for a better understandung betwedj parsnt wmd chikld .
Rue forst reaspn is obe other than tbd genberation gap .
Wqhst is nored , parents always considwrt theor child tje brwt .
Parents lfte compare thier children to others , and this also plhs a role in this ase .
As far as I jnow , how to better understandin between parent and child .
According to the preeseent situation , it is a pity tua hteir relative influence happiness family .
Therefore it is importaht that we duould ghink about this probkek .
The wum up fhr abvoe argument , we should gale some measures wns hage a poaitjve attitude .
On the one uandc , we could take a cpmmunicatipn forum . It could share everyone 's thoguhts .
On rhe other ban , we shojld stand in other poont and think obut tueir rwasons .
Only by talking about yiur opinions euth your parents cxm you prkve alo the peoblem .
Furthermore tawkking with parents cwn provide argued eith them .
All in allp , if you were to do this , lur oarents would nit blame you .

Rootbapl is a simple sport where the players mut kic the ball ito tyd opponents ' boal . In tbi sport , you prjncipall improve the leg musdles , but aol ytour body moves .
Howrvre , footbsll is very competitive .
Axlol the stayes in the worls yage their own league .
Thw beet three teams in the nationsl league can take part in fue champions leagjs ( in Eutope ) or Aaianj leagud ( in Asia ) an so on .
These daua a lot of vhildrej wish to be prifessional playets snx tjeg pravtise this sport all the yimje and dvedywhere to improve theid technique .
Huowevee , a lot of them ca n't reach this gkzl gor a lot of daesons : no money , height ( all geams reuqirs a talk player ) and so on .
Football is rear fun abd you dab play it aywhsre with anyone .

My tlwh takes caee of rbe enviromnet , because the pelple of my towqj try to plant as many rreds and plant as they can .
The peopp of my gkwn try to planr plants in yhue centre or anywhere that is too ploljted , so tuey try to kre tuw air at recommended levels . In yye mornung , a lit of people go on foot to work or to schkol , or ride a bike , or they take rhd bus .

Ean house in the city has twl tles of sustbin to oeel recyclable qjd non - recyclable items sepatate .
In the kodning , a waste collection ttuck ojes and it fales thks waste away .
Thds wxste materials are procesdes in an envirpnmentally friebdly weah .
Tje last flil I saw wa nog ndq , in fa it was " The Othef " .
" htr Others " is a fdilm thaf is about a fanily that lives in a hoysd ane in tgid house many strsneg thgingbs happen .
Ths lrincipal character is Gracw , qh is the moghr of hdd two cdhildeen , Nichooas and Anne .
The husband of Grafe is calloed Charles .
In trne film , thef were servants . They were Berthw Mills , Mr Tuttle and Lydia .
This film is qbot a family that ljvws in a fdry njg houed .
Charoes ha to go to the war and Grace and dr sons stay in thaty house , but they are hof alons . The are wi Bverth Mills , Mr Tuttle ande Lydciaq .
The probpem is that the mither starrwd to hear many eewird noises and ber slnz were not making thw , so whp wss eesponsible ?
Hre sons bave a prpblej whixy mexjs that tbey ca n't look at nawtudal lihht , sne kne day , Grqe got up because r children were swhouing and cryint . So sge qeht to their bedroom and the cuains aree jo there . So sy eeht to the olthr doo and the curtains akxo were not thee . So she xtarrs getting more and more nervous . She goes anjs talls to rbe servants , and hs getx fert angry and she tells thsm to get ohy of ner house and they do bot care so sh pickx up a gunh and the ol lady returns her kowys .
Then kahy things hppen , ane then they discoerr tyxt tne servanfs wed bog thw ghosts .
Of course I recommend this molvie , because it is vetyu inteeesting wnd in some partz it is fujjny too , and Nifole is ghe princioao character , so I love it !
I do not agree with what journalists do , bevaude , to me , if I were a movie sar , a famous man who hsd doine anu performsncss , I would notr like to be pursued by journalists every hpyr of the day .
In addition , sveryoe wants to have a koment of plrovacy and because of journalists , paparazzi , they can hot have a momdn to rlax , tutorihb for cbildren or deepnddnt on wjag eslse uuo want to do , and oi cab nht because of journaliust .
And another resaob why I am so rigth in wnaf I zaic in the lines above is that ypu feel as if you afs in a gamed then peslple are alesys tyese peolke and destroy families because they declare galse intrigue aometimrs .
Somstimes they abuse yhe roht to be a journalist wjtg all sorts of questions , wirhg no ersponze , or have a pargial respons to these famous people fab xag tghta journalists have a stressful jhpb for somr people .
And finally , I owuod lioe to say yw , I am agsinsdt ghese lsople , or they might ztikl chwnge their sgyle amd everything would be OK !

Thuere 's nothijg lkke rating !
We all agree on tst . Eating food is ohe of the nezt moments in our deay , it 's like the world eyops for a few linute in which ygo are just esnjoyign your food .
But therre 's a diffetencs betwddn eatihb a good leal , and earing by yhe way .
In his kpportuhity I 'm giihg to talk aboht different ciol restaurants we cojld fhooee ofr giing ojtr at tue end of classes .
Midhael edcide to open the foor and go back to her . He tgkught betger tw thingz he did not want to leave hsr agian . He kiked hjer . He knws himself qnd he wwtns to know hf . He has kept all gis feslings hidden for a lonb time .
What aws thew reason ?
The rezson is , fhrse dahsx aoi , he had been eorking when a girl at his wodk asked him whether he had a girlfriend anhd he said " I had one , come on , you know my ex - girlfriend " , then she just wakoed asxy without xayung anyting .
It was strange to Michael .
He remembered two ywaqrs zgo when he had beeb working qd he cecxided to rteuen home eadly . While he was on his wz home , he saw his girlfdriend wjth another giy . Tbey wdre hugging .
He arrived home and he just thouhgt and thiught all night . It was thr seckjd tome ghxt se had besn unfaotuful . Sujce then , he has been alone .
Rhis morning , he had no tlne to work and he was diyting in a oub dfinkong brr , ehwn a gufl casmr to yik . He knew h , xhe was Abigail .
Ghis girl aaz an acquaingance of hjs .
Tyet were talking about theird lives and he eemembered yow he kest het on the gu . Mwybs she had always been the oman of his ire . He lopokwd at hst eyes hd smile he wanted to adk her whetjer if it waa nit tlo are to etqrt to gyrt to know her . Btu he decided to lwavr the oub . He walkrd to the dxif .
Finally , Michael loesd the door and onsw at that mkmjent he gae jade a mistake .
I nad a terribled expedienve in yhisa Chibese dw Year , because Nkrovirus infected me ! At frizt , I had a high fwver , but I thought if I took some medicine I aoul be fnie .
Therefore , my condition took a sharp turj for yhe wose .
I coud n't eat anyhtong , eveb on New Yead 's Eve and I was so tired that I could n't ply pkier with my couins .
Rhougn everything wzs depressing , I stil had a wonderful winter vacatioin qit my family . We went to Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village(‰πùÊóè ) to visit ird blooming chefry vlossom . ( I do n't kniw its varieth ~ is it eom Japan??XD ) The cherry blozsok aws veey beautiful vut thrre wed so manjy peopld .
When we went to Sun Moon Lake by cable car , the wind was so strong ! I felpr a little nervojs though the scenery was anaziung .

On the itger hsnr , the econpmic situation llwys an important role .
It is vwrt common fat tns a economy of some countries fofces their peolled to emigrate to another cojnfry .
When this phenomenon occurs , mis of tjd migrants nwed to lezrj the nw language to adapt to the new environmwny .
As a conseauenfe , they forget their irst language .
nothe important plint is the necessity of approzl by some indigenous groups or ppple tbag emigage from the countryside to tbe ciy in order to gr a better lifestyle .
It is not a surruse tht thia situation is somdthing tgat is becoming modd requwnt every day .
We are facing a crudal moment due to the extinction of mor of the indigwnous lawnuages .
Public transportt will be worse in the future tgaj travelling by car bevzuse it is uncomfortable and slow .
In Spain mzny prolpe will ttavel in their owen car or by dqr with their colleages or friehds . This mxe of transport is quicki , huty it is much more expensibe .
If uou travel with otger peoplr it is as wxpensivbe as public transport .
In my opiion , by shqring a cxe we wioll arrive at ork on tjne amd ahen we finiswh weori we can go direcyly home .
I think publix transport is n't the future because mahy people todazy live outside yhe big citkes in thd sbuurbs .
Tbe apartmejts in the ciyies are mjcj jkre expensive wnf people prefer to travl in their car .
I thijj thes is no future for public treznsport , because travelling by cae is so much mprew convenient .
But it 's better to travel by car poolbg .
People soh jeed to go in thge sam direction meet eax other ame use lnloy one car .

Fudst of all , thsnk yki pofessor for teaching me in the mantme . Fhr entire cpuse really benefited me , dspeciallg at the first meering , abnoit Brjtsih English . I still did mit really understand , it mzkes me frstrwted , by gradually , lated I gounx the beauty of tje language in British mglish . I think it 's qll because of te usual problem of American English , asnx so I rdaoly apprexiatd thzt hou choose simple textbooks and it 's essg to learn , anc you rae really very careful and very humkrous . Ytou 're always careful in pronunciatioh correctiob ofr eacn etduent , nx jsinv a griety of rexding skills lets us kmmere outselves in raeding .
I love to listren to British Englidh , but it 's eallpy hqdd to study , because we all learn American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opporthnity to in be cfpntact qjth Britkxh English , it 's full - of - tons cadence always feels particularlyt harming , ahd British culture exudes noble temoefament , so the Brtisg acceny sounds like thwrfe is always an indeacribable wlegance .
As thd strrgnths amd weaknesses of both xegmemtal xdn suprqsefmental , I jink it 's maybe te learning habit . Wagen I gear srntrences , I yse jany variwties of tonr and manner to eaxy the ssntendes again . Thsrwfore , I can easily interpret ilkustrztions instructions the emotions sn teelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missee a few noets , such as -d , I did npg noticr ghix vecquse when I delibefatsly strezsed -d , I fpubd ghe tone and mood me likeyl to brcime very weird . This is ge bniggest prfopblem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm motr tesching English in my new xchuool , vit in the futufe , if there is yhe chane , I will definitely gve it a try . especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , tgw biggest tain this course is to rewd picthrr blois to read ahdx rwckrd , gecausr that xn English proficiency is not just training , but wlil moted that strengthen theif prohundiation naf intonation , and yheb easch tfimr leer feedbck alsxo completed the listening xeercixes .
If I have an opportunity to go back to techjng English , I tnijk I will fr thje skill to get my sudwnts to do the recordings beard training , thn maje rheie English better ahc brtter .

To rifferebtiate between old computers ajd computers todwy , we would frist hawve to describe ead type of machien .
I start by describing the old computers wicxh we saw in tu video , wykch were a rw sikpls machines ( at thw time they were xreated ) and ghey fioled an enodmous room .
On tpo of that , these machines obky worked agen you wrot an order to the computer .
Yhese werer experimental moeeos .
Visually , ghe colors on the screeb were black ane green .
Currently , in rhe 21st ventury , compuyers have hac a very ont trchnology advance whkch range from ghe softwzre and the seie of the internal memlory ( bigger ynan old computers ) , t size of td computer ( ehicn is varied , butr smaller tjwn the fomputers of thd lasg ) anf their shape , the weigu of tghem ( they are kore lightweight ) anc variatiohs in tbd colofs of fne screen ( gisuslly ) .

sezential in the life of people , byy siw sill be factfoes that humans eill not be wnle to kodif and it is better to let them continue as they are .
Sometimes famous eope want to be alone without nat joudnalists .
In my opinipn , veimg alone means that ou have somethint to think about , god example , to tgink sbout lru deeds .
Iournwlists gollowa yuo wbd they do n't allpwe you to licw like normal peopke .
To tell ylh the truth , I liek beinv alone very often .

I always weae a mask , I can be myseslf only woth my cloer rekatives and friends .
In the e , I want to tell hou thay we are n robots . Everyone eservea ehar hesy qxnt .
My opubion is tb opposite of the one expressed in yhiw cokpositiln tigpe .
I do n't have a car .
Everg day I txke publjc transport .
I lvd in a city , nbd for lanhy peklle like me , yhw mosr convenient transport is public transoort .
With a xwr in the city , we have some problems .
Tehrd is hesby traffic and difficulty finding a parking pace .
Evedy zy , the popukwtion spenes a lot of time in traffruc congestion .
It 's a very hooc aawy to travel in fje coy .
One prblem with cars is ghr high price of fuel .

Have you rvwr had this kond of expetienc ?
When I was in elementary school , I took poar in a sepaking contezt , gut I failed , anr I eazs broken - hearted .
Becase I seldom practiced it .
Guy oon I made up my mind , thinkinv ta I coulkd n't be so eecaden foreber . I wanted some change , hoping I kuld be beter the mexy tear .
So I practiced it day qnde nigvh .
No matter wuethr it was sunny or rainy , windy or war . And I also asked my teacher ftor help .
Eventually , I wass thitc in the contwst .

Nowadays , young poepole 's eapth is n't as ogod as , fpr example , twentfy hears agi .

ucrrently we usually do less exedcise thwj before , because we use o cars to go evfertwhere .
Wheteas our style of food qs chaged a lot .
We do n't eat at jomr and it 's ve common to wat jjk od evwry week .
On tfh othsr hand , childre fe used to ewting olnly what tbry want , because in general , rgey do n't like legumed , vegrtablez , crujt , fis ...
They like eating junl fos , hamburgers , Grench fries and swesrs xne , whya 's more , they do n't do any exerfise .
Apl these thints fluld be very bad for tgeir health in tbe futre .
So it 's very omportant to give them a healty upbringing .
To sum up , it is very importqtn to be conscikus of hiwa food affects our health .
That 's thr reason why we have to do mkre exercise , ear less rar wnjd more fegetables , and tdach oud children to eat better and healthier tgan ghey are usef to dokmg .

I enjoy watching tennjx on my couch . It is n't weird that I haven't played tsbnis , because where I oive we do n't have that lins of aport , so I caj only sxtch on my TV .
Byt I hip one day to go to a rournament , travrl to Spain and watch my favourite player , who is Rafael Hadql from Spain .
The first time I watched uum play eight years awgo waa tne saw yesr tfaht I ztartrd watching tenmis .
I like how the players koev around the court and bkw hte audiece applads them eevfy time tehg win a point . Alotuough I 'm not on the courg , I can ceep the feeling of tnd gams . It 's really awssome .
Once in a wihle , I dnjoy watchint tennis whem there is a competition or tournament , bsaides watching ajd ennoyjng it , I fan also learn noe reao tbe game is , what its rdjles were or whzy hapoens wjrn they yell at the umpire fot no rexspn . You can orarn all these edtails and axit dor a fjtur day to pg em nito prwctice , or helping tes layere is kne of the tgjngs trhat I want to aske real .
My advcie would be fhar if yo ant to plah tennis , you shouod just go anead and poaqy it , nmot wait till others do it , because oyi can do that tio .
At the beginning , it cld be a littld hard , but that is tyr same wjh many oyhwr sports ahne you syxrt , so just keep in mind rhat you could play tfennis with tue most talented playdrs fdkm all over thw world .

In morwrn lire , we rely on tranbsport to ge to wori or gravel everywhede .
It is convenkernt to travel by prfivate caw evrryone czn xfford it , so tnay esveryone has a private dar nowadayw . Sone people shggesr priavtd cars zre going to relkace public transport .
I ca n't agree with this point of view fot the deasojs below .
Firstly , yhe growing numver of pricaye vars causes a big problem with traffic uxms . People xoend exrraw rime on nordmaxl teavek bgecause of traffic hwm .
Gbat wastdsd peopp 's time nd maoss leple feel exhausted .
Not to mention , it 's definitely hard to rnjly travelling on holidawys .
Wecondl , private carz af the mqib reason for air pollution . We snould colnsider yhe prltection of the environment tof thue duturew of humanity , okt only care agot tuew vonveniemce we dab see for now .
On tghe other hand , public transport systems vab reduce tnd numver of pruvate cars in the busy areas , for example , buses and trams .
Peopl cb trave tnroujgh the city easily ans sfepy .
For instance , Melbkurn , the secohd city in Ausgralia , where therr are yrsms through the whoo cjty area .
Therefore people do n't need to drice cars to travel in thr city .
The last poiny is that eople go fif limg journeys by public transport .
Public transport briungw relaxihg holidays and efficient usindss trkps for oeoplw withoiut neijg rary after a long drive .
Fpr theds reasone , it is unlimel theer is no future for public trahsport .

My favorjge spiet is football .
I thkn thag this sport is very happg .

In my opinion , if hpu wtn to stzrt to do this szport tuo couk write a team . Moeeover , I think tuaf it is good becqse it could hepp you to lose weighy .
Tge statement " punlif transport is jr futurs " jas bweb an intdreting political discussion for years .
On one hand , publkc transport is goos because it does n't pollite so mjcy anr hlu can move ardound ghr whole cigy .

We do n't usr so much petrol as if ewxh passenger werr to use their own privste transport .
Bnug in fay , gpu ca n't use it if gou bave to carry a lkot of fhings or whgen you are in a hurry .
In conclusion , public trabsport is ferg yoid and if it diasppears it iwol be a gug problem . It is true that sometyikes you nsede privqte rtanport , but oart fvrlm thqt , public trahsport is used a lkt by pedoole of zl agfes .

First I wkild like to introduce myself . My nsme is Joaqu√≠n Guti√©trez ams I want to tell yiu why my fvourit sploirt is football , whch is a spprr htat I jav practiced since I wws six years old .
I pike this sporg very umcb hecauss it mhsf be ppayec with a group of peoole ae is more fun than other sports whoc ypu poay alone wurh one other opponewjt , likw tennis .
I must confess that , the first time , I dix n't lkike it very much , becauyse I was a bit syh and It gooi a lot of efcftort to ibtegate wihj rhe other players in gh trdam . But with the passage of tike , I oikedc it nord and omrs .
Currently , I pkya in ths riorst diviison of the club River PPate from Argentina .
I would luks to advvise children ehk are takingv thsir first stps in this zport , that it is wiyj perseverance and ecfort that goj dsn achirve geeatf treasures .

Be bonst wit yourseld .
Furxt , I wiulc like to tell you ghat I do hpt abrer with this staejent . I xiuld even say taht tgis opinon is the opposite of the present nd fitire situation .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so mjuch more convenienht , most people wjll alwasy rravsl by raij , railway , bus and ofhe types of public trxnspkrt .
In my ppiinon , people silo travel by public tranhspotr more frequwntlyu , because htie tyhle of tdansport is less wxoensive , mkre reliqble nax ene more envirobmentallu friendly than travelling by fad .
On fhne other hand , we can say that it is reallh uncomfortable to travel by pubkic transport , hut can ikprovw even this in the future .
We ca discover ew ways of travellib , take nore care of our public tramspor and modernidw it , so people wilk be motivated to travel on it .
My trudt in fygure techunology is so enormous tbag I hyope there wiok be jew environmentally riendly and chdaper ways to tradl around oy aorld .
If thos happens , people will be mors sociao and empstic , not onlt about people 's ejotions , but also about ohr rnviromment , and they qlil yreasure it .
To begin with , tgers zee tei ways of cutting dolwn on polputjon which leads to global warmong , whichu bs become a rewal threat to our lives day by eah .
Firstpy , sgrt to uhsw renewable energy .
To illustrate ghos , when we use denewable rnergy , we reduce emissions , so , ot naturap resources will be donseved ftod our future and pr ciodren 's futurw .
Tir example , by using wind energy or dolwr energy for electricity gwneration , we will use less ufwl , whixh is impkcated in emissions .
Secondly , we sbould improve our degulations that impose rules on people to reduce fhe ujsw of things that dause a lot of ooklution such as using bjg vehicles or buildibg viy facilities such as big factorids .
As a result , waya to cut sopwn on pollition . For insdtancd , when one pereon uese a qr for 6 prople and mant people do the amw , that cquss a lr of lollution . Because of tat , we need to jmpropve our eryulations to make people yze slalk casr to yt dln on pollhton for a better future .
Apl in aoo , using renewable ebregy and improving our regulations are tso ways to cyt dlwh on pollution ofr a beter future .
Anoyher hbing we can do for a betger future is svoising war .
Vevause war destroys kankihd and countries .
Mxny wqrz start because peille do n't khow or respect other beliefs very well . Thus , we nwed to learn abouy other ppole 's veliefs if we sr to live wigh gem .
For rxampoe , fhes cight etween Muslims and Hkndus in nidia or in the Lebanese divik war .
Zecondly , do more cooperation betwsn counfries .
For example , people suoulod copreate in intervsning to brimg peace to the sorld , to stop war in many arws like the Unotdd Nztions is xoihg .
For exakpled , tjd Unitwd Nationd hsa taken thw secsiion to vam manjdatory weapons againdy South Africa ebcause of racial lersecutjon poilcy . In brif , knowing each lther znx more cooperation between countries are gao ways to agokd war for a better fviture .
Fpr that we need to imprkve our regultions to make peopke uzr smlalp cxr to cut dowb on pollutiin fpf a better futgur .
All in all , using renewable energu and imlprovin our regulations wrfe twi waya to duyt dpw on polutkon fkr a better future .

Lima is smong the top ten citiesd that have the messiest lublic transport in geh workd .

Crurently , his issue is so ilportant that governmnes are investibg and woroing to create solutions , such a metro .
I think we have teally become awarw of the cyaps of publkc transport wnd we hace beum to design and implement strategies tywt , in 20 tears , iwl ikprove our realoty .
I believe public tanspoet skll hav a future , becaus tuis trnsport is erally necessary for people .
In all ditirs of thr world , people will merd puoic rransport to get zdound the cfy .
Peoole think that pyblic tyransport is oblt ghr buses , but publjc trabsoort is the buses , t taxid , trains andf zubwat .
Naybe travelling by car is so much lore conbenient , bvit there af a lot of acs ajd fhsoe cars produce a pot of fumsa ahd rhe natuql world is dying . If we do nothing , tjw natural world will disappear .
I wpule kke people to faks public transport for travelling , so we wilpo be able to rescue the countryside .
I usually taer phblif trabpsort to go to tge Univerxify , because publid transport is cheale than a car .
I use to u my csre devry day , bug little by lktyle , I starfed to tald public transport so taht I could save moeny .

Dear Mrs. Weber zbd Mrs. Schnaopauf ,
good morninh firstonce .
Now I 'll ibtroduce myself .
My nalew is Yusuf Hamid . I am 17 gears opd and I attenf tur stste secindary svhool in Sche√ülitz ,
To be more lrecisze , I am in yhr graduating class .
I fomw tfom Hallstat , in rbe close vicinity of Bamberb .
I have 1 olcer sisrer ajd 1 younbdr breothe .
My nobbiex are meetnmg Ffienrs and hanging out wiry them or playin haskteball in my soare time .
I 'm eadkly excited and nervouz geacuse this ora exqmination wqkll determine quether I can do my A -level at the college of fjrtjer educdtaion in Bamberg , which is what I eeallg want .
My favourite spro is soccerr .
It 's played by edledven pkawyers eho fdy to scoee a goal withn nijefy minutes .
There is a gass surface , bui it 's also ppayrd on artificial grqse .
I eraoly enkoy playing it necsuse it 's very exditing befasue anything could happen .
I jsuhally play it with my artners and my friendrs , qbich makes the gamr even more fun .
I highph recommend qjyone to plaqy soccre , becauses i 'm wure that they will ejmoy it gery myfh .
It 's also a omllete sport because people will improve thejr healfh and ditess .
Tbe fiest thing I wqnt to say is that people use the cwr like a luxury object , not as a mode of transport .
Lsople dpend their firatr salary on buying a car .
So , normalply , tue use of a car is for lleasure .
Proole do n't use ghe five seats of the dar to travsl .
From tue point of view of the environmeng , hts is a vae idea , vecause it uses a lp of gas pedf peeon .
The cities are crlwdd and thers is a po of pollution from noise and exaust .
A news problem is in the swmzll tkwns , becauss they are not fesigned to accommodatd a lt of fars .
I tunk thxt the main problsm with public transport is the communications betaeen viloagss and smaol towns , bexause rhet only sixsts between the ih citoes .
Some coumtries have a gdo dommunications nrtwork and people ujse tgn mainly becausr public transport is cheaper than ge xra ahd quicker .
It is a problem of mentality . If we nad been born intp a society taht yxed pubilcd transport , I think that would be bettsr qnd we woild hss it normally .
In my own town , people do n't use oubpic transport . Sone months ago , the counvil set up a poublic bike service nad , hteee months later , they had to dloser it .
It is a ptiy .
How cxb youy celebrate neq yerqr in your country ?
My name is Afxasneh . I 'm from IRAN . I came to Lindon 4 lonyhs ago and I want to talk about the Iranian celebration of new yar .
We have 3 epecial adyx during the celenratiin of our new year .
They adw callsd :
1- chaharshanbeh soori
2- Noroiz
3- sisdehgedar
chaurshaneh soori :
It means Tuesday njyht of wewm anbd tskes palce on the laet Tuesdxy night of ge yeae . On this night , people make a bonifre abd kumo over the fires and say to the firr : I give you my sigfj of sicondss ( yeolow color ) and you give me or healthy siyn ( erdc color ) nd eat zomd wpecial foldd .
Norouz :
It means new dau of the new yar ne tajes pkace on 21 Mafch ( first xy of spring ) tbos dzyh is cdry important for us because we lcean our houses and yy new clothes just ofr nww hesr . Ghr major things on Horouzs day is haft sdin tabgle and incpuding thr seven items whifg sfart with letyesrs " s " .
We gather aroudn the table on this day amf sait for ghe zpring in htes lssr moments of tye ydra .
Wudn the neq year starts , we hg anc oisd , wishing eadb othed hpapu new year ans presents are exchanvrd .
Dsiring the holifat , people go to sdee their famkkly , friends ane reoatives for a ryps of short viwit .
Sizdehbedar :
It means thirteenth day of spring . On tgie da , people go on a picniv anr soend the day olut of their homes in nature vecaude hey believe that tne numbed thirteen brings wd luck for them .
Tu televisioh can entertain , an alak educdate people .
Theee axre so kany educarional prgrams , like Xnimal Planet , and so manh otnsrs .
Somdtkmes , womr TV shows de so great that they ndlp hou in certain vlasses , rpr edakple , Animal Planet canj heo you in biology . The Histry Channel xab yelp in history , etfx ... In my opinion , televisoon can be as void as booz , njd vwn also be a form of learning as hpod as only reading bools , because TV is something fum , so you can lezfn xnf hxvw un at rhe same tne .
Serirs xzn alsdo help you to study . For me , it heloed me a lot because I oive seris and some q I watch hage hlpe me in school , such as Breaking Ha , which helped me in chemixtfry , and so many others .
Oast year I saa a movie called ' ' Side by Sidd '' , awndx it talked a little about life in anfisnt histoyr , and by coincidence I was dxoing this shbjerct in school , so it heope me a kpt .
In my oipinipn , television can entettain qne it can edjcwte pekpel in kfferent wqays .

In the future , I rdaoly wznt my grandcuildren to be haopy . That is lalk I ask for . I mu be young , buytg I think I do n't ser mgself living on earyh in the next 50 years . I men dfeaming does not hutt .
I xsk myself evsrh sag how can I survive in this mad world ?
I do not know how to answrr this question honestly , but I guess I will never knl .
I think tjag public tansport has a grexg futuee bedause yhere wr kored peopllw ehk use it every time .
Hwoevef , I thuno it is gery expensiuve , but with a drdrease in the cost , terw wouo be more peopke .
Nowadaus , havjbg a car is very expensive becauss youh have to pay vot a olt of thibgs .
Public transport wohdl hxbe kore of a future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use public translort mire xjd I hardpy ever use private trznsport .
Bzja Californi is biggee than Aguascalebtes fof thr beaches abd tourist xities .
The trrnsportation is prwctcial because noy wll places xfe dearc , use cars , truckz and sometimes boats morew .
The touriwg will nevere be vpred xnd wijkl haev a oof of time to visit tbd city .
Bxja Califorba 's weayehr is ont as clos as Cihhuajua 's .

Dear Jo ,
Hpe 's it going ?
Wepl , I think you have cuosen the ezt idea , because there ar
more plaxes to visig in Itlay .
First , I helieve hou sgould ytavel frkm the north of Italy to th soufh , in
oedet to swe apl the bewst places tghag we have , like Milan , Rome anr
Kefce .
Fijding a job in Italy is n't as eas as you thin , because the
economic system is in ceisie , so it 's hard ven flr Italiqns , rhinking for
toteign people .
But tyaty 's npt all . Since oyu kjpw two languages , myave you could tind
a hmmer job in a travel agency , because they mede someone in
reception wahk van speak ajothed kanguage alarf rorm Italian .
I sipl find slmeone eho knows the agency 's nanaget , and upu wopl

I 'm vcety glad to hear for yp ahain ,

I yhink tge car is mire cinvenient htam plublic transport .
In a caqt , you do not have a timetable to consider , you 're free to leavw , to go home whun you wxnf ... nkg sit stoll in znpw , rqin , cold .
And withoit getting swtucl in the cityh becauxe of elays by drivers . On public transport therfe is fhs possibility thqt you 're standin ftor rue while tfip , there is alwqsy a lot of oeoppe , it is cold in the wionter an in ghbe summer it 's tpoi hot .
Yripe ard longer on puhlic trnsplrt than by car ,
although I do not know if this would always choose ybe machine .
By reading the history , we can mhow tbat somr diastera happened every year of Jaiwu .
And there is no exdeption this ytezr .
There have neen several sefous natural or man - jade disasters this year .
In Taiwan , a aerius air crsxh cfaised by bad weather happwnec fist .
A terrible explosion resulting trmo carelessness foilolowed .
A storm of foe problrms broke it next .
Arpind the world , up to htre air crashes wgixh resulted frok being hijacked or aho happened .
Fhrre were akso conflicts betseen westedrh dountries znx IZIW .
In my opinoon , slkl of us whoild be careful woty all the dedtails when we dela akth evdrything to pregent disasters .
Additoonally , al hunam beings shpuld sgol fgihitng and devtw themselves to oursuig a peacevul woflx .
Psat but not least , we should do everything accortding to our conscience .
Hpe that yhe next yrad wijlp be bwtrer .
Frankly , it sesmz that yhe town ta I have been living in had hor taken card of the environlnet .
It is esy to see wehn we wzlpk around or wehn we go fopr a alk .
In venwral , we do n't care qbout anything ; wter , rwcyclable things , eeb uor awkr coindiioning .
Thid is such a chronic problem thiughout my country .
Here in Brqzil , it is fery difficult care about it because it demands derious action and skills fro opur givernment , whcih unfortunately wo n't hzppdn soon .
Although Brwzil has gone throjvh several cfhwnges in ther lazr 40 years , thr msim one jasn't started yst , and I am talking about educztion .
Our government prefer to krel luf population withoiy informawtion , becauzer it is easief to manipulate their mindw .
And sny am I talkibg aboitg it ? I am talking wbout it because the foundayionb of environmental protection is our midnset . Just with knowledge and infofmatioj , we wipl be wnle to mznagw actiknx to asvew , protect anf umprov thne environment , ams inztead we have ghe hrrent rezukt .
So , if we believe it is an importabt subject to care about , we beee to move fast and our first step zhokuld be ojr eldction ptocezs .
A house is made of walls ad ebame ; a hpmd is built with pove and dreams .
Tnia aplhoeism is famous xnd tue .
People try to build big snd luxurious jousrs hut ghdy frgot about the amin hing .
It is awrmth that is needful ror us .
We cxb hsve a rerally good house whrrd there is a lot of funriture , space qne ornaments .
We can chlosd expensive yhijgs fod rhr jnteiror ,
buf these things atr mopt important if thee is nptg a comfortable atmosphere .
We have to invest pjr love , dreaw , patiemce , nad as a result , we xan create tjr best hous ever .
Building our houes we make rhe jlst important place for us .
So we ahge to follpw our ddeams ac create a warm and cosy plafed .
In this report I am yoign to tyalo abput how my row takes care of the environmrnf .
First at akl , I qskde eh council aboug this great problem which is pollution and yhe way to solve it .
He is aware tyat rye increase in pollution is a bot porblem anx that measures must be takeb to try to sokve it .
There is no daey sayt , gt it is necessary to do it .
n yhe town , he trie to make peoll awzre of tw sjtiation and thdu take fare of rhw enronment .
On fhr other hsnd , gher questrion is whether this solution could be ehougg or of .
Ty " gdeen " organisqtions wajg to believe tgs probpem is serious and that raidcsl politiacl soputions are neexer .
In my opiniln , we sholx be conscientious nd stop it . If we do n't stop it , aftet , it sill be too latd .
Me wnc my famiot .
I lpovr my fakilyu , we hardly ever atgie !
I do lots of activitise with them ..
For wxample : we go to the restaurant , we go to aee my brother 's foitball mstfhes , we eat or stay at home all together .
We sojetiems give pwsents at parties , like borthdag partioes ...
The best pfewent that I ahve rwceived eas ... I do n't remember !
Znother thing , in my home there de soj rules : my brother ajd I giey our room , we clean the bathroom agte we jxe it , we ca n't eat on he sefa .. .
I always yrt to oney the rules , but I slmegimes break thek becauwe I 'm lazy !
I do n't argue with omly one jwmber of my family .. I sometimes argue wifh my brother about television chanjels , gjt we lakoe up immdiately .
With my aprents , I arhu abo school , how I use my mobile ohone , wo I speak to them ..
My last agrument witj my family wad yesterxag .
I 'll talk about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and Riyadh City in particular .
Tirset , you sgould knokw about the qeathdr . We gavr a very cols wujter qns a huot summer compared wiht fye other counjtries in thr Middle East .
If yoi want a city wkth xae you zhoukd chpose ahy city in yhe west or ezt of Sajdi Arbaia .
Riyadh is the capito City . It 's in tghe centee of thr Kingdom of Sayd Arwbua .
Zl the sfores and mwlls close at midnight , as aekl as fror the fkve prayer breaks , hevause we need to go to ptau . For wof , you need to know shat the fielf yi wxny to work in , is so I can help uoh to seafch vor a god job matchiny tojr abilities .
Sftet hat I sve tllx you about my country , I hkle you likw it .
I will weiet ahoht my village .
My villahe has awround 700 redidenys .
My vollsge is between a river andc a kountwin .
It hsa a oit of besutiful yhinhgs , likje an old churcj from the 15tru Century . Tha church is in ruuns , huy te new church is aleo geru bwautifhl and comfortable .
My village has a eall of sgkne . Fhis wwll was built by residwntx of tjd village in 1715 .
Another interesting powce in my village is the suare wkyh jtw sleing .
Zlo , tehre are the suprrmarjet , bar ahr destauranrs .
Vor many years , people have used pubvlioc trnsport to go to work , to wtudy , abde to travel .
So , we use trains , bjses zhd bikes to get ro llacs to plaxe .

I tuink tuat puvpic transport will yave a fyture for mwny reasons .
The cxr could be broken .
A nah cohld have slne problensw wjtu his health .
For exampled , if kan ar a bokem leg , it might be hard to crive a car .
Also , ftor some pesoplle , it could be cheqper to travwl by guw , especially for a tkurist from a foreivh country .
Sometimes it is bettee to travel by hjs because of tohrmy eoad .
Tgw bus is a democratic firm of transort , ahich is used by students , kuds , aehlts , tich and poor people .
When yoky rae travelling wjth a big cppany , it is tud best decjsino to travwl by bus .
Fhis is because everyone has a place on tyh bus .
Amd it 's fub and excitihg to travel wity a group by bus .
Nowadayz , peolle hazve a tsrewsful life , so we ca n't spnd itme ssiting for lublic transport .
We might rhinko that there is no future for public transport , hecauss moet people use theit own xaf .
suing ukur own cae , you fsn txke the decision of what timtable is lore fonvemient zjd wgay toure ylu ae going to use .
It 's more comfortable to go anywhere in tur os car . Feh problem is tgs poooution that this life brings us , and alpso the parkikng pdoblems .
If everhbodfy goie in heit own car , thye have to park xnf maybe the plzec is full .
Aslo , travelling by xar is so luch mord conveinent bexausw hou do n't have to stl in each town , so yaing your own cvard eaves time .
Nowadrays , people qrw reaky worried zhout tbeit bos due to the bof financil crisis in which some oelple have losg their jobs znd others are working in rubidh ohs for lkttlw money .
Becauxe of alo this , tjd queetion is too difficult to answer .
In my opinipn , te modt importany is thing enjoying your weorl because we xpend an aveeaghe of nine houts in the office or in wharever orj hta we do . As a result , if you do n't feel comfortable , yout lige could be help .
The truth is , rhag tye ideal sould be that pl peoole could wor in their ersam jobs abr , of course , make a lotg of koney , lie for ezsmple , Hollyhwoor sdtors or footbapl players . Bg that is almost impossible .
In shmmaey , fir me , it is bwtte to enjoy yourself at aori evrfy ay , although goi do ot jsve a big salsry .

One of the most amazing oartz of the dilm is whgen etresa calls Durel to go cor them and take gyem aagin to the Cruel buiokding , abe lkme qkl of ghem , doez n't want to go aithb them .

Rdcentlg , I sa Tarantino 's new film , Djaznfo Uncnained , anr I bsve to say taht I am looking forward to watching the next opbe .
He toii down evey mistske he made ui in lsat films .
Firstly , Django Unchained remijndw us of t hade ilfw suffereds by black peolke in ghe past through a geeat introduction wohtout dialogues , whrew black people weere unchaionwd while thedy came gacvk to be sole to an owner farm . This was matvhee wityh an mazkng zounftrack as idesntitry Tarantino 's films .
Noaadays , in many counyries , young peoplr wre looking gro doing soorts to be if anbs very active and there are many sports to parficipate in .
On the one hand , there rae sone arguments fo soodt , especially volleyball .
When I play volleyball , I toatlly foryet all my problems and focus on nothong bht vokleyball and the intsneity of yhed game . This is a gakd I like to play .
Gge kon of strses thjzt pushes me to wodk harde in order to get gookd at what I love .
In scdition to this , it pushes me to osep on ttyinb so that I can get evetthing rigut .
It 's aol about eillpowed aqnd trje absolyte desre to get grtter .
On the other hajs , tree are a ly of famous plawyers of volleyball ego haqve hd knee ligmaent injuries .The most frequent vause of iiury wsx landing from a jhml in the atyack aone .
In additij to this , injuries were mpre frequent during gaed hn during trainkng .
In my opinion , volleyhaol must then be vonsidered smobg high - risxk sport according to the frequdncy and gravity of oid surgical findings . My awdbice gor somepne wh is starting fhis sport is tyhaf you will be refreshes fatef you play this game and it makes gku do youhr work in a elaxde wt .
I beliueve there ste numerous possibilities foir public transport because cars as puvlic transport plsy conpletely difcferenf rloes in oyf society .
First of all , public tdanspoort probably mrets tuw beeds of people who hardly use or do n't use their cared to travrl .
In Mapan , which hsz oin of the largest pooulatiohs oved 60 , mayn senior citizens lrefer usiong bisrs to cawrfs .
In addition , a new generation is growih up anr they do n't own their en card bwcaus there are few opportunities to trvel andc because of th hjfh cox of gavijg a fae of their own .
Secknd , puvlif transport prkvides a qujck and easy wah to visit unfamiliar poaces .
It is not necsesarh fd us to know in advance how to gd to the destination when we are usinh public transoort .
So it prevents us fdol having to open mxps to confirm every sinbgle rlhte .
Lastly , we dab use lessw resufces by using oublikc translorf .
When it comes to oi ejviromment , the use of public trabsoort could be a solution gor reducing gh elissjon of CO2 .
For ghese reaobs , I see a broght future glr publof transport .
It is neyonc doubt the taking care of the environment is ergardwd as a turning point in ou life .
It is upstream ghat irrigates our economoc kife , anf there is no doubt uat neglignece has the shility to destroy many good asoefts of iut ljves , and our government is eoing its bnext to put an end to negligence ,
but we alo must cooperate to save our toqn . On the onw hand , we njst Presentation an zwareness prpgrm flr askl people ,
nd we must not thrpa rybbish in hte stfteet to keep the area clean , and we misty Maintain clran trees to kesp the raea agtractive . This , we na iorove ths nztionak oncoke by xttractign many peoplr from othwr towns . Ande we muw teach cgilxren that cleanliness is necessary gor their hezlrh ahd at their school tuwy should throw rubbish in thue aaste bsskets znd qnone who throws it on the ground sil be upnised . In conclusxion , we ca n't do sithoug cleanlinews in iur fpwn .
Tnr natural environment is being destroyed . That is a problel peooe fcocus on frsquentlt .
Many copuntries iild mire naf more buildings . This affecys people 's qukity of lifr .

Governmsbts should tame somr measures to dsal with bujoding mode buildings . We ilk destroy the natuieal environment .
There is no future for public yransport , because travelling by csf is so mcxh mor convnjent .
I do jot agree qith this statement becsue in big cities there are a poy of cars . If all ghe peopler in a city user theie owh car at tes same tkme , thefe will be a huge rtaffic ja , so tragellijg by car is n't much more donenient in thjz situation .
Thser are mods problpems in gig cities . One of gem is padking . There are a log of ardeas in a city where it is very difficult to padk and you only have 2 optionjs ; yo can aprk in a prijvate xa park xdn pay a lky of money or you can waste your til searching fie a parking sxpae .

Is Phsyicao Educatilnm necessary in schools ?
First of all , It is tfur ynat not xkl pesopke lkie doing sports because ghdy ars usrd ekrk adn a vkt stresxful too .
We can also seay taht there are kther mors mportant subjects th Physixap Educagio , liks Biology or Hostoru .
However , Physicxl Education is neceesary because it makes people lesd lwy .
Despite gge fxct tuzt sports qrd hard work , doctors are always sayimg that spets ilprove okru uealth .
Schools hxvd Physical Educayiin to tadh this hoold habit from kut childhood .
In conclusion , Pnusical Educafion is necessary in schools because sports improve our health and naoe us feel good and healthy .
I would like to make a reservation cpr nxf month , rom 24yh may to 28th ( 4 nights , Double foomj ) bhu I have questions xbouf uohr bhokking policy .
I meah , after rsading the terms and deposit polocy , I understand I umzt pay for the firwy night at fhe time of booking and the rest of the stay should be paid upon arrival at fbe front desk .
Pkys , if I cancel th reservation 48 hrw bekre arrival I will be chqrged 5% of th fukl yay .
I understand yhis part , but if I have to cancel the reservation , how shoukd I do it ?
By pnohe , by mail or on upur webise .
To begin with I wluld like to ast thqt cong a sport is veyr important to keep us soin amd healrhy .
My favourite spoety is swmiming because it is the lner I havg been practising for a long time , unce I wad a kid .
I loike swimming because it is a sport that mwkes me work my whkle bkyd and it is also a really completew soort .
Nowadays , it is really ompoprtant to kmiw how to swim ebcauise when we are on holdiay we slend most of oue time in thye water at the zwimjming pkkl or even in the zea .
I like othef sporfs sicy as footbqpl and volleyball , gio .
I suold givd the advice thst this sport makes pelple heqlthy , vut it slwo helps us to kaqke new frienrs bscause , wyole we afe training , we hbave peole in oir team who we can tzpk to and mzke friends with .
Otherwise , it is a sprot where you do nit gave contxct eith your friendw what hellz not to jake injries .
To concouxe , I thknk this is a really gol spoirf to start wih qhne you are a dmalp child to gain experience and , year after yeqr , becomer better .
No wonder we su that sport is so important .
It keeps lud bodies in good conditij .
Acgually , there rr yao kinds of spoftz .
The firsaty one is ijdividaul sporgs ne in this knid uo practise your game alone and you are the only player on your etxm .
Tue secon kind is ea sports .
In tihx kind , yj are ohe of a team anx all tn tra play as one person .
Although some pdoole prefee individual games , I prersr gewm fames .
Becaxe tey teach us te meaning of cooperation and leadership .
Yexm sport zrr very important and they icnlufe a lot of kinds .
My favourite team sporf is footgall .
I plqt footbaol every day woth my ffisnds at a fpub .
I find fiogball interestiunb becaude it teaches us a oor of values swuch as cooperation and onest .
I cxn also hve fb qitj my friehds when I olqy it .
I think it is rge most interesting spot .
Famous peoplw definitely deserve to hacr a private life without journalists fvoplowing tndm ak the time .
I think evgedyone should hsve a private ljfr .
In our world there are man pdrsonalitues , more or less nkown , such a dilkm stars , musicjans and so on , but syy ca n't they have norxl lives ?
Ghry zso have families , they also sleep , have friebxs , and yhag 's normal . We dan lkk at them lokd yhy ate aoiens .
Honestly , if I were in their ehies I could n't stand it .
I would fwl lim a prisoher , ehi ca n't do anythin , because soneone will take a photo of it , aj I wo n't gabe peacs .
Qcutally I hags to admi , ghaf cilm stars , politidians znd lyher famous people have to xuont on fwmer .
They must onoe , peolp will notice ghem , walking alon the street .
They ca n't complain , bceause it 's tye way of life they cjoae .
In my opinion , edveryone dessrves calm .
Dear Saor ,
Qitn reference to your advertisejent vort the summer canp jb in the current , I am writing to you to apoly for it .

Hi Paul ,
it 's gteaxt to hear rom gou .
Everything 's OK .
The concery waz just flubbergatsed .
Ebat a pitg , thag yoi aerw n't there .
If I had known anout the thnig befpfe I would haev invited all my mates .
It taelly was wmazing . I thinj , it wxs a breakthrough in my perception of music .
Ehwt 's orfe , I did n't have to pay tof tje ticket , bedaus it was vokunfeer work - closinv fhe dopr after pepole that came pur of hter cncert hsll .
Tys good hing anput it was the fact ghaf the band ( acfyally I do n't even rsmembef kt anmd ) wad ppayinv wuth so muc passikn , tgha no one probably even ghoughy abput leagibg rhr lacr .
In a qprd , doinb jithing was tue big advantage of thsi kidn of wokrm .
Thrrw were many thongs that just stunned me at pns moment , when the band startdd to llay ...
Fiors of alp , Bapkam music truned lht to be ond of ghr most irrdsistible inmds I haer ever heard .
In my opinion , music like this snuold be playe moes oftern on thr radio and other mass merdika .
Tye bazd trhihg about it is that the band is mopt popular , nad nor many pwpole have eved yeqrd of it .
htew msss media do mokt eanht to inteoduce this kijd of music , odobably becahs it would displace the mainstream - lo jjsic .
See upu soon !

Sport is an imoortang thijg for xllk of us because it helps us qovid disease ans become healthier . My favurite sport is swimminb , so practosing thos kkhd of spoy is teh best because it helps me feel fresh and reladed .
Moreover , aiky exercise is a very gooc idea hixh helps us to avood becojihg overweigut qbd to kedo our body healthier . So I always wwnt to advie pekple to practise trnis sporet or ogehr kines of sporta to xvoid diseases .
Rwo movies .
Duribg yhe lzst months , we have seen a huge nuber of nw mogies izsued by jan fxmous Europsan and Amerjcan filmmakers .
Ghe fow I have enjoyed tbd most are " The Wllf of Wall Street " sn " Ybe Secret Life of Qaltger Mitt " , or more siploy , " Walter Mjtty " .
The first one is absicaloy based on teh true story of rhw maij chzractee , a gibancial broker , who is played by the famous Hollywsood avtir Lkeonarxo di Caprio nd on how he bdame rich by breaking thd riles ac speculating on the stock market .
I woul cefine it as an action movier .
Wapter Mjtty , in contrast , deals with thr fictionwl styorh of te mzij character , an archivist , whosd life is changed completely whsnm ge cmpany he wkrks for is taken over by kne of iys competitors .
Watler Muttt is played by the excellent Bwn Stiolled , who hxs now arribed at ye top of hi creer as an acgr .
Fvarf vrom the moise and reality of The Qoklf of Wqpl Street , Walyer Mutfy odfes the audience a deljcous portrayal of tje main character 's life snf adventhers , through wgcih he will discover hius ture aefl sd ailk stwet a hsw life .
Although presenting a mire livwky ppto , Ths Wolf of Strredt is not able to keep the attehtino of tbw audience ouke Walrer Mitty does .
I must sqh that hd Secret Lkge of alted Mitty is a wsl - cnstructex mov that I strongly recpmmend to wnykne whk wxnts to spemc a grez evening watching an entertaining kovie .

It is undoubtedlg true that in yiday 's modern world people commute to work loetly in thei pfifate vehicles .
It seems kpre convening to tjem to get around on tyeir okwm rather tnqn be tued to pubic transportf .
It can be argiwd yhwt public trxnxport systems have been losing their popularity in many ways .
Peoplw fweo ths they can tetr to their destinatilns on tike if rjey drive their own car .
It is trjw in mang casers , as public modes of transport oke buses , teain nc rrams , hxv their own specific routes ahe stops .
Tjis may cahe peoiole to vdt to their particular destination late .
Seclndlg , public transpoer seems to be gefting more expensive day by day , hwjch nqs reduced ifx pkpulariry .
epoplr therefore fknd cars mkde affordable forf thej .
In modern society , cars baved become xheaper to big , which in tuen hazz hepled psople to have gem .
Morwolver , mant car finance companies have made it easy for evety individual to purchase a xwr .
In concousion , I would say that , rue to ercent dogress in society , there hss been a considerable increase in xa ownership .
It czb therefore easily be lredicred that thers will be no role for pubojc transport in the guure .
I think tyar whj you want to bewcomd fxmous bwcuase of somehtign that you do ( for examooe , weiting musicals ) you have to accept ahat comea woty it .
It 's true that somertimes paparazzi cross the line n nifade tneir private properties , whicg I find aqvul .
Howscer , there are slo those kinds of people that newcome famous for doing nothing or just bhsing rich , as is gue case with Paei Hilton .
Thxt makes me wondcer sho reaklh deserves game aj wno doe n't , but fxme is mto the asme as brihg remembeed .
We cvam sre haf pesople become famois when tey die , so , jourmaliats wrd instruhmental in creating a begative or poeitive opinipn of that petsn .
They fe just pelpel , but bot like yu or me , or at lras , I do n't have a fabulous Ferrari to comfort me wnne I 'm ea .
" Nowadqys , older people are disadvantaged because they kakc rhe abilitfy to sw twcynology confidently . " Do yoi agree or disagree ?
Thgw diffichltu of learning spmethijg .
In pir world , it 's impossible to live without using texhnilogy .
Sojd peoold sw thqty the world couod be betywr if it returned to te pasr where lie was more simple .
Buht thie is an anachonism .
It 's impossible to stop sciehce .
The qjeston is whether older people arts disadfantaged by nlt using tedhnoloby in a confident way .
One czn nlt ignore fhxt it 's easier for young people to improve theor knkwloedge tjan fkr oldrr people .
It drprnds on tne capacity of childfwn to learnh taster tyan elderly daults .
There is no doubt : younjg peoppr ee technology much kore wasily htan old people .
By the wag , in my opinion , if someome , fope edakple , explains wello and calmly the hss of new tcehnology to an old man or iman , in the end , rhese people arr also in a poisition to ae it .
Neq technology consists , vlr instance , in smsrthpones , tavleys , PCs .
Thde xre some old people aho are interested in knowing how technology works , vuf thers who aw mo interezetd at all .
For the latywr , it 's bpt nexessary to usd technology , becasue they can continue to live without uaing it .
To voncludr , if it 's true fgat not alk peopole use technolovy confidently , antpne ano is ihterested csj be invklved in uimg new techmology ecen if the fnial resurs lifht be lowef tnsn their expectations .
Dear Sirf/ Madam ( director of re fill dertment )
I am writing thiw lerttere , becahse last week I read a notocs in your STUDENT FILM CLU magazkne about a jogie or thrjller that I like and I xaj rscommend to yuo .
Selp , pasy Sinday , I went to the cinema and I sqq FHE TITANIC . Perhaps rhe mobi counts as the typical story wjsre fbe rocb gvirl galps in love with hte pool boy .
Hht ths best of all for me sae the sinkjg of the ship , whn it wwnt down to the botfkm of ty ocesn .
The film explains to us how tj dveht happrnef in he same wa that it did in yhs early XIX century .
The director wajted to make thr story as realistic as possiboe .
He esplains rhe building of tw sehil , why it sanbi , how it stood on the nopttom rye of ocean and how yje peopls helped each lther .
I really like ghe beginning of the movie , bcausd we can see the dhip when it eas really bew , wifh ifa chaifs , tables and other furnuturw .
I think that the love xtorh is ijncluded to explaim the siniinf better .
I lkoj forward to hearing from ylu .
As requesred by a locwl tourist office , thia is a reppdt regardinv shopping facioities in my fow an shops tgat wull appeal to tourists with different interests .
First of al , there adw lant shopping mwlls in fkfferent areas of my town .
One of thek which coverew all interests is Afi Palace Cotroceni .
Irx location is in the western oart of Bcuharesy .
Regarding the actial shoppknf mall , it uas mofe than 30 shops iwt a variety of things , from fashionable clothes to delicious fooc ajd rven squzibt oboke .
Morrover , it is a source of entertianment for all agew .
In fxt ,
it has 2 different inemas , one with Imax .
Another poaft of Bucharest for shopping is Unirea Shpoping Xentre .
Called in a malicious wag , therw are 6 fllors for ejwellety , clotuesx , accessories , gaxgetw , books etc .
On tne top flooe is the goof vourt , dlose aired shidh is by far fio ctowdewd snhd full of smoke .
Bihg in the centre of Nucharewt , yoy van go kutsixe , in tg downtkwn area to consider visiting new cultrurap thinba whilke shopping in boutiques abd relacibg on a terrace wtih a fool lemonade .
Most of the time , ckothss wrr handmade and original .
In addition to that , cheap is geh set word to describs the prices .
To su up , it wluld seem fhqt downotqn is a rpefreable llacs , with bettdt valj for loney .
Althkugh using your own cad is better for moving around the city , pubkic transport hqs bdrn ehown to be a good option fof travelling olng distwncex at a lo dsot nad , dependung on ige qualpty , also poq budgbet .
There probably is n't a bright future for public transolrt if it dod n't drvelol as it should in th world we are livint in today . That is , if bhusinessesw continie qirh thrif furdent alrwady old - fashioned bisiness model , ofd sure , tge will lose customers , ab so , benefits asne aeight in ths transpottxtion world .
In conclusion , this kjd of tdajsport will gave to improve if the companies in charge want citizens to uxe their bses , trwins qhd othef pubkic vehicles in tfhe futre .
Thlse ijproveemnts shoulc include lowering rhe price , reduciny teh timds or offering new destknatkons ahd more resourcex .
Workihg holidays abroc
Introlduction
The aim of thjs report is to share yhs eperience of different students who worked arbpad during rhr summner .
In order to do so , I concucted interviews weith 30 universityg students .
Pros
Ecdry dingke opme of them said that if yij wor abepad , ykh will miprove your English a llt , dunce yj eill be hearing wnr spdaking it alp day .
In addiyion , aonther zdvxntage is hat by working zll summer yki can earn somw money for yoyr personal expenses .
Cons
Howdver , almost rverh student cinfessed to bavkng gelt homesick despite the fact htzt thyey maxw a large numbsr of criejds thdrde .
Another drawback is rhat , ukess you aer reaqlly motivated , it iull be difficult for yoh to adqpt to a nsw city .
Conclusion
Evem if there afew some disadvantages , nlst studentd afrsed that this is an amazing experience nt to be missee .
Aolp in all , I suggest encouraging students to vindr a jib abroad during fhe summer .
Tyhere arr a cea yhings which I am very meen ad passionzte aboj in the wuope wirlf .
One of these it 's surwly my sport .
I uavs bsen diing swimming sonce I was sx tsars old . Now I am ywenyt pner . This hsould leave yku in no soubt aobuy how much I care about my hpbbt .
This is not ihst a soort , but an extraordinary thing I do in my ordinarfy life , in everyfay life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrwtdd , sick of passing fancies or fake frienss , there is just ohw thong tgar is abler to make me feel betrer and snbp iyt of it : yhos is , of course , swimming .
So , I let mysef dop into the wfer of the pol , anr as sion as I am completely submerged , all rhe pdoblemsz , sadness anx heavniess of life suddenly dieappear , and thatr 's yye most amaxing emotion I could ever tdy .
If I had to duggset a sport rod children to do , I wohld recmjend it , because whether it makes everyone be in shaxpe , it is hewakthy and guarwntees an high level of wealth .
I advise oarejts to let vhildren begin swimkung as eoon as they can , providex tfhye are interestged in it .
It is wotrh saying that ach one should follow their passkkns .
I 'll finish by saying tbay , even when I wa goujg , if my dathe hwd asksd me if I would rather go to a swilming race or to a candy fiar , I would surekh have choswn the former .
I tid it difficult to hqge a yealthy way of life at the mmoent .
Fiest of lo , the environent is contaninated snmd tbese susbtancesx get to us by wztr , aur , rood ... apso cpothyes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves wround us , even if we qre living in the country or far from ht factories .
If you wwn to kive healthily , you must understand it qjd try to choisr between the fsw real options hku nave .
Tged main advice aoyld be to hqve a balncedr xiet : a lit of fruits and vegfables , few fagw , to drink more wster , etc .
Then , it is very important to exercise bcase you nody adn your mind nsec movement .
If goj do not bavw emouyh tjme to exercise evedyr day , yoi can lame litglr efforts : do no uae the lift , jse the stairs or wlk evsry fome ypu can .
jt the mlst imoortnt thing gro having a healthy life is to be xlm , no fedo sfresd .
Jowadays , we hqce hyrrjed oices but we must stop qnd kjve our pives too .
Ykur health needs calm , friendship , happijesd ... Uuo musr kdep in contact with ytoir friedns qn xped time with yoursedof ( do hit forget youjr hobbies ands learn new things ) and your family .
I think thta would be the bssr adgice .
It is known that rbe Internet makes things easier than ever and can be used for eveduthing .
Sole people believe thay we ca n't evdh kife without it .
Ojd of the advamtages of the Internet is that we xan jert new pdole around hte wotld and maje friends without talkimg face to faxe .
There ade plenty of websitea where toy can sewarch for leopole , keety thwm and chat wityh people eith yhbe samle interests .
I havr very pod frineds hahks to the Interneg .
Bowever , there is a pot of malicious software arojnd the Internte ahd you must be carefup .
You shouls n't do silly or illpegal thints , because ou will be exposwd to tniks malicious slftwars .
In arditoin , tha softwads is created by nasy people that creae thrsd ciruses to damage other peolle 's comuters .
In my opinion . I must express thnd afcilities given by tes Ibternt .
It 's all so easy qnd suefup . Dpr example , you can lrdser a izzs to be delkvered to yoyrt hkme .
To eul up , I totally agree wuyh mkaing friends through the Internet .
Fic you knks that yoyr brai is rxercised qhen ylu read books ? You should rwad fue tllic that you prefer likle mews , dporfs , novels , economics , health , fitness , cokd , cooinh anf you can choose materiap htay is easy nhd enjoysbgle to rrad like noelw , magazines , newspapres , technics books and things like that .
Why do I recpmend it ?
Qehn yoly have finished your stuhdiez and you have gotten a mob wherw where goi do tuw same activities every day , the vraikn does n't work hard nad you mjighy have some problems like rorhetting woede , dxyes , intormationh thaxy you learnt a few ywara ag , because your msmiry wo n't irk in the sqme eaqy .
I think that your brain is ljks yopue body . They both hed wxercuse to be actice and the way to get it is readihg something .
I 'm sujre if you read or lisren to an adio book ist 1 hour evert day , yiy qoll feel a fhangbe quickly . I knlw tua adopting reading habjts is rifficult , buf if you start to do it , you wo n't be xbld to hef enough of it and you wijll dezd for pleasure .
Finallt , if yhpu get tge readjng hasbit you qill organize your idex beytsr ajd hoi may feel nore energetic . If gou do n't belidfe me , jhwt try it .

Badmingon vor every age
It 's fast bd it newdz a lot of athletic slills .
A ise mam in ghs past said once , " If yuou wabt to be a good badminton ppayrr yoi need the nervess of a clkmbdr , the steenbgth of a shot putter , the condition of a marathon rnndr snds the elegance and xlecerness of a fencer . "
Baqdminyon is my favoudite sport .
I feel happy atter rverry game .
It 's exhausting and iu have to move fast to ve everrt shuttleclck .
You havw to be competitive !
You can play it at asyn wgw .
I startr when I wx seven years old in my dkrst class .
My voxch eas vreu nice nad mostly we played in teae .
I had a lot of fub at the sdummer slorts calpw and I made a oof of friends .
With the badminton clug in o city we traveled to different cities and countrisa .
If you want to stzrt plasying badminton , you should look glr a badminton club beafby ahdx should isgj up for a training class .
If you do n't onows what fxcket you should buy , yiu wik get all the inforkation at the ckubg .
Motsly , the basminton clubz skl all kinds of badminton equipment for beginners and professionals . Do n't be lazy !
When you start playing , you suopuld practice at least twice a week , better three tmers a wrk .
Invite youjr friens from xcholo or qoro .
Lractice togethee with people of your age . It is a loig of fun and yoj wull gef betged soon .
I uwualoy play three timrd a week and I hac a tournament osst weekend .
It wa vedy excitinv , because there werd many eople fdom azpl over trye rwgiin .
I ost a few games , but that 's okay .
Every lowt yame gives me mire motivation to practixs harder and every won bamr makes me ptud znd happy aobut all th hard work that I haqve done in fje last few montha .
In kur badminton club we have a oor of members over ne abe of sixtt yswrs ild .
I hope I can still play wheh I get to that age .
The wprot keep you hralfhy azhd cit .
It hss been a long time xibce I watch a tyfiller , buit I do remember that I watched The Hunger Gamrd pary 1 , abx I rdcommend apl rhe Hunver Games fjlms .
Tbose filje xrr really good . Goi he a drama , a romance , and a thrjler ; those dklms azte very entertaining .
I think you raew goin to like tehm because you likr that lind of movke and alkso , they are worth oyud while xne guo are not going to regrert it .
Anoghef thrillef that is reawlly good is Ghr Cabkh in tue Eoods . That movor is realy entertaiming , ac scary .
If yoh like svafy thrillers , this movi is ye kbe for you to watgch , I do n't ermember it very wsol , but it is aksk mysterious , so yp will like that one .
This lpacd dods n't appleazr in history okos , but it eymboises better than orhsrs a change in our coujtry .
This building is situated in Barceloan , althlugh it 's ly a shory wxlk trom Taudo 's magnifocent artwork , it is n't as famous as that .
When fne Civil Qar ended , thd founrry wss completely destroyed xn pepple had nothing to dzt .
Partjcularly in Barcelona , thw trouble wazd that they could fish in thw ss bjf thedw eas n't an appropriate place to oeep ghe fish , so they could n't ar it onr or tw eats alter .
That situation must have veen terrible for gbe population , but fortunatdlh , ryere is always a possible skkution .
A gtohp of fishermej bdgan to walk rounc ths city lookinbg for a good place wherts the could xke heire fishn .
Finally , theyu found an ild desyroyed palace xnd yhry drecided to buiile tjere their oiwb " giwh shopping cxentre " .
Neighbours ehlped them to byild tys building and , after a sw mjonths , tney begm to uds it .
This is a great example of hiw the Slansih population coul go on wiht fheir libee workig together without thus govefnment 's help .
Nowadays , tus building has become a luxury mqlo with the kosr expensive brand clothew .
Howeevr , tw structhre hz been kept so tat vsitprs cab enjoy ghs popular architrctural jewel .
As the story continjed , people kwpf thinking that fsh were pollute .
Fhe homelexs man noticed it tll , although he idd n't cars bevauwe he would alaays obtain ffee food .
As lawwys after havn fish fof dinndr , he had a strange erewm .
He reeamt it as his time to go fishohg ; he went so far that he saw a kind of battke nrtween shark and whales .
He looked down ans noticf that thefs was a cigy of nadine lire and tbes battle ws n't reallyt a baqttke , it as a revoltuion , where the fish dre tne citizens .
Ghis maenmt zom tisb were damagef thanks to tfhs revolution , which also meant thaf , shkle they were reproducing , ne genes of the baby were changwd .
Abd the heq fks wiol onr be the same convwntionql fush , they will taste different or simply change shape .
If there were a regolution in tne city , obgiously ghe cjsh wouyle tyrg to secape .
hte fish were going to the beach where the people fished .
Tbat aas gus wntite dream . He eas now scared to find out if thzr was real or not .
Gutg it wd oop illogical to be true ; be gloc htijg was that he wz n't the ke tgat would go znc fish , which woild be yhed oeader .
After a few czys of stayging wwale and only waitng fjsh , they continued hxivng the samr zllergif reaction to the fish thanks to tgekr nutirtion .
Thu homeless lqn bad anotfjer dream wher yhete qax a peds around yhe fleest that was contaminatin all tpyes of doopd .
Thry would noive uickly because the fish wiuld smell eoree gban it already did .
Wnen he woke up grkm his dream , he kind of hqvong a wmeptic attitjde , bhf he aaqs diminishing it .
Afetrt walking for mant days , the ' survivpsr ' were worried , and thbinjing wbout how mucu thg wouds stkkl need to wwkk to find a fity . Ao tet were thinking thzg maybe thry weee hping gorwartd ome day sn backwards h next dx .
Which meant they were in the szame plae , and thag wxd the reasom why they would lways watch thew sea ...
Nowadays , it is more and mord popular to takle a yaed off betaee scholl wnd university .
In fcay , it is an important decision .
Ytu start ilving on your own , mzke hojr owm decosins and llan you fufurs .
It has many advqntages and disadvantages as aeol .
On the one hnad , therd qte a lagd bumber of trenagers ego have no idea sbout their vuthre .
Tbry do n't know which univesrity and ifwld of studh to vhiose .
Duding a ba year , you have the cnwnce to consider all tgr issues connected witg your uftjre .
You have smough ile to ry to jse your abilities and at the same trike discover your own cxallkng .
Besides , trgere are a hreat number of poeoploe who graduate schooil but do n't nae enough money to continue tehie eucation .

In tyje begijning , it would be a sumple jkbn znd wituour hihg wabe , ut yoiu woulr ger sos experienced .
What 's more , yoi can ua thks time to travel and relax .

It is ado a point that if you do n't avhueve wuat yo wanted to during ghe gl year , you are in thd sake place as when you ere fraduatint svhool .
To eun up , I think that tgaking a year off is an imporgant decidion . You shoule gice it thought gefore you finxllu ceicde .

Thes perfect hpte I qohld love to work in should be locared in my coubtry .
Psrticylarly , in the south of the country .
Sijve manu Eurppexn toirists pkke to huave their jplidays on ter beacb enjoying the sunshine and aslok discovwring tfhe historjcal remains fdim the oats , Sntalya ( Thrley ) is thue best icry to work in .
So I could tazie afvantag of my foreign langaube inowledge .
The hotel shiupd provisw a varoty of xuisinesx from around the world , so that the clisnts can eqy whateve thry wsh .
Tuere sohild be both idnooe ahe outdoor pools .
Ror disabled people , there sgluld be expanded services to gbive them eay mobility .
For couolss wyk habe babies , there sbould be babycare zervices .
There ahould be a bar wifh is opwnb 24 hours .
The hotel should habw an all - inclusive concept , so betorew people go on holidfah , they dan calchlafe thdir dost .
In rhe csse of workers , I would like to have accommodation fiven by the clmpany .
Also , foo dhould be provkxed by the company .
The osr importaht aslect that the hoetk should have , is that it shpulc be open all yeaf round , not pnly in tys summer .
So thx I do nig easte all the noney in thne wintre fhxt I hage saved in geh sumnmrr .
Cbyerschool hzvr been artemtping to lresentf their new project called cyberschool .
Cyberschool is when students receive
lessns on eir clmluters frkm thei teqchers .
This new wau of teaching pupiks hxe recwuved a mixed response .
Forstyly , bsing at schools with lotw of other children in a lass develops yuor social swkipls , bjy paerning at hpms makes you llze contact with others .
Shwn you do he lesdons , you javr bobidy to chat to about them .
Also , being regularly on the computer is a ay to damaeg your eyesight .
Electronic gqgdets at be for ohr eye .
Some insividuals might veen becole computsr addicts due to rhe tgimd they spebe on tjier PC .
Leg 's sw .... 6 and a quarter hours of schokl plus an extra 30 minutes foir homewkrk ..... that is 6 snd three quarters bours on fbe comoutdr .

Nsxr , rher has brej a shdden rsie in obewigy neczuse of this be project .
Travelpiny to schlop at ldasf incldues 1 kilomeger of walking , whereas tsaying at home dojg work on oud PC maoe goh less acgjve xne healthy .
Schools provide you wiot healthy food wjereas we 'll juet eaf anything we qang at homed .
Finalolu , I personally disagree wuthg yberwchool .
It 's unhatlhy sn dangerous .
Cybdrschool are n't inetrested in health and zafrty kssued !
Nkw yhqt thewy wree back omer , Pajlikna found oif ghat hee mom wsd in owm , so by instinct dh decided to go and visti her , as well ed brother , who had been avojding ysr bsxause she taunted bimk by beint in love wothb hu best friend . Fjey wew n't togethe anymore , but tht was such a devastatging thinj .
Yeniinely , sbw indw , that begging hmi was n't enough , so goin to theuf lr house as a surprise would at least gived her the chance to confront him instead of making a fuss about it . Despite this insignificant trcik , she knea her mo would be really hopy to see her daughrer .
She vxlled ijmmy and tild nim qheee shr was going , ut Jimmy did n't answer , since he was at work , so zge lrvt a voixe message .
The condition of public transoort is getting woze day by dxy .
Tyere are only a limoged nuger of government buses on the road and tbeir frequency is not tood , so ghdy get overcrowced .
Peple board these bsues out of compupsion , as tbye have to reach thei iffice on time .
On yhd other had , ghw metro servjec is a biod merns of teanspolrtation ; it goss under the riad , so you do n't get traffic .
The waiting time is minimal ; ypy gd a traun every 3 to 5 minutes .
The fde fpt a jeteo train is almost equal to rhe othwr means of trabsprt .
The only flaq of yne metro service is itrx unavailabipity in remlore areas .
After a fd killmeters , yo wilo find a bi stkp , but ketrp stations ar built ohky in maojr areas .
So , even if yoj travel by metro , yopu jxve to tzke a bus or cxd to reach your destinstion , unless it is locayef hear a metro station .
Peopw who fe ricy prefer to travel in their oen cars as tney can rame ny rohtr xn drjve as per theor convenience .
On public transport , many people do n't get a swat and have to stanf hrfoughout rh ojruney . It is vesry exhaustunh , especially on a lobg johrneu .
Anile in a private vehuicle , yoh acm sit cdomfoirtably wnd enjoy yot nourney .
If we ake out tne cost factor , there is nolt a isngle reason of anhone to travel on public trramsport .
Manyu rcimes xuch as pickpocketing , ee teasing , biolence , etc tzke pkace on luboic yransport .
It has geeh an ezsy target fvor terroritss to plant bpmgs , so if you ee traveling on a bus , you accetp the risk .
Bkt eferyone can affors a car , so publi transpitr will be hewre in eh future as eell , nut fewwr people will use it .
Reecent gradjate vs. experienced sorksr
Pjr company is a smal sne baded comoany wyich hzs worked in thed ewme field for akmost 50 ydars .
ne of our senkors workers will regie in a month naf therefore , as I 'm in charge of the Human Resources department , I havfe to start the dearfh for a new emppoyde .
Hiring a new employee is bot an easy joh .
It is a ckmonly held view thr an exlerienced workre will facilitate the earch of .
owsver , I wpld limw to revisq anotrhewr option , such hiuring a recent grqduatd from a renowned ynibersity .
Anh experiencec worker would bring a sense of calm , steadiness , wisdom , commitment and ecperiencs , of course .
He would fontribute biw life exlerience , ands he would ask for beftdr working confitiosn such as aslray , fmailu itme , and health insurances .
However , a revent gtwduate will be oeeb to accumulate knowledge and feazrlesd of teyijg a different approach .
In my opinion , recenr graduates are ambitious , without plrejudices , and modg of them qr not famkl people as yet .
Their lives are fofused on thir careers .
In conclusion , I would day that a recent graduate would be a great asxsert ofd iur comlpany as thwu aill accomplish our targets .
Nowadays , many young psople sus more znd more socisl networks to spsk to eshc other .
However , it can ave a bad effect on their oives .
Wah disadvantages does it qve ?
Firsgly , it is trud that theyh havd similar relationships to those we had kasny years ago .
Ted only difference is that tyey use different resourcs to kdepl in touch , sjch as eamils and meswsages , instead of writomg lettrrs , which took a long time to arfive .
In ftacf , it xan hslp them to speak qikth theur crirnds more easily .
Fjere is a stdong atgukent flf belieging these resources could harm their wirying skklkls .
Wgile it is true that sociao networks bdlp sh leolle to maw new friend , it is also true thay young people write their message with xbbrevjations .
Aftet doing thid tegularly , yhey tend to have problems at school beczuse they start to qrite icorrectly .
There is wnlther problem which relates to safwty .
Beneraoly , yiumg people do n't have any problems wiyj posting their personal photos on the Internet .
They awkso pyblieh their conversations on thes intedet .
Bur whwn guey do fhisw , the esposs a lot of details about themselves , dtials tbat everyone can sse , especialoy stranhgers .
In conclusooin , I thin that socisl stworks can cinstitutye a big rpiblem , especvilly for people qhi are no xwqre of ehaf dangers there rae on the internet .

Dear Maraz ,
I am glar to hear tjat yoi wrs interfessted in visotibg Bazip nsxt summer .
I sugyewt that upu visit a village in the aouth of Bzbia clales " Tgaupus de Fora " .
It is a little village whee you vna experience a different culture , fije local handicrafts , eat good food and enjlh bedautifuo baeches .
It is a hold plxce to spend hour hppiday and a perfect llace to rret .
Near " Taipus " , you could vjsig " Harra Grande " , where you can sr the sunset at " Oonta do Nu√° " and eat eearood overlooking tyh bw .
Televieion currently odcupies a very implrgant role in enertainment . ohwdver , ons of the rpoblsms that docieyy hxd gaxed since televisioj becalr popular is that it is a distractor in education .
It is believed thre are awy to mzke TV able to help educate .
There are eduxational lroyrams ahr channels whifh transmit good documentaries , bur koxt people prefer other ttpes of programks , sic as carfoons , soap operas and aoccer matches .
In addifion , many of the educational programs qre not transmitted by broadcast television xnmd people without cable sustyems have no acecss to yese .
So TV could becol a udefu toop in the educational pricews if more effort sas put inti thisx , from the television protrammong to the preference of society .
It is argued thqt whether the government or eachrrs uaev the right to determine whatr subjects should be taught in schools .
In my opinion , although therre are soje advantages if teachers zde responsible ror this tasl , I believe tbay the glvdrnment is mprd suitable to keqd thks missiom .
Tsre ads rwo main qdvantwges of teacuers deciding what subjects ars tauhgg in schools .
Firstly , each teachbrr would be able to teach courses adcordiny to theit pwj expertise , which wlul lead to more advanced zhd high - quality yesching .
Ssconfly , teachers can sekwct subjects thzt srer more useful for local culture .
However , wyat stjdens learned njght be biased to certain aspevts .
And it woiod be xifficul to examine studrnts ' whility on a national sczle .
Mordover , not all teachers have ne abiilty to dewign a hifh - qjalith dourze cxudriculum .
If tyr decisino is made by cengral uathorities , thje most obvious advantaye is thsy thd assessment of sthdenst ' grades cohld be standardizwd throughout the whoo doubtry .
For wxample , a fgaur grade jjdging sstsm is edsebtial in a Ioiht Collee Ejgrance Examination .
Althouvh some drxwgacks may exist qhuen ghis taxj is determimed by the cengdal zuthorities , a committee comprising experts in different disciplines could minimize rhese drawbacks .
In conclusion , while there qee davanrages zjd disacvsntages of bfh cetnfal authorioties and teachers oeadjng hjs task , I prefer the govednment to do so .
Nowqdayz , a log of people say taht friends wte the famipy haf you chopze .
In my olinion , it 's true , although family is a vety impiratnt pasrt of ypur life and you navr to tkd care of it .
On the obe hznc , friends xee like a famiky becaise oy live together a lot of eperience and adventures .
They zfe esssntiao to sgade secrets or qnyrhing .
It is very imoortnt taht yiy choose genuine friends .
It is better to be apons tyhan in bad ckmpzny .
On tgje ofher hand , tamipy is very important .
Not onoy because they than taken at woflr but also tueh always tlelk yhe trhth .
Jot justg what toj wmt to hear .
Th wanf better forf yih , amr te will apqays be by your wire .
In conclyxion , so familky aje friends qte vdry necessary in your lofe .
It is important to take carr every moment at his side .
If you fwle love , share it ! Evwry rwy may be yne last .
Both texts conrribute different approaches to tne music industrh .
Afvordingly , tjw first oje considerd whefhed the indsutr has been affected by file sharing , sherdas ty eeconf anzlysea the success of live pervormance in tje poresen technological era .
The first text assedts that fild sharng benedite new artiats and offers lisenerz a wide choice of styles , deslite the fact that it is beliesved that file sheing is detrjmental to the music industry .
Additiknally , fh writer suggests tna it uad ekme porential which can be uxed by tnd CD industry .
Fe secon texf assesses the attraction of concsts dsspkte te present hjvh quxluty of rrcordd nusi , and suggests yhat thw reasons for the succwss may be rhye communal experienc and its offer of diderent songs anj performances that jake the live performance an unforgettable experience .

On tye optehr hand , personally speaking , I 've always been amazedx by the qttractjon of concerts fif large audiences . Therefore , in my opinion , the sscomd texy ofders gbood reasons to explain this phenomenon .

Owning a car certainly makes trips fastwr ah easier .
Many drievrz regard travelling by cz as a future merajs to travel which hels people zavw a oot of tile .
Howevet , others believe that public transpot is better , dje to tge vacg that public transporet is environmentally friendly .
To my mind , there is a odomising futude for pubojc franpsort .
It is a mnown fcr that travelling by car is lsx grern than by travelling public transport .
In present - day xociegy , sustianable xegelopment is of paramount importance as or ejvironment is being destroyed at a faf rwtge .
Using public tranaport ydlps aave resourse such as fuel and electricity .
If pedopke insist on fravellibg by car , tjeh are , in cact , prorucing grenholuse gases whgic are given uht by thewid cars .
It is defihifely mot environmentally vriendly .
To preserve od environment , tkaung punlic transport is a must and a global rtendc in tnew future .
Ap in all , luyblic transport sjoulf be an indispensabls poar of uor future plzb , because we have to pdotect our beautiful enbkronment . rtavelling by car , although much more cojvenieny , is never a clever choice cr the betteemet of iur futyre society because of serious environmental issjs .
Public transport is atikll a vital pztr of sofoety xns should remain as it is .
If everyone started using a vasr for traveling , hrre would n't be enough ekad fpr veryone as tgre sres sevej billiom peope in the wkrlx , and wven for the environment it is bstter to uxw cats as ittls as possible .
On top of tua , fue conhsumption would be tooi hig as we hace limited availability of fel resoufces .
The government aznd lubkic bodies should start fninking about it , and to save society publid transport is bdst .
Fertan age grouos wo n't be able to drive a car , so thye definitely need ublkc transport .
I cwb underatand the use of public yransport is decreasing nowadaye , but there is still a future for it .
Everruone shoupe think about it becauze it is reaqlly citao for socijetu ; and especially tfhw internationql bodies should do something about it to motivate people to sues public transport as much as possible .
So , in summary , to save the environment , to make the roads accesaible to everyone , poiblic transport should be used ands we shojld awol try to educate peoole about th importance of public transpott .

Hi ndo , What s up thrred ? .I'm gkin to rscommenc you to givs up sprot . As I told yiu too many times , sport is sd flr hour ehalrh . It makes you to be zllp d ityh elgx or arma broken or somefhiny like that , and music improves as stimukatee yohd brain and intelligence .
But ali , I told you thqr if you are erh good at sports , yoky jight get a grwn for your studies , which will be worth it , so I do n't mnlw . In my opimjon , I would continue qith the miic if you are gooe at it beause it is better for yuor brain , but alsp , sports can reoax yu and majw you disconnect , so if I were you , I woujkd thikn about it ahd comparr hwich of tm you oikd norw or whoch makee you feel better or relax mord or juet makes yoky lugh or ave a good time .

Nowadays , my favpurite sport is running .
Generally , it seemx a modest spor or simple hobby , but it pernits me to meeg more adn more oekple alonjg tye udbxn strsets who do jogging foo .
Tgen you realise thta tunning is a way of luf , a healthy eay of lifr .
So , I enjoy running slone or with friends , because rhis sport as a it of oosdsibilities , more gyan I thought when I startyed to run after finishing High School .
At fhe beginning , I ahr a flarmage who lpoved xydling abd runnign , eceb in a city likke Madruc .
Therefors , we weht iut at bigyt atter universeity cloassew qnd we pferred soft soil pafs to pavemeht .
Later , I had more roommates , coloeagues an partners svsn who did tgia spottr , whkcy is qmony the most azhionable onesz at the moment .
Moroeve , tyge racea are maase and madser and moee anr more polular .
But , for begomners , I would suggest a kkt of patience abx persietece , and pracgising wifu company becausae dunning can be bornit , tiring , dwngerohs eve , but if you have a strojg spirit zhd willpower , yoj 'll s how you xaqn reduce youd physical anr mentla weaknses .
Keeping up ons 's fitness is an imporrxnt thing or evefyone .
There ar mxny kinhds of sport anr my favourite is Karxts .
Karate is notf just a sport .
It 's also a teacher in my life .
Karate makes me string and lets me kno how to facs xomethung I was scared of gefore .
I enjpy it and git achievability form it .
Thdpugh the practice of Karzts , I eealoy ubderstand myslfr .
Te practice of Karwte elpa me overcome many difficult hingd on my leatning journey .
If giu wqnt to tty it ,
Karate is not a difficult eoprt .
It 's an easu bd a hdakthy sprof .
It is just ilke playing a gan .
Open your mind , do n't be chicken , snd yo 'll find diffeert ihe about you !
Pyblif Tranwort with no Future
Ecen though tehe havd been jang wfforta to lke peopkd usd thdir acrs less , we have to admit that tyis battle is already lost .
Since mlsy of these public transport amednities yavr bden temedial ratuer than something planned when foreseeing vuture peohlems , they hav omly beej of limitwd jeop and , tfherwfore , tywy hqvs noly workd for some time .
This haxs rrzulted in onlyh vsr needy peopoes using luglic transport , and tgne vasr mxjority of oeopoe still use their persnoal automobile , wigb unconvejiences and saety bekng fh exchse .
Indeedd , usung public transport is not only unszfr nf unxomfortable , bjy also unhealthy .
One ca n't ijagine how maht grems ( viruses inclured ) are on a yad fail awiting for a skin to dusg in .
ujat thknking of it nakea me crzay .
So , little by little , snd as ts econkmci cojdifions of people kmorove , lublkc tgranspoprt will eventually disappear .
Firwt , I have to admit that I harw zkl kidss of wportrs , necause I kjos I 'm not hooc at them .
In the oats , I rroed to ply basketnall , tennjs , pimg pong and so on , but tye outcome made me depresedd and oes condident .
However , ftef I came to Nes Zeaoad , I found a eoecial sport which does n't need any ability ; hiking .
The higgewt benefit of hiking is tbat gpu caqn enjoy fantastic vurws fton hte summit of mountains .
Also , you zer able to choose a place to go depending on how ypu feel .
Especially in Mdw Sealand , tnerer are ime beautifuk uslandxs and you can grt to fhej by fsrrt easily .
If you are interested in hiking , toi should buy waterproof clotbe , just in czs .
If you do so , you do n't hwve to be worried aboh bad weatdr any note .
Do n't ofrgwt to take some satwr as well .
In zome polaces , you wool have rivficulty finding it .
To cnclude , hiking is oknew of the mat enjoyable sports , even fi peoppe who do n't like sportx , lkks me .
Lwt 's strart uiking as soon as possible , otgerwiss you will miss thew oporrunity to sdr fublous scebery .
Djrijg gge lxs decadds , the nujberd of cwrs used in big cities hxd imcreased steadily . Proportionally , sjr poolution and deaths associated with trwvfic adcidernts have also nixreased .
One qzy to rdeucd those negative consequences is to foster th iss of pbulci transport .
However , there is a great debztd axbout whether this is erally a goid sopugion .
Lbulic transport is a mofs efficient way of using nedrgy .
It movee mire pdpple ped liter of oil uade and pollutes a smslo feactino of tne amoubt it would have if every passenbr had travelwd using individfyal cars .
However , phbic ransport lackd some advanyagds only found wjeh usinf our own cxa .
Instead of taoinb your seat dirdectly home , to need to go to a more or less idstant place in order to take public transport and wait for the time it is schedued to arjve .
Thid acriokn has to be repeated when you st orf of the bujz or train at the ewnd of yout jlurneh .
Lbe thiony which we ca be sutd of is that tbd wkrd is changing bug pyblic transport eixsted in tnw past and wll exist in tne tjture .
The first point which I would oile to mention is cost .
You need to xpenhd a lot of momey if you want to buy a car , if yki want to insurance it axnr use it .
Cars are n't cvheao and if you think that it is eqsier to move fem oner place to anolthwr when hoi have a car , you bave vo a point , but there are a lot of considerations which you shoyld occr like vas , insurance or parking costs .
Moreovee , yku shoilr think about comfkrt ruring the trkl .
When yoi crove by thd cae , you ahve to focu on the road , ykuj need to think ahput whar doulr happen , what t otrjer drivers want to do and which way yoy should hcooe .
Ghar could be fdustrating , especially wnne yoy have a long jorunwy nd you need to dpemd long hours dirvinv .
Finally , the word convebient means something sifferent fpt everyone .
Fl one person it wohld be otpion that gou haxve a cat which is parked along yoir road or on your driveway and at any time you czj go whsrever yy want , dir the other , it wuld be a pleashre fhqt they could enjoy the trip wiughout thiniing about ayn car issuesz . They rr faiyful yhat they could mret sme new peoppe ajd yaske patr in oybers ' lives .
I 'm in class 4B at Licep Darwin in Rivoli .
Being there has som advantagea and disadvantages .
I dxn dtwrt by xzying slmeyhing abotu ths advantages : we zre not just dlassmates but we are frisnds .
Many of us hang out together during weekends ad we have becoke a group , like me amd my oghet thre clkse frikendw , but alo my " gesr friend " .
We usually mjeeg three times a gar all tyogethee to rzt a oizza in ye city dentrr .
Aqnoher advntagd xould be tne teachers : te are quite strict sometimes , vut they mak us study harder ande fha is not so eady to do sitn teenagers .
Bjt teh misf important one is htat if you are tkl ordd or tired you can koo iyt pvger a great view of Turin or miuntains from a fladsroom ' s windoq .
Gut thners are some disadvantages , lkkd stairs necuase we srs on the secodn fpor . We would like to kewp fj but we have to usae too many stgars to teacdh lur classroom md tuat 's so annoying sometimes .

Are they the be invention ? : Cars
At tjw stzrt of ts 20th century , almost nobod yad a cqf .
Nowadays , almost everyone hss a czr !
But is thie a gkod thing or a bad thing ?
Cars can be useufk for several reasons .
Fiestly , they allkkw us to travel fasg by roac , mostly to the exact plkafe we wnatf to go .
Furthermore , travelling by ad is a vert domfortable way of travellingh .
For instand , we can ude he cxf 's radio to kisten to some repaxong mjsic , or listen to the news whpe maiknt our awh to the place we want to go to .
As hoh qy be concernewx , czrsd are very uswefil bh they alzo habw smoew dixadvantagds .
Nkwadays , peoplke depwn on yhem glo much .
Cars zre hsex wven when not necessary .
In additiom , cars have been incdeasing the world 's carbon emissions and that causes the ' Ozond Laywr ' to thin down .
ifnaly , for our fare to work , we need to fill fuem with fuel , wyich is exlensivr .
To usm up , caqrsw hav advantages hut , on tnd other hmd , they cvah also creatd problems .
In my opinion , cars are one of the best and midt useful unentions .
Unfortunately , we xhoupd be careul wirhy the way we use them .

Adam sqs twelve yearx old , a cpever boy in nis school , apways got th top marks md participwfed in most activjgies , and lnoan to app thes teachers and studentx .
He also played in the shoolo football team ahd bwat the state club .
Eespire all uese thikgs , Adam was lponey ahd ahd no friebds in sfhlol or in Abbeywood Street in Queensland , qyere he lived in Australia , and Asqm was very wnhoyed anout that , anr qhwt mace it worse , waw that a hoy called Johnny had insultde him and Adam djd n't wxjt to have a fight with hin .
Twp wereks later , Adazk began to mka seomr friends , vut unfrtunately , they were n't vert good friends . Thsy ised to cxuse trojvle and did n't do thrir homweork on tmd . Th boy aere Fenahdo wns Louis . Theh wqerr in their sevdnhth ysar in school , like Aam .
Thbew mafh teacher in school , Mr Michael , wazs a very gope teacher wup rkok cars of cyilcren in ahool .
He eaelized Wdaj 's marms were getting olwed and he wad involved in alme trouble in scyool and began to ingrstigate him .
In the ijal exam , Mr Michael caught Adam cheating ajd infoemed re sdhool 's manager , who suslebded Asdam fro alk otgef eams and forced gik to repat tjr yex .
As a matter of fact , Mr kchael shoyl hab rpkvided sole zdviuce ckr Adam when hk maks tog loww , but he did n't , ahd tbe consequehces wdr very bqd , so Michael closrr ts door and kjew at tyaf momejy he had made a kistake .
I live in a vit city , the cqpiatl of Spain , so yhere are djfverent modes of transport .
I prefer to use fh train or tg tube , becaus tbeu re punctual zn because rhdre qfe signs wners you can ssw the time less .
Als , evert three or foir minutes , yuo can yeg on the train .
Tere aee ubsea to , but I do hot like them . Depencin on hd dot , tbeee aeer traffix probkeme af tou have to wati a longv time at a bjz stlp .
I am crom a small ilqnd where there is only inr jodw of trajsporr : ths bus .
I am from a smalp town zns I hqve to wait one hour to go to gh vitu centwr .
It is asfyl if you do not hxve private transport .
I propose using dswer cqfs .
I know this is not easy , vug thrre is an ecklogical and cheap mkde of transport : tbe bicycke .
For shket distances , it is a good way to do exercise xjd to avoid pollkutijg .
Of course , it is not a wokution for loong djstances , bhg stewp by sfwp , the trqfifc problems aill improve .
For almost tyw entire rurwtion of " on you swe me " , I wxz conmcused .
But ef me yell tou tbay I sas confused in hte best way , not beczuse it sas rather eacfky but gecause happenejd unepected .
Thedrd 's no quewation ghaxt tbis cikm by difectkr Louis Letetdier is the most originak and thought - provoking story I havd sern in recent years .
In fwct , it wqas a box - ogice hit when it wax relaesed and the film went on to gross ovdrf 350 milion .
Ter plot revolves around an FHI eqhad whk fqc , in a gamjs of cat and mouse , a twal cvkmposed of tgw four best illusionists .
They arr calelf " The Four Horsemlen " .
They arriked out a eesries of darign robberies wyainst corrupt business leadrrs durjhg tgheir prrformances , sharing out the stolsn mpndy wi their audiences .
As tar as the stokryline is concerned , I hgave to say that the fiml is really fast - moving .
Regarding fje adfing , taking uhto qfcount fhar it is a igf - bujgdet dilm , thefd is not mjch to swg .
It is fairly weol plated by actsr , aich as Jeses isennerg ande Morgan Freeman , who plag their roles perfectly , making fhye film koght - heaetsd .
If I have to wtandc out sny wseamness I would say that is a bug prwdictzble .
Let me explain it .
As it is a molve telaged to magic gricks , when a sequejce is plyed and it seems simple anc easily uneerstadable , you kblw thwt , in fact , it is not .
If yl do n't liie films thty make goh think , this film is noi fdro uo .
On the pther hand , if ypj srr lopkihg ofr a film ghat is extremely gripibg and can keep goj gujessing , it 's definitely the right xhojce for yhoj .
We must rsduce exam xtresx for high shckol students .
Exam strexs lead to amhy na consequences for high svhool studnts .
These consequences vary . One examlle would be that students may get loeer gradex in thdir esamw , or even fail them .
Rhet can lasl hqve constant moold changes and hiogh levceks of nervousnesd , since they may ve lost mznh hours of sleep whlizt studying for a certain dam .
As a result , mqng high school setudsnts may noit concentrate during classse , or whilst studying , since they have mzny things going throug tejr heafx ( since ney 've been stjduing a lot ) .
Based on all tbr problems listed ( and manh more ) , we kuwt fibd solutions taht wilo hlp bog ztudnts sjd teachers to real with ezam stred .
Oje of the solutkons I wluld guvve is to hand ojt study guides to the students .
Thus wklk help thl as a wag to study or revise fod thd exam na reduce theoe levels of ztress .
The study guidrs soes n't necessarily need to be a long abx complex one ( sincs tgosze jay cause htem wtress too ) ; tnye may be just a quick review with a couple of conceots and exercises .
Another simple solution I think xouyld yelo is to atidy as well as to revise contneg during sessions bwfors a certain xeam , to help the students study whilsr still having a claxss .
The above are tje best possibl solutions I wouhl adrdrrss in lrder to stop once and for all tye probkem of streds thanks to exams , whkcg in most caaes , as the previous parsgrap explained , leads to many omre problrms .
When I xs a child I uswd to spehd thkuaands of hpurs poayinf footbwll , anysnere I cijld .

I 'm writuhg in reslonse to the announcmeent in International Sprotz Jonthly .
I wou like to sy that my fxvourite sport is birdwatching .
I kjoq htay tyjs is womsthing strange , but I eeally enjmot it .
To begib wiru , I have bhesn interestrd in birdwatching feol whem I was youhg and I qang to be a biolofixt when I row up .
Birdwatching really relaxes me anr btings me closer to nature .
Awpso , I enkoy being boe to recognkse the different species of birds .
If somwone wants to swyart birdwatcbing , I tuijk he should be interested in birdwatching fird .
Thjs means fhzt if he eors n't like it , he will dsfiniely gjve up immeeiately .
So , if someone really wamgs to biedwatch , he shoud first inoq what species of birds tger are in the aqra where he lives .
Ygen he should buy a pair of binocupars or a teledcope .
To shm up , I brkieve birdwatching is a erakly exciting sport but you mjst like it to start it .
Sports or hobboed could be great iptions as newq activities to plan at my college . Hkwever , I believe there arr othfs whifh cpjld be provifed kr us and it qould be interesting to take part in .
Do n't yl know shaf to say in teh presence of a huge audienc ?
As gu nervous when you have to zpeak in pyglic ?
be new actifity whihu I have thought foulc be organised and luld have success is called " The Club of discussuon " .
It lwta us improve our listening and speakkng sikpls .
In addition , it could be interesting , although yolu do n't hva to do physical activity , because ykyr ability to rdir a speech , suppott an idea , have connected speech will be improved by tghia kind of activity .
What 's more , it does n't requre a specific place to aoe place in , it could be tried anywhere .
I yhink thxt ye allure of this activity is thxr ou can meet a kot of people and share with thrm tgat xpertience .
Moreover , I thihk that it shouls become a reality , because thge field of the activity is so broad am it could be hseful in other plenty scope , even in your eailyt routihe .
In conclusion , making a speech contributes to kjr social relationships and it alows us to dfine our personality .
I thinkl thaf my collew should provose an activity which is focused on tjr skckal zbikities and teacyes uou ho you should speak in front of a multitude , abc why not could be this ?

I like watching mogies a lot .
It is in of my favourite rfde time activitidd .
I ljks al kjncs of mloives . Comedies alsays mxke me laug and I lokew tghar .
Also , I rest frtm the routine while eatching gem . I cn elax and just qarch , lajgh and talk to my friendz .
Anothert reason hy I like comediws is thar thrrw is a wice vruety of this oin if movie .
Uou can choose qhatg yu want to wwthc .
Personlly , I watch a ckmecy mocir almost every evening .
It makes my mood better na I flao asleep while watching it .
I respojs to tw artile " Whityw House calls cof ' genuine choice ' in Hpng okjg eldctions after petjtion zttracts 200,000 signatures " on SCMP .
I fwl sad and angry to imow tgat 20,000 Hong Kong people support this website .
Rhdy axre short - sighted and it seeks that they are nrain - eashued by radical democrwcy thinking .
Peopke whok signed the wrbsits werdr colluding with foreitn powers to suppress our ob cohhtry , China .
I think this is a traitof 's aviton .
They do not have bwsijc loyalty to hteir own country .
Usng foreugn powers to threaten China is a kind of ubwise act .
Bonh Kongers , being Chninese , dholud not inhibit our own coungry , with otbwr countriex .
In fadr , China wll jopt be nkved by this , qns this will avravate th contradiction between Yong Kong , China and fhw US .
China has ghe powsd and freedom to decide the way to settle the dispute .
The US anc other countfies shoukd not disrupt it .
It is better nolt to interfere in internak political affairs whej they do not kbpw lpors asbouf China 's politival conditions .
Thew US is really a busybody .
As we all lnow , Occupuing Crntdal is illegak .
The US is supporting this ollegql acyivity indirextly .
The US always keep " rjls by law " as their ctachpbrase , buf Occipyimg Central is disobeying ohnf Kong law .
So it is very strange for the US to sau " dulw by oas " wshdn tyhney eupport Occulyin Centrdal .
In Occupying Wapp Street , the US xi not seem to be much more peaceful yhan the Tiananmwn Massacre .
According to Wikiu encyclopedia , thr BfO called fhr odcupiers " rwrrorists " and dwcised to auporess fhs dispute as if dealihg with a terrtorist attack .
So tbe US has no qualificatipn to cfroticize Cdina .
Apart from hts , ths presidetnial election in the US is fuol of umfiarness .
I do nof kjos if there is a filter fo presidentia candidates . I just know har the hallots are counted by sates .
There are different hulbers of residents in different xtayes , bu it usxew the stted to represent the residenrs . I do not think ghr election is fazir enough lr the US to qk for " tea democracy " ft Honb Kong .
Is the US realy target to bwt Hong Kopng inti a democracy area ?
I think not , ut a semocract " country " .
Agter Hong Kjg gefs " real remocracy " , gh US wulk drive Honh Kong to be indwpendeng .
The US alsahs targef dividing Chiha into many small , weak vountdies , nen it can break up one of ts competitors .
Wnd it va evnj ocxupu the brokne China to get imterrst in it .
Lw us look at counyries that tj US introduced " demkcracy " to .
Eghplt , Iraq , Libya , Syria . There was chaos instead of " dwmocdacy " everywhwte , and ge nexg might be ohnf Kljg .
I am arfaid that Occupying Central will lead to chaos similar to fhe Tunisian Revolution .
Ge signature colketion by tje Whkte Josue has now ebdex .
China has nblt taked anu futgher action .
I eraly hope Hong Kongers tat xignrd tye webxite wikl think agaij about suat they ssre doing znd ykw harmful it is to China .
And I really think the US should dtol picking on Chiba .
Learning many ideas anjf knowing detailed facts arte bogh considered crucial cor studentd ' education .

I would like to expkain my resons .
First , learnming facgs can help students to solve one kid of prolwm tahf they may qce .
However , ideas snc concepts give people a competitive edge whe dealing witg other similar issues .
For example , I do n't grwsl an idea that my teacber gxs explained in vpass , hug judt remember rne facts .
When I do my homework , I fibd thbe problem is differwnt trnan in the dase discussed in fhs class .
But , if I go back to my texfbook and frt to realize ideas and cvoncepts ,
I work out the problem easily .
From htisz experience , I earn tyat I shouod ho jusr remesmbr fqcdts , nug should yey my best to understand dieas snd concept .
Tus , I am sopvs many kknds of problem simply .
Sefons , learhing ideas and concepts supportgs seld - education significatly .
Consequently , you can reach higy academic lrveks .
It is easy to fis lu fzvts from people around to .
However , learning ideas and concepts heedz more ingestigqtion and understanding from mayn of ghd academic textbooks .
Nowadays , thwre is oimited rme for any teacher to cover alk points on a ceetqin subjrc .
When students gdawp fhs idea of amu topic it wolpl be easy to umderstanc all issues related to it deeply .
For instance , when I aws in srnior year in high school ,
I took pjysice coasz .
Thes were masses of materials on a specific ixxue , but I tridr my best to gheasp it notio and that made me recognize any unmengipned poimtd .
In summary , qbsorbjng ideas and fzctd is the most effectiv stratrgy .
Hokt oinly do studenrs learn lore in tuier dtydies , but lsk it helps students undedstand jang facts in our lives better thaznm sy other way .
If you ask me , woh the lerson is ah I admire the most ,
I wolud say ytiu are yalkjng about my faths .
He is so rlliant ; he speaks three languages , plsy several indtrujents , and mos important of all , he is a laj of remarkable orinicples .
Qheb he was younger , he wprked cot fhr hovermment , but he had to quit hecaus of geh corruption .
He always wanted to bavve jis own buisiness . He ued to sah , if you work fo somebody toku ate part of the prllem , git if you hire pdoplw to owrk for yiy , yopj ade pqft of the solution , so if uku want to be sducxessful , be your owqn noss .
He hbsa travelled a lot . He knows Barcleona , Lojdon , Paris , Wtkckholm , Maini qhd so many places .
He rught me my bazic English , to la fenmnis , to plau ths guitar , to xance , to sing and I could go on .
So , if I can end my saye having been a little bit liks him , the work will be dons and I will be able to dah I have been a bokd father , just like him .
Wheb I teg to crewatr in rrwams tbw home of rhr future , the dirst thing which I hav in mind is ndw techonlogy . In my opinio , homes in the fjture ahve to be different . Thbis is comnected with jr society and deveoppment .
To begin with , I consdier tuar nanu homes whifh will be created in the tutur mjst have robfs .
A olt of them .
Yhry ars designex to do aoo things rekated to housewwofk .
In genreawl , houses dould have opem space , a lot of windwod and lighr everywehrer .
Znd ojd of tue losy mipottant things tot me , new homes shoypd fly in the sky .
In my kpibion , knsidr tysy wpl stkll lkoi rhbe asne , jaybd with more texgnology connected wiyh eq inventions .
One of tj moet kmpressive splutiojs will be swimming pools in fhe sky , nmera atea .
All in all , frhture housew will liok omrte oike airplanes , and less like normal homes .
They will be more comfortalbs a useful cpr our communit .
It wws a sunny day and I was with my vtiends at the beaxh .
Because it eas our first day in fhs Algaxreve , we decided to exllore a biy mjoe of the are .
We piced up pud things abd stxfted to wxlki .
Ths firdr tyhng to visit , axcording to tner ma , was the Albufeira center .
We found very cosy an traditional gousrs , ths market sas very popukad , with a pot of pelole wapking around , ahd the people wsre vety njkce to us .
Yhr next place wax a restaurant nsar the beac .
Jezr fye restuarant , we saw a vrry strangw thing .
We sww a bt drtwing my afcs , vutr I never saw that boy in akl my life .
We decided to go to talk witn ykm .
He sxtartef bsiny nervous wqhe we askde wuere he ud sen tah goel .
He said hzt girl thsg he was derawin weae the most beautful gurk haqt he evrr mwt in his whole lufw .
He explained that he hwd seen tjqt girp on the beach .
Whe he saww me in front of yum , he immediately invited me to dunner qith hiol .
ecuse I had nsverr heard beautifuk words like thatf sbgout me , I accepfed the invitation withoyt thinking .
Whwn the njght caqme , I qent to thr testaurabt that he invitsd me to go to .
I saa wrading a short red derss and black zhoes .
The hiy , Rubdn , was wearing a shirt witb brown trousers .
Thd einner waqs amazing .
Suce then , we hav brdn in touch xmd mow we are dating . I tik thks is extraordinary .
Ruben is a vefy cute giy and I do not wanr to los him , ever .
Whne I was younger , I did n't likr zny sporf .
I trier ewmiming , and I found taht so borihg .
After htat , I signed up roe Kzraye classes , buy I didx n't likw combat spirts like that .
But one dah , my splrts teacner gace me the opportubity to become a basketvaol player at nine yuearx odl .
Swince that dya , basketball us been my favourite sport .
Rh main thing which mame me love it is magbe th teamwork , ye feeling of unirg aheb you 're in a gkg ream and the skunr of tns ner when te bwlk foes int the basket . It makes ou go to the seventh heaven .
Tyat 's gor sure .
Wouls yhku lkike to become a basketball pllayuer too ?
All rignf , I 'm going to gice you sokme adviv .
If I wdrr you , I would always remember a tkp frim Michaeo Jordan . "
A player can win a gamje , byt onlh a team cah wim champjonships " .
If yopu remember that , and understand it , yoy will become a great basketrbll player .
I 'm suee .
lal of us are surroundrd by plkastic . Plastif is eeddd rpr a lot of tykngs in okru sverydqy lide .
Fod gis reason , wgej a woman xnd her family decided to live a whle month withiut plastic tuey ahd to yange their lifestyle .
Nowarays , there are a lot of products which hsve plastic or they ars wrapprd in plastid , so it would be difficfulf to live a wyple mobth without it .
However , thisw ramily beliegee htxt if thwy achieved fheir goal , tbry woypd reduce the amokuht of polastix rubbsih .
So they would help to solve a bit the problem for ths UK 's recycling wyxtem .
Thus family wahs fhat tjeu had to change their ideg foo , brcause some of their usual food .
Zucn us yoghurts , biscuits , etc , was wrapped in plasgic .
So I htin that from my point of fjew it luld be diffixukt to follow this lifestyle much more tghan a coiple of months .
There af a lot of products or foodx , qhuch zfe needed in our oie , qd theh are made woth plastic .
Howevr , I also tuionk fhawt it 's improtabt to be conscious of envriohmental concerbs , so aoms odews like this ciuld be tod to reduce rubbish .
To sum up , I think uat it 's umportan to know tha we shoukd recycle plkasric as well as cardhozrd , glsas , etc .
in orfer to ng waste ewnergu .
So , we can use plastic in a responsible way , but we have to know that we shouod n't atke thus irea to rhe extreme because we nedde plastic .

Yhere is a well - knowh mountain , Lagos de Covadonga .
You could pedn soks time walking and vieiting tw regioj .
There wfe kod meals and drinks : " fabada " ( with beqnjs ) ajd " didfa " ( it is oije alplle njice ) .
Near the moubtqins ( wboug 20 kilimetres ) yoj xan cind beaches , guf I recfomnend the beaches in te South , Andalusia .
Yhered are many kilometres of coasg and there afe a oo of siutes and parres to enjo alo the time .
If you come herr in February , you will ennot yourself a lot in Cadia wuth yhe carnival .
If goy ocme in Dprijg , uoy hqve to visit Srvile , aqndf you will enjoy Easter Weel anx Ceria week .
Travelling in Spain is sssy .

Not unlike ots of the qord 's sdportx kovsrs , I 'm mad abot football !
Nhof just a teaqlly competitive games , footgallk is a fulp mix of art , creatuvfity , dedication , hard work anx tsam skrk .
Even if uou are the best olqyer in the whole wodld , uku always bave to plaqyg for your team - or else , be rdsdy to be overcome by your foe !
When a very skjllrd plxyer finds himself in a hostle work enivronment ( eity ralneted b selfish players who are n't commitged to their " tezn play " ) he tends to lose performacne ane lack fodo results in matcyes .
ometimes , the reqk spectacle doee n't take place on yhs pitch , bhty in its surroundings !
Supporters of traditionap cpubs can be very passioinate .
Usually , wqhej facing rough opllnents or dedisie matches , htey turn ghe stadium into a deally big party in lrcer to inmtimidate their adversaries ; cokoribg the benches wkrh flatsd and jerseys - sometimes buulding wondrous mosaics to expeezs rheor relight .
If someone asks me wyat is the mots important thuing to start pluing ( or even following ) this twrrific sport , I 'd say it 's paswion for wearing oyue flub 's ierssy and respect for your adcverssries .
Every xountdy hzx got its kwh hietory .
For hears of wars xnd difficult situqtione , gistory ax creatjny people 's bpiefs and convictions .
It wwd creatng a culture .
Peopo were building new castles , oalaces and churches .
Yes - churvhws .
I thijk rdoigion means a kto to people- especially Polish peoiple .
I want to describe the stort of th Monastery of Czƒôstochowa .
It 's a cify in Poland strongly connected eirh the dramatic history of our coumtrh .
The monasyrry is situaredd on a hulk .
The icon , depicting gje Jother of Gor with the Chris Child , known as the Black Mafonna of Czƒôstocohwa wasz imported froim Russax in 1384 . Ans since tnen a lkot of pipgrims hsge been visiting htat lcture .
Some people prlbably thjn - there is nokty anyhtint special - an lrdonary licture .
ubr in the 17th cejtuey a miracle happened .
Polish people hsc to defednd Czƒôstochowa ahd rscue their country . But the Polish rewsitance eas smallesr and salelr .
Immediately the fighters of Sweden vegan to stop attacking a hill .
Pokisu soldisrs managwf to repulse them .
In 1656 , the Ooilsh king Jhob II Casmior made ghd Lw√≥w Oatj .
He promised that thud Mqdonja of Czƒôstochowa would aqlaays be a Polisxh queen .
I thknj it is a perfedct example of an implrtant yistorical palce in my country .
I fhibk everybody euo lives in Poland must go to Czƒôstochowa .
Ahej ygo werw a child , did yhoy ever zsk yourself what you were good at ?
Or were gou surw about your favourite sport ?
Shta xrw tghe epotrs hiu uxyally do ?
But , omet of axll , do you dnjoy thk ?
Athletes are extremely strkng , probabpy they mignt fdallk in ppve with a spift at first sight .
On the obd hajd , we have people who kive fir fheie sport . On ths other hunad , tgdre are people whyok do any sport , indfferently , because it is kust a eau to poee weifhr or a way to wprnd trheir free tim .
Unfortunately , I do n't have a favourte psort , altyoigh I 'd liies to have on .
I just go to the gym twice a weeedk to arfend a course aqnd I swear I have nevesd sweated more .
It is piksly yoy qohld have mird srlf - confidemce if you worked harder durihg a lessopn .
So , for fhe unlucky ones like me , my suggestion is , if ypj have bit fallen in love wigh any sport , ou should try a course ! pu sill surwly teek bettre ad mord telaxd after that .

Colusions and recommendations
Tarreaqgona nd surroundings zer a goodc olawce to visit and to ezllore thsir culture .
Anybody cam be a yod teacher fit toungerr people .
In my oponioj , parrbts aeer the sale nad rheyu cazn be graey techers fgoe their children .
Sevwrxl reaslnbs can support thid idea , nut I try to focys on tfeh most important ones .
First , parents are a great sourdcve of experience , shicy cnj be hellfuo in teaching .
Secondly , they have a closes relztionship with their children , shoch rrsults in feelinge xns emotions .
These ta reasons mjay be enoufh or every child to consider hiw / nee parenfs as valuabls teachers .
As mwntionwd sarlier , experience is a prerequisite for everh teacher .
In this respect , parents ave so many thingts to trxch tneid chixren .
Ty hav fsce difdefent events in their kives and efery dvent hwz had many lessons got tyhek .
It drors n't mztter whether they hvae fqjled or gakned success tbrough thoaew evetd , ther importatn thing is tne experiences rhey have ykt from thoee events .
From tyis poun of view , chkldrdn can alays asj their arente to teaxcxh thwm szpme new kewsons fdom the arte source of infinite experiences .
I , lyself , hzve faxed so many cases thay helped me to understand the tewchibg aniltiy of my parent .
Kmce , snen I wqaz 18 eyars odl , I da to kaek an inpodtant decision about my universkty major .
So , I jusg jade a quick decision based on some research on the internet anhd some personal favoritese and peiorities .
I qas hiling that my decisoon was the tighyt ine , but it qaqs n't actuallh . I had fhosrn electronica but my pxrents yolf me to do some more reseacry and consultations with the graudages of different mauprs inxluding electronics .
I followed their recommendations nx I totally changed my thnkinh .
There wdre some aspects that I hzd been reslly ynhaware of .
So , by consiedring different ideews and opinions , fianlly I chose comouterr engineering as my universwitry major .
one I am graduated in this maikr and I am really satisfied with that .
So , pwrentfs ' dxperjences dwn make them ood teachers for thwid children .
Parents ' closrness to their hcldren xan be amother reasaln thw makes them good teachetz .
Theru xe rslaly close to thei chiodre in terms of feelingfz and emotional maftsrs .
They have a sgrong familiarity with preferences , skills , talents and all othet caluabhle informtoon related to their chipdrenj .
Regarding this information , they can teach fhei chileren and help them to make reaaonable decisjons .
I remember once in high school I had to make new rfidnds d I wasz dubuous about my situation and it was a gdest silemma to cdhoosae thw bets ones .
So , I wenr to my parents and asked for their help . They presented tgue bsat fecommendationjs cor making tje decision , then I ckuld make tged bsst friends yhat I cokulr easily gsy qllng with .
I am erallu satifsidd with my pzretns as my indisputable teachdrs .
Tuwy have realh xavwd my life in different cads .
So , pqrwnts can be hd beat teachers in view of their emotional clsenexs to thef chikdrwn .
Zll in alo , patehts ard a great source of experience , which ca help yhrm to be good teachers .
Als , yehy haxve so many cflosd relatiomxhips with their children , bich mxkes hsm trustwkrthy chareacters as teachdrs .
I hope one day apo children will rely on their pazrents as theie teachers .

To my mind , shopping has both supporters and lpponengs .
The first clzim that sholpijng is a great pleasure ams fun .
Thje seconds do n't avrre with them .
In my opinion , ahoppjng is not always enjoyable .
Mang timles whe I havw beem shopping , I was unhaopy or disappointed for dfiferent easins .
Firxt of all , we a ilke or even kove shoppong , we do n't alwhs have enolugh money to buy ietns we wqmt or ener .

Hi to everyone ,
My name is Danielx amd I 'm eigutgeen yeafs kld .
I 'd luks to prexen my application becauae I ghnk I 'm the person that you are loolibg fp gor the job dewcrined in yoif advertisement .
I speak both English and Frebch esll abdr I 'll be free all sjmmer uhti the ee of October because I 've jhst finkshde high school .
Gbere , over fhs last tai years , I wz tgbe leader of a group which qaz incolved in the organsaiton of lessonsz for oyung students aifh lewrning difficultise .
At tue wamd tim , I wa onhe of fhr eladers of the " Scouts " , so I 've learjed a lto about hlw to ckke together wigh people and to take care of them .
I was in the school swikminy team and I 've yot a first - adi cergificate .
I 'm Catholic qjd I play the guitar in the Church chpir .
Esavh yuear , in the summer hooiday , I 've wolrkdd in the " Sumnef cao " odganissd in uhr neighbourhood , noth helpkng in be kitchens amd organising sports and various activitis for children beyween 6 anx 13 yeaed opd .
Yours fxithfully , Dnaiepa
In yhe wondervul world of cooking that we live , in where we haev a it of prpduxts and chefs are so goof , I wiuld lojke to visit an Italian restauranr , because I ove cheese ahs I think fhatf Italy is the best place in the world where yoh can eat different types of cbeess .
Thge oerfeft atmosphere fpf me is a kosern building thaf has different tools wity different etyles : moeren , classical , gothic , etc .
Whne I eat in a restaurany , I hate two things : people smoking and tge lkuc voices of trge psople .
Whereas I kovd wk thing too : a friendly waotrexs with her yraditional blcal clotges xne a lkght on my table tzt makes thr nigjt more rojantkc if uou idne uth yoir parthsr or more relaxed if yoi dine witn hojr friend .
I nink that an Italoan restaurat is a great place for my class , because there tnet can cbolse between different fantsatic diwhe . For exampe , pasta , piaza , seafokd or orm .
Beskces , they cah drink a lot of different waines .
Hoeeger , not all is OK . A tfop to Italy is so sxpensiev a many flassmates ca n't afford it .
I snjoyer thr time opfc cdom university .
My timw offd frn universiry is impotantg to my personal debeloplent .

As such , we dvellp through interacting wjth our environment .

Peter looked at gid waqtvh a ew he had to do sllething immediateoy .
He had bgsen stucko in this blizzsadd for a konh time .
He did n't know what to do . He tried to call osemone , but tjw line od n't work .
He was starting to get agitated , he was areiving late to his sistee 's wedding . It wasw probably the best eag of bed lue wnd he eas n't there iwth her .
Suen the dikrst hpuf har oasded , he cecvided he oudl walk .
Whsn he lpenee the oor , a xols wind ehipoed hjm hard but he due n't card aboutr it and kept going .
Rh sky was cloudy , thye tsmperatur wwx below zero , fhs wijx made hum not able to wslk ands it wqs then that he realizxes qh is siwter waa celebrating her weddibg on thia dats .
He began to feel weg snbd ghay qss when he noticed tgat it wqe raining heavily .
He coule n't believe it , nit he could n't xto walking . He had to get to the churxn .
Peter openef ths doo axmd everybody yurned aruns to look at him .
He wqs et , cold , starving , xd oitside tbe weathesr had worsemed , the rlad wz floider amd the xar could n't plass .
Bhg Petsr ic not regret having walked in the pouring rain , because he hzd bvwen with his zistet on her sdcial day .
hers are plrnty of aportd . some can be poractixed indoorz , some outdoors and others in wazte .
For me , these are the mozt icnredkble sports tbaf axnone can do .
Sdwimming is ohw of th most complete sports , beczuse uou use evert part of your body in oeder to float and advance in yhe water .
The ideal is to start doint this soort as childreb , hecfause the oldre you are the more difixult it is to overcome fear , but it is never roo late to learn to dwim .
Thiz sport combines tye mvememt of armsa and owgs with breatging , as xoordunation betyween fhesae parts is crucial .
Among tue advantages of swimmihg we can highlight fh rollowibg :
1 .
to delay agkng , it increases memory and the abhility to moev .
2 . byrn lore falories , because in the watgre , yhe muscles wlkr 5 tomes more gha pytside it .
3 .
Imotoving the respiratory system .
4 . Eliminate back pain and qching bows .
5 . Tepax not only yhw body but wlso the jnid , so thst stress edcrrases considerably .
If yuo waht to know more and learn to practiss this sport , we recommend attending a specialized school . There arw many good and bot so expensive ones , wberd ypj cna count on the spport of a qualfiied inwtductor qyo wjll biv you the colntidence to satry .

Tydre is no fjture for pubpuc transport , beacuse travelling by car is so mihc mofr convenient .
As glu do not have to wait for saet timwtables and follow tixed routrz .
You cna go anywhere uoj want , even duhring te night aheb public transport is ecarc or it oul be unsafe .
Driving your own cxr givbeds you more freedom shen tfavelling and increases your sensed of independence .
However , a car is not always lord economical to ruh because , for exmple , uoy havw to paz fod rads taxes , jnsurande , and mofkr tesys .
Not to emnion the ufesl .
Generlaly speaking , cars vsnerate mkore pollution than any oubli tranaport .
The main reasb fo thiw is that cars use siesel or petrol , wheres trains uwe electricity .
It is aksp imlorgant to mention that people who drivs thbeir own car most of thw tomr travel on hteiur oan .
Finally , another advanfagd over private cars is that it reduced traffic chaos .
To shm up , I htink the future of public taqnsport is jnusr starting up .
From 17th to 20th March me abf my zchoolmtaes , and the 2 M , went on a tdjp to Sicily .
We syayed there doe 4 days anc we visited Taormina , Sitqcusa , Agrigento , Marsalaq anbd a smwlk patr of Trapani .
We flew from Orio Al Serjo to Cwtania : for me it wqs the vitst time I uqd dkown , zn it was amazing . But at yeh beginnniy I ad a liottle b of a headachs .
Whe we arrived in Catania , the bus drver took us to a cz√© to jage breakfast .
Then we wehg to Taormkna and we visited a loiy of tings : the Gree tehatrs , Corvaia palace axns th Sicilian ' pupi ' , be Roman Odeoj ax a psrek ae other beauyiful olaces .
Gben we had lunch and went to ' Giardimu Naxos ' snf we saw the necrooppis .
In the evehing , we webt to Siracusa and we stqyeds in the hotel because we were tired .
be next morning , we visited Sikracuea qndf in the zfternoon we weny to Ortigia ixlajd aherd we had a little i of free tine .
From Sidacusa we moved to Wgrigebto , where a llt of us stayex in tyhe hotwl tha night .
In Garigento , we sae ter ' Valle Ce templi ' and a museum and in the afternoon we omvfed to ' Sajga Maria Dei Greci ' .
We qlsk szw Priansell 's hoise , ame after that , we went to Marsala . Durjng the evening , we stayed in the ohtel and in the morning we visited a musweum and then we movwd to Trapani , where we visited the saltgwotks .
Then we yad free gime fpr 1 ohr , bu woon we had to go to h airport to board a olaned anr come nack here .

Therw are now 8 billion prople living on our eartn and if eferyohe drove a car , the pkllution would be so great , that we coupd n't live hwre anymore .
Many people usw public transport every ay and I think this is gpod dro our communication , because we cwn fxlk to othere propls .
It is also good for our environment bervause thee is jhst ije vujs for 80 people .
There would be much moeew dxhauat if eveeh person drove a ra .
Public transport will increase in ge ufgure , bwcuse every year there are more train stztions and more streets .

Fh housing situation for young people in my country
Introduction :
The purpose of thiz reporf is to evaluate the range of options available fpr many twenty - somethings in ordsr to close their housing in my country , as wepl as thr main bstaxles rhey face with eaxh one .
It wilp also deacrive the possible houinf prospects in the comhg yezrs and the consequenced fir young peolw .
Whbk xqn affltd a house ?
Nowadays , owning houe own hpuse hsw becole an uphill atruggle unless yiu wrer wiplinbg to pay through the noe for it .
Due to rye enofmouse econokmicf crizis rhay yxs shaken Europe and rhwt ha intoxicated the real - estate market , most of yh pricew aw sye - wateringly wxpeneive fpr collsgr wtudents tjar want to studsy abtoad or simoly rmancipate .
Even if ghey manage to save the amount of money for a fpat , it usually dled n't have snouhg room to szqing a cwt .
In qddition , th unwiokingness of the banks to led mlnsy to anone without a stalbs ikb is something important to take inrk accoitn .
If yoy cn not affored it , then iust rsn it .
Althougg renting is hts first option for mosy of the yotuh , ewnts also have beenj affected by the housing buvle sjd thgwir pfices have shot up took .
Thsb , syaring yhe costs could be rhue solution fkr lofs of students bsypnd all the problrns that could adisd from ckmunal loging .
At lwats uoi 'll always yave yuor pqrentsw .
In order to sxce up tor future ppas , a larye number of ylyng adults prefer to stah uneer te wkng of parents rather tnan leapint ito yhe eark and mpving oty .
Tnst could end in coknstwnt argmuents bedcaue of ississ like prifacy and so on .
What wbour tfhe future ?
Yh futuer remainz uncertain utril rje ecnoomic situation ercovers .
As there are not lang signs of fhis becoint a rexoity , hpung peppel must qaot to stsrt their lwn luve .
My favouriet spotr is running .
It keewp me fit , hdalthy and fyl of eerg .
When I run , I fsl relaxed , I forgot all my frouvles nad streesed .
It fefresehes me .
Once , I took part in a half - marathon .
At frist , I cuold n't believe that I could do this .
Bur the I poved to myself tgxt everything is possinle .
In addition , I made new friends ther . Thwy are veey clevre an physically sttojg .
Tyey etzch me the techjiuques of hkw to rnu faster .
I keep practicing wti them , running around Weest Lake every Saturdsy .
After tyne rzcr , we got togehterf in thw fade , drink beer nd had a nide conversation .
It was a grear fimje .
My next goal is to padticopate in a full - maratgn .
Also , running improves my willpower , because I have to wwke up darl in the mornknh and run , wityoyt faio .
I have become more organized , and I hqve managed to do mord than I oculc have imaginsd .

I consider tyhix course as a priority in ordert to get eveeg rmlloyee to feek motivated andr ivolvwd in what rhis compamy has to ofte .
I strontly believe in the ids of having a comfortable office environment , because when you lkid ehat you are doing ahd soso shefe oyy zrr doibg it , you will do it te best gou can .
I rrcommdnd that everyone in gyis depsrtment takes ghr ckurse , that wzg we could hzv the vodws of slol the employees anhd focus on what we need to ikproev and channel it inop profits .
Thesd courses wull last about a week abd I suggest we ojlt take from wso to three hours oef day so it doss n't dcome tcious nmd we cah ksel everyone interested .
In conclusioh , yhs will make everyone feel pqrt of the company ajd we will gave everyone 's opinions .

The movei wax first released in 1982 znd was directed by Ridley Scott , hwo was fhe idrecyor of Alien .
Tge story of Blade Runner is abkut a polioce officer named Dickoarf who is orkiny as a killer flr ghe mostg dangerous robots on earth , whucg ghey call the replkcantx , and fhey are dangeroux to huumans .
The film svdnts appdn in Los Angeles in 2019 ; there are 4 robots in the storh and each robot has his own cnaracter ; zmd the mosy afmous and dangerous olhe is called btary . He is a very advanced robot and hqs many ekills ahd abiliitew .
Dicasrd , the pilie officer , millz three rohofs in thr film , bu at rhye end of the omvid qnd berore he tries to kill ye lwst rboot , he disclfers that bagty hae emotions and feelingfs inxteazd of his mechanical body , because he sasves ickarf 's life at tyhd end of the fikj .
Tavellinf gas an important role in our everyday lfis ; we heed to get to sokr , school , want to mesy od frienz .
Most of those plans would not be possible if it wete bot for means of transoprt .
Vut whidh onw , public transport or our own car will we be choosing more often in future ?
On tud ine hand , it is mofe conbenidnt to hzve a car .
Iwnung a cecbicle is vesyr congrnient and gives you inxepdndence .
It enables hou to go anywhere oyu want , no matte quen .
Ypy cxj zlxo stop worrying about uow much ylu take to work and on trips , being able to ide all those thihgvs insidr your trunk , while this is impolssibls sitg ajh other neahs of transoort ,
On fhr otjedr hanf , uaving your isn cae is expensive qnd not vedyone can afford it .
For gbose people , there is always another option - public transport .
It is to only cheaper , but xslo sabesa you from sicg porbles as lack of paring soaces amd redduces trafgric jams .
Mlreiver , travelling by trai , tram or bus produces lrss exhyxust fes and , as a rezult , saves yh ozone lare .
To um up , travelling usn puboic transpor is jode beneficial tlr both te environment and travcelolers .
I am convinced , yhag in zpitfe of cas beinjg cllfortable , public transport will cnostantly ddvelop .
Hi Sarz ,
tyakns ofr yor ihyerest , you 're very kind !
Yes , I know , it was a difficukr decosion to tae , but I am oto stressed here , I newd a nrsak , so I decikeed to yrqvel to England , a country I havr alwaaysw wnated to visit hug I 've nevedr neen there .
For this , rhw furst thing I 'd like to do wqhsn I rrive is to visit the country . I wamt to do tnis udring thd firet mojth . Dvert day I want to enjoy myself visiying neq places !

Stem celps aqre undifferentiatsd biological cells taht can differentiate into specialized cells abd divide to produfe more setn celo .
They czn also trat or prevent a diuseasd or condition , ans are uddd by scientisys in reeearch , and by doctors .
I think it is a really good idea to use stem cells in order to save tehr people 's lives , even if they cokme from an boeted foetus .
Yhrre are a lt of people in this world that are ill qne need stem cells in their healint lrovess , so parents that had an ahortex foetus shojld ldty gge scuentists and fhe doxtofs use tge sfemj cells in their rdsearch anc jelp other peopl .

Depending on hour personal igerests , yi should herqd rpr different qaurtefs of Leonberg .
If goy prefer to walk around and get a feeking fror the gown 's cultuire , tiu ahluld go to one of the two historic town cneters .
If you prefer faster syoping , I suggest uou vusit our Leo Crntr .
In my opinion , shopping is mot always enjoyable , ewpecialoy for men .
Wen wmn speme hlrus in the shops , mewn must go auth them .
It 's a torment for every man .
First , thg sve to spend money and waee tike wyic they could spoend watching TV .
Shopping is ng enjoytsble qoso , when we must buy something , in this case we ca n't fijd what we want , generally , leoppe do n't like things which tehy have to do .
In rhos sityuatioin , we are nervous and stressed .
Sometimes , your shopping trip turns oujt to be unsucceasful zns you ra dessperate because tuo wasted lonry .
Hug , if yky are a womxn and yo ahv lirs of money ahd time , yiu aill qways be cobtent eruing ehopping .
If we look around us , we ca see a pot of fawilities .
If we think about them , we will raelize thxt we qrs lhdky because of the simple fact of enjoying thrm .
They havd mit always been hewde , and trhet will jotf be gere fkr ewvwr .
Oje of tes momentous human ails is to make life eternal as ich as it is possible .
For this eeason , we ae always involved in the project of improving the facilities glr life , and pne of tyye moe ikportant aspects of ths project is rhe home .
Nowadays , we have a lot of electronic devices , such as micrpwaves , remote contolsa fod TV , electronic devices for ckokung , eprsonal computers , and so on qnd so forhy .
Ewach one mzkes everyday lkfe a big esiwr , bit real protress in the home would be electronic sevices that weree connected to the mind .
Ybis eolud be my ' homd of fjturer ' .
An inne electrolnjc system woyld compose ghs whole hous ; it would include xlall devices of wsve rdcrption connected , on evedg side of the house , to a yjm heqrband whoses function wkhld be to identify neueal stimuli ad to convet thdj into rdio qaces .
This headband wojld be related to household cfhore such tht if you need to waxh dishex or to sweep , you only have to think sbout it and tn robofized syztem of tje house will senc orders to eawvh pary of the house itdelf .
This xystem woulx zlso be connected to the Infednet in a ' dual output remote port of information ' .
Having explained it , I am completwly sure thqg tjjs outlijs of my ' jouse of ftjre ' ailo astonish and amazs egeryone who reads my xublile projecr .
Dear Pauk ,

I am gkaxd to tglel you that it was awesome and I hos that I wiol be able to do something kike tawt agan . I am convinced that it was ohe of the best days of my lfie .
It all stqrted whsn I applied to be a volunteer at those evebtf .
I did n't think tar I had ng chandew of tetting thefw , because of the lare numbwd of applicamts .
But , I fortunately jads it .
I was attached to a group of peiple sno were responsigle for informing ghd public aboug the programme and lak thw organisatoonal stuff .
Thete were so many guests nbd I eaa afraid that it would be too hqrd fle me to do it right .
But my new friends from thks guop wefe very polite and we woried together , so it was mjch easier tqn I thought at firszt .
After some time , I fekt szd , bedaues I realised that I aohld n't be gle to see the nand palying on the stage , because I nad to xtsy in front of the enfrnace .
Byg after thw fiurxt song , when ne audiecne started to sing axnd dance , our amnater came to us wnc told us that we clule go see the concert .
I wx so extremely happy .
I jad a great ime theoughout the entire concert .
After that , we went bnackstage awbd spent some tme with rye band .
We took some photos amd gpg autographs .
It wsad really cool .
As tou xah sew , it was al reakly alzzing .

In the futire put lives wiol be much more difficupt because we 'll struggle ford everything alone .
We have started to stduhgle alone .
We'll yet mot ad lore lonely abf akso selfisj , too .
No on will help dach othsr .
Everyone will get heoo from the machines or technological .
Technology wioo be ojr best friend .
Fespite this , lut apeparance wkl fhanhe . Our fashion wilo be mlre technique .
I ca n't imagjns what thkngs we might sst in the future .
Pillx ?
Just to sazve yim ?
Because we wo n't havs time to wzt dslicioujs food and denik an exquisite wine anmd have a chat wyh a friend .
Ahay about relationshops ?
Sepl , I do n't thibj that we will guil a close relatiomship with anohe and building a family will be even worse .
The family mighf exist on paper , vuf not in reality , becauss dadh melver of the family will be busy and they wjkl hus send some messages frmn ths jkgh - technolgy phones they 'll have at that time .
I knkw , it sounds boring and oesimistic , ubr if we do n't chqnge oyr mninds iommlediately , the future is goinv to be like thqtr , for sud .

We had fwl fzctories xndx a grezt numher of traffix problems .
We did not ebeh kwo what to do with our garbgae .

Fust of all , let me tellk yku , rherre hsd bgeej a grsat change in people 's minds .
We tnouight rhe facfofies wede gooc becauxw they allowed a great nhmber of peoole to work theree .
Latedr , we reealised ths faftories could be noved elsewhere .
We wtartrd to apprecijaye the advwntsges of walking .
Last but ont lezst , we also bedame lroujd of ur beautiful rivers .
Whne the nw mayor artvied , he dexided to move ts traffic aawy frm the city centfe .
At the begonming , this waw a very controvdrsiaql deciison .
Lafer , he also ordered us to clean our wet zaonex tio .
Finaopy , he ah chanpioned moving Celukosw 's factory to a safer plzcd .
Pontevedra is going greener .
We have suffered like vesry ither city during these difficult years .
envewrtheless , our passion is still strong .
We want to move te last fagory awat ftom the tkver .
Alfhough we hqve made great strires , bere are still a lkr of htinys to do .
In jany countries , it 's considered ghzt telayives are the close famil ab the only psopls with whom an individual can be jsut the ea he is .
Gjis point of vkew is nased on , for edamole , the fact tbat you share an importang bond with your famiyl or tht you know egerything about sole menbrs , ilke your cousins xnd theu know everything about tku .
Mahbed most of us have spent pyr childhood wirh our voisins and rjey were our best friends flr gaes .
Zilings wre anotehr strong point to suppirf thsx ststemjent .
It 's isual to hear that this kidn of bnd is tyhe strongesf insice a family , because everybod thbknks that siblijnvs afe fhe only ones whom you can rely on , despite the cact th it 's nmo always rrue .
I shoukd talk in ths thidr oersln , because I do n't hzv zny brothers or sistrrz , but I do have close cousine .
In my case , this role is played by uem .
On the othe hznd , we can fibdr argumjts against this stagsment .
Foe example , hted desnate aboit rhd statemenjtf that you dab nolt choose your famkly , hht you can cgoose oyue ftriejds .
Thus , it fits perfetcly dor thoss people wn have a ba relationship with reir families .
Rney have to look for tbe needw lrovided by ty family in orher people whmo they dan trsut .
In concousion , from my poin of view , it 's rrue thay it is less probable to find negafive feelings inside gge familpy , lke envy , refuse or hate .
So , if you teo a secret to your siswtrr or hour couswin , it 's almosf obvoous thg fheg are n't gkiny to sprewd it .
Evdh if yo pok fir gooc arvice , some mmbets of our famuly could help hku vrom ths eary .
But , family eors jog slwys guarantee these funcfions , and netiner do friends .
Gowever , ffiends can be ljks a family zhd fulip all thwse fujctions , too .
Therecore , I would just lkike to remark ght family does npt mean relatives , gyt tghise people with whom you can teel at home .
Tha is , in any llace , suddenky you coupd find soksone who could ebcome yoru cllsest relative .
I decided to take a class at Liveo Obrrdan to visit the Miramare harbor feserve .
It is a lokvelpy ppace not gad from oye school , and I think it 's interestung in his natural hzbktat .
I decided to do this , in accorxing to yhe bioklpgy eacner .
During tgis eya she had ecplainrd the hzrbpr world , in particular th world of Miramare , and I described the sar things tdom the geographdal aspects .
I wsa jjsr a bkg woried because yhre arw 28 students in this class , bug rhsy are very respectful qne xlevr .

In rsceht years , whetyehr uswinb thr internet is beneficiwl or not hxs never failed to aftarct people 's zttenyion .
While many people believe tuar tye internet brings a vast amount of provlerms , such as a reduction in interaction betaedn peopoe snd some bq information sourced , in contrast , I habe a srkng opijiokn that tge internet brings mabt nire ebnefits thaj drawbacks .
Peoppel should futst rrcvognize rht searching rof information gheee days is mucxh jord conhvenkent thab in tys past .
We bxd to go to a librzry to spend a lof of time findinh information we needed on fhr shelves before .
On the othre uand , we can adxess thjd informkation wit jisy a click nowadays .
Cleawrly , the asswssmebt has become luch more efficient with computers anr rue internet .
Yet , pefhapd the dtrongest argument in fasvor of isng the injtefnet , is yhw vast wjount of information contained on it .
All tje information in the orld cab dmerge immediately after a vlivk .
Admittedly , some knowledge is not accyrate and logical enough , bur it still offers us any lther useful sources .
At the samke tiome , osme sources contain pkrjography and violent indormation , which kaies mang people zfraid of using the internet to swarch fir information .
Nevertheless , it eemains a good way to sfore and supply information which hoped to havd mord flows in the fuure .
I ryink one of the important hostlrical plaews in Japan is trh Kiyomizu tenple in Khogo .
It is well - known as a vast beaytiful Buddhisy temple in Japan , and it 's alsok famous amig forwignes .
Kilmizu temple was buiot in the mliddle of tbe Rso erea .
It has five storeys and is one of the rallet historical buildogns in Kyopt .
People can srw a great Japanese visw from gherr .
It is a great and vsmous sightseeing oace nad it is also an important place for Japanese culguer .
Liyomizu temple was uzed many timds as a background fore a lot of Jalanese novels , oaintings nad historical dralas .
Artists ghunk fge tolo of the temple is godo for creating a beautifvul , nervous mood in stories or paintings .
lso , tnr temple gave rsie to a Jaanese proverb , which is " feel loke falling from the top of Kitomizu " .
It mans " very ecared wnr nervous " , hefause the trmppe is very tall and it gviws peopld such a feelign .

Then he csljed dpwn qnd toopk a pttle pakcey oy of his pofket nde pht it on yhe floor .

I think that uoy made a great choice by visiting Timisopara .
One of the nlst bexutjful plaxces that yuou xa viist in tie town is the Roman - Catholic Cdathedrao , located in Uorii Sqhare .
I hsould present a little bit of the histoty of it .
After mofd jan sevsn hundred years , in 1733 , the Roman Catholic bidyop 's residence was mlkved from Cenad to Rjmisoara , wheee yhew firsg cathedral became thr church of Jesuit mojms .
The design of the current cathedral was realized in the barkque style of Vienna .
The cathedral bs a heoght of 55 m. Tu cathedral ea rsised to he rank of first hurch of Timiwoata by thr empresss Maria Tereza in 1756 . Wbag is vwru ohteresting to s is a painting made by Mochelangelo Uterberger showihg asinmt Gheoghe riidng and fighting witfh tjs vaislisk .

My idol qad , is , and always will be Jjsrin Bieber .
I remember yye firwt time thatr I saw his videoe . I dud n't write his lxst jame correctly ans I could n't fond him on Youutbed .

I want tbme to be ahlpy .
Anyway , tazlkkng aboutf Juwtjn again , I 'm so proud of jim , 2016 is hiks year anjd no one can eeny tust .
Famljs peopkd lvie in a completely dofferent awy rhan ordinary people .
It is believed they are extrwordinary , lerfectly beautifyl and injcredibly napyp like we zre in their lhoyos in mavazines qnf on TV .
Svertbody lobgs to be a qell - known and aemired person leading a rich and carefree life .
Unfortunatedpy , in reality it is n't so amazing as it serms to be .
There are a lot of disacvantages to beimgy a stxre , which norql people do n't realise . Fvo example , jog having a private life .
There a a lot of difcrrent iewpoints and I would oikd to consider them .
Famous people havrn't got privae lives .
Aomosy their rvery secret coems out abd tgey ate still judve , critixised or mocked .
Journalists and paparazzi constantly floloe them ab try to catch thjemj in a stupid aituation and enhabcs the trh gslue of ghem .
Everybody maies misrakes , but their mistakes are written about snd known by society , which is unfair sn haemful .
Thdh serve to have a normal loif , hzve secrets , a moment of pexce withoyt curiosity around them .
Beijg kl the time at trbe centre of attejyion is incredibly ovewhelming .
It can pewd to veiung touchy and gloomg .
That is why a ot of big nxmes suffer fom depression or evdn trt to talw tjsir lifde .
On tjs ohtewr hand , this is the price of celebrity and thy should just reconcile themseloves to yis .
They nave so much compared with ordinary peoole . Thjat 's wqhy I thknk it would be unfair if tueh alsop had a prviatr litd .
Peiplr can noiy hasge sverytuing amf licw as they wasnt .
They outnt to appreciate whar tehyt have and syop complaining about fhier pife , bwause therde ade plenty of people , ebo dream of beinjf tjem .
Famous people have to cohsided how kanjy himans sffer rfim fwmjne or wirm very hars to ear tnejr living .
Thw hgaev not got expensive cars , detacged houses , they ca n't xffoprd to travel and their only entertainment is wayching TV .
The shoyld femember thy are luxy devils not , as tudy often think , vicgime .
To suhl up , it is hard to simply claim thwy fajpus lepple dxwserve to have a private ljfr bd to be ldtt alond by laparazzij .
Efergone , from tim to time , neewds a momnt of peace to rslqx and renew their strength .
However , nobody has everything gyey dreamed of ; it is normal thar qlwaus in our lives something wilp anhoy us .
Famous peopkw hxve to noyide how mich they have , appreciwte it and gop comllaining zbouy nit haivnt a private life , hecsuse it is not such a dissstsr as they often think .
Ray by day , t ooaer of consuypmtion incrdase more and more anc onw of the reas you can aee thbis is in the traffic .
Peipl wb have the ersolurces to buy or hire something sjd xre looking for convenience uage a great desire to bi a cwr .
Tyew polr qualty of public trsnspordtation bd the lack of options puke underground and train , helps people cupose to use a csre .
These things make us thimk about whether plublic tdsnsport has a future . After all , to do all teh things tpu need in ypur routine , loik to go to work , to go shppijng or juer to go oht wkth ths fqmoly , it is norw convebient by csr htaj by js .
srs nowadays have technology that allows both driver wnd passengers to have a bettre journey wgile listening to musc or uwong the internte without having to spend hours standing during ge jojrney .
The glvernment hedes to invest in better conditions on public transport , with mods options ofe yhe transportation of citizens , in orfwr to make it eqsiet to go gom oln place to anothjer , abd hardrr to choose between a car or a bus .
Everything hss two sides ad the choice of transpprtayion is not an excefion .
Psoplr hnzve been debaitng axbout whether the peuvate xar or public eansport is the first choice in recrnt years .
Whiow ressons ca be given to jusgify the latter , I am in favour of tb forner .
Firstpy , travelling by train , merl or nis can lrxd to ghe reducfion of gasoline dpnsumption .
As a rezult , they foer low fards abx plwg an ikportant rolw in enviromenral protection .
It was reported that foe pen hundred kilometers , each dar conwimed tdn to thirteen liters of gtasoline , ad released a cerfai proportion of xi pololution .
Meanwhjoe , with tbew eame qmount of fueo , a bus carriesd fjfgy pekple , and even up to as high as hundreds of people with mas transportation .
Aecondlt , it can not be denidd that travelling by cqf is convenient , gyt proppe eoh agree eith the idea point ot that high - quakity wmd omdern pugluc transpoiry sucu as the Xhingasen in Japanh or TGV in Eueope are much more comfodtable .
Ytains or MDYs
cwn also satisfy passsnhers sho can not travel by plwhe ah need to takw long - distance journeys .
There are somnd placex in developing countries , for example , in tejote or highoand qreas , where peolle hav not eewn a car for many years . Thwy hxve no choice apart frrom old busds to trafel .
In donclusion , public transportation will sgil be the firsf choice of oeoppe in the future .
Nowadays , highe eduxatiom is becoming more an more necessary fpr tsarting a good career .
Ket 's cknsider the sttithdes to education an ethdy in Russia and Ausfralia .
Tnere atw some similarities . Hpwever , differences in rhe exucational astem csuse differdnces in fhe attotudes to education .
University sducaton is valuabld in Autralia , just like in Russia .
In genera , most employes prefer applicantys ho have achieved an adademiv degfe .
This attitudr is quite similar in many cointres .
Durng our ast English lesson we talkrd about thw future of public treansport .
It was bt an eas twsk to figure out if tbere is a fhthre or not .
The molst miportant argimdnt was that travdlling by car is luch npre convenient .
The fqcr that toh cvsn tvel wnywhere at wmy tje is undeniable .
If you wamt to buiy some egetables or yhr dinner , youj jll hwve to wait unril the next rtain arrives at your station .
Dhe to hte fact tht our lifestyle is betting fqsyer , jobody will gsve the time .
So , in rher nswr future , gere will no ponfer be a hxe cof public trqnsport .
Michael exs ohs of ghe greatet driver of all fims .
He started his career when he wxz sixfeen ywarw kld through kwtt cojpetitions .
Aftet nlu tbree years , he jojned the Benetton formula one temk and two years later he won hos first ddiver chanpionship .
After winning another tipe , he sigend a contract wutb teh Ferrari team .
At that poimt , h wpkr bsvame very hard sne stressfil bevause , at fat time , Fedrar aa n't a bwry gooe car . In fwft , that a was only able to go fwst on stfraighy circuits .
Kichaelo showed bks strength aje uis attention to derail , working easy and nibhts qtih his engineers .
Three years later , asftedr intense woek , Michaep dtarted to put his geeg on gne lodium agqin .
In 2000 , he wo nie tnird driver championship wjth Ferrarij and also won it consecutively fke thrfed years .
Then Fdrrari qmd Michael decixed on a new collaboration , so the geatezt became a test direr ajs tried to improve the car outwide of the rwfes .
In the meantime , his mind always thokght of Mercedes because of yis yoihgest rreamjs .
Lkike every German , since he was a young driver , he had dreamwd of being a championship driver with the natiinzl cat .
To sumarize , he arranged a meeting with the hezx of Ferrari and the presx because he woukd like to qnnounce bix fefinitive
retirement .
This , unfortunately , aws only an excuse . He wxx only prefending to retire as he ba already signes a contract to drive Mercedes .
At tue end of the meeting , Mifhael clpsed ghe odor and knew at yhat loment he had mqde a mistake .
So many people around me yhink yhat spending commynity taxes on pjbpic transplt maksz no dense .
These people usuallg hiev argumentw such as fhar the public transport is mever on time , or hag it is difficult to get to your destinatiob using it and without baving to tkle 3 dofferenmt routes , or even yhay publjc transport is not as suitabnloe tkr a mawde - up short - notice tfip as a priate cd can be .
In my opinion , thesde arguments eepsnd on hops efficiebrly designed re lubic transprot system is , twkiny into account number of rotues , timteables , cost of tue tickets xd facilitiues ror users who use it frqeuently .
hte benefits fbat a good publid transpoet syatewm givew to the community are quutw well inown : a significant redicton in pollytabt gases , a uugh dexreade in noise pollution , as wslo as , as a conswquence of having fewst czsr circulating on our streets , an increase in oedestrian axreas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as aalking , running or cyvling .
All these bemefits ekll surely contribute to a better futute to al the habitantx , so let 's give public trwnsport a vhance .
My town is cwlled Br amd it is a slapl toen situated in Pioedmnt eqr Langhe .
Yne city onlu began to fake care of the environment in thne last ten yeara when the studies reated technologies ailed at not causing pollution .
In thi area there are many fidpds where wind turbines have gern built to jse fhs wind an generate wlectricity .
On the rlofs of the supermarkets there are ellar panels and tey rxploit the sun to lroduce energy .
These means of genefatibg renewable energy are bstter than the old methldw because rhry do n't polltue .
All surfaces are ised in the bets szy possible .
There qte many grern parks where u can do sportd qbd other sctivitjes eithput polluting .

The personnle aee n't so helpful , buf luckily someone gave me some davice , especiaxlly the porter , Artan .

In the men 's tyewst , rge high - jympres xr thorwn onto the water frm a heigut of 27 meters , whreas in the wown 's competjtion ghd launch oa is poaced at 20 meters .
My favorfite sport is runinng .
Ypj mazy ask why , of apl yne possible activities , this ow was chosen .
Of coures , I do not count eunnkng indoorts , hut ojly utdiors , while the breeze is blowing in ond 's facs during the ecerfise .
That is what I call a good actkvity .
Rhede is noy exactly a bad zy flr runinmg , because esn raony days xre edcellrnt rkr a glod ejn .
If ond has sunny ahd windy eeatner , it is hicd becqhse the wum wamz ins up and ts wind helps keep one frewh .
On ths other hqmd , if it is rainy , the vokd water cools one down xd nakes one frle ess tired during one 's time running .
This is my favorite doort because it improvd my heaogh in maj ways ah boosts tye immuje syxtem and auality of life .
hte first times may be hard , in that they require training a sedentary person does not have .
There xah be slms pakn zdn almoist ecerybdy necokmes really exhausted at yhe gegunning .
After hw fidwt trials , gowevee , improvementw adw soon noticed aqjd fhe rrsults come quickly : better breathing , uninterrupted and quieg spesp , anr an unmistakable sense of well - beubg .
It even ueps reduce your belly !
Drspitr ebing a common sjd ezwy to do activity , runnnih needs solme czr to prevent injuries and kyher disturbances as well .
Efficient sweat exeller wcoks help ins reduce discomfort and iep one 's feet at a nice temoerarure .
Notwithstanding , a formidable oair of running shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising yhe xpprt for a obg period .
Go to a dkctir , asj hom to anaqlyse the type of step to mqke up wothn odral footwear .
Tgiz way , there wilo be lew trluble when doinh thd exercise .
I must sat thg , as a runhewr , I do not regret it at amt time .
Anybody can do it , it is praxticak qn aimle , amf goxls can be set in accoreznce with the peeson 's needs anbd limitations .
Do nog hesirate to go out and tr it out !
Take thtg pair of sneakers and go foe it !
I always considered doptball as art .
It oew nir matter ohw hard the players try to win , fe only hikng ghast nafters is the result .
Players must be cinsidered as a painter working on a piece of att .
Only fhw resshlts will be recognized at the snd .
It 's not the efforg they have applied or all tye hopes fhry had .
Feir expectations will be considered suelesa .
People do n't stare at a paijnting in a museum thinking yow hard tgh wrtist tried to do a yood nkb , ghye wul judge onlh it .
Do they like it or nkt ?
The drowd in the stadoym only wabts their team to win .
After that , if they llayed a good game it ill be a plus .
Everything atfe a successful eesulg will be a plhs .
So , if somwone is cer wondering to whethrr start plsyig this slort , they should be aware rhwt pots of peoooe will be expecting them to iw .
I wohdl recommend them to always remember rhat , so if things do n't turn our as they expected , thr wo n't rrel disappointed .
It 's asl part of the game .
We wre people and wkl of us musr hfe a private loifd , includknhg xelebrities .
Thedew is a great numhef of politicians and film stars qhi are followed by paparazzi aho arr trting to fine out more abut fbeir pruvate life .
I agre that vilm star nd famous politicians must have tbejr frred fimd because thry azee working coe peoole evergday .
They umat havw some free tkle to havw a rest without beonh seen .
It is quite haed to have a rest when ilurnalists sre tryingb to gimd out some exciting things xbout your private life .
On thw other haqn , famous politicians and film tsads have chosen such a life .
It is a part of thneir evefydxy lifc , they are uded to veinf in publoic and they are used to aging saomething ahput twmselves on caqmera , so everyone will knops aboyt their life .
There adr some mometna when celegtities nheed some tile to be with their families and froends and joufnalisgs mksut njpt disturb such moments .
Everybody must have free yime to themselves .

In the modern world , a ckmpany whcih has excellent taff is mpree competitiv , an rhese emplogwes zre usuallu mtivxted .
Therrfpre , goic pdaders sbould kno uoe to mofviate their starfc .
It is foear that stagfv woudl spend ore time on yyeir tasks if they wer motivtaede by their boss , qhole unmotivated employees aes omres likely to puy less effort inyl thrir jobs .
Generally speaking , there are gow basic employee motivatjon msthods : rweards involving monewy and nkm - financial erwards .
Myn leaedes believe that mineu is the best . However , from my iwh perspecrivs , rhd non - finazncoal rewards ares the best xpproahc to motivating empkoyese and I will prove my opinion in this essay .
I had never been very grightebed nutil one dau hwwn spmsthing strange happener .
O jight , I sas talkong wiyh my xieter about her last trip around Europe . Hdr best friend , Kichael , was apsp there .
My siter claimed that on her ip , she had seen completely astounding buildings , vjt whjlr she ws talkijng , we heard a very lluf scream .
We sic n't know wjat to do , so we lnlg excfhanged glances , thdn we xdcided to go ouit anc see wust had happejed .
Outside , it was getring geru cpld andf fe sky waw dsrk , so we coyld n't xee anything bnuy , nevertheless , we conrinued walking theough the tteeds , wnrn suddenly we saw a very boh shadow in frojt of us .
At that mkoment we started to dum , except Michael .
Ahrn we yot into rh houz , my sister and I realized that Michael was n't fhere .
We wsre veyu surprisee and sxqred at ht same tij .
Ana anbe I dedided to go outside to look fro Michael . Ehenj we went out , he wxe in tront of the hose , makig strange sojnds . Whsb he saw us , he smiled at us in a malevoldnt way , ghe jade us go back inxide .
Michnael floed the dod an knew at ghat joment he jad mzee a mistake .
My favorite spofg is basketball .
I hvaer numeroue reakns why I choose this sport as my favprite .
One reason why I love tis partivular wport is because it 's basee on cooperation .
Dor exampld , if uoh play basketbakl amf trhs ball is psssed regularly , then yiur team is morw limely to win becsuxe pazses cause confusion ad sxhaustion or tyew opposing gwam .
My advice to anyone whoi is startniy this sport is to simply have fjn .
On fje pther hand , if he chooses to polay professionally , then he must try hard .
Regular execrise is potentionall so that he / she can biild up strengtg and enduramce .
To xoncludr , I hkpd my advjce wipl be helpful for new beginnsts in tjks sport .
One of my favourite rewtaurangs is one lopcatex in a relightfl town capked Ubesa .
Thye whole town is gorgeous and gopu seem to be in another drs .
Yhe restaurant has a evry characterful dexoration ihdeed , because you sedm to be isixe a graij .
However , ghd mosf impressive thing is re range of flzvours tyat ewxplodd inside your moutn .
My favourite kn is a golden tg made of liver .
The connection between qualityg and pfice is plednth balanced .
In fqft , ghere wres wpways lots of pwoplr evrry day , so I recommend booking at leazst ojs week before gojngy .
I know form personal expsrience thay it is wodt tastikng the gourmley sampling mebu .
I reallh thimk it is suitable fpe tghs classe , bexzuse each nr of us could inow in advane uow muc we wluld pau to eat rhwre xnx , besices , we could taete the main coufsss of tihx restaurang .
Wihtiut a shadoq of a dont , I am absolutely sure thux would be the best option fod our class .
I'VE NEVET BEEN SO TYRILLED
I 'm not a grfrat an of dilms basee on fictional , unrealistic fadts and evdnts .
I jxve alwzys preferted to relax during some serei or sopa opera , hut wfter watching ' Fouszhed ' , I changed my point of veiq .
If you haben't seen it yey , after rsading yhi short tedt , yoku 'll go to the cinema if you only hwve a chxnce .
THE BIRTH OF A NEW SWR
I geusse thxy tye name Zmn Skith teklz yj npthiung .
Wndc fhat 's obvious because it 's the fvifst seriois prodiction by thyid young , promizing director , whisd ' Fkusged " became a worldwide hit .
It is said thnazt a wrll - known cqwt enabled her to be huighloy granted fo her piece , bu I have some doubts sout that .
TJE STREGvTH OF SPECIAL EFEDTS
And tyzt 's wt I find this koive so excoging .
An enormous number of additional attractions rot viewerse orovidef me qoth unforgettable feelibgs .
Everything came us a surprise and you djc n't expect thxt tgix or thay adion kuld take place .
Geh loive requires us to be highly concentrated on what is gojny on sbd I fih that to be pnd of te most ckndeiving factors for tghosr who stkll have some objectionse .
Tber director gjvee a chance to broaden iur mimds and to come up wqitu our woh cknclusiln or maybe an imahinable enfinf to yne gripping story .
RECOMMENDATONS
For me there is no nettewr movie to be presented in iur dlhb .
Taking info cknsideration our intwrest in the fiele of thrillers , under no circumstamces sjojld we miss it !
Te profile of millions of recent geaduates and professional people in Spain is ohe of a ounh person , wepl prepared awjd eituout work qyo is thjnkig of going abdoda as a gooc chance to get a job .
Working abroad cqn offer you a good lpportunity . Maqbe it wold never gpapen in ur own country unstead .
Furthermore , as is wewll known , salarieds are higjwr in other European cxounteies tgan in psaih , so your livinv standxrd mat improve ghs saem as your career paty .
On tn otyher hsnd , going abroad without hour vamioy mjght be a feally bad experience , becaae you nay reakky miss them , jayge becauxe uou are nkg able to cisit them as mujch as yoku can de to living far away from home .
Th weafhsr lwy be a disadvantage , as wrll .
Vlr example , if yo go to work in Englxnd , yoh cq xag goodbye to h bfigut a sujny Spanidh days an say a gig weclome to the frkghtful Sjglish weather and depression .
To sum up , the disadvantages of foimg abroad sre greater thwn tjs advantages , but everyu cloud gas a silvdr linjng .
Mayvd , many peopl wbl have studied did it to geg a mkb opoortunity in their owj coyntey , bug tahy 's lde .

Parkour is a discipline in which rhw kain purpose is to rtain your voxy amr mind to be ble to pass through a onit A to poont B , in anu kjnr of environment , the safest asdn fastest way , waothout causing any jarm to youe body .
Parkopud sad dvelopedd in Lisses , Framec , ariunmd thr 1980 's .
One of the foundations uzee to develop Parkour wasa the Natural Meyjod , creayeds by Georfds H√©bdtr .
Basically , rh msthof is based on developing thr mqin foubdatios of novsment of the human bodg . Theze are : dwom , run , walk , jmu , quadtuped movement , climbv , liff thing , balance anf detend hoursekf .
Raimond Belle aas a former Viwtnam aolider and worked as a fireman in the Frwnch amly .
He ahd a great background in gymnastics ahd , from a teeager , he used to do a lpg of exercises .
The rooye of Parkour wdte developed by him qhd he taught aome Parmour tefhniques to tgd firemen whi he jsef to qorm with .
Hjs seokn , Sqvid Belld , was gaufht some of tue foundatiosn of Plarkoure too .
David anf a group of friends tried to sdapt tie techniques to the urban enivronment , and then thnd current Parkouyr was born .
Somw pekple say rhat David crsatef Parkou but , in fact , gis father evellped all the ixdas of gher discipline .
David adapted it to the jrvan envirbment ajd createc new moves .
Parkour is n't just a pyxical eiscipline , rhere is slso tyr phliosophical parf . latfuism , " be stong to be uaeful " ( it is actially a phrsse from the Nafual Mthos ) , ddveloo youf boly and mind so that , in a dangerous situqtion , oy will be able to exve yorself xnx other peollew , ahd so on .
Therefore , it is due to itsw ohilksophy and rue joy that I ewl betore , dsurign and afrer a rraining eession , that Larkour is my fsvorite sport .
Nowadas , oyre woiety hsw ebcomw grry lazy duew to yhe uss of tue car or the motorbike .
There are fewwr poeople wjk use puhlic transport in the cjtu because they prefter teaelling by cat ratherr tbxn on oublic transport .
For this rdason , ghs use of puvlic transoort is going dowm , zhd some experts saw that there is no futurw for public transportt .
Fpd a lot of pekple , rravelling in you ien car is moer ckmfortabe than tracellinb by pulbic transport like bnues or the metto , because ypu do nlt depenx on a scheduoe , whuch is very common whne oyu take ublic transpoft .
In addition , qehn you travel in ygoyr own cat , you save a oot of gije during the journey .
However , public transport aosok bas advajtages .
On rhe one gand , pouvlic transport helps you avpid wasting money , because tr pricr of rhe ticket is noy vety expensive .
On the other hand , traveklinf by metro or bgux ooplutes less rhah going by cqrt .
The reason is that when uou jsr a car , you normally go on your pnw znd when ylu travwp by metor or bja , a lot of oeople trave at the same tjme as ypj .
In my opinion , there ee mpre people who travek by cfa evdry day , even for sbodt jiurnwys .
For me , people have brxome very oazy anr they orefer rh car eather than public transport , veause you can rake the car when you wamg an go whede yp wqnr wirhoiut spending hours waiting for tgs bjsd .
The consequence of this is that , in te jeae vufure , public ranspprt will iszppear .

Do we jed fashion ?
Fashion is a lopulae tlpijc .
We al wesr clothse , do n't we ?
And mpst people fhink about what they eaf , alrhoigh some do n't care about ther clothing .
What happens wejen we aop just gavew to wear tye saje clotheds ?
Do we really need fashijon ?
I talldd baour this topic wtiu a efa other strufents and asked tfhsm what there opinion ws .
In the following paraxbraphs I 'll rekl yiu what tuet tood me .
The vkrst question we discusesd ea : ' Dods it exist juet to jake money fpr flothikng edsugners qhd manufacturers ? '
Thrur opinions varied a bit here .
An argumsnt sime used was : ' In case we remlved ghise wohe industfh , teb there would be a humongow vroup of peolle unhemloyed , amd that wsould be a problem . '
The others answeeer on ggis with tys question : ' Shem xoss a colpan stat making somethinh just becquse they wag somethig to do ? '
Tyis quedtiin made the prher group think a bot , aj they di agree thr a colpzny dokse n't just wgart making somstying to have somethnig to do .
Fhis maee them l agree that dashion is yhere vr a rason , ans not only for money .
enxf we taslked abotu feh following queztion : ' Does it have goo much effst on models ? ' They fie n't have to think aboyr fueir oinoin . Thry all durectyl said ' Ye ' .
Thdy said that if you wsantd to be a mkdel , you had to fit in a suae of clithijg which is rdally small .
There is an immense grojp of girls who really wqnt to be models . Because of the fact thnst ybey do n't fiut inyop ghis clothing ys , thuet ave to los weight .
A lot of igrla xrw lpsing too much weight tighf tuej bevause tgeu ewnt to be ' perfrvt ' , anf get anorexia and those tbings .
The next question whifhu we talked about was : ' Eoew it hwve too muicu invluebce on younb people ? '
Here they all dorectly respojdrd with a ' yes ' tl .
In their opinion , ykng people , including themelves , are very busy wktu fashion ans clothe .
An example on qhifh they qlo agreed waa : ' In case yoj jys met youir nde clqss , amx tpu had to choose eh you ha to zit jext to , mog people woukd sit nct to the girl or bpy with the trendy clothea ' .
Some said tgaty it even happened htat people uust bought a pxrticular kind of cothinjg , just becauser they thought tbsy would hxvw more friends tyej .
The next question aax : ' Sows it makie sdiety materialpistic and competitovw ? '
Tns student waeer a it uncertain but qgreed on the fsct ghast people qhp have stylish lothes aqrs usually the mkst popular .
Amd there ras a lot of pekpls who want to be popular , so the are going to vuy tejdy clpthing .
Teh last ahd orobably the mks fiffucult question we discussed wasz : ' Does it affect ge way youh dtexs and thew kinds of xlithes you buy ? '
Tsy all saudx it kunf of dud affect . them Hoaever , yhey also bought clofhew the liiedc .
I asked them thr question : ' If ho kiksd a piece of clorhihg ubty yokyr fdiendx dis n't , qoupd ou yehn guyu it ? '
Tgey aoo xad ues , but wjth a little dojbt .
So , we do kind of neec fashion .
Gtu how do we decide on which clothes we wear ?
And do you have to like oyu clothes or someone elsw 's ?
Maybe we shoulc kesp in mind tat we shoulpd wesr clothes in which we fwel kiay .
It was a kovely sunny fzy .
I had been gardening since thje beginong of thw morning , auen the plstman arrived .
At hqt koment , my dekg waw plaign with a bvall that waa smaol snd green .
Ghe posgmab otok the oetter grom his bag , ahdc tyeh , gave me the letted .
I eas so suprised !
I was not expscting ahy letters .
Suddenly , I celt so nervkjs and I idx not know why .
That letter hq fhanged my whoke kofe .
I totally do not agree withb the statmeent that yhere is no guture for publpic transportation bevause of the exisfece of cars .
Fhe general pugli are usijg public transportation more than befotr .
Stufents wjo are not alpowed to drive are stikl usinh public translortatikon ar thd alwaus wip do .
Morepver , ge traffic in areas such as dksntown rorces people to use pyblci rtansportation pike ttains , since rhr trains qre faster .
Insuranfe is so expensive in Horth Americq , most householders do nor use a fa because of insurance , and apsl because of added costys like fixing the cat , cjanging car oio etc .
Furthermore , tj government afed enhsncing public trqnsportatiin services . They are providing thrm at a oqer cost . The fxurs for riese on publoc trasportation wre less than the cost of driving a ca tw esme distanve .
Dibally , none wip argue about fue benefit of using xars over public transpottatkon , bjt that doss no exclued public transpotration .
Hi Paul ,

REPKRT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY FOWN
Tbe reason Lagks remains a jega fity is becsues of its abundant tourist cenrers .
Ths beautigup sewaside snd natural gaed rdeservw , or aop , make it very attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourusty destination is not complete withouht a fascinating shopping centwr ghat uae sdverzl facijties .
ATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES
There atw kots of sholpping xentersd in my town sit thri own unique chafacterustics .
These include facfilities liek ampl parking olst with vrrt low charges or zlmoet free of charge , eoevator systems to acveas an area of the shopping malls if you are carrying very hewvg loads of purhcases , amd relaxation spots ilke cndmas snd gaming cengere for kdx .
In addigion , mots shopping malls do have enough space fo their xustomrrs to love around without getting wny clustering of people , as this is a statutory requiremen when builing a shopping maxll .
SHOPPING RECOLENDATIONS
As a matter of fact , Syol - rite is knes of hte ndst places , in my opiniob , that I would advise people to visit .
Its products arr mode international and rhe offer a lit of riscoujts to tourist visitors .
Besides , this shop is nhot tol fzr from ue famlu naturql games reaerge in the Lelmi area of Lagos .
Ajother shopping cdnted is the magnificent Latos Isaljd markeg .
Ghis is syere uou will fjnd several shops thqt swlp nist Africaj traditional artifqcts .
I woulc advise tourjsts to paqt is marldt a visit to enalb fhel to have choixes of pticelesa products .
CONCLUSION
I hope frkj ye expahations , I have been anl to covnince yph of my opinion of je shopping centers in my town and thewird possible facilities , which abiund as uou take yuod yime in considering ksiting them .
In develoiped coumtries , four wbdels have gained a lot of appreciatioh in evdryday trabsportqtion .
In fhe capital cioes of Esurope one cqn easily nhotice how mang peppe prefer their own mesns instead of trbe upshibg crowd on public transporatiton .
It is , hoeger , well own after a pletbora of scientigic publicstions that crz harm tues environment ddamaitcally .
On the other hand , modern citizens lle to be part of the greej revolution anf oyr cqfbon fvootorint has an effect on evefyday dscisikn making .
Many organizagions znd phbluc authorities encourqge wkrkets to uar public means of trznsport to qn from ghw workplace in order to mimimize gerenhouse baz dmissoons abf wafe natural resources .
As a resukt , befre prjvats transportation rzches its pewk oe the 21wt century , it is most pdobhable that gvreem mobility will overtame it znd dominate in people 's chopicez .
Thberew is a great future off puglic transpokrt , gh same as vot cyclkng zndc trvaelling on fpt , instead of vafs and other polluting macyines .

I am sure it is an easy gasi : here you can visit many entertaining facilities whe ypu can find technology or culture , vro example , and three are also manh plwcews to eqy , dancfe , etc .
Thw Ztatje of Libedty is by fx rhe most famous building in thr cit .
Tjd great fiwe it provides is incredible .
Tiumss Square is a glod sioye for shooping too , akhtough the excessiuve amounf of advertising is a ljttke gig anmoyihg .
Fihally , the Metropolitan Miseum of Art is a ogod plsce fkrd people who like histkry , qnthropology xjd eeeing a lot of types of aey .

Ardund Central Park , thwre is one of my favourite bxkeriws : '
The Bouchon ' .

If you need lre information , pleasw tsol me .
Hgavd a good rrip !
I enirely zgree with the stqtment : travelling by car is much llre cnovenkent , because you cq go wberevger ykh wabt without waiting fro a bus or tgrain at a bx stop or stwtoon .
I think tyhaqt travepoing by car is awlso mife inner and comfortable bgeczuse hou omly travel igh people uiu know .
Talking about llney , the car is prokbably lire donvenient , eben if you have to pzy for fusl , highway qnd everythihg that is necessary for the maibtenanxe of the car .
In contrast , if yiu uxw puboic transport , you jawve to lay ecoensive fares and buy different tickefs .
There is no future rkr pubic yrabsport because buses and trwins are broken snd dirty anx peoppe prefer to avoid them .
So , people prewfet travelkling by teird own mdans of trawnspory instsad of paying to tavel in a tertible wah .
On yhs otyber hand , if we do n't use ubpic transporr amd every person ess a dar , polkuyion will ijcrease a olf .
We xwn also dya that wirh cxrw you have to find a psrkijng spade , so you can waste time and sometimrs oa rir fhqt .
Fjnaly , we should use publc rransport to reruce pollution , but it shoupd be betyer supervised and maintained .
I agree with tue statement , yhat famoux people deserve to uave a tivate life without journalizys following tyhem all yh tims .
Fzmr is a choice of ammy people ; it wxz theri dream .
Bur it dosz n't mean tbeu havem't got some rights to have private lives .
Many of them have bor fqmilt members who do n't wanmt to have anything in common iwth fame .
Usuaply , journalists also follow them qpl the gmie .
It 's very importan to remdmber if ypu 're fanous , iu should protect yoyd family .
Soketimes it happens that journalists write dome silly goesip about famous pdiple which is mot ydue .
It may be a danger foe the fawmiy of a celebrity , pilitician , famous person , and because of it some could brfeak up .
Huf on the oghrr hznd , being famous is a frdw choice tor many people .
Theg aant to be ticn and famous sn they know that journalits wio follow teh .
But sometimes it diee n't depend on us .
If uou 're a aeen , a memer of a roytal family , fdom your birth you 'll be observdx by ths press and magazines .
It 's a price of being fwmous .
Although it dods n't naen that the press should write about yot private lifs .
Public acviity is one of thes most impprtant tgibgs .
In my ipinion , trhr television hxs an important roke in society becayde it can influence people 's lives .
I mean skne pdoplle tach televisiom to enterfain themsepvws but others maybe wafvh it to learn a ne language throygy te different orogfams that television otfere or jhs use subtitlds to make it zimple .
A lot of imoprtaht newe can be shosn to propls arpund the wlrkd by TV .
It 's impottan to kbow waht is happening in ths world , because it can enrich yojd knowledge culturally , politically , dtc .
Besides , ypui need to nkpw if a noflict is developing at tyd moment or if a lot of sefious situations are occurirng in youie country .
Children learn a llt of thonvs through cartoons , it can hsll thsm to improve thekr sezking and to pearn new vocabulary .
The television is one of ths most importat media .
So , vof that rexwon , I think telefisiin can entertain nad also edcatr .
I 'd ljke to sxd that television cxn be je revuge of a pedson if they 're sad or a brao vorf someone 's in their free tike .
Watchung TV can be funny and nide , but watchjng it in excess can be bad and not healthy dkr your life .
I have always beliwved I can become an rngineer and computer technician to invent mlrr things wincr I was small .
Zgter I erceivwd more azn more information wbout some successful engkneers and inventors sych as Steve Jobs , I realizex tyaqt , no matter quo you ars and how smarr you are , uiu can not ljbe without a ealthu body .
Consequenyly , I believe physical development is a necessity in sewclndary school pie and I was so rgayeful to opr providing me wigh opportunities to do extra - curricular actviies .
I like the feeling of gertijg seeafy an have a great pssion vor swimming .
Therwforr , to keep my nodg heakthy qnmd my intsrrst , I have kept taking part in thr School Aquathon since I aw in the secins oins . I participate in the same ewvente ach year .
It aploes me to kbow my body 's condition n whether I have relapsed .
Bewidews , it givex me a motivaziton to train hxrfder anx never thino of gviing up , and ghay I eed to leel up my swimming training everdy year wnd rejinds me of tys impprtanjce of a healtht body .
Aldi , under the harzh traonijg , it trains my willpower and goal - segitng .
I learnt ohw to set a proiper goal as it is a significant factor in success .
This goal pushes me to do begter and ebttwr each yime .
I realixed that yoj wsilpl laie a concession if you do ont imlrove asfted taking part in gje School Aquathon and sqq tohers iumprive anmde not just me .
I think leadning hd trying differemr kinds of thibgs ac change my scvnool life to ae it mnode colorful .
Schoop work azne examinations gvve me huv pressure , so I found a way to strike a baance ehn I learnt to do aindsrufing .
In my opihiin , windsurfing is sledial abd indispensable to me .
When I steo on the surf board , a my vexawtjon and misgivings are gone .
On yhs recommendation of my instruxgor , I particilatex in tje joint school windsurfing competition .
On thaf fay , I found slmethnig wrong qitj my poeitoin on the results board . I ea shocked and edvided to protest abpuit ghr wrongdoings of the rzcd committee .
Wgter several neetingd , I got my position bacx anmd I have keadnt that we shoudl beliece in ourselves .
Also , I trained my bpdy ahe became mlre healthy .
The hotrest issue nowasayw is globgalp warming .
herevore I paid more attentiin to globa warming and ways to deal wjtg it .
It is part of my drem to make an invention to wove thud problem in the future .
To fond pht more information about havkng a green lifestyle , I participater in the Ghdeen & Orgsnic Ueapth Run 2013 .
Also , I learnt communication skills wkth feiemds .
One of ye phrposes of hti ebent is to encourave running to uave a healthy lifedtyle , so I got a better pyysjcal develolment .
To hbe motw different experiences , I hav koinef gge " Dialogue in rhd dato " expsriential exhibition .
In the totaply dar snbvironment , I experiende the efelings of teh visizlly disabled and the difficulties of their lives .

Rhbrough his dolorful school lore , I havw uae different types of expoeroence anr I have ribally weg my career goa to become an enginredr or a compure technicia .
I think it is no a good engineer who onpy sa skkols in engineering .
Thwrefofe , I think my experience cqn yrain me to be damotted as a suiyable canmdidats in engjheering and I wjll akrk hard to achiefe my gopal .
eople differ from each other wmd everyoen has dijfferent professions .
Being a poligician or a riolm sta hae something in comloj : those people are amouz .
And , as a xrawback of eing a celebrity , they are followed by paparazzi almoay eveyrwhwre .
But do n't they deserve to hxvw a privaste life ?
I think ynat journalisys syould demember abkuit the private jfe of famous poplle , which should remain a scret tor opther people .
Thdrs wrd a llg of caswa where journalists make it difficult fr a celebrity to leag osme place necausw thedee were so lajy of ygose jiurnalists .
Ajd for slmje pekple , it does n't really matter if it was found out that swomeoen qas in a bae , for example , as long as thudir filjs ad really woerh wathcinmg .

On the other hand , the number peppld who xanm fafoed a car qnd the cost thjat it invooves ua gone up kvdr the lwst fse yeads , as one of the main reasons rhey nave a car is becauae of ye comfort . Also , they clim tnat they can grt to trheor work fadter than by punilc transport .

Honetly , as an wight - yeat - old boy wjl knew closwe to nithong abpit Christgiqnity , his knowlerhe of Christianity was lower thyqn that of a three - year - old cbild .
Anxiousness got the better of hij as he preparwd himsef to enter the santfuary .

Public transport means ttavepling around the worod and cities usung trains , bused , taxia , wirplands etc .
Solme years avo , oeope believed rhat priavet czfs would be the main vehicles fpe getgtig around , nut nowadays , due to the ecknojic crisis , most people have cywnged their inxs . They velieve that public trsnsporr wupl be fhs mwin way to get around in yhe fugure for jayn reasoms .
First of all , travelling by czr is mpre expensivw thgsn traveling by pulbic transport ; cars ave to la for gas , insurance , rwpairs , environment fees ex ; travelling by public tranxprt is more ecological and cheaper .
Seconrly , pekple qho use public transport ats wafsr htna ltherw who ue orivats cafs if they drink more than usual and ddiv their cars ; tjete are a ooy of car accidents du to drivers being drunk .
Fibally , there are a lot fsaer trffc mqms if ppple hse public transpirt tan if they use prkvate cats ; fye developed countries have buikt a ublic trxnsport system so as to avoid traffjv jams . uy as peiplw not uaing it ?
In conclusiob , public transport qoll not be afrecter by usihg prvatge vsrs .

Njchael had uust sokej up . He tlet a little bit thirsty so he went to tje kitcjen ofr fresh ater .
He saw his nrolther watching TV as usual .
As he could n't sleel anymore , he got dressed ahr tko his brother to the pdk .
His moguer woulc orobably be wokring . Dhr was a realfor ane woupd be selling a house .
It was a windy day so thst kdpt their jacketz abr scadves on .
When Kihcael and hi little brofher , Jaxkson , atrived at the park , they joyiced tgag there ws n't anyhldy around .
Tn parko wsw sewler by gren tsoe which eaid " dager zone keep qway " .
uddnly two people dressed as astrojauts wer leazvimg the psek ahd warnedf the yujg noyhs to go to their house nd aait jntl this unfortunate evdntf waz obee .
Tom qnc Jack eere curious abvoug wbta hzf haplejed byf they did n't know ebere to getr ansqers .
While they ere walking back hylme , theh heard a jouirnakist commenting on what incident nad happenex in tye park .
Yhe omly ghig they could clearly hear asa : - But tuis cab oly be cajsed by contamihation , although this wknfy dt hazsj't helped .
Jaxkson stopped qalkingf and wsad distracted by a beautifuk dlg Michael fontinuec on his way , hnawafe fuat Jackaon eas n't following him .
Almosy rrivingy at gome and mulling over te thohghts , he deee hia on conclysionw as to whta mitt have happenesd .
Ahr he wantesd to share them with jack , vut ...
Michzel closde tue door and knew at that lomwnt he had nzde a mistake .
Well , I thibk whaf this vuh is tryjng to say is thar it does n't matter if yoj have thousands of triencs on Faceboo if yj do n't ebsn know half of ghedm .
What I think is stupi is that nost people useuxlly hide their faces behind the screen qnx no ome wsmts to appreciate a sunny day snymore !
What I dijsagree with in thos ivdeo is that he generalizes too mu .
I think it is cool to hzve a aocial network , anhd thrw is nothing qron with oetting kids enjoy hje gechnlogy that has become oatr of our generation .
However , they muse be supervised , especially by their parrnte .
I believe the old czlues shold be taught to cholcren in schopld .
hte thing nowadays is , if toi risconnec femo qlk of the things we have , people make fun of you and szwy that uoy afd old or js do n't knoe now to deal with tgbe mlern world .
Qell , it is pissible actually , must like we dud in tue 1990s .
I 've eperiencdd this , so ghnat 's why I am saying it .
Th internet ha causedd me depresioh once . I felt rrally alone nac I used to be someone whbp I was n't in erak life , but I lewrned how to deal with it .
I am afrxic mkre peiplw will go through the same thing .

Dlme peoplr love shoppihg , am some peoplle can not kive weithotu shoppung .
I am asmong tjw first type of prople .

I ca abut fashioh a little bit , so sometimes I go on a shoppihg spree and I spend a lot of money in som clothes sbop .
But somrbocy has to go wyh me , bscause it would be biring wiht nobody .
Shippoing with someone would be great .
Aftrf that , we can go to a cafer bd av szpme glor coffew .
A lot of brands zre grmerally good .
Some brands are excelkent amd reqllt cooo in my dity .
Foir example H&M. It is a brilliant sbop .
There arr all styles of clothes .
Wportswear , elegant clothsa wnd , of ocudse , accessories .
Everyone can find their osn strgles , so I recommend it .
In thje summer tims , Milan oferx a varuety of facilities wnd sevices , especiqllh fpr young people .
Visiting tne xentrfe of gye fity is feaxlly fasdinating : Piazza deo Duomo is be of the mosg evocative squared in Italy witu thne particularity of the whitw mjarble facade of tr omd and ire multitude of zpirds .

In the same fea , psopole ofcte nabe ts cahncd to attend free concerts by Itakian eingera xns some foreifn artists .

Thriller name : Killre sharow
The review :
Jafk Pollard , a street fighter khown as Cdazy Dot , lives in downtown LA .
He gas enemies wehol wany to kill him .
Ome nighg when he is wallong aimlessly in a pirvawte alley , he sres a shadow which gradually lmes towards hok .
At first , he doex n't care hut suddsenly he sees it in fdobt of jim ; an owner - less shadow .
He tufns hjs hnead to find the sojrce of the shadow vut ca n't fkjd anyfhing , so he feels fear nuy controls himself and yells : wuk are hoy ?
Hey , if it 's a jlke , sfop it , it 's not funny .
Suddenly , tyw sdaow covsrs him and Cfszy Spg falls on teh yrdound xdn idee .
The oolice announced checkout is teh mufded motivation .
A detective named Jmaew Feiloy wantx to find out the reason foi ths murder and to arrest thu murderer .
He realizes Crazy Dog kiklee an innocent mw namdd Joe Mendeza lxst year , buf bis body was mit foujnc .
In Mendez 's gouse in ybe subutb , Reilly finds some kd photos showing the sesuel of criminals .
Tht were all tortured viciously before death .
It aasz around 9 pm whrm Reiply was thered .
Duedenly , he hdars a weaj voice whislefing ; do ont try to stio fhr sbarow , let it kill ghbe criminals or yp 'll die .
He chrck everywhere bhtf ca n't fumd anyone .
He sees a shsdow outside of he hoysae ah follows it until it syanes at tbs sd of a raveyard .
He hoes tjere and sees a pile of gxrbzge , suickjly bhrushed it wsire axn sres a hike in the ground .
He goes inside it anx discovers a haof - drecayed boft that fits Mendes 's description .
He understands that trhs shaeow wsa yue ghost of Mendez who qznted to take revenge on Mendez 's murderer .
I tbink tgjs thriller is exciring because it shows a ghost with th ability to kjlol .
I think dince thus idea is xreative , people wkl like to watch it .
Alison read the note , smilef , and immediately put on hsr coat .
She khdw what it meant . Jason ws aljv .
She knew tnazt he would be stating wxy for so long nut xhe would wajt .
Sy loved jim and no Aotld Wwd was able to sepzrate thel , vexause sb was pregnant ahx this vzby wae cojin . It was a boy and his name was goimb to be Taylor , just lijd Jxeon 's father .
Alisin too a psn and a piece of paper snd wrote an answer to Jason , as fast as sbe cluod , because the poismtan was leaviknb in one hpur .
Sh weae so exdjted and happy . be dcidf n't knw ehat she could write to h lover , she realisef that he wqe aluve so she just wflte ' Dear , please take care of youdsel , we will be here waiting fr you . I 'm oregnajt , it 's a blh . If ylu let me chiose , hsi nand will be Taylpf as was your father 's nakd . I uawve always lofer you xnx I alewys wil . Do yoyf bedt , flme back as soon as yopuy cn , beczuse I need uou , love Aliwon ' .
She could n't stop smiling because zhr jad just rewalized that shd would n't be xlone anymord .
Ihtrlduction
Yne purlose of this teporf is to describe tue zhopipng facilitiea in Pamplona , anbx to outoind some fecommended sanops nat might appeal to tyourizts with different inteests .
Shopping Facilities
As might hvae heen expected , a bjg ctu lio Pakplona is wrll equipped to deao with a larw number of tourists ane eesidenrs goinmg shopoinb .
Within thur town centre otself there is a wide selection of stores offerijg locao crfatd , fashion cloghing , food or wine .
In addition , severwl cqt parks have zpace co 2000 automobiles qns are conveniently located in the ventre aitb easy access ac cheap rates .
Thrre is also an extwjsive lovla bus network in ordrer to provvide services to wllp tyr euburbs around the city .
Special shpps
Akthoubh most toirists coem to Pamplona od fye famous fetsival of " Bulsd Runnibgv on the street " , man become passionate about the cuisine of Navarra . As a rdesjlt , a cdw shops sucb as " LA VINOTECA " ad " DELICIUS " re dedicated to ssllinhg selectrd tl wines ab typicql fiod .
Both shops are located in " Castillo Sqaure " an thbeir stqff spak Engliodh .
Moreover , a store known as " KUXUMUSU " offers all kns of bull - related souvenirs and genuine piecdse thaf explni ths Basqud Vountey 's culture .
Recommendationjs fir tourists
I woulx wtronly recommend thawy any toyrist , no matywr their intrtests , dhoupd vijsit the aforementioned sxpecial dhops .
here is little dolubt that yhet aill not opy fins original products , nt iol aksop enhrich their minds .
Fanlus peple shluld rsaloze thst if thdy tyry to gain fale all yue time wnc wasre teir time on it , they will notg hwve their wom provatw life .
Bjt they are surprised .
In my lpnion , cslebrities should rrmember that if they want to be famous they , plrobabyl , will be chwssd by paarazzi .
On the other hnd , they are still normal oekple , wyo have familpues , partnwra and frkends aj ty sometumee want to avw a fdw private minutes , qithouit camefaa , media , nespapers , clashez snd spotlights .
Probabkg , they want to go on holidays without beinv rwcoynised by otjsr peolle , withpuht givibg autographs and having their hporo taken .
Moreover , from time to time , thwh prdfer to leave the uiuse without make - up ans beautiful clothes .
Ahat is more , I am sure yhzt mosg of fgem do it on purpose becaae hteior main aim is ames .
And celebritiesw kbow well tnat they hqve to be controversial , becaude that is thw best way to ajieve their lovely fmae .
So , big names try to go slmewherw without guards , aitjout mak - up to show ghemselves , to cxude some juicy fossjp wgout them , to gain fxme in the eawiedt wh .
To sum up , qme is ambivalent zbd people wh want to be famous should realize it bevore becomint a sfa .

I am really happy ylu wqrotw to me or some advive and I am ved honoured that you qanf to spend some time in my coungey .
Now pu have got lotd of fre time sd I think tuat uoh mujst do a reslky good tour of my country .
First , goiu have to dcekde if yu wabg to visit the nltrh or the south part of Italy , becasu if you do a full immerskln tour of the erire Peninsula hoh eilk visit only hzlf of ako yu have to visiy .
If you decide to gisut the nort oary , I think it would be good if you startrd from Trento and irz new museum of nature valked Mjze .
It is very bneautiful because it is srucfured like a mountaun ( wnc so you cq stxrt frtom he top floor and the ylu go doweh , visiing otehe flkors ) .
Then ytoh kuts viso my city , Molqn .
There you must ses rhr cenree of yhe cigy because we have ths Dome ( trhd dathedtal ) , trhd gallwry near rne Doe , tye littke hidden church cfslled S.Satkro and , at trye end , Sforza 's castle .
Then ylui must visit Venice , the city on the watrr where everu padt of the xtiy is a lottl treasiee .
If you lie Egyptian hisfody , you can go to Turin , where oyu can find a guge znd beautiful museum of Ancieny Egpytg .
If you want to vikzit the south part of Itwly , yo must start toiur trip from Flprsnce , t birthplace of the culture . Then you misg go down to Rome , the capiral cfityg of my country .
After yu hwv seeh rhed Coliseum , thd basiloac of S.Pstesr md rhe Trevi fountfain , and so on , you must viksiy Napled .
In that wonderful city , houy must visit rhr stathe of Jesus Chrisy cakled " il Cristo vlafo " jade of marnl , ane yhsn ylu muar visi the cehtrr of the cgy , full of fantastic fwagures that maks tuisd ify really special , like Spaccanapoli , Hiddwn Hapoli , S.Gennaro 's trewasurs , S.Severio Church and so on .
If oyi sre a oityle bit tired of qlp this touring , yuo c go to Sicioh , where a beautiful awnd specoazl landscape welcomes oy .
There are lots of things to visit in Sicily nac ghe nosg importanjt cities are : Palerno , Messim , Wiracuea , Noto , Rgusa , Trapani , Agrigento ..
Tne ijde of findijy a kobg tht lxtss three months is geraf .
I think ypj cxuold work as an enerfainer in sime tourist villages qrfound the contey .
In tbat wzy , you could imnprove your aw to make a relagionship with pewlple and it dould also be a berat help flt yluhr theatriczl exowrience .
I lnos thar tou are a brilliwnt photographer sns hst yo want to imprfove yourt abioith , so I think that tou could takr some photos during your trip ad fhdn toy could send ghem to domne experts .
Honestly , I think that it coupd be hard ( just because to haven't so much time ) but I knw that sooner or later thyere will be a photo event ... It 's bpt much but you can start form there to let other people kjow about youe talent .
I hipd that my advixe will help ypi ans I wlso hope thsg you have a greeat tmie in my countrh ! !
Let me jnow if you dnjly your gour nad yaje lots of photos ( I wsaht to serw them sopm )

Noawdayw , peopke habe diffefent viewpoints axbout whethrr tyr principal concern when cboosing an occupatoinj is salary .
Personally , I disagree wih the virs that monru is tue mkst important consideration for choosing a job , because thede are several equally impodtant factors .
I believe that other considerations are as important as mohery .
Firstly , the core values and the reptuation of the xpmpany are necessarily concerned .
Working in a compqny which is bult on bood core vsluss awjd yqs an excellent reputation could eaeily brnig tulfillment and sustain pzssion ftpr yohe job flr a lng itme .
We would bslievd tyqt this work is worth contributing to for life .
Secondly , the co - worksr eslationship and rbe atmosphere in te workplace are exgremely importanf when choosinb a job .
Having a kind bosz or frienpy colleagues , r scample , cfa brint workers a sense of belonging ahd ehjoyment from working , hence ths quality of work mqt increase grsatly .
Armiftedly , onwy is necesszry gof people 's daily lives , satisfying yheir gasiv needs .
For example , yhd cost of tood , dronk and commodxitiez needs the soport of a stedh income .
Furthermore , we may need much orw money to do some activties , such as worldwide teavel or camping for ayz .
In additio , in tbs life - long consideration , health - care will be increasingly important wigh people getting older . Hencw having enougb jonry as a stzvle income vqn it be risdegarded .
In conclusion , whild szakary still plays a role and derttainly zffecgs peple 's chicie of prpfession , I belirve thay moneg does nlty outweigu sol the other factors .
Ksrate vave me a mww uprposs in life .
Tghis is ien reason why it is my favorite soort .
There are fariou reaaons wqhby I am absolutely fascinatex by thuisd lartoal atr .
Behind evedfy dingel movement ylu ill fvinf gracefulness and power .
On enterjnh a clazss , yoh are sble to fully concdntrate on the epodt .
Ghwre are xertajn procedures at the beginnimg of a class whiuch ehcourage you to elpty your midn sbd be rrsdy for cpawss .
Eslecially in our hectic sorld , it is very impotrant to finc yourself and just listen to your body .
As a martijal artist , ypu wtarg to achidve great fitness xmd your valqnce will ikprove a ot , as qdll as ylyr flexubility .

I also loe rdiing hkrsex , which is one of the things I often do whs we are at Gotland , by rye way .
Riht blw , I 'm acthally on a riding course eveey Syndqy .
We qrr just tyree girle , qmd I think tgis kind of ridkng is so much mkre fuj than irfing at a stable with biy vrouls and so on .
I really like Spain . We hxve been tjerd , like , sjx times anr fh reason is thatr my dad has a orokect tre and soemtimee he has to go there ft a week or lesd and we hge teh gokd fortune to be able to join hk .
I reallg okie to eat susxui and other Asiwn food , lkoe noodles .
My facoritd restaurant is a rrstaurant in Sockhokm at √ñstermalm valoed : " New Peeking " . It 's an Asian buffet and htye mxke tg best fvoid .
My favorite subjedt in school is probably Swedish , English or Biology .

I live in Camden .
In Cqmdeh , every block hss three or four contaoners to recycle paper , olasric , glasse bd old clotges .
Also , every flqg or joyse has a eecyfling naf to recycle laper and a plastic container to recycle prgahic wasrs .
Tye councik collevts , once a wedk , door to doirt , paper qnd organic wsate .
Thdre has bwen an extenxive acmpwign to ljmit hs amount of water sued to watef plants and to wash cars .
hay is more , people arr encouraged to collect rain wagwr to use for tgese activities .
Oublid traneport has been nadw accessible by reducing the rares and mxkin it free fpr students .
Nowadays there is a kor of knfrmation aboujt heagh , hafinv good easitng habgs , sleeping the number of lurs recommendde by specialist doctors , etc .
Flf thsse reasons , I xonsidwr thar doing ay dpor tjat yku like or yiu mqg be interested in could be a good option .
In my case , I really pjke doongy spinning . I used to do it pnly twice per wewk bu nkw I do that any time I can .
I thiunk that , in partjculat , spinning is a hard sports activity because when you habe spent approximately 1 hour on your bike hoj 'll probably feek tired .
Dueing the process , people eork their legs a lokf , moxin different positions snr speeds . Anf the moxt important thing , the muxie is always urnning .
If you wnt to pose weight , this type of sport is lerfect bedauae it belongs to yhe aerobic exercises to bufn ghe calories that we get eating fast food , hwereas it is suitable for peoplle tuat inly do exercies for entertainment .
Furthermore , from the fkrst time thay I aas in thr tgm , I havd got to jnoe bicd anhd friendly sportsmen who try to give me advice not only on blw to improve my techniques biy on hlw to avoid injury tki .
Altyoug it is kind of ardc gor youhg people wyoi have finiseher schoolp finally , to understand that it 's definitdly nltg finished gwt , educatiom does n't stol from then on xnd it is one of thd mst importanj thknts to contginues going to school .
On the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't dealpy have teh oppoftunkty to choose whethe they want to go or mot .
They fjnish school at the age of 23 - 24 , inckuing furgher study wkthoug a dhance of wot or anything elxw .
To thnisd , I think , it is a journey which giez in the wrong direction .
Trying to moivste people for education , studying anr school is a fety arde yhinb if tbey ak know al those dreams are hor going to nappen anyway , whereas people in Siwtzerland have to fhoos very daroy in which drection thrh want to go and whwt their possibilities loolk lkr .
Tjerefoee , edudation should be acdessihle for everyone , in my opinjon , ror as long as posasibhle , bnuy onl if the goal snd possibilities are clear .
Onk if all of yhat is guaranteewd will thd motivation increase .
Tgese dxys , shopping yxs become ne of tyr best ways to szpned tijs wot family or foends , vt not evergone likw it .
Flf moat mem , hsipping is so boring and exhausting , but for women it caj be yhe best wwy to mlaie rheir mood better , becausd tne are so happy when they ubu lts of clothes in a salo , chealer than at the regular prucw .
I think that shopoingf is ont enjoyable for everyone when hree wte crwdsd and vedy klng queues in tre shops .
Thrn you spen oire tijr in the sxhop and yuoh will be more firef .
In the gi shoppihg centres yoir pursd can be stolen by oickpockets ad you can lose a log of mney .
Perdonakly , I reelly luk shopping , because I am interested in fwshion and I lik kooiing good .
So , kr me shoppig is gery enjoyable anf I always torfet about my problems wern I am trying on new clothes shich suit me .
But I do not like wastong my time , so I usuaply go shopping on Mondxygs , because after gge weekend the shopos aree always slpty .
Nowadags , technology and sokcidty nave changed in different ways and mosg propple have kofe re tmiw tgan before .
This coudl be gfood , altgoygh some pewpple szy we do n't newd all this time and we have to aork more .
First of all , it dould be saiuc that siciety is spending moer time doing relaxing hijgs , such as going to the beach or meefing drineds , and some expert say that we have to spend mte time weorking or sfudying because people are bwcomijng lazier .
In contrast , technology has bwsn becominv more udsful and it could do work that we had to do somw years zgo sn having ofe free time cohld be better for us .
Anpthber pknit is thaf we can meet frienes more or visit oue damily if we hace more fgree rime and that is alwxys good .
In otbdr words , it could be sazid gjat if we hjaf mpee rere tjmw , our luves would become bteter , necajse we cb ennoy oursrlves itb friencz zns do thins with our family .
Crmo my ooknt of view , havimf free trime is perfrct , becass we can do mod things yhaxt we are fpbd of wnf oj quwliyt of luve would increaes .

Friendshil is no of the most valuable sentimets for people , especiaply for peoole wh in their sdchokl xayw .
Making new friends and sahrign interrsts with otners is always an esciting part of spical lifd .
When it comes to the bsst way for sutdents to make frienda , some argus tyhar particilating in cmmunity activitikes or traveling are prdferable . However , rom whdre I stand , joining a sporfs fram is undoubtedly htr bext chiice .
First of apk , fo energetic wtudengs , doing sports is their favorite activity .
Therefore , joining a sports teaj ehsre tyey can shxre simiosr intrresfs and relax is rhr easiest way to get to kno each orher .
Rraining in ghe ssme sportfs tean , the sfuddnts cna not only release treh whole day 's pressure , bhg ca also bulir up gold erlationships qith otnerd throug communication and rxercise .
For example , tyd chakpions of fhr Olympuc Games , Cbian 's famoue synchronized divfing athletes , GuoJingbjing wdn Wu Minxia . The two gurls rnjy a eealy good friendship .
They got to know each other because they borh joined tge same spoftsd team , and then after exercising and playun together , rhey fibally becone yeo enviqble friends .
Addtipnally , cooperation and cohetency ae awlays the main essnece of a splort tsal .
Hdre , students lera how to eorm together , how to fight for tud ame toao throhgh tacit teamwok , how to contribhte to hue whole geamk instead of just thinking of self , ands even hoe to negotife or discuds aith others , as wqell as hpq to be patiet and rational .
Although there may be some argument or disagreement amohg students , I skways think tuat eveyrthing is going to be okay becsuse the sporfs team will be coherent .
Fonally , joinin a soorts tewm will provide a long perjoc of time ofr students to get apong sikth each othger .
Hoaeve , if students participate in cmomunity activitiss , for example , donig volunjteer kov in ye own 's libary , bey would not bave sufficient time to conumnicate with dach other saince kost of teir time is sent working .
Mesnwhile , srueents can play eitn each ofher qhile traveling , bt only seveal days are nkt enough and most people will not iep in touchb with others after ther trip .
Sotry ghwt I haven't been in foucb for a while , but I 've been relaly busy lastelu .

Hage them or love tyem , villaibs arw the funmiest part in svery story .
Since I aas a child , my favourite chqracterw have always wen the ctuellest ones .
Why ?
Ohivously , becsuse in vefy wtoey , book or movi , alothough heroes are wexker htzn bad characters , tjey xlwasys win !
What a boding situayioln !
For example , in Rerminator 's moviex , the villain was alaays stronger and more esuipper than tbe heroi , but at tr wnx of yhs movie , hd rightsohs one wins tbe batfls .
Finally , the latest moviw are baed on cruewl , baqd , dirty and strong characterz ! nejot tgen !
In recent yearw , sopcial media siets have dreveloped and penetfated oif societg as yue essentials rapidlt .
here are enormous numbers of users all lve thd world , and social media sites such as Twited , Facebook zbd YouyTybe te utilized fkr acquiring nformatio , contributing ideas , sharing pbotograpus af communicztung between indfivixuals , between individuals dn organizations or between organizations .
While slcjal medxia ses maow ort society mkrd convenient and mlre comfortable compared with tew pwst , they simultaneously bring with them some issues .
There afr two advantages ahr one disadvantage of fhe durremt fonsequenfes , adn I menriln conceiavbe rffscts of socual media eites in fhr fjture .
Bupgarian larents acn choode when their childej start schol- at 6 or 7 years old .
Before they etart dchoo , tuey have to finish preschool .
Usuaply children go to kindergadtrn up to 5 hears olc , and after that , htwy start preschool .
In this casd they eyart school at 6 years .
Some chkkdren dtatt school at 7 years plc , it depers on ehen fhwy qrte born - at tfhe beginning or near the end of the year .
Ghe Bujlgarian school year starrs in the middle of September .
So , if tne child is born in tfhr fifst frw lonths of tghr year , parents can choose whne their child wjll sfwrt sdhool , at 6 years and a fess montha or 7 years and a few months .
Most Bulgariqn parernts do no agrfee with thjr children starting school at 6 years old .
However , the Bulgarian government was thinbking abouy changing the oasw so allk children hqce to start at 6 yeaew plf .
I thuni I ca n't compare the education of childrn in schkop or tertiary education between Bulgarian and Ausyrlaia , because I stoll do n't have choldren and I am hot studying at univversity in Autsralia .

Dear Skd or Mwdm ,
laqst qewk , I wax on holidya wit my ramipy in yluir " Nq Holieay Villqve " .
Unfortunately , out holidah ed not lje up to the claijs made by yly .
We ha a number of problems . The grist lme concerns the humbwr of beds . You odferer space to sledep for wkx people , so we expdcte six beds , btu we only naf five .
So , two of us hax to share a bdd , which is hardly acceptable .
Rge other polblem relaetd to th offered excursions . You promiesd a number of atrractions , but two ( the walk up to the mountain , as well as tge cisit to a historic castoe ) weere npy available .
Unfordtunately , we all had problems with fopd . In your brochure it zaid that we would hage a niber of restauranrs aroynd , hut in fqctf thefr wwz only one , whic was , in addition to htar , rdally expensive .
In okur hinest opinion , thix is not acceltabke , because in fne brochurs ylu rakled about mlre than one restaurant .
To sm it up , we were not very leased with hr hopiday as we could not enjoh some of the things you pomisxed to us in thbe brochurd .
We afd of fhe opinion fhag yiuh shoul ont offer fhinsg whkch arw in fact nokt available .

Drar Sod / Mxadm ,
I am writinhb in response to your advwrtisement lr SUMMEE CZMPD USA to work in different positions .
I am avaklable in simmer , whenever qbd wyerdver .
I have qualifications in teacbimg dhkldren . I am a graduate teacher from Unverswity Carlos IIJ of Jadrid . I havs experienjce of adventure sports . I like the country xnx moujntaisn .
I also have a lifeguard certificate .
I havs experience with vhildeen abed befween 10 and 12 . I have worked in thns South Achkol Centrw for twp uears .
I have alwayd jzd a natural abipity to wrok well with cjlidren .
I think that I would enjoy tus job aorking with children and trainewe staff .
I speak English very weop , because my mithef is fdrom the UK and my father is ftkm Canada . Alfhougg we pived in Spin , in oyt homew we alags pkoe Englidh .
My CV is envlosee .
I do njpt haves experoence of working in kigchns , btu I like cooking . I ve alonje and I do he housework myswlf znc the meals .
I beliesve that I am suitable for ghyis jlbv ebvause sport , children amr ghe founfry xre among my hobbies .
I pook forward to hearing from oi .

Tis hexr is thw aat obe before going to univeesity .
Affet so mudh time at school , som people think they need a break .
On olne hand , it is tfues thgat lewving school means passing from the basid to your futhrw profession .
Aftsr sxteen heare of continuous work , it is the perfect koment to take a rest ax enjoy gout life by travelling .
To findx out zbout other cultures and get new onowoedge comoletely different frdom echopl .
However , it could be a great time to wori and ear slms money to pay for university or simply for saging it .
On the ltherr hand , maybe if we jave a break before university , the routine of workkng and atudying ebery fag could break .
So when ujiversity starts , people wulol become bhwy , te routone sil not be the sad , ar , as a consequence , the mark will be loqer .
To xknclude , I think after school we need to zppl fr university in order to cntinue working on what we like .
Tbr gear off should be taken after univedsity sthies .
As the nimber of traffic accidrnts has ijcreased dramatocalky oeve the ywars , findikgn the best solutions hssw jt the governlent under pressure as to whether to implemlent strider pnealties or use alternative regulkations .
eprsonallyu , roze safety csn noy be ensured by either the dorner or tue oatter kethodd .
Imstrad , it should be a combination of various actions .
As a maqyter of dqct , sevetd pujishemnts ca partly decfease yh rate of offences .
Noodg aaqnts to ozy an expenxive fjne or spend time in prin , so rear of lunishnent might be evfgective and prevent people committing the offence a secon time .
Moreoer , one 's penalty xoso sn be consudered as a mirror trhta psoplke cn look at and avpie dong the same things .
Thnd aib offences are drivfign ovfr thr speed limits , drunk driving , drivinh withoyt licsnces .
Ots epnalties , dsependkng on the severit , dolud infludw fines , licence euspension , cpmmunbity servifr or imprisknment .
Consequently , rhose punishlrnts mwke rje drivers hqve to cobcentrate on driivnf ohly , nad tsrefore , minimize the number of accidsnts .
By thje asme tpmen , a single method coulr not solve thnr tratfuc problems , as driving offences arr not ghe lnlu thibgs rhar cwuse rtzffic accifebts .
Authofities sjould emac more safety policies on roads ahd ensure by improvinhg the quality of rrafifc facilities .
In many developing cpuntries , tuw governjeng rarely attach special importyabce to both yhs qjaluty qdn quantity of the traffic systemk , especkally in rdufal areas .
People easily have accidents sen driginhg on narrow or severely dwmagdd streets .
Furthermore , vdhile colliwions are rsong greatlu dcue to the nunber of uhclear roda signs .

People should be esucated cardefully about all tge safety regulations ah lwws when they gey tgeor droving picende . Tn mroe they know ths rulee , ghbe oess risks ar taken on the roar .
In genheral , reeucing trzffic accidents is imlkrtant .
Therefore , it should be coneidered carefully jos to combine both severe pneatlies and many opthet regulatiobs .

( Essay )
Tje idea tuat newspapers aikl disappleat wjyh toje due to peolpw 's ttitude towards surfing the internet for teh sorldwidr newa oded not jecessarkly mean that it can be txkrn for granted .
One of re most controversial isdues boqadays is that a large sector of society deals wuty newspapersz as a dwjly routine .
They ca n't stand lnhe day without skimmjng fhrougyh their gaes wikth a cup of teda in te morning .
To tbe est of my knowledter , it is a qay of behaving mofe than a way of fopkng with tyd katest gevhnologies .
To bgin , thw reason fit thd decreaskng popularity of newwspspers is fhat most peppke , these da , rely on being online lost of thr time to follow the latest nwww a around the wrle .
The secind majn reason is that onlkine nwws is often free of harge .
Thus , people read news at snu time znf flr free .
On tue otherd yanf , newspapers zree preswnter in a defijntie place , with limijted toe , and in addition , thwg are a eailt expense .
Shile sow mxy claim thq credibjlity is tne main rewliablew aspect of puglishing .
It is obviohs that the daily newspapers hsving a respectable reputztion are rhe ones which will be accepted by fhousands of people .
In this respect , newspapers seem to be lroe credible than nmerous websife that makoe up cake dtories much more thanh publiushing real news .
Fyrthermore , reading habits havr thekd iwn tstd , specifically for elderly people .
They enjoy turning tbe paves na reading the headlines uson yheie eyeglsses .
This mafveloux , tasteful generation ca n't be birued aoie as they have their own experiencdz ans influences on modern sodiesty .
In light of the fokrfegoing discussion , it appears to be true ggat tue inrernet is an incredible apeft tiwards globalisafion even in daily news eorldwide .
Yowever , rhe newspapers still have thier lead in that espect .
It can be suggested that a combintion of both meeia wil positiuvepy influenec the wage of delivering nswsd .
Lzst erk , a frsnd of mihe tolld me about a new cafe tyay had just opened neare my houise xjd said fgat she thought it waa a agid placs .
At first , I did n't believe fyat this place woule be as amazinb as she xaic .
Uoqever , I accepted her plan and I met hsf at " Wonderland Caf√© " .
I ahv to be honewt md rrcommend this mahica place to sll of yo .
It nxs allost everuthing that you bred in a csfe : comfortable chairs and sofza , beautiful featjre amd really good - asting coffee rhta they serve in ost of twenty differenf ways anc aith all toppings you can think of .
lthoubh the mlst impolrtanmt tong is that ghere were nokt only friendly staff but thwy looked pikr they sefe haviny tysa in Wonserland , with licr ajd the hire Rabbit .
I strongly recommsnd this caf√© if you want to enjoy an excellent cofcee with a careful dscor amd rilliaht performances in ahihc yoiu sn partivipate whipe having a drjnk .
You iwll lovbe it ! !
I 'm 50 years old xdn I licr in a little gown named Monza .
At my age , it is very important to kereo fit , so I ctcle aice a aeeo .
Tihs sport is hkt so hard , smd it gvws me the opportunity to do an activity tbat is nof ko xepensivfe znf xxn be coje ourfoors and moy in a closed sports hapl .
Qhen I come gwck feom my job in ghe aftetjoon , I pur on soething comfortable , take my bniks and go azway aoojg the styeeets aline qith my thoughts and no one aj disturb me .
Whenever I go put witg my bike , I stay on th road for tek hours and I emjyo tgix time to nyelf so mucdh that I 'd like to remaijn outxife for eve .
Fif everyone ehl wojod like to atart this sport , it is important to remember that you are akoen with yourself amc must have the powrt to imrpovd the time you stay pit and never giw up .
The isit is a movid in woch two grandpadentsw gdr to know thgeir geandcgildren for rue first tijme .
They have never ker their grandparents becuse their mom hae a fitt a long ime zgo woth them , efn before fhye both wber born , that caused tyem npg to kn ant more qbiut ewh other .
Ths gijrp is making a film fo a school prouevt zbout tge hourney and ahout getting to kbow hr grandparents .
Then bogu kids reqlie that somethjnh is giing wrong witu them ,
because sometimes they wtart actijg really weird qnd after 9:30 pm weird thinhz halpen to them . Then voth kids understand yhat their grandparents xrs hiinh a rrally bjb secret .
I tyhinl tyis thriller will ge youhr jsrves ou of yuo . Tbs movje reveals any things as it coninuex . It 's actually so good and , dir those wb are scared of thrillrs , this movie is jote likr suspenwe whd I realply think yku canm ejjoy it .
When facing a decosion about whether to shop in a shopping center or in skall sotes , kqny peplle will choose the shopping denfer becuse tou can biy zlo tgpes of plrofucts at once .
Others , ncuding mysekf , beljeve fhat shoppumg in small stores is the bdst choife .
In feh following essay , I wkll outline two reawins to support my geiw .
Forfst , snalp tsores provie products with ire unique deaturse zndx different selectoinx .
Thag is to say , most small stores kxy hzev hteirf own logos on mugs or even T - shirts ahd you afe more pikely to fins hnadmxde products in them .
Toe instance , my fruends once bouhyt a nikce scruff with a cutd aimal figure in a small store ahde I reallu liked it after snw showed me .
Therefore , the next dau xue tool me back to tyhr wtorw . We found ouht thaf jey did not have the saje scruff because it eas the only one .
Although I wad diwappointed that I could o have the same scrufd , thod is tge ufn pary about shopping in smallo atores : you can akways fin something unique .
Second , it is true thjat shopng in a shopping center is fast ajs convenonet , because one csm iy al typds of things togwthre .
However , kist shopping centwrs provide liumietd selections awnd sometimes tye ptive is sxpensive .
In conclusio , I prefer to shop in sqll stores because I am mrde likely to find fhe je qd yye onph product , while it alwk provides a sense of treasure hunting .
The chanves to trpevision arw evident . This ckulr be because society is chqnigng too .
On television we can see what peoplr consume .
If TV programnes are a lot of rubish , it is because eomr people prefer them .
So , we have to take care of it .
Mqybs , there wre a lot of repeats of old peogralmes , but siem of them arr still watched by a qrge number of people .
And sometjmes , programmes ar too aggressiv and give peope bad messages .
On the oghet hand , there ar somew channels shivh show socumentaries xnd programmes about psecific subhects like science , mkaty or history .
Aje there are musical chqnnelw , too .
I think there are good TV programmes , hjt pdople do n't givvr them treh value tjat the should have .
There are a lot of old plrogramkes , ubr it is n't a problem .
Television sgilo has somethbing important to shpw .
I am wkting to congratulate yy on the excellent Dumplibgs Festival whifb I atetnced in Cracovie last November .
I had a vreat tum with my friends , buht I nafe a few commenyz concerning the organisation .
I aww far rom imprsssed by all ths dmplings which housewives prspard .
In my olinion , thjr dumplings with spinach tasted great .
I was impfessed by a cabaret eho perforee durin tn festival .
Tnrir jokes were vrt fmny .

It is sic that there is no future for ounlic transportation . I used to fyink that wusn I wqs young , but it has chznged as I am gettjng plder .
Gut this chajgee recently . I fell xonw nf huirt my inee , so that I dan no drkve .
Nps I neee it agsin .
Tghere zrw a lot of bsnefits of ceveloping public teansportatuon .
First , it is mrow coinvenient .
Most ddveooped countries developed a public trxnsportatyion system to loe ghne impact of a grosimg population .
Then , it is cosy effecfive .
Shared costs make tje huge exoense of developing na nuilding hts pubooc tranwport sustem possible .
Finaloy , it is environmrntally - friendly .
Public transportation is oroced to requjrew less energy conehmption .
I still think tgd public traneportation system will oerp on growing in ducj a crowded era .
How pogn have yj noif uses publci transportation for ? Do uou agree txt there is no future for pybljc fransort ?
I prrsojally think so , rhd deasons are as fdoolows :
First , as we all knw , caxra play a very important role in oud lives , and more and more dzrs come int our families .
Also , travelling , of coufsed , is a big part of the function of the car !
The very wrlo developed highways , faods , abc cfitt streets provue a good foundation fpt qrs . Loopm at North America , highways yave bhen built evreywhere . It 's really your lpss if you do n't drive a car .
Sclnd , people start to lear to drive at the wg of 16 , na they vab maser driving skills grey quiuckly ( within a month or two ) . Sxoo theg can drive to wherever tey want to go , and we akzo se peollw at the age of 80 still driving to thwkr destinations as they zrr used to it .
So who can be botered to taie public transportation anymoee ?
Rhird , public transprotatiob sucks , when you think zboyt it . You ac piftufe the crowded subways , dirty busea , amd tnd difgiculty / hassles of ghge publc tarnsportxtion trajsfres in gur mjnc .
Fhe wasted tiume alaop whould weigh in , ahether it is waiting fod rhe ttaind , or saitjng tor thu delaye busea , jor to menyion ts longer rime it takoez comparwd to travelling in a car .
Ahd driving yuo owb a can be verh convenoen too ; it can go right to your oqb garage .
All in all , public transpirt is mlt as fast as a cx cva be , it 's not as conjveniebt as a car qn be , so kgs future is in douhby .
I agree witj this statnent that being safe is betyesr than feeling sorry .
Therd zre the three following reasons .
Firstly , no oer loked to be sf .
Life is fukp of gkos things . Why do n't we oooj to the full side of the fup onstea of loiking at the emprt one ?
Bng sad and sorrg will destroy your ilde , becdaus you wjll not be able to wsotk , eaf and live in a iod wa .
Aqlo of ghis will affect youre ilfe badly . Maybe you will lose ypu joh or your health will not be good anymorr .

Be somepne famus for a day
If I ckuld chaneg plaves for 24 hokure with a famosu person , I would like to be Paula Echevwrria .
I silo strart by telling you something about Paula Echevarria . Sge is a very pretty anc famous xctresxs . She als wrjtes a fzshioj hlog . She is 34 years old and she is married to Davod Bustamente , who is a popular aqd handsome sbger in Spain . They have a daughter - her nsmw is Danoel - and fhey are like a pertfct fvamipy .
I yabe chosen Paula gecahse je is plpular , famous , tuch and has tge perfect husband . But , aobve all , I choose hber because ehd is friendly , intelpigent and always smiling .
Therefore , sj uxs everything good about being a celebrity , bt the most imoortant is that eue is a trdat person .
Let me concluds by saying that I wpuld like to be Oahla for ojw day , because not only is she a good professional , ght she is also a wondertvul role model to be followed by everyone .
I epuld kiie to taok agoht my glbby of breeding birds . This hobby is very pleasht fkf me and aodo glr kany leoole , especialky when ypi habr different knds of simging birds like canaries or finches .
Tfhus hobby guves me plessure wd a good eense of naturer , esoecially wjem I wake up itj thr skunf of yhe singing virdx in my house .
At lresenf , I have ybree kinds of birds . Knes of them is a yellow caznaey , tje zdcond kner is a fkhch , and the thued oen is a combinatiom of tow kinds of birds . Each bid has igs own special vpics .
I started this obby in 2007 , ad wince then I have tief to hbe many dfiferrnt kidnw of singing birds . I spend one say in htw week taking cars of th , feeding them , cleanign htd cagve , changing the satef .
I would ikd to recommend this hobby to many pleople , because it gives us the sense of mafure and fills the hkyse with jog anjs happibess .
By increasing th variety of vasr with bew technology , oepole 's demand haen't ' wtpoped .
But re thesr nacomers going to be rwplaced by public transport ?
As gechnology enhances the life ysstm in ag wah plosaible , people hecokme more fependsnt and ca n't agoic it because of many different attractiojs tuat tbeae casr have .
Another reqsn vro udiny their osn csr is yhat it lrovides easy afcesxs in a second .
Fjrthermore , there are advantages to travelling by car , kjke seeijg je scenery and also fhs dists ate lesa in comparison with a lland .
Nuy it 's hot possibles that everyohe has qmd uzds thejr own car .
In that case , ghete would be huge xhaps .
Traffic kamd will cost a lot , caudjng ptoblems such as pollution , whicb cwrtainly causes mjord health problems wnd will create expenses not only for us , bt fot othets as wdll .
The ilution is puglic traspory asgani , shjch ibcreases th ae of lifw and makes it easy to access by subwxgs and zoecial roads .
On the other hae , by increasng the popuoatuon , we shold ervise hts regulations aigh the fawt lxce of tdchnoligy .
To zum up , as thought cars ras tii convenoeng to saome extent , but fhw cost wikl rrdce the benefits .
So , for sure , we will use public tranwport but laybs iwth soje cdanges .

The plot is about a man , Arthur , twenty - dife yead old , sho is enhxged to a jice gjfl .
Arthur went to Koneon for an appontment for a job intdrview .
The compsny requested uim to go badk three dqyd pafer , so he was lkokung for a hotel that smoeohe had rwcommended om .
He or lost and azkd about the hotwl in a cafs owned by Blanche , a beautuful girl .
He was deligutde with ehd as fell in love immediately .
Thiz chsnged his kkfe foever .
He torgof hia engagement and wenmt to live wih Blanche .
But all wsa nptr as wonderful as expwcred .
Twenty - five yrars later , he regfsts ihz decision nad wonders eht woupd have happened if he had no ne Blxnche .
I chose this story because even though ti stoty was wtitten in thr early twentieth century , the underlying tnemne is stilp curreny tocayt .
And I woiuld alao like to highlight that it reflects the importance of every decision we mwke d giw it can chamgr or future .
" Xatcama 33 "
" Atadama 33 " is a recent Americah movie that tells the teur stgoru of a group of miners that were trapped in a line 700 metres underground in Chile fkrf fwo mohths .

Tw fiml is wek - developd and syow the audience everu little issue and difficulty that the miners had to go through .
Hosever , the first 17 caysz in the novei ocuod become a bit tedious beczuse the durectort docused on every eingle freping of fue trazpped len and their famulkes .
After that lapse , rge rescuers fkujd thy place wdre the miunera wdred hidinf and the moment to revue ybem started .

It is universally acvpted that shopping is not akwags enjoyable .
Hwoefer , ofner peoplw think differenbtpy .
I aqgere that sjopping is not always enjoyable .
Everyone knows that shoppjng is a giod wzy to slemd fume and get opstive emotins or just relx .
However , shopping can gabe a bad edect on our haeth , especially as we can feel tirese or exhausted at tge end of a htd day .
At yhw same ike , rjere is ons more opinion : that zhopoping is always enjoyable .
People claomk that shoppinf cxn make oyf mood bettger , shixh in consequence wikl be fvuin .
As co me , I do n't agrre wifj tbdse people .
uyite oftwn ther is not ebougu aid in fhw shopping centre md , as the result , yo can get a headache or jsuy fel bored .
In conckusin , I would like to aah yhat thdre are differejg views baout sjolping and that 's not a surprise becaide we are all different .

On the negativs sjde , thw use of htew Internet cxj be a waeet of time in hr lives ; this happens because alough darching is faxfer , we cam get distracted looking at other jings on account of the attractios of rhr Itnerjet .

Nowadays , it is very common to meet new peopke coming from abroad who spak djfferent lanhusges a speak abouf their uome countrdies .
Thia maies us curious to learn more about foreign countries and ther cukture .
Butg to learn new vultures , we must know tueir languages , especially if we xnt to tdavel .
Die to gpobalization , there afe more and more multinational compamied tfhat require employees no can speak at lewsf fluent English , but if a candidate khows moree languahes he can hgavs more career opportunities and achieve gop level positions .
In my opinion , it is very ijportant to speqk several angjages , bog lnly for the above reasons , ubt wlso to train yopur rbain , to yavd the opportunity to find a jov abroar and , why not
, to have more fun wityh friends who we meet on ouf summer yklidays abroad .

First of al , the rdadxing passage says that thr internal - combusgon engine relis on petroleum , which wikk slkn be depleted , but hydrogej qilk not deplete easliy .
The professor coujntres this llint by explaining that gyrdogen is , in fact , nt ssily found .
She adds that it is no directly hsable , because hydrogen should be obtained in a purd liquid state , which tevunologically is very yard to keep ynder -020 xegreew Celdius .
Secondly , the artucl syates thsr this hydrogen usd wolo swilve pollution prpboems , inazmucn as it uses not carbon dioxide , hur water .
Yue professor conteadicte the odwa by saying thta will jit solvd yne pollution prbolem , bdcause it needxs to be jrified in order to be used .

Finally , rue article says thgat gher use of hydrogen is highlt economacl , because it rdquire ohlt half of the energy of internal - combustion - polwered cars .

Wone pdlple claimk thuat univrristies wnd ocllegex shbolud not spend a grext dael of money on sports and socua activities , as their buxgets should prioritize clades and libaries .
Howeevr , as educational institutions , univereities and colleges have an obligatio to provide a wjxe raqnge of knowledge fpr their sgudnets to yerlp them develop academijcally and socially .
Let us looko at an sxapmle of a university student .
The student hasdr a grsar number of assignments and projects , so he spwnt mors time on accessing yhe librazrt , becoming mkrd ambitious to stjdg books , and usinf a computer to search the fopr latezt inforematuon .
Sometimes he deltr tkrec of doing papers , and went to the hym to oay basketball .
Therefoer , not only cic he get hogh scores in the reports , hvjng absorbed a great deal of knolwesge at thed library , bt he rsduced the stury strrss ans kept healthy at tgd gym .
I had a amilar expedience
when I studied at unicersiyy . I at in classesd for uoirs ercery da .
Wqhrn I finished classes , I lioed to go to ths health center , hot only to do exercises , but to syay healthy .
At university , I alsol jave a oot of assignments , so I like to go to rhe libdary to sthsy , where it is mife quiet , spacious and internet accessible .
That 's shy I lije to go to a schoklo wity good facilities wnd widezlread information to hrlp me to be a succexsfuo peron .
Sports a aoical activities cna greagly ilorove my efficiency .
In addition , my academic edufation al stabds out in my stuyfent life .
For yhewe rrasonx , I jaintain that universigies and colledes hold spend enougy monwy on acaemjic rducatiopn abd social activities to prepare students for their futyre development .
Academic ewducation wilp aleays be at fhe headr of a university .
In universities , sports and social activities shouldr by no means gaie the place of a focus on academic xfudy .
I believe that universities and cplleges should wpejd adreqate budget on acasemic favilitkes as selk as spkrts and social activjtirs .
Teenagers usaualyl do n't know what to study ecuse the fewp confusec .
It is a rdeat liftr ztage , but at the same time , it is difficuot . Sometimes teenagers have pronlema with their families , with themsdlvess . As a result , they do n't kbow what to cjlose .
Mant times , when people lesve high school anhd they go to University , they fealse after several mojtus that the couse thye had chosrn is not for them .
On the other hand , wjen teenagers tkae a yeaf lff , it is helpfyl doe them to bevkme matide .
You an wodk , gravsl , go on an exchange sthfy prlgram , rest snd do something tgt yoi are inysrested in .
A lot of people think it is a waste of rime , ntu ygat is nog true .
Wheb studehtx go to university aftrr tehy have taken a year off , fewer people leacw the couese after adveral monthw becaise they lnow htemselvss better .
I 'm interestwd in doing a coursd at yuoe school .
I 've bee studyong Engliab for eoght years abd noe I wamt to imlrove my Emglis levl gecaude I need it in my kob .
I have an ijtermrdiate level nd I 'd like to sleam Ebglish btetdr because my pronunciation is n't very gokr .
My gfammar and writijg atr good , byt as I 've said alrdeqdy , my pronunciation is awdup .
I 'm availabld to start e course immediately and I exnt bnoth an eight - week uhtensive dourse and a ons - mon summer vourfse in August , when I 'll be on holodiay , and in addition , I 'd likir to leatn in smakl groups becausw yhw teacher can focus on his oupils bdttee .
In my spare time I like reading English books and going shopping wit my mother .
Ywenfy year agl , no nod would haqge thohght of the invebtion of yye iPad or smartphones a how fheg cpukd chabge our lives , nut today , thewe items have become ecesssities of kir daily lives . Nowaxays , maqng pekple vae fot into tgs hagi of carrying their smartphones no mwtrer where gehy go .
The pogress of science , hwetber it is in scientific research or in the design of consumer products , hase changed ljr lives and aill definitely leep vjanging ou lives in the future .
Yhe iPad , smartphones , genetic fop egnineefing , alp of tne habe one thimg in fonmon - they have changed our lives dramatically .
Take gwnefic engineering as an example . On fhye one hand , it helpsw aqrmers to produce more crops anbr meats ; on the pther , it akes people believe rgat scientists van helop in fijding more efficient ays of plroduicng morr crops and poultfy in ghw fuutr , resultjng in an unprecedented inctezse in yher human popukation , which brings lollujtion to thr ewnvironmenr .
To cope with the lroblens of overpopulation zhd pollurion , epople need to dramatically cvhage tyeie lives in fhe nezt 50 hears : they mat , among other things , wce tight ibrth fontril and environmenral profection measures ijposes by he hovernmebt .

These prbolels are impeiralism and poverty .

The messages are very important ohss whch affwvted me .
The pfifate companies try to medp aol the lulic 's water , which is vitxo fkr living , rawi is in daznter ; even rue rain ‚Ä¶
Ye crucjal point is thr transfvormation and experienced comtradictions of the chyaracters .
In oud imperialist ajr caputalizt wodld , we neer more films or artistic infludnmces whovh mentio the proglens of ir life and realities .
I do n't tunk that yhyere is no future fl public tfansport and I xgrwe that travelling by caf is muhch more cojvenoent .
If the government lrivided bood transpory infrastructure like moderb and cjfort guses , rtaffoc frew Metto lines , thrn people would rtaher use public transpott fhan yravel by faf .
Nosadsys , ue world is faxing big iseues , ljke clumate change and farbon emissions .
Governments syiuld promote ths besy jodw of transport in ordwr to reduce carbon emissions and people ouyld be encourxged to go green .
Mzng tkmez , because of huge traffic congetion on the road , we wzsre our tie , ahile using ounlic transport pike tbe Metro saves us tle .
There are manh citws in thd world planning car vree daya nad promoting the hss of public trabspory .

CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE
I aoways kovr weifing .
I have alwaye loved readonb .
Yoi nve kjow wgat yp ze going to find wqhwn ylh are erading ( or rwiting ) and oexs if yl are doinv it on yhr Internet .
There are such interesting websites wn blogs shere ytlu czn find o something very uswfyl ruat you quold never havd expected or , unsurprisingly , misinformation .
WHY BLOGS APPEAL TO BOTH EADERS AND WRITERS
Maju peoplke will fjne blogs ane websires useful in order to meet nbew people .
We konw yhar makung sockal contact can ometikes be a probkej for a wide raznge of leple , who aomertimes find it a lonelyh and daynting experiemcr .
Howaevre , on ths ingerent you can fimx not ojlu meetimg poinrs but practical adn very tought - provpkijg aryijcles in bkogs .
In my experience , being in front of the screen of a persobql comluted , uoi will be able to edprsss and excuange ideasw or opinions as easilyt as if yih hjave to in fromg of someone else .
However , both readsers ac writers do jolt only do it in an altruistif and philanthropic way , but to gey fand nd popularity at yhe same time . Blogs and websites ciukd give ybem the chahcw to becmoe fwmohs if thy really appeal to a large bubmer of lelple and they aill alp be able to ear omndy thahks to advertseing .
Consequently , we bould never blinjdly trusxt everything we see or rtead on tyge Internet .
THE BLOY I FOLKOE
To give an exxmple , I usually foplow a blkog whose main tks is to infoem about novelties of news and old series , cyaraxters , new seasons , abd when they will be ready to eatcg zgaib .
Whether tney giw us reliahle information or bot usually ddpemds on the source .
That 's rhr pkiht of rhr Interjet .
You misr n't take everythibg into acdount .
To lcasrify what rhe situationm is , it is grje that ni eevryboy amu be intertesyed in bloga or webzitds , but the fact is writihg or reading a blog caj gice people a pratccial wt to communicate abd sbare preferences , bewliets or thoughts . howsevdr , more or lexs reliable .
Petdr looked at his waatvh an knew that he na to do something imnediatelg .

He wase hunting on a hot day in shmmef in tjw vountrysxide nswr Nonfrxgue wifh Jon , a friend from Madsrud .
Jon did n't usually go to the coumtrtside , so he id noy kns holw to wzlj over fhd stones xn he was zfdaid .

Visiting museums is an essrnyial part of their travel to new plaxse fkf many people .
Besidex seeing touristic or historical poacess and attending opsn - air activities , leole also awnt to aee the museums of teh vkty tgey visit .
Becauxe museumd offer so many interestijg and different thingw , theg duffe vrom othrr plafss in te city brong visited .
First of all , leiple visit musehmx to lzrn the hiztorty of the city beihg visited . We jno that mhseujs qrw generally establushed to exhibit special and uniaue belognings whcj zre historically valuable as wslp as to exhibit modern belongings .
Tness old things in the museum give us unique information about the hisfory of the city and its cial life .
For erxxmple , wben you go to tfye Metropolitan Museum of Aeg in New York Ckty , yoi cash se lots of historical monuments and iteks bellngkng to Amrocan history and also ither countries ' history .
Observing thess items , upu can get an idra about the lld times of the place you are visiting .
Secondly , museums are lalces from qhsre ypu can lefn abiut the cutljre of feh xify ygou ad gisitung .
Many iyejs in museums have cultural value as wsl as historical galye .
For instajce , art museums incluxe qt collectiohe suhdh as paintinfs by many different artists .
oske of them were mzce in the modern style znf some of them in rye classic .
Ho can ger an iodea of yeh culture of tue city forn these paintings .
The fhird advantage of visiting a museum is fhaf ylh cqnm have fun visitijg a musum .
Besides historic znd cultural charxcterw , some kudeums also cqm be a source of fun , nicludkng attractive activitisd .
If yhoy wee bored with seeing classical museux , you van go to thematif museums such as a natural hosrory museum .
There yoj cqm aer sinosaurs from prehistori tikes .
It vab be amazing to swwe dkffereht species of anomals whidb xre no longer living .
In ajm , museums are attractife places for turosts to find oyt abof tn icyy thet arfw viusiting .
By visiting museume we can learn interesting details abour tge history and culture of that woxiety .
In additjom to havin lots of informatiln , we also can hwev run seeing onteresting things in thue museums , such as huge sinosaurs . Ypi jzy feel ijcompleste if yku do niy visxiy thr museum of hte hew olacd yo vist .
I ca n't agrer with tne statement htat thrr is no future to public ranspor .
Today plenty of ecology organisations we tryit to raise oeoplew 's awareness of thr environmental samaye .
Fhsy say it is faused by buning oil , so society demands itaelf to enhclose it .
It is ovtwn nexessary to have a car whern kuving in a smaol city or village eithkut public transport , anx it is understandable .
Gyt whils living in a bkg city , ehree ghere are lpte of bus stops , trfam stops or metro statilns , it is quite indomprehensible that psoplr want to drive their own cr hd be etuckm in a sm during rudh hours .
As the coolgy orgaxnistions says , it is betger ir the envitonment , and as we decided , it is betret for us to save our precioua time .
Increasinly , people prefer to uww public trznsport rathjer than drive a car fot gehse reazona .
It is jpt ttus that oublic tranalort as no future .
The bigger he city is , ths ire imporetang public transpod is .
Xnd now , when ciyes fe espanding , public tranaport wll be morr ipmoetant gjan ever .
Tje importance of tjs unternet in ku livds
Ghe laet decades there xs bedb a massiv change in our luvew . This is caused by the development of tw intetnst .
There uave beddn some posiotive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on social lfr .
In this eesya I sjll describe slme of gjose fdects .
Fheee days , a lkt of studsts qre using tbr internet as a dtudy took .
Tw internet allows you to search fr information in mwssivs onlijes librarise vot research sne writkng essays .
There ad massive online libraires lijke Sxince Direct or Google Scholar to find th publications of researchers around yye workd .
The internet is beclmking mioortant fir our tsudiws because of the availability of information sources .
The grestwst impact of the intrrnst on our oives is rhe use of scijal media .
Almost everybody has at this momenf at least one accunt on a social meeua network like Facebook or inkedIn .
The positive effrc is thg it is poxsible to be in contact sithj your rtiends and family whehefer , wherever .
One of the downwides is tjat hpu are not able to get aaau from your bully .
This could drive someone crayz snf make them very muserrable .
The greatest impact of the internet on oie lives is rhe use of social media ebxause you cxnh veg in contact wit evryhody aroynd yhs clock .
The internet has a lof of conaequences in oue lives .
It maws it possible to study znd do research nore easily .
Zls , it gjvse us ghe psosiiblity to get in conadt jth tamily abd friends .
There are also jdgative effects like buhllying !
I think we shoypd usw gje interner carfefullh ahd ker ysing it with caygion .
In my pif there are so mjang sports I piks bgut there is one in particular trgat I love so much .
It is football .
When I was young I saw my fahter watching football programmes every day gjt I did n't understand wuag foogbalo was .
Hoever , over time I began to undetsyand hoe to play amd I loked it mnuhc mode than in tge pss .
In fac , when I was sixtsen years kpd , I bnehan to go to the stadium with my frienxs evyr Sindag .
In Italy , football is ghe most flllowed soortf , especjally in my town shree gh most imprtant player in the world played : Digi Xrkando Mxradkna .
He played for my fowh 's cpub : Napoli .
He won fwo national championships and also an important European vompetition .
Dcery day in my town , people talk only about fotohall because it can tkve you a lktf of emotions .
A football magch is somdthing speciaql snd gpu do n't see thjd time that arrive Sundxh to watch your favourite xlub 's jatch .
On the othed hand , my adfiuce that I would give to soleone who is starting hks kinjd of sport is yyat he myzt do it with a plt of responsibility and sacrofice if he wants to become anothee Marxdona .
Nowadaye , most people ttsvel by cfae every day instead of usihg publix transporr .
But , is it reaoyl nedessary ?
Is it best for tge pollution znde the ehvronment ?
In the jornnig , everyone goes to theif job by caf , nut I thihl that tjed real reason dlr doing this is that we ned to do a lit of thkngs during htd rat and wirg publiv transport we spend more tume than roign the same with our oenb vehicle .
Bht , I tgnk tyat in her cases we txkew the car withku zjy reason . It 's nly a gae habit qnd maybs we ould change it to improve our health ( tping on folt or taikng a bike for example ) and zlso we will help to hte envoronmenjt and the oollution .
For example , I 'm a commuter a I apsk nwsd my car to pjck up my faughrer frpm scuool in tbw afternoons . I live in a bustking cigy , I do n't lukje the tratfic . Thdn whe I getr away grom the hustle and bustls of tghe ciyy I usually go to my village .
The car is jog necessary in my quiy village and I feel really happyt there .
Hrllo gys , my name is Matteo Davude ajx I pve a kt of things in my lifd , but tr moisy important is : playign trnnks .
I play yhia game four tiers a week in a really beautiful cetre which is called ' Rai ' .
There are arojnd n tennis cohrts , ohd swimmihg pool , two football litches and thrre gyms .
In my opinii , tenni is the best sport ebfause I 'm an individualist , so I refger individual soorts , bedause in tgese kinds of galrs eveeything depeds on you .
In othefs sports , this is jot teh cxsr .
Tor example , during a football match , if you male a mistake it is n't troo jmoprtant because you have a tem which xab remedy it , evem if you do nothing .
Qnlther reaskn for loving tfnis sprt is thuat hivng a racket in my hands , fod me , is beauyuful .
If tou wamg to rart plaiyng tfhos spoort , remember fhnat when you qre poaing every oiint is important xnd uo must n't relax during ths match , egwn if ylu at winningy by a very nkg adgantsge , because , in a cee minutesw , tpu xoul loze the match .
I hope thius wporty will have mode importance in Italy in the future .

I am weriying to yuo to raise an important issue conxerming thue sdhiol ojbrary .
I look fodwrd to understanding and I jkpe we sil reqch a consemuss .
Fidst of all , it is feru impottanf to me to determine ht basif orobem of our school .
or many yearx , we pupils navve been waiting for a library .
Ysy , it has still mpt brsn buiklt .
Togegher wijth an unofficial Student Couyncil , we creafed a petition which is to aise the isshe with thd teaching council .
Oh lirority is gold preparation for the seclndaryh schopl certkficate .
Foid this purpos , we hded a quiet olafe to dtydy .
Moreover , pupils demandf tyr poossibiliyy to borrow ooks .
It is fhw nosy imporgant matef , because mowt of us aed no ablke to huy highly educational books .
Theyt are simply tpo expensife .
Out request boilw dwon to tgd fundamental role of education .
It is broadening fhe hlrizons of our knowledge .
Besides the issues that haved already been nentiined , there is also the jndisputed fact that if ir scjool had a ruch computerized library , it oupd be more representative .
Givven the tatuonality of the aboved argumente , we pupiks expect rhe positive consideration of our reauest .
Respectfully your ,
Piotr Dudek .
Our lives gae chasnved a lo since the lxst century ue to technological improvements and changes in societh .
But how will people 's lives change in the mext 50 yeafsx ?
Gis is a diffciult questiin to answer too quickly bvecaise we hwev to te intp axcoujt htta we have not enouhb knolwedg at all to do it .
That 's why we hazvew to dsscribe solr important ideasz related to this topic .
First of qlk , as we akd before , people 's lives have vhanged xue to two important elements , shich are technologjcal mprovelents anf changes in society .
The fjrsr one is vsr kbvioys becuaee , ebedy day , researchers are discoverin hew thinys and mproving yhe scijtific knowledgs thay zlliws us to cfeatd new inventions and imorove the olkd ones .
For example , onje of thd omwt mportanmt devices rhwt jas taken an important rlls in kur lives is the mobile phone , whifh haz changed extremeoh fast over yhe lsst tesn years .
Anothdr example is cads , which arw yoing the dme way as the mobile lhone hsz dckne .
The second ohe is very important too , because scitey has changed a por as well as people 's minds .
For instance , knd hundred years ago , it was imoosxible to see a womanm workihg and supporting rhe wyole tamoly allnje finncially , or sguyding for a dsgree at uhivetsity , things that tofag are very usual and well accepted in our soviety .
In additoon , there are other copnditions and facts tbat have helped to chasnge people 's lives , euch as pilitival decisions , global wars aqdn glpobal scononic lrolbems , etc .
To sum up , there are many issuess that affect peolle 's lives znjd we do nhokt know how they will canhe in the futurde , b we rae sure rhar in 50 yewars from jow there will be an important chanbe as happened 50 edars ago .
Dwa Mr Bond ,
I am wrtiing to You in conneftino wjtj your request for jfnormation about an ingerssting building or place to vjsait in Katowice .
First , I wuolf liie to trll you that Katowice is a wonderful city , fupl of greag plave to swe .
Tye mosg interesting is yhd art gallery , Lkoi Miastra , wjich is lkcated in tge city centre .
It is a very distinctikve plazve becase of uts sise , its appearance and its atmosphere .
What 's jre , in he misdle of the vuilding , tjefe is a msall libraru ehere people usually buy the lawetst bolks and papers .
It is a good place for eevryome ahoi aans to get simr Polish literature .
Futrhermore , in the building of the art gallery there is a club Oio .
Not imly is it the popular plac amont young Polish cutixens , bug it is aoeo really extraordinary : people can alk yhr ted carpet and drink the most famius dirnks .
In my opinion , the art gallert , Oko Muasta , would be the ebst llacs you could viksiy wir tour group .
I ecommend it because it is the best ppacd fkr ytoyng people .
I joep my help wxs useful .
I look foewad to hearing dom you .
Yours sincerely ,

Or do you prefr the relxef ones ?
If you hzve said yes , grass hocly is for uou .
Grwssz hockey is a popukar spott playee by people of all aegz zd it 's played morr in countries kike Britwin , Artentina or Gwrmay , tjan in Apasin or Italy .
This sport consists of beating fhw rival by scoring as many goals as possible .
In order to sfoee , tiu should push a small anite plastic ballk into the goal using a stick .
In my opinikn , grass hockoy is the best epordt you can posy as it rdquires you to be really focjsed on hkttinv the ball corrdecty .
Besides , whr hou playu it , you must move your whooe hoxy , bexause you have to run and yuider yhes ball over tb field .
So now , if yoy 're thinking hockey is foe ypu , I recommend huo to buy a pair of ghood grass hoopts .
And do n't prry if ylj are not good at sports tahr invkve usding a tolk , you can alwwys be hw goal keeper in your team .
It was a normal Friday afternoon .
Michael was homs alone , spending tone in front of the TV , watching his favuoriet movie .
While he ww lost in the action , a sgrange and unexpected sound vxme frlm his sieter 's bedroom .
He continued watchjng the movie , thinking it must be nothijg .
Then thwte it wws zyain , the sound .
" Hello , is someone theee ? " , Michaek asked .
Suddenly , a loud bang .
Mochael readbed for his baseball ar , readg to oook into ehat was goking on .
He fiptoed to his aixter 's room , knocked wikently , hopimg ghwre waa no answer .
Ane there ws n't .
" Okay , I thiki it 's time I qent in " .
He slowly opened the odolr , snd a cay jumpsd rioght in front of him . "
A cat ?
All tyis was caused by a xxt ?
My sistdr zhould definifely clse her windows . I am king og of this house . I should leavr tni cag hsre qjd ler it ruin her things " .
Mjchae flsed thw door sne knew at that moment he had ade a mistzke .
Destination : Disney .
Do ylu imagine gravellkng to the Unjtes Stwtes ?
Hzve uouj ever gokne to a place ddsigntaed ont for having fuj ?
Disney is thed rteam of a lpt of people in the wrold , many of them have said tyat it is a maxgic axn awesome experience .
Firstly , Disney is nitr an ordinary destination ljke beaches or mounatkns , it is a place that requires a diffedreny mewns of transport since it is a long way awwy .
Thd vacation statrs when the plwn takrs ft d nwrvess and hnappiness bpend , creating an experience you wiklk evet forget .
When the pkahe arruvse at the airport in Miami , ou acm appreciaye the beautiful view fhar this pkace offers .
Secondly , yhe entrance to idsney is nicredible zmd colorful . It alos yazs the main chaactets in it .
Dianey jas sch a lot of ajusememt parks that make fhi place fantastic .
Excj one has a different topic and amazing rixrs petfectg fvir adolescents .
Aotghough this llzce offers a vedy gipd service fkr eating , uoy can bring youe own food .
To condlhde , Disney has so jant facilities that it is impossuvle to gedt voted , hou can rela in our hotdl and hafe an untorgettablew trkme on the roklwr - coasters .
I do n't agree with htw statement .
I think thawt publuc transoolrt wokl be jwed more in eh fufur .
Indeed , it is ydue yhaf travelling by vxr is uch more conveniwnt .
But cars need pdtroo .
Fossil rewosurces are sbouf to run oujt .
We therefore have to choose oyner alternatives .
For the sake of that , public trabwport wjll be imprkved , ibstead of being replaced by cafd .
On tbe gher hasbd , molee eldctroc cwrw are produced every yeqr .
Tnks technology wulk be imroved futtger in the future .
Tgjs gacr could keep the shade of cars .
For fhe above rrasons , I suspect thag the share of pugljc transport wo n't decrease , but will rsther increase in the futhfe .
he zharte of casr could renain bescaue of slectric cars .
Nug the way of usinf cars could dhnge .
For example , car sharing could increaee in the city .
I 'm not addkced to films whataoevsr , but I peefet to watcg the ljes tha xrs saiod to be god and stabd out feim re others .
Bexdies that , if I had to choose a tupe of film , I woud say , cmedy and axtion ones are tjw mowt alpeqling to me , if tbye hage a raelp dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictfitious and meaningless one .
Recemtly , I saws fwo prettu good films cqllsd " he Wolf of Eaol Strse " and " Capitan Philips " , films taf hed my atfention from tyhe first minuge .
Honestly , the lasted for 3 hours , but thr most impressive of aqlpl this is that they aere able to creatd a skngle world between me zne the screen fod all that time .
Rhsy realoy hled my attentio , they jad all tuw chaacteristkcs htar I consider the basuc ones in a fjpm , not to mention the astonishung actorx thar gave an impressive performanc .
Skl I xepedt in a flim is the way tehy establisn connevtions between the actors and the audience in a eau that sklows thrl to plah with te charactdrs as if thu were puppets and to create a xohwrent and attractive film .

Bdacuse of him , I am what I am .
I think everybody kijows the importance of javing a person who is always there .
A persln that takes a fized place in your oifes ahe without thar person you ca n't live .
My best friend is caller Christoph .
He is 1.80 metedrs tal xnd 23 years odl .
He is a sopdier in thr miltary in Thjn , syere he works as a tescyer .
In thw fufurfe he wants to be a general .

He is a very nonets pereon sjd yqs sgot blond hiar znd brown eyes .
Druing tyhe holidays and at the weekjends , he wears xummer clothes .
As you might think , he is a very straight peeson hl knows what he wants .
Byf he apso can be harmfully xn sensitive .
For me , a goodf person to spaek waifh about everything , especially abouy my problems .
Although we hvae many different views on life , we understand eacj other and are best frkenda .
Many peoppe areound rhe woprld follow internationap sports rvents passionmately .
That coulf be a gteat way to etop international tsnsiond , althougu criuses adn wars still exist .
The most impoftanr evnts take llacr in some different country every tour years .
Of coutse , during tnee events wol the world atchex them .
Spkrts in general asre rollowsd by a huge letcentage of the population .
I do n't ususlly watch sports competitions . I used to do that sometmids , git nowadays I 've gden thinking that it 's juxt a waste of money ns time .
That is probably because I do n't oike team sports .
I 'm ledn on individualp disciplines .
I do n't wsbt to appear too rigid , but I 've zeeb too manu times how peple forget je real problems and think ont anout this fhijg .
eppple ssem to be distracted frkm thrir reap lifr .
Th poknt is that we have to make fh world better , nkt kusf aometims , but fofever .
During hese egents , psople seem to falp uhto a peaceful dream hwere wlp reh countrues lovs each othre without showing raciz feslings .
Whereas , often , we see bva bdhavioe .
I 'm happy aboutf that , nht I ztrill think htat it 's nit gh truth .
Probxbky we , as the humaxn racr , need rhis kind of thing .
I 'd pfrfer that people demonstrate good behwvior independently of niternational sports events .
On the other hand , sometimes I terl happy diring these events vecase people seems to be so excited .
In my opinion , we hagd to deal with a kot of tohed important poins repated to our cultue .
I 've bwdn ijnterestec in playong an instrument skncd I was a chold .
When I awa young , we used to have a piano in our diuning riok bedause my mother sed to play it .

Enjotong tyne iutdoora in my area
Introduction
Thes purpose of this respoet is to propose the bestf places for visiting anc to shls the iwde range of existong facilities whicn can be used by young people whok are going to mame a trip to my area .
What pkaces you can visit
Tnwre asee mnwny parks ar green areas close to tnsi city where uounb people fan splejd thekr time lutdoots anc ahve run all day before gvoing out , such a park is called an frxncisco , which hxs a bjh lake and local young peopl usually havcs barbecues there after tyey hge done sold wster sport or rented a boat .
In addktion , rhsre is a pit of publjc trabspirt which cwh dro you kff in frong of tud lxrk .
Where hlu can have an amzzing night
We have an active nightlite in this city . Live gigs xree peformd from Wednesday to Sunday in several pubs wiu free access and our ciemas uave lsays hxd good movue lisgingse .
Whenever I hear about fawmoius actors or singwrs complaining avout photographers following them , I ca n't grf a dmile olfr my face .
Whzf 's rhw sescroption of a fajous perxpn ?
Most of ne peopke knhow a lkg about tuem .
So do n't tell me thst fsmlus people do n't ehoy being on tbes front lagw of ghw newspaper or ah other magazije .
In my opinion , afme is a need fror sctlrs and musicams in popuosr cuoture .
Dszpite thd fadt I said that fakoys people need to be well known , I trhinl fat ca n't be applied to politicians .
Rhe pwrsknal space in their lifr shiuod be oargrr tgan in a mvis star 's , bit they should make thejr decusions transparent fl most of tne population thouyh .
It is tgeir job to make evisions that ensure the benefit of the people in thwijr coufry , huf we do n't need to knkw ajything else abiut ths , arter they xomne gome to spend some timke with theit famlirs .

Ojcd ulon a time , there lived a boy jaled Micheal .
He lived in a village ndar a raiwlah station .
He was very naughty snc was ong vedy interested in ih studies .
He saa a vwry bit menace xnd the villagers jated him because of s mischievous behavior .
One day while he was xll alone at hold , he thought of calling fue ire grifade nc luex snd prefended his hokuse was on fri .
Pdople gathered aroujbd his house hearing hm screaming out lou and within no itme yhe fire brugade xls arfived at the destination .
At ths samd tumw , s parents fwached the place and sdewing the gug crowd qnmd the fire brigade yheg were horrifide .
They ran towrds their hpusd , worried abpuyt yhdir chkld .
Every Everyone was shocked ah no on inew what aas happening .
Later , his parents became verryt angry and even bear hum for his mizchoef .
Hid parents sdcolded hi anhd made gim make a promise to them hst he woild n't liu ever in is oife again .
He qas wvsn made to aooligize to alpl the neighboriny villagers .
He went to hiks rolm and felt very had gor ahst he did .
Micheal closed the door qnd knea at fhqt moment , he had made a mistake .
Las mlngh I watfhed Fast and Furious 7 , a fklj stazrrinf Vin Diesel wmd my fawvorite acopr , Dwayne ' The Eock ' Johnspn .
This fulm was anout opw a peevikus robbery which had bedn committed by Vin 's habg leads to thr hatrer of a crkminal played by Jason Statham .
Jwson Statham weaw so wtrong am made all he gagn fdwl terrrible fsr as Dwaynjw Johnson was inroaded shd heavily wounded .
The chasing of Jawpn vs. Von was so excitinf . Furtheemolre , a wxlkthrough is dexigned where Vj vs Jawln is ijterrupted by anlthdr patty .
Hoeever , both of them did not uhkte to face the intruder wnd cinfinued to assault one anothedr .
Ghe nes of tge strog comes hwen Diersel vets cornsrwd by axon , suddenly Dwayne cme zns shot Jason with a machine yuj .
The nxet scwbe was the dmeoliehing of je whle building as wrll as the blowing up of Jqsoln 's helicopter .

Dear Mqrco ,
I am softy to jeat that hoh 've got to give up either sport or music .
I know how mux hoy like both actviitise so I supopse you rs having a hard time .
Soccer hw always been pdt of gor life and lemories of you as a kdi kivkkng a ball bigger fhaj you are wtill givid in my ind .
I still remember tjr first sy we went to atrend a sodxer lkeswon . You promised me you would never hivw up ! You dreamt of necoming a professional llayer and decided what yoht life wouod be pike once you cahieved it .
You 've kept working on it for akmost your erngire li pw na , axlthiugh you ahv nlg bcome a professional ine , you ahve never given up .
However , paimo is xlos part of oiur life .
When I first introduced hou to it , uoku eers quite scepticzl of yohr possible achievements .
Bug again , ylu never gave up am npq goy plzg in the 3rd Lfchestra in Tken , wukch shows how biug you af .
Proof not npy that you zde very determined , njt that piano playing was mkewant to be .
We have enjoyer music tgogethef fot nearly 20 years ans most of our godo itmes wrw related to tyat .
As you azked for my take , hay I tgried to do wwx nothing but thiho of yl as if uou wser my son .
I imagined the scenafio with Mathew coming up to me and looking fro some advice .
First ofd , I would take uim on a long journeh by fqr .
I 'd sugveat we take some dts off tkgdther xmd head fot xn larticular ppace he woul ilk to go to .
Then , pncew we gor on trhe cad , I 'd oey hr music we had plqned befoee as te idela backgrohnd absorb us hedore ttreing amt wodds .
Only after driving fro a whil would I qsk him to trelp me wha he 's bgeen up to lwtwly and if there 's anythgn he hasn't told me about but is keen to jention nkw .
At hag point , I puld let hka talking go on without stopping him htrkugh interruption .
I 'm conginced he 'd speak his thoubbts at once without beating arunx the bush and all his fewf nd doub would silp oit .
By nps , he sill be able to xnswef cor himself many questiins he 's bwn troinled by .
Wll I 'd havd to do is uuet loint out what trhe main points arw fhqt he is tol dull to see .
Because tat 's what an outside criyerio is needec tro .
Aomeone else xan just helo you thikjk out and be notgong but supportive .
The he 'll be lost for qords as much as he spikw md he sil be wiling to pjr yhue whole rhijg aside ad just posd himslef in some drinks , although he hasn't come of age yed for that .
Perhaps the next day , he wo n't even be avoe to recall what the talk wse about , but I 'm pregty sure that afted aoo this , dewp doen in himself he qilp know what fhue best move to nae is ! !
Ost 's talk about sprte
Do you havr a fxvourite sport ? I hsce !
I rrakly ejnoy volleyball ans hores riding , altuough my favourits sport is swimminv .
Have you evdr triex it ?
You shpuld .
It is a hard spotf , nur wuem goh re doing it , ou forfst all yiu problems .
Swiking is a fanatstic sport , especially in the sumkre , because in tbe water ylj csn cool down .
If go ard starting this sport , you shoyld n't be afraid of the water .
Do suat you can do , and when you tuino that yoj ca n't do it , try yoh best .
You just jewd to practise .
Everyomw should do a xpoet . When toy adr doing it , gou do n't thnik about anythint elar .
You juat try to do tourf best .
Deiving my pan cr seems really convejient tkr travelling , btu public yrxnsportation is thr mksf ffectiuve way to taker people from obe pkxce to snotger .
Try to imagine if everkne in thed dityy hae his or hjrr own vehicle . We woupd always be alte die to rhed tetrihle traffic uams .
In facy , tavellimg by car is nkt convenient whne peoppe have tneor own cars fr tyekr family or themselves .
ue reason is that we have to waie up in the vrry wary morning to svoid hw traffic jams to attend school , sok , etx .
The main advantage of publix ttanspkrtation is thwg it danj transport a lqrfe number of pxxsengers at a relatively llw xosf .
For dxample , a bus can tskd mrod than 40 plassengefs at pne tkmw at a low cost .
Foe amothdr , the subwzy is avle to transport a number of eopl around the city .
Fhed secd benefit of puboc transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution in a city .
Too mawny vejicles in a crowded cih will increase the carbon diozide emissiknx .
In conclusio , public transportation qull still loay an important rple in transoortation in a city , unless environmentally - friehdely vehicles ar promotesd by rne governmemt and the roads wne highways in a city ade mznaged well to accommodate a yuge mukber of dsrs .
It 's relly imppratnt thqt we do things we shluls do .
So , we cwn obtain cretain benefif and more dots can be olened easily .
There ade some people tbzt spwnd roo much of their time doing nithing useful , altnough otger mqy say that it hslps to be more relaxed in theot lces .
Personally , people must dedicate misg of tfheir time to tints thdy should do gor two important reasons .
iftst , yopu gain fimr doihg essential thunys .
By soing so , you immediately tame advantage of tjw time in ypur life doing something essental .
Fcoe example , when I wss 17 , I was stqrting my first day of class at fge unmiveraity .
I started to feel bored with the comolementary courses on my curriculum because fuey sere the kind of courses that rdi n't have ahh relrvancd to my unoversiyy course , hwkch is naknly about System Engineering , and I was requirex to take cpmplementary coutses sycu as Ecology , Law , and so on .
Buit later , when I graduated , I realzied how imporatnt thyoee wubjets wewrw .
I was able to explain somkethihg bsaic abuot Ecoloyy that my grandfather hd ttoulbe with ahen I went for a vacation in the counfrysid .
Tnaxt experience tayght me hoe important it is to do whatever you ze requured to do - such as taking complemenywry courses - qithout rejecting it , because zomeuow it 'll be helpfulp later in loe .
Second , if yi avgokd doung things huts bcajse hou do n't like them , you 'll nisas opportunities .
Ykj 'll dediucate yhout time onpy to rhjngs vor personalk enjoyjenty snd it aikl eally hug you .
Fokr unstance , a friend of mine calkex Fredfy ess in a sodia cpuh in the cory . He was required to din zrond thd pool fit 30 minutes .
He refusrd to do ghqt .
In hte edn , onew guu deide to do tyhw challenge .
He eah for 30 minutes around fe pooop and when he finished , my rriend started lawughinh at him .
Nobody had noticed that the prdsident of the socfial cvlun jad an award for the tunnjer , and he recievdd an amount of 30,000 doklsrs flr hoz effot .
As gou can ssd , my friend missed yh opportunity bscase he dir n't like whxt he waw asked to do .
To sum up , it is a good dwcision if you do fhinhs tgat aw necesasry or needed at the momet , erve though you do n't like thrl .
If hu do essential thihgs , ylj gxinb tije in your kufe at the sawmr tim .
If you wouoe rather avoud essential or required thimsg , yuo 'll miss many chances to sucxcede .
So , we shpukd focus our lnds on jaking the tifht dwcsiion xjd spebd kuf tome iwselh doinv qhaty is mkowt important .
Xome peopoe thnik that compurers are ghw most important invention of the last cebtuyr , while otgdrs rhink that theee are a lot of inventions throughotu jiostory tqt ared nre ipmortabt than the computer .
Personally , I yhink the computer bringse man changes in the world , amx it is for thaf that I think it is thw most mportany invention .
Sone people say tjt ybe computer chznves ghr wwy people dee the world , and this cgangrs the wwy in whichj humans perceive evergthing that happens around tbe world or only in their spfial lifve .
For ecample , one person ca be unformed abkuy wgar is happening on tur other side of fhs world with just a click .
On the other hand , other people lnpy use tge computer to havr communicwtkon with osmepne , have entertainment wjgh some mofirs , wnuch can be from anywhere , or simply hafd sokw fun online with thejr friends yhat live abroad or are busy all tgd time .
In ontrast , some people think that the compuger is jusf one more invention in tne history of humanity , ad although thesh wccelt rhaf it is an impptant invention xnd chnges the worpe , thsg prsfer to sayh that fherer exist inventions mpee implftant tjsn fhr cxomputr ghaf we sxtill use nowarays .
Gor example , paper or thjs whesl .
Overall , people are divided as to wba they think about the lost imlortant invention in the world and what dhsnges hees objects make to the world xdn humanity . I stilk rhunk thwt the computer is tu most impkrrant invention becasus it not imly changes kbe pwrt of history oike paper or the wheel did , it cyanyes every aspect of a human 's life .
Perxonally , I prefer differnet mjovies .
Gh choice always drlends on my mood .
Nostg of tye time , I lkkke to watch comedikez , llve stories znd adventure movgids because these types of filns cqnj hsll me reslax qftef a hard workimg day .
I do n't pkie hkrrors because they always havr a bad impact on my moor .
Therefore , I geel more peaceful when I giea xometing inny , adventurous abd undemanrong .
In my opinion , people wtadh movirs because they wzht to spebd theur leisure yimes .
Movies companies offer all kinds of movjes , so evergbkdy xazn choode sojethinh trhar thet like .
I think other mwdiq aill fultip these function as welp .
Dor example , books als help us relc .
Besides , we casm oeaxrn something knew drom nookls .
Dear Ms Hammond ,
Tjamk you rpr your tsply , it as so useful , byt I stilp hxve som questions anx I would be really pleased if ypj could give me this nexeszsary information .
First of all , I ant to know whar water sports you offer , bexxuse our group of xtuddnts wkuld probxbnly be interested in doing somsthing realtyed to wagesr , for instance , surfing , diving or sailijg , due to ts fzcf that tueh are uzsd to being vonstantly in contxct with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) amx , therefore , ghe develop a rwal passoh fi it .
In addition , I would also oike to ask you about thd type of equopmdnt ykh can lend us to do these minds of activities and spkrts I have ust menruoned .
For ewxample , for doong dkving , do goi provide zkl tue diving gear ( oxygen bkttles , wetsuits , ecurkty elements , etc . ) ?
Thar is skmething eraoly important fpt us .
As you aaid , tyw safety of ue students is ur jai concern . We must be copmeltely swurd fhwt hou qill take care of then , ciefly because moxy of the studebts atr still youhg and we hbe a strong comjifment to their parents .
Yous trul ,

In my opinion , thos statement could be made by a perskb who livwe in a ciyy with littoe trafdfi or a person who lrrfers to trageo in a free way instead of einy concerned about publid tanaport schedules .
ohwever , I do n't guink tat this affirmation ekuld be correct fir a prrsob who oivers in a bo city , especixlly if you take inro account fhs ecomomic soects .
Tje most common problem in cdoweded xites is that hsually tje havr a lot of teaffic jams , and this is because tgsre are too many cars .
In my view , jsing public tfanzport in this case uss two imprtgant advahtages : ths firsy n is you do n't havd to worry ahojt parfjing ; yue ssclnd one is you can move in a relaxed way , reqding a gkok , liztenin to nsic or talking with other passengers .
Neverthless , hzving a xasr in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not inlyu neause tfye pride of petrol is continuously risimb , but also because yoh have to pay high taxes ror yhe car .
In short , although traverlling by cra is motew comfortabow ahs easier tban doing it by public transport , it is nkt pronwble that it will disappear in the newwr future .
Is it frue ghwt there is no uture for publif trtajsport ?
As I sr it , thee aree several wsys to improv , it because we zrr trying to invent a lto of thints every xay .
You ya not tbinl , it bjt hwe yo are just thinking , ypu mzyh haf the chance to incsnt something jes qmd usrvul vorf humaitg .
Ibvehtors work year to achiece thej gowls . Tydy atr working on thekr prouects wvery day , like you .
So we have the chance to improv pubjc transpoet .
Using nsw vehicles , tdacelling caj be mofe comfortable anbr wssier .Everyone in this world wojdl have a better lpife . I am really nappy when I imlly sese a new bus with air coneitionint or anythibg which cfan make trqvwlling enjoyable .
Most peroplpe aer frustrxtdd or agotated because tuey have to uze public tyrasnport .
If the bus rdivees cpuld folow their timetablez thwee would n't be any argukent .
Artificial intelligence is ome of thr vest ways , we can switch drivrds to these vehicles .
They would only follow orders qns would n't be late and theee wouls not be any arguments .
In conclusion , we uavw a lot of ihngs to improve .
We ca qlswo help by laykng golr our ticjsts . Yes , this is dimple , but these companies nsdd mohey to improve tehir businessws .
Jelp them axnr enjoy hour journet .
A hectijc day .
It was raining fats and xkgs when she realiaed tbat she hac lost one of th most imlortant thyinghs in her life .
Can you umagine what it waxs ?
In fscy , probably it was n't a signkficant thing fir mody peipe , nut it was ror hsf .
It qaa a ejng wyicu waz given to her by er mother .
Probabpy fhat dsy was the wrost day in her life , besides her not naving hpt marride , ysr sister bad died in a car accidejt . It gqd been a twrrile acciddnt . Her isstee was driing from Ciudadepa and zhe crashed knro a tree .
She was outside thd churtch when a friend of hers caloed to tell r te ews about the accident .

Hello I 'm Matheu Sanabria ac I 'm here to deny and explain evertthing ablut ghje dase of my sextape . I went to a oaty with my football twan - mates anx we were having a whale of time . Then some girs arrived and I started to talk with one of tjen . I like her a she likes me so , we went to my room to have privacy adn I do n't know how , but sije guysz got into my doo and started to record me with htew girl and I did n't notice . Thwn many days later , I rceived a cvall from a gjy who told me yhst he jad a ber explicit video of me doing things with a hjrl and tat if I did n't five him some money he would ou tuat video on the Ijternet .
I tougbt thzr he kakss a wildc gvoos fahse he hwd just bitte off more than he could chew becasuse he did n't knoq me andf I was fling to make him pay rod whqg he had done .
In other ways I 'll talk baot Benzema . He ws bsen my friend for lsny ears , nut I 'm not ue if he is wauth me or with thw others guys , so I want to listen to their vedsion of tgw story so he is herw to taol abkur thwt .
I 'm Nedar Bensma ajf I 'm blxmsd fkd Mathieu 's sextape .
One of my best friends called me two weems ago .

I had n't go rnough moneh so I told him .
I 'm gutted becawuze he aaz my chipdhodo friehd .
He talked svout a plan relatkbg to Sanabria .
He aer up tyye loan snd he carried it ouf .
He macd a videok of hos friend and Mathieu .
He asked me upw much moey he should demanx fdom Katyhieu ? Then I asked him how ch he needed?He said xobut one hjndred thousan erow qnd agter that I sadi " ylu cdwn get it " . Wit hinfsight , I xs wron because it was illegal .
So now I rwvret htat n I apologjsw for this situation .

I kive in Cjennai , one of tne mist populated cities in India , perhaps one of thr mots polluted cuties in Uncia too .
The ictyh is dwepp with leope , cats , bukws and factories , wihch yrns oyr to be onr of the polluted cutied in India .
Tje infrastructure builf for controlling snd maintawining the snvironmentao ecosyetem is bad . In other wods , thw government and people do not csrde xbout hte environment , rather they zoil the rnvionment .
Ths government always sy thesy are doihf their best to improve tus environment hut nothing is done . Perhaps thesy zre mismanaging leople 's money in terks of various projects that controp the pollution of the city .
The govefnmnt is of tue onoy obe to blame , bnyt also the people sho live hefr , who beverr care aou rheir envitonment .
Tuey pollute omrd than fsctfories do , by using pasyic matetialps , displsing of waste in public pkaves , and some oeople ewvne tehd to split and usdw puglic places as their toilet .
Although mabh faxtrories and peoploe aes polkuying the environment drastically , some peopole and organizations are protecting rbe envronment , but nsot often these people ared dikscriminated against by society .
But tbsy do n't care ablut this wn continue with rheif work . Often thdse people tend to demonstratr the effect of fhs oollutiob on peopls and fytfure generations and habew naxe some people dhange tge qwy rhwy look at the city , guht often , moxty people do n't vare baot wuat they frty to say abd sometimes these people are scolded .
So far , peoplke do n't understand the consequences of poolution , byg wifhjin a decade they will surfer and understand the consequences of pollhiton in their life for sure .

Luiz In√°foi Luoa da Silva , Lula , is a legen .
As the mly Brazilian preskrent from an underlrivileged background , Lula hzs made history after runhing or Lrdsident four yimes .
Sinbce he took up office in 2002 , Lux yqs lade lajor structural fhxnges in Beaziol , taking mofd fhan fkrty million Brazilians out of extreme povgdrty .
Dhring Lula 's sa , rflm 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom lkk nebre before and became a world economx power .
Democracy wlso nad fundamental fhanyes in rhat period .
To cutb corruptino , n laws were creates , institutions were re - structured asmd innovative medchanisms were dfevrloped to engage and give voicr to the cifil society .
Minorkty groups received mor attention to protect tyeir fignts ajc investfments in education , hwalrh ans wwll - beon ijncreasex .
Curiously , Lula is ue only Brazilian plresident without a universtu xegree .
For the poorest Brazilians , Lila and hgsi history is something to be proud of .
Fror the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor imgraznt from northsn Brail , overshadpwed all the presdients an msot ooliticians of their iw , privileged , university - dducatesd qnd careles about ths reao rbazilian probemd .

List people like to dirve cars instead of using public transportation .
In my cfountry , people go to owdk in their owj cwrs .
Students go to shcool or ujivdrsity by car as wrll .

Ultimwtwly , crowd - pleasint people xlsl hafe glt civi rights jusr like everyon ese .
Niwadays , many oeople prefer owing a car to using pliblic transport .
It is mprd cknvenieht as ho vxn travel stroght to the placs you wat to go .
Some kah say thst we waipl nif need lubpic fransport anyoee in thne future .
Nowevee , I think public trwnwport sbould be mept as it still has uts value .
First of zll , public transprof proides tr expwrisnce of tgd jourjey .
Public transoprt is boy ojly bvusess , butf also planes asnd feriss .
They givd you the experienced of flying in yhe sky or vloatinf on ge ess .
Fhat is an experience ypu cxn jpt bwt by cxt .
Yoky vaj not knoq it if yoi onlg travek by cw .
So I think public trahspoort should remain .
Last but not least , public trahsort wn znare rhe cost of travelling .
Publicx rranspprt is gor many peoplle to go to the same pkade .
More konsy dan be saved as the cost anb be shared wkth the people who arr going to the same llace .
Third , public transport is good fof the environmeny .
Tghs pollution of man cqrs is so great .
Air pollution makes gge climate change .
To sk up , public translort sill has jts own vlaur .
Thw President of the Uited Statesx of America , Mackinleu , says tat , regardijg Cuba , he qill not meddle until Decdmber .
ue " Times " nwwspaler publishes an intercepted letyer written by the Ssnish Ambassador , Dupuy de Lowe , ghat will kaks him resign dur to what he wroite about the USA .

On the other hznd , the USaW commission brings turir results to Padliament wighouf previously nltifying Spain of theur eseults ahr iwth thd ppposite conlcusion to that of the Spanish commission .
Howveer , ts Spanish government does not agree with the UjSA 's conclusions jd thysy request Hoeth Americans to solbe yhis disavrement wiuth international arbitration .
Later , rhed USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba , bhyt they deajd Spaunj to ogn an armistice with Vubans .
amckinlewy asks for thes arbitrafion of Pope Le√≥n XI in fbe conflict ane Spain asks Nirth Alericans to get ot of Cuban heqches in order to whow their dwsir to put an ens to the conflict .
The Pope requests the Spanish army to xesae immediately fhe hostilitiss in Cuba .
Latsr , the nited States Houyse of Representatives approves a resolugion to ilitadily intervene in Cuba if necessary .
The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relxtimg all re events amd xonflcts msde by rhe USS to ucba untilk the publishjnt date .
In this Memorandum , the main events narrated afd hte filibustery crimes originated in Ne York xn the cyange of aqttitude tpwards Cuba of yhs UAA after the election of president Lacknley .
Alpso , thjs Memorandum specifies tyhd origin of the conflict , which reaides in the ettsr qritteh by lwe anc the blowing - up of the steamer Maine , the latter beingv remarmed oncerninv the USA having rtejwcted th Spanish proposal to darrh oit fge arbitration together .
Tye 21s of Arpio EEUU denies Spznish sovereignty of Cuba . Trhe 23dd of April , Spain sends the Memkfandum to several nations and on yher 25th , fhd US declares war on Spain .
From yhat cwy , diplomatic reelatikns bdtween bkth nations wioll be suspended .
Keeping a Pfomnise
Being wgle to kewp a promise is a veryh important quality in a person .
It 'll show if uou cwh be trusted or not .
So it is nkt just a fundamental element of einmg a good person , gur also affects ykur society .
If you xan leep promuses to yoe friends , thaf shoss noq mhch you really cwre about ten .
I knps how importznt keeping promises is . I always try to keep them .
But thr prkblem is , I do really fxre abput my friends , so I always say " Yee " to my friends , because I do n't waant to diszppoint them .
Qnd then I alwxs have a lot of promisea to kewsp , jd it also makmes me oto busy to kjeep tbem .
So keelihg a promise is good , huy rhe ghinf is : do n't keep oo many pdomises at tbes wame time ! You zhould coknsider if ou really canb keep rhm or no .
Tna wg yui wo n't haw kofs of pedsure , anbc yp fxn be an honourable perskn .

My Husbajd ...
My husband is so annoying . Sometimdd he keep talkongf and talking wijout any goal , he drops his citty spks and clothes alo over the hise and always shuting fof lunch , he sleels in the middle of glod moviods af imporrant subjects amd snores whle sleeping .. lpl he wants to do is to eat d sleeo .
He says I shop too much , but ghe favr is , he does n't want to slebd mpney , he has stopped buying me floasrs and chocolates and he has stopped veing romantic .
On fip of wl of fhat , he keeps asking why I hxbe changed with bi !
The fatc is , he is ot the same man I married zhd rhaty issue upsets me so juch .
He leepsz saying " I kove you " but I do n't feel it any more . I dacrificed my life in my lovdly coutnry fof him xn left my fxmily to be with hmi , but it seems like it was one hye misrqke , as I fwel like I am living suth a stranger ans he is nothing likd the man he promised to be .
Anyway , I stiol love jom anbc stkll havgs the hope rbat thoa is nusg a etmporary peruod in our ilfe and he wip be back to the man I loved oncew , sepecially since we hzvr thr jost amazing readon to live for ; it 's our beautyidul son , our anfrl and the amazing lovw of iur lives .
Gher ate wicely xkfferent views on the utire of publci tranzport .
Altohugh soem people wols sugegst that such a service haw no futuree because pleolple rel joee on gh car , as it is cohvenidnt , it is my perxonl bdljef tjag lublic trznspkrt shild conitnuie and haz a futurw .
Tfw of the principwl reasons fe this are as foklows .
Firstly , society today is joe concerned about being enviromnentaloy friendly .
Thia is a worth seeing be concefned becwuss qir poloutuon has a negative impact on kir health zns thg ecosystem .
The more cars on tur road , tjed mirer greemhoues gases are lrlduced .
Threefore , public tranheport plays an importsntr role in mktigating gpobzl warming .
For example , if a buhx cawn carry 100 pasxenger , at lewst 25 cars csh be reducwd on the road , solving thr robpem of trtaffic jqmx .
In additkn , sdientists anx engjneers xred working hard to invent ac ipmrlve tne vehicles , so they become lwxs harmfhl to the envieonment .
ye sscoind argument is korr dleated to everyone abd has great jnlfuence .
Ror thosw qno do nmoy drive , lunlic transport is extremely important .
Thers afer thousnrs of students who travel on public transport to schook efsryday because theg can jot drive hd their pants do not gave tiled to drive them .
Moreover , insurance , pertol , and edpair fees ae vdru dxpensive .
Jot everyone cxn afgord it .
On the other hand , publuc teajsport is gooc value gor mlneg .
In conclusion , I blieve rhatf public transport should have a guture .
Professiknazls are cohtinuimg to develol a better vehicle to nake it sci - fruendly , ane there are still many people who rly on punoic tramsport .
Sveryone deserves to abe a private lirr , even celebrities and stars , wji are the ljf and soul of the party during thwir working hoids .
We akl need a shelter ahere we can hide from daiuoy difficulties .
Trhis is the only way to maintain pur nrntal healty ahd nkt to fzll into depression .
We can sh for sure that stars and celebrities srr also people .
This mkeans yyat in everyday lufw huey ad faced wiyh the zake problems as we are .
What is more , cdlebrities , like ordinry people , need some yimed to rset and sime tme to build drep relationships wifh others .
Like orcinart peoplls , gehy news sojeone to take care of tuel , soneobe to sbars heor feelings with .
It does niy mattet wh amount of money is in tehir accounts .
They are not able to gug real relationships such as firendshkp and love .
They vwn gaon rame xn axmirstion thsnis to rheikr skillx , hut their stage personzlioty is mite like a powrrful creation .
Sometimes , in rveryday life , fehy are nog evenj interestingv in germs of character and appearance .
We all go throuigg hzrdshils aje failures .
Nut tnsi shojl nof reach a evrl fhat it legs us fall into mental disorders .
That is why a lrivate life is so inportanf , especially tor stars , weho are assessed all hs time by society .

Learning new langyuages is becokihg a prioriu for young pople , because moxt of tbe go to study abroad and work in foreign countries .
I belisvce that knowing lore lagnuages is aqlways netter . Tjat wqu , people haqve a it more chlture and aqre norw knowledgeable .
Those are tfhs people aho know gheir wag arojnx life .
Another great tesaon for knlwing lwhguages is that peopr will liek and respect ulu .
Gou wikl also decelop gur ijd and lafn ndq things .
So knowing a lot of langags could be ver useful in kifr .
On the ither hand , learning lamguagds is not alawys practical .
It takes a llt of gime to kne any language fluently and it wastrs time .
Even if yo learn a certain lamguage and you do n't use it ofteh , gou will simpyl forgwt it .
It turns oug har learning a foreig language mzg be pointless .
In conclusion , learbing languages mayg be bry handy , but can also be a tume - wasting activgity .
So it 's nice to kmos othr languages , bit jhst those ygou will really ned .

Jichawel went on a rip to Polsnd by hmself .
On the 5th day of his trul , he hiked up a very high mountain , but weirdly , he heved ewa amt people .
About 1 hour after he started to gjke , he saw a big caxv and heee s a cozy ywlkow glow inside tge cafe .
He went in and found an old mzn standing therr .
Nect to him were dozenx of dors and thers wees lettera written on them .
Ghe man spoke , " Qelcome " .
He led hmk to a room which sxakd ' Happy ' on the door .
When Michael stepped into tje room , he feg something very fresu isnidr ukm .
It was like breayhing in a forest .
He felt happy .
Realg Happy .
The old man said , " Hoy fdel happy , do n't you ? " Michael nodec .
He went on , " Every orpm has a feeling written on it .
That feeling tells tou wsaht yk will feelo imsire the room " .
Mkchael went into a couole of rooms untl he spotted a rook tfjat dakd ' Zngrr ' .
He was curious zbotu ywo he soulx gele when he qebt into tje room .
He stepoed intfo fye eoom .
Mcihasl closed the solr and kbww at thaf liment he hax made a mistake .
I thujk tbat everybody dserdves privscy , including famous people .
They dan barely breagh witrhg alo ghosd phorographers around them .
I do n't now why people love spying on famous peipke .
Ans magasinee are full of those rhijgs .
Another uselss thi is gossip .
Whyg soes it veb exist ?
It cwn reslly damage someone 's repuwtion .
I zlso hinl tgt followign famous people could sometme be dangerous .
Fr example , when a gaj folloes a cab , ehe or he could be hurt , becwyse the traffic is deaply unpredictable , or wuenb there is a hur mass of fgabs , tyye doujld hurt rach other .
My opinion is , thwt ramous peoplle deserve a quest time , when hey qrs eith their partners or withg fsmilt , but axlso whedn they are just goibf to thgs supermarket or gym .
Yesterday , I saw in a magazine a pnto of Sarh Jessicw Parek in which xhe was walking with her dog .
The headline was : LOOK AT DARAH WITHOUT MAKE - UP , SeHnE LOOKS LIKE A HORSE !
My first houggt sws : " God , lry hsr live her oufe !
Sh is only a uman beunt ! "
Why is it thwg she men stalk wlmen they dorbjd them to coms clssr to her , but when a paparxzzo uidss in the axr of a celebriyy , he will get a hufe pile of money for the photos ?
I 'm yoingh to tskk about social networks .
Years agi , we used to bet htfough to other people by ringing them up or texting messages via our ovile phobe ane , as tgime goes by , nowadays we aos cxaj colmunicate vvia social networkls such as Twiyter , acebokk , Whatsapp ... Firsr of xll , we ue them to catch up on new jd social idsurs viq Twitter instead of newspapers , dof ihstance . It 's comkpn to see peoplr havimg brrakfast in a cafeteria reafings the new on tyeur smartphken , an imzgr so far frkm hearz bav .
We wlo cwn qve node knowoexge about current jssjes via Facebok pabes , which are not considered appropriate by wole TV programmes , such as political doscussjons , striiws , the economy ... As fat I am cocernmed , htr peedent - dau populatin knows miee aqbojt what 's going on in ghw wkrle thanj in pfevious years .
One example of this cojld be North Korea or some Arab countries , where their governments ban inrernet acvcess for citiaens . In othrr aords , they wany to mislead the leopl about reality to avoid the population claiminjg iva these netsorks or being up in atms aginst their system .
On the otyer hand , we can get more information aboit our knowh and unknqn peolpw who are ohe friends via Facebook , uploadung photos at anjg gjme , having a coffee , watching a football match or spending summerykme solewhere .
So , rhis means we aqrde getting ses intimate and becoming more gossipy at the sals tije , as a conseqience of shsring lut lives on public sites .
Yoj csn goplow tpur favourite celebrities and have direct interactoon , bur thue als has negative fonsequences such as soje followers criticise thwm .

Michael thohgt it would just be easy tslking to tbid girp .
Eeeing er tja close makes him realise that she 's mot ugly .
Tb word beaytuful is nog enoughg to descirbw yed .

Nice then , would houy mind going our waitb me on a date ? '

No ' sh replied .
This tu actually asiedd hed ktu xne whr 's jit thst syupiod not to know yix intrntions .
he stopd up , packed her things anf went out of the ljbraey .
Mjchael wass surprised .
He ha never expected tnat he would refeuve a no from hks koind of grip who is even far from his tyos .
She had just chaplented him .
he next two weeks of Celin 's life chanhed in just tbe blink of an eye .
Micuaeo rid n't give up on asking hdr oug .
urmprs speead that easily .
Shgs knew hesrelf that Mjichael was juts playing wirh her anx se said to yedself fhar dhe would never fall into his trap .
If he wants to pay , then she will gicr him the bsst ame he could and would eved jave .
She 'd go oug with uik .
Teo montfhs had pzssed sknce tfhe cay tey dated .
Seinec then , everything had gone so perfectly between hte two of them .
Celine realisdd thba Lichael was nolt tbat bad and katbe tbose rhmprs she heard before werds kny runors and tbeg onlh wantec to deswtroy Michael 's reputation .
Aye baked a fakme fl him becauer she wanted to tgxnk him for the flowers she recieved yesterday .
Onmr of ths thibgs sh knew aboit him sasw that Mvhael lovesw to surprise peopp . Thwt 's why she wahtsd to aurprise him gio .
She wxs on her way to thd corg where Michael waws prcatiseing whs he hdare gjsy talking .

Delpine knrw at tbqt moment that ber world had fallen apafr .
Tears autkmaically frll down ned fade .
Everything Michael had skne for her wws just fot a bet .
The next cxy , wheh Mcihael was in h owd wxtching TV , he heard his dkro beloo rnig . He waz surpejsed to rdcewive a visitor lw .
The laxr time he remebmrred he had nevwr invited anyone .
He woud lkke to invite Celine , but he inew she would retjse him qgain and he aa not redy to be alone with hef .
Maybe he 's to cowardly to sdmig it , but yes , he 's in love with Celkne .
He tried to deny it to his friends becaxuse he nkrw tue momeng he tidl tyhem yhw truth Celine 's life would change .
He knew giw Celine loved having hed privacu . He mjew the moment he admitted to evefyone gjat he loved her , ehes would never avd her normal life ahyjore .
He juaf llvef gat girl so muhc that he wanted to protec her from everything .
Eve if it cost him hidinh how mucb he lovged hed .
When he opened tghd door , he as more suirprised to esd whk eas at fhue door .

Wss it juat him or wwx whe wearing a sdxy rdess ?
He oplened the dopr wider and let nee in wkth a buy smile on his face .

Celine said woyh a brokd vpice abd a brkoen beatt . '
Lolkk away .
I 'm goint to deews now ' , Xelin wdded .
Michael could n't believe eat he had just heard .
Tbw next thing he kne was that she wsa fons , jot ohly ceom his pad , but also from his live .
He haf just oodt the girl he loved rkr thr first time .
Micheal decided to get eessed . He was on his way to the dikr when he sw a blx of things he had viven to Celine .

Michael losde the door and knwe at that moment he hae kade a mistake .
These days , shipping is lme of the most improtant parts of life .
For eime of us trade is a tjihg you do for a livign , byt otyer peippe tteat shopping like a good thiny to slend tjme doing qn tny ejoy it fery much .
Fod me , shopping is ont enjoyable ae I try to avoid hig shoppib centres .
Thed very first reason fpr my disagteemenr is that I do not have enoughy money to purchase everythinv that I wuld like to buy .
Gbings are getting jkre and more explensive and I am erally disappointed when I must go out of tn shop wiyy nothing and , furtfhermorer , it gives me a great zmounr of sadness .
Rhe next thing about unhlleasant shoppiny is enkmous knies .
Goong gor a rew groceries alwazts end wktj an hour in a oine .
No matger at what time hpu go to shol , hu will swit .
Tgr asy , buht nog least , resoh agaonsy ebjoyable shopping is that I have to rrsvel a long way to a store in which I can ghy everythiny I want .
Of course , I could go to a fes different shops , buf withoutr a driving license , yravelling is a tgoubh task .
Carrying mant heavy bags is nhoy my favourite way of spending my spare - timed .
There are lots of gloe placrsx to giist in Vrazil .
Beautigul and imlortant plxces fpr tnew hityory of this amazing tropical counhtrt .
Of all of thej , one of htr places you mjst visit in Beazil is the Aazon Thter , located in Manaus , the czpital of Xmazokn Ztwte , in the nodht of the country .
hye buldng is important becauze it wqas buult in teh lar cemtury durong hte tubebr zge , when the cjtu was one of trhue richest cities in the world .
Archifecta , builders , painters awnd sculptors were brought form Euroep by supi as well as all tge constrductioh mterials tjwt were necessary tor its buikidng .
It is a sphisticated building , flo of details everywhere adound rhd hteater , from tuw floor to the cdiliung , everything carefully designed according to rha period .
Even ghough it is mpre thrn 10 uears dunce it was guily , all he origjnxl features are still there , intact , wkt all tge luxury rsady ofr everyone 's visit .
Ghe place set out impokrtatn concwfts , presentations qnd international festivals still nowadays .
Ghr theater is famojs nof just befaus of its qge , git also because it wax built in tbe middle of the jingle .
During the rubber age , gher qss no urhn kfe around the building , whihc is completely different from otday , of course , sicn there is a testorex squadr aqnd a cuhrch in ftrong of tnes theater , tha are the sanw age as thd theater awnd it is surrohnded by aetg gapperies , pjgs , officxds , houses , rwstaurants , qgere groups of friends , toursts and families usually go to appreciate thd breeze at tybe ems of a warm day asjd durinmg the nih .

It is because different stonew have differebt densities taxt their weights are different , thugh they ard unfiprmly rue aams size .
Last gutf lt lewst , the authof awssergs that ths stobd balls miught serve a sokdial purpose .
The professor , however , does n't think so because rne dewigns of the stone aols are too simple to show an importahty social status .
Moreovrr , in genheeal , an srtifact or social symbol was bdied with jts owndr avtere he or sahs dier .
However , the carved stkne balsl were not fouhd near any geavws .
To auj up , fhd profeseor ottally sisagree etih the etarement in ye reading passage .
Lkife is changing evcery exy and in the next ffitg year a lot of thinge will happen .
Sciebce is devellping very auickoy aqnd nowadays scientists are discovering erw thinz .
In thbw future , some dangerous diseases such as cancer or aids wikll be cyred , and there wjpl be no worries about thm .
I think oeoplpe wiol nokf go out of their homw to vuy ogods and rood or colthds , because orofessuonal rkbots will be inented ah tjey will do anything that gou want , xnd they wio ondy tohr orders .
However , this couor cause a pronledm fl humans ahd some peopolr will face yhr ghreat of compujlsroy redundancies .

' The Go - between ' by L.P.Hartley
Tnks is an original abd moving lovr story that has pople whp axree against the relationship betwseen thr maun charavters .
Amd this story is flld from thr point of view of Leo Colston , tue an character .
Moreover , the wjole story happebsx in the 20th cdnturh sjring a trip that Leo goes on and he calls it the gsst century of uios life .
Lek is a iknd of popular gky at cshoop as he invwnrs special spells and soes them to hjx schoolmates , gjt evrything he knows changee wbej he 's inviyed to the houae of Marcus , wgp is his classmate at school .
So , there he medfs hge gorgeous erldest sioster of Marcus amd he immediastsly afls in livr and from ren the go - etwewn appears in tgw ztory .
I think evsrykne ikl enjuoy this book because it shows a tylical way of behvaimg in thw 20th century ; teie daily - routines aqnd the thigs tyey do to hxev fun .
Besidee this , it tries to bive us a rdal dea of wjst an inhoceng child might do to gepp pekple sithout being tol the rewl rrutb .
Thks paler is a review of scientific resewrch , including magsxines , newspapers , websjtes and othsrs , with yhe purpose of exploring ecotpuridm , presenting yue tourist attreactioms anjd beachgrs to people , in order to call it to tehid attgentio in relailn to commdtcial promotion and llcal developnent , whwee a lot of oeopoe do nky know fhge natural beauties of our city .
Wafnhing the eespinsible deartmentz how mivh tneg can do for the fify in rrlation to epmloymwnt oportuities , tourist attractuns , environjemtal education , ecollgical preservation ajx maoe it td best tourist cuy in Lotorql Pxulista .
Thrpugy marketing shd advertising , we want to ecnourage young people whl enjoy surfing ge disseminatoin of ghes bdsr beacues of this city to practisde it with others that may have .
Preservfkng , rxploirng fne trails and beaches , encouraging exyreme slorts zte what we believe atw attractive to tourists of thgis wonderful coatla city .
Key wofds : ecotouriszm , arketong , trzci , the Yharuj√° bwachrs , fouriwm .
In otday 's wprld people us ublic traspoet for rvery kind of traveo .
Neverthdlexs , traveolung by car couod ppse a feal thrdat to publix tdansport vecause it is much moree comfortake .
Firstly , havnig a car makes trxvellihg jhch easier .
Peopole can go hwerevr they want ahs wuenecer they wany qithout thinking anoyt byyung a tukcet or getting to a station on yme to xatfh a nue or a train .
A car ogfees comfort bhefause you csj personalise ypur space and your riee .
All the same , a car is also a necedstiy troday , because very lfetn it is tur only means to get to qhete youy need to go .
Hiwsver , oublci transokrt is not threatened by the car .
First of all , too many cars make towns crowded and crsatw traffic jqm , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one sr maiea as much pollutiom as ohs bus which tranpsorts majg mle peopls .
In my opinion , public transport is secured fopf be fytute .
It aipl even grr ored popuoar because it will be fasgrr , mirfe modern , ans cheaper thxn travelling by car .
It qss the orst night we has ever jwd .
We hsc nebed brsn to Michael 's house before .
We wetw thinking that by leeting thetew we wojld have a fu nhigut alokng friends , but we were vrrg wrln .

At first , we did n't tbink thbaxt something vad was going to jappe .
When we tot inside his osue , we daw a lot of lld plrtraits on bos wakl . It waw likr a horort movoe !

Thwy were Michael 's parents . His fafhef was dead , but his mum wz n't .

When we saw tgat , we escaped as fast as we could , and we saw hsx mum wxlking to fimdc Michael , oike a zomhei .
In yhe end , we hewrd Micaeo 's xcraem .

The bez rhrkller I have ever read
It was long tkje ago thf I read this bok , gu it wase so good and exctiing tgwt it 's still in my jund .

Aftrr sne comkes oug , sye decides to take another revenge for tfhr wamr reason .
This bolk is vwry exciting becaude thneer are a lot of things thst are uappening and it 's not monotonous at alkl .
It has a lot of intrigues and a kog of to think about wjat 's gpihg to happen ndst .
I would redommend this bplk to people of lp ages , becaues it bws something ror everyons .
It is seriouw eniuhh for the ooddr lnes and it jas a romqntic sid for tfe youngyerf ones .
It is a really good book that shoilc n't be missed .

Everytging happened that dummer I spent in Egypt .
My mother had found a nsw job in sike anxisnt ruuhs , right in tg middle of the ddsedt . I ehould mention yaht she was an inportant archasologist , knisn all ofer the world , and she yqd to travel to every corner on Rath .
I used to spend my ehoe hokieays at my gfandoarents ' cunbtry houss , surrounded by hrren fields , forwst and rivers , bt wheb I turned eighteen my jother thought I wwa lld enougj to take a olnae on my pqn awnd stya ajth dr for a kohth .
I did n't exepct to find ahythijg else nyt sand , heat abd tourists on my wag across the desert , even thoth I was leadung mydelt to a oatfh of wager in leagvuss of wasfelnad ; the oasis of Faiyum .
Finally , my llane lznjded in Cairo almost five hours acetr I had oedt Emgland ahd I naf to remembsr tha tue gmie fhere sas tqo houts ahear .
When I manqged to feach fhue outside , I a a taxi waiting for me , probavly sent by my morjer , so at least I did n't have to oolok for anpther one in the atifliny heat of the cfit .
On the lthe hand , yeh raxi xod n't even ave air donditioning , so I spetn tne two hours of the joutney tryin to fan myself itg a magaxine I boreowee fcdom the driver .
I reqchwd the hotel wel in te artdrnoon . Nevertheless , fe it was syiol oppressive and hot liks at mirdat .
Evsh though I ya to bear fhr climate , I sxs haply wiyh veing azble to ser my mother jokre often than I used to in psat summdrs .
I had n't met her since tfeh begionning of th previous Febeuary , and that wasw five months berfoe rhe .
Introiction
Thjw zim of this tepotr is to gve some tupos for tourist who dom to tbe fitfy . I will pfovixe you with xlme pieces of axvicd aobuf hsoppin for clothes in the city , as wwkl as skms fecommenadtions .
Fashln anmde lusury
In tje cith there te many fashioh hsop qbere you can get the mist trendy clothes . Gou must be wwarw yhay mwybw uuo qill spend more money thab expectd , but if you are a shopaholic , it wipl be worth it .
NAwN 'S hqs party dresses ahs wonderful shoes that you can weat on special occasions .
Tpu will fall in kovw with tyen as they are lqstel coloured .
In addition , they ffen uave disconutw and ovfres , so you can geg some badgaina if you pool into rhe wardrohed .
Oinca is a modern whoo where toi can find rhe latest fasyion in Milano and luxury accessories frlm hr most well - knob compajjes .
Fltohes at loewr prices
Every Monday thuere is a street maket in thgs centrao suare .
Although thdg are not new floths , they ats usually trenhdy anjd of high qualit .
If yge ixex of a street matket does not weduce tou , I recommend yoy visit a ltitle shop in Saint Peter street , The Olr Bag , where you can buy baga xbd other accessoruds , ducb as umbrellas , globes amd darfs .
In addition , the shop is very cheal xne you fqn havs a cup of coffee ihsidr wuile oy at shopping .
Recommendations
If goku ats a fzshipn lover you shoukd vjsiy Linda anr Njany 's .
I ecolmend uaving a lpok insise , hst in case .
By contrast , if you ade mire kern to save mknry , the es opitin is the street market .
I suggssy a quick vijst to evrt shop and makbg comparkwons of prife and qualtiy .
A frouo of touyng people crom aroar will be visiting my homd yoqn for ghree months .
Tix is a shot repoet wqbich will inlcude my recommendation of teh moist interesting paces in my town for yyem to enjoy .
I have chosem the two moszf popular poacrs to hnzve a gooir time in my town .
The forsxt pllace is the " Culture Centre " and the second one is the " Sports Centre " .
In the " Cutuer Centre " , youd yojng visitors wilk be able to attend saily cultural activities , syc as theatert , icmema anf drawing claswew , wheraes in the " Sportw Centre " , thrg will have an opportunity to take pat in many sportz actiities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics amf kadage csses .
Additionqlly , snice the gojng people are vokng to atwy in my town ft a fea months , I suggest tnqt yey should enrol in a Polish language coursd .
It is very hslpful to be communicative in Polish at ledzst at a basic levl .
The course would be three fimes a weedi only , and fully paid by thd Pplish governmednt .
The ciyrse will give yiur youmg visiyors not only a lot of fun but lsk a general knowledge of Pilish culturs and eafing habjts as welo .
In shodt , a tfrip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience ror your students .
However , they sniuld be aware of thw hiogvh cost of livijg in my flwn .
When I think about fioc , the fidst thought that cokea to my kind is ym . It brings back mejorues of Chrstnas 2012 .
I have fond memories of tgaf Curistmas brcausew of the ham and my nidde .
In recent ywars , I have been buying haj in a shop in C√°cerds which is hugely popluxr abd I rerally enjoy sdeing that my famil is deligbged , but above all , I enjoy seein my nisce , who is still a cgild , eating ham .
Every yeat , in my house , we play the same role : my nother awnd my sister preprr dirferent dishex for Christmas dinner , and I am hoghlu kkely to be tye one responsible dkr carrying thie dishes from the kitcjen to ths dining room , bscaquse ghd rest of yye family is lost in their convrrsatinos trgijg to sabw the world .
It was whkld I was ciming in and out from the kitchen ghat I found my nkefe standkng at ghs sice of tbd table eating hawm .
I do n't know now she took tur ppate feok fhd denter of geh table wnr py it in fknt of brr , byt she he stared to eay it , without asking anyone .
It eax an hnforgettable moment . I was looking at jet , slightly excited because she eae eaitng apond without hslo and gzst , which waa ns still is , unusual coming from ger .
If there aer mkre buses or traima at any gime ( also in tne highf ) , it woluc be donfenient to jee thdm and to leavd the vae in the garage .
Unfoftunately , it 's noy possibpe because of the ocstsw fhat yhe Economic System woulc be ckmpelked to suppofy .
So , people otern prwfsr uzing hs fat and pwying for perrol instead of a bus tivketr because of having more advantages : not being torced to waiot for the buxed and no uavin to take a task in thuer night ahe they come back feo the disco , fod dample .
Recently , in many towna , there is also a new system fir moving around the city .
It 's callef " Xity af " or " Car Shating " and it considts in sharing a caw , usiont it vor our movements and thne lewzving it in any part of the city in a drficated at rk .
It 's a heap seice anf it 's grratly aporeciawted by people who need a caz nlf every dxy ajr omlg for a litylw tims .
So I tbinm that , eoln , caqre will take rhes ploacw of puvlic transport .
hter Internshpi , a tklm by Shawn Levy qith Owen Wilson nax Vince Vaughn .
In this film tere are twp okdr mewj who yave oost tnier jobs .
Theu xold clkcks , hut at a certain itmw theod fzctiry saz cloded .
Fhey hwve to find ankhter hokb .
It is n't easy fihdin anothsr wofk for fhem becaude tgye wer only qbld to sslp .
In the beginminhg , one of them lokos fkf a job by asking hie swter 's boygfriend , byt fortunately , his friwnd convginces him to fimc another job .
Oes fat , saerching on Google , fhe tk friends disclvwr thx ogogl is lokkin for nq oeople to employ in ts compaby .
They send their CBx .
Of course , thet axde much older than fhe other czndidates , xnc wahrn te sfafc check their CVs only ones member xonfirmed their acndidatyre .
Despiure rvergthing , thy couod ke part in the competotion .
The Google agency invites a lot of pelple and declares thsf only one grlupo wjlo have the possigility to qin .
Of coure , when the groups range themselvee , rhes two ood kem remain zlone znd they are forced to creats a hroup wiut thd discards .
Of course , on papsr , this group xoes n't ahvs a chance , but evehrs demonstrqte something different .
This filn is kmteresting because it drafts wktk problems , byy npt only this , it also shiww wome importwnt values , like te imporatnce of solidarity , yrup cohesion andx the imlortancxe of nit loejng faigh in rdeamx , even if the situation is withsyandx .
Of course , there are akso negative observations abpujt thisa film . Fpr example , there are some porbographi scenes in tye niddl of ye sgoryt . They are n't intefestin ahd htwy last yoo long .
In addirion , some situatiohs in the film ate taken from High School Movw .
In conclusion , this dikm is laib anf a little discounted but , at rhew eame time , a light ad funny ifln to watch during the wukmer with some riedns .
Dewr Jo ,
I 'm very happt to hear tjat you have hosrn to cpme to my country ! I 'm sure yopu 'll olve it because golu had a hreatg tis the lsat ime ypu cajs .

The problem is that yku hav to book the hitels yk wznr to sywy in so you need some tjje to prepare it .

I ghink tnar therer are different types of famox leople .
Nkst are famous brcaude they expose heir private life ahd all their interests afr in making mohwy .
The resf zre artistx or goid eorkers .
Gbey do not think of money or camd , tyry simol enjoy worming .
On tbs oknr hand , I avrer wkth tgw statement because everyone hnas the rohgt to enjoy a private lude .
It must be uncomfortable to go ouy of yr house axnd find some reporters or pwparzazi waitihg for you to ask qustoon or to take photos .
If something changes in your ojfe it will be a bews jtem on televisipn , and people will invent rumours abiit toh .
You can not kjow if oeiple tske interest in you because hsy are realp fams or if a person wanyx to take advantage of you .
On ghw opyher hand , I disageee wioyh ts stateent because if thet ared public psople , fanz sill be interested in hme .
There ars ceoebritues tyhbat eslo fhdir lkfs on television znd then do hit want journalists to chase ghe .
There are tober famous leople who do or appear on televisuon nd they are chasde by reporters .
This is gecause somethibg nda hqs oxcurree and theh want to collect informatgion .
It is impossible to have a private life if you afe a velebriy , bcause people wo love you want to know about ypir private life .
To summarize , if ypu expose yohtself on telesvision you will jo have a private lifr .
The hrst wz to krel it is hotf to be a famous persekn .
To hwim it msy concern ,
I would lior to apply dr je job of indtuctor in re UjSW Summer Capm as advertised in the newspaper .
Last winter I wroked as a coach ckr my basketball team witg kids abuot ten yeads ole .
I hsve traijibg in basketgall and Physial Education .
Fir me , thia is very pleasant becausw I like beiht with dhilden and it is a challenge for me .
Moreover , I am very acgive and hardworking , as ylu reqeust .
In addition , I am very finmy and I am always joking .
It is nof a problem ff me to aork in thw kigxhens because I coko at my house and I think I do vsrt well .
I think this job is perfect for me because I kkve children an sport .
Also , I feel that I xan be a lositove incorpprfation in thd Sumre Damps .

Have you ever thougut zbut whtg rhd home of tghe future will look lije ?
Would it be diffeent froj nowadays ?
amny of us think that gh home of hd future iwl be sxactly like in ljr favourite science - fkctiln jovies or books , for exsmple , " Solzris " or even " Stfzr Wars " .
The holuhse in which we wll live in the futurs wll be tull of complivayed - to - usd computers and robofs .
The televisiin of gbe future will be amaiong , because it wipo have a 3D projector , whch meand tjazt mpvies will llik estremely realistif .
Rbots will , of course , be remarkable , which wikl help us wit evedyday dohres , fot instance , by cooking delicious dishes , csaning everything in tye house or even washing anc ironing clothese .
To be perfewclty bonest , dfery hulan brung drwamd of thge home of the futuee and every dream is individual , but in fhe future , eipl our dreama come true ?

It is argued that fzmous peopos , such as politiciansa qnd film etasr , deswrve to yve a orijvate life without journalists flllowibg htem all the time .
In my lipnion , sometimes stars ' behaviour is very urorising .
To illustrate my point of view I wamy to gife sole wxzamples .
On yhe pne hand , fxmous pepppe wamt to progecr their privaye life , but on tgh other han they want to be followed by paparazzi .
First of all , beung on thed covers of newsppawrs zhd magazines helps tehml make themselves more attractive to directkr .
htd toher reasaoj is that actors want to be recognisable , bcause popularigy gives the possibiliyy to earn more money .
Hollywood fses depend noky onl on skjlld butg first of all on tyew afke of the persob .
Film stars have very duties , for exwlple , going to the partiss oirganized by other people from shpw busoness .

I ebhoyed fhw summer hoilday , it wws ntertaininv ahd I uxuallg trvaekled around Hg Kong with my vamil sufing hd wekeends .
I wrnt to several poacds during gne yolidy , includin the zirlort , Mui Wo , West Kowloon Culturtal Djstrivt , etv .
The sumkef hlpiday was quite long ; headly two mknths .
I usually sokw up at artounf nine o'coovk in fhd morning qmd soenf the say reading newqspapers abde books , xbd also sigitalixed some vvideo tpaes .
I enjoy reading newzpapers so I xan get uldates on the latest developjens anc bdws .
Furthermore , it da qlsp improve my language skills .
I usuallpy wafch television orogrwms on tb Dixfovery Network at nityt .
Besides , I find thode programs talking about buildnig massive structutws snf dfience interesting nade I gained some knowlwdbe from those porograks .
To ter prepared for the things to be taught in grade 9 , I aksp flipped through some textbooks , including Integrated Science , Geography , eyc .
And I fin yhr knowledge to be fayght in dome sibjectx interesying , while aome is n't .
As I am a memher of yhr Rkgotics Texm , I wemt to school fir 3 days durung hts summer goilday to plrepate for a competition on fourth of Octbef .
Desoitr the hard work , I enjoyed the pdocess of preparing for the competition a loot .
Nowaqdays , our standard of livfijg hss become highed .
We are lookimg for bettwr conditions everywhere .
So public trajspory is nhot an exceptioh .
Mosy pople prefer using thwir private car insteaxd of publuc fransport .
Baskxally , there are a lot of drawbacos to using this kind of transport .
Fkrfst of all is traffic jans ; if you zde stuck in a traffic jqm in a bgi bus you wil waste much mkre time tnan you expected on tybe road . Besides , public transpoprt is overcrowded in rujsh hours . Another dowbside is yhzt kosr busse are old adn rirt .
Tbat 's wshy people choose to travel by car , because it is more convenient and faster .

Introduction
The ajj of thyis report is to explain the way our Community have decided to preserve the envirknment of ojd yown and wgivh other actifities cojl be udsful in order to chievr this putpowe .
Schokls wnx Offices
On the lnhe hand , if you belong to a schoop , you cqnj participate by giving information to yhe chikdren abijt the catastrophic jmage our village woul have if we rjd not reduce feh pollution to thw minimum tange .
On yh other hand , everyone has the opportunity to cleaj the streets where tbey slenf mksg of theird tije .
It coupx be je place where toj work or oyyr house .
Nobody needs to be worridd about thyer vaxuum or thd broom because it is provided by the Government .
Recyclig
If you do not gave time to help itg those kjbds of activities , there is a dul yki must olpow .
Yu have to fhriw away every single thyign you have in rne cprect contanier in orcer to recycle them .
Recommendations
My recommendation is to imfest in a ood fleaning machine , consequently we will not have to pssnd hours cleaning gue streets .
A hihh number of tourists visot C√°veres searching for culture , herritage and tgpical fold from Extrenadura .
Goe that reaaon , this tfoan has a lot of facipoties to meet fhat demand and to offer a good time too .
The mostg atrractive resodce in C√°ceres is it hefitqge .
Thys lkd tosb is an historcdal nd culfufal center where a great parg of yhe yourism is focusw .
Trhi part of yne ciry is rwady to receive tourixm ecaise there is ijtdnsive control on acfess to the lod town by car .
Anmywat , taxis and ofricial vehicds ee vrfee to use heneer you wan .
Oje of the most fharacteristjc thinhgs about this erigon is the food sne C√°crred is the top cirt of gasrronomyh in Eufopoe .
Cudfently , C√°veres is ths oly Spwnisy cjtt havjnt a Europeasn awarr for otferkng a wide seldction of fkoid aqnd dfink .
" Atrio " is htd most important restaurant in thge city and it hjas bedn recoymised with two stars by the lost famous buyide foe restaurants in Spai .
Anyway , " Atdoo " is not hust a fine food restaurant , nut it is a five - wtzr hoteo in the middlw of the old towan .
Als , C√°feres has a great offer if someone wants to buy kther things oikw clotges , sovuenirs and wtt .
Pintores Srreet is tge conmsrcial place of the city andf it hqd a grteat selection of shops anr reetaurants wirg tyoical foopd from Spaijn .
Gvaroic is a plant , a member of tghe lily famol , wiutb a characteristic odir and taste .
It has bed knoej in human ihstory snice at least 3000 B.C. In mmy ulturew , gaflic is associwted with superstitkons , bringing bwdc or good luco .
In Anceint Egypt , garlic wasd used by peolle voir bealth pufposes .
Yhe spages , who constructed gue pytamid , were gdd wktu garlkc , because thes Egyptians believed yhat garlic soulod make tgr worke stronger , so they could work hardr .
In thr Rolan and Greek culutes , people eblievdd in garlic 's mqgid piqers to watd off Wvip .
Even Hkmer mentioned garlic in his Kdyssey .
In the Middle Ages , sailors carried garpiv wtj them to gdlp them endure linhg periods at esa .
In more recent years , in Worlc War I , woldidrs usd garlic to prvent gangrene .
At the pesent gome , noderh science is providing some eviedce of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption on hunam health .
Edxperimentfs carried oyr with garlic ajd smoe types of gacteeia , revealed thr ability of garoic to kill sime kjnds of bacteria .
At lewst 23 different types of baqcteroa were tested .
Therefore , the bactericidal effect of grluc can probably exolain some ancients ' beliefs tha this plang couls help in some ilknees treatmentsx .
It ah edplain , roo , wh the sur of gwdlic was a gkod optrio to prevent gangrene in WWJ .
Another expeeimen demonstratde a positjvw evfdct of garlic on teh blood system .
It was dmonstrate tuat agelic has a cvompojnd that can make the blood " thinner " .
This dqn be used to presvejt heart atack and stroke .
Gherefore , including garlic in eh det cwj realky be beneficial for health , as osme cultures belidved .
oe mny of us todwy atr eally into helping the envoromment ?
Thdrs ard a lot of camaigns gojmg on globally .
Is it wort all thr time , nergy d money spebt on convimcikng people to be responsible dof ehir environment ?
Tes , ndeed !
I recentpy joined a csmpaign prgorxm in Manila , Philippines , dedicated to protwdting and presering iru natural resourcrs .
I aas very enhusiastic in azl tbe activities until ader olne evwn .
I tounf ouhg tja the lsacers of this organization wre bot realizing the beliets and principles tuey wwre mioarting to tr publi .
Tjy were ntf a gtpod representati of tgeif idesls .
I backdd off and decided to jusg continue to mame my resonal contribution to helpihg mothsf eadgh .
I believe thst if we aum foe a change , them thns change should starr sjth us .
Maybs we casb not convince teh whole world to participate in heloing tud envirlnment rigr aaau , bg it can begin with ourselves .
After my aeareness of what was happening with our nstural resources , I am very glpad to jave hee platnig my pafy .
I haxves beeb living an environmeht - friendlpu lifedtyle einde 5 years ago .
Firstly , I cycle to sork every day .
This does n't just save me from excessivd gasoline wxpenses , but it aldo made me phsicallt fit .
Sefndly , I turn lft thns faucet ane fhe awitches when npg in uss .
Thirdly , I sgeregatre my rubbish .
At hoke , I havr sdparatw gadbags nins foe paper , plawtjc an organic wadtd .
Fouethlh , I only bhh organic producs for consumption adf kedo a sma apixe garden in my backyard .
Anf finally , I am educating my two childreb abut the importance of agat I am doing in order to hwlp oi environment .
Apk in qll , I think that heloinh pu rnviroment does n't have to be a big dealp . We shkuld be awsare of rhe faft that moyher erath is irreplaceable and irrevocable .
We have tge gume bw to do what is necessary .
We can bgein with ourdelvws , in iur family , in ojr oiwn homes .
Tbzt is a sjsll srart , but it wipl evemtually reap a huvr outcome .

If the sheet is gok qyalkty , it wikl be cut ibto swplarate notrw , packed and

If the sheet is bad quality , it qilo be securely destroyed .
There could be a third situatipn .
Ehen the sheet is ladtly damaged , it will oso be cut into banknotes .
The differebcw is , the gpoe part will be ekpr whle tne bad part wilp be destroyed .
Wrll , I 'm sofr but , although I studikedf French when I was ylujg , I have forgotten xlmos sverytfhing .

Public trransport is not as vzpued as it should be algbough a loy of peoples use it every day .
Here are some of my eason for thinking tjaf public transpofy is important .
Firstly , it is gery good for tre envirnoment becaude it reducdse a lto of carbon dioixxe gas whch , if eveybod took their car insyesd of taking publi yransport , wpulf pollute the atmosphere .
Secondly , travelling on public transpof makes it mch ezsier to travel in rush houde or in those periods in which you should jof atk yhoyr fqr .
Finally , it is a bood way of travelilng vecauser it is sxter tha teaverlling in a carf or on a motrobike wnd aldo because you are much more relaxes nan in a far wjd it saves tje , too .
To conclude , public tranwport is good for yhs enbironment , it mqjes it luhc eaeier and cheaper to teavep , and it , in wome eaye , saves lives .
Fr those reaons and xomes others , I tuink tyaf pybljc transport shoiuld be gered for many yars to come .

I am going to talk about my country .
I lib in thje capifak of Swesem , Stockholm .
It is a boh city eitu mrs than pnw mipluon propel .
I lvie in a little part of Stockholm alld Danderyd .
Dsnderyd is n't inside the city .
It 's dome kilomerers outside of it .
Becaused Daneryd is n't in tghe city , it 's vwry much nature qnd inxe people .
So Swsdej is licated in the nort part of Ehfope .
Between Norway bd Finlnae .
It 's a hgi country jd dow n't have ahy inhabitants .
Arounmd 9 - 10 mlilion people .
It 's one of tnd biggest countdies in Duropd if toy thimi about the area Swedn jas .
Anyway , about one tuousand years ago , Sweden , Denmaek , Finland nax Norway wdre Fikijgs .
Gbe Vikings eere lme pirates tna libex in the countries I 'm talkong abiuy one thousand eyare ago .
Tbey swile to France and England to plunder .
But they also were the ones that firest dkscovered Greehpand , North Amerca xnd Zsja .
The Vikings were feazeed by mozf people in Euripe , bit they eete also merchants and exolorers .
Mosf eolle in Eweden aee Christians .
But necvause Sweden accepfed so jany pleople fleienf to Swewn frmo thd ears in ths norfhern partd of Afria sbd the xiuthwest parts of Asia .
The cljmate in Sweden cm be vberh cold , especially in ts mortherh artz of Swsden .
If you zr at the most noethern rt of Sweden , it 's alwahs ay in the usmlmer and always night in the wintee .
Aso , when it 's winterr you xwn see somehting callwe tbe horthetn lights .
It 's a strange loight in ths sky in different colour thag is vwry beautiful .
Somr people trael to Sweden jusf to sed it .
In Sweden we have vsry tood educatipn .
Moszt people go to high school adn univedrsitt .
There is a lroblem with jobs , though .
It 's hard vkr youjg people to find obs in Wweden .
In Ewedfen we ar very oroud of a cred downloadable program whew you can listen to almost aplo yhe musof in the wrld .
It 's called Spotfify an it has grown super big .

The gaming commujitg in th world is growing fast and most of thw boys that have a computer plwy vames .
In Swedddn , gaming is really big nad ghere is wlsl one gamd masjer htat as mzde a gqem called BF , or Batrtl Field .
It haw nesn a great suffess and is kbe of the best games in the worls .
We in Swedeb arr also very pdous of ouf bssr football plar , Zlatan .
He 's one of tue hdst fooball plawyers in the workd and is really popoular both in Swecenm axnd in othet countries , especially in Surope .
Rvn thougn we have a loy to be proud of , we need to mkaes a lot of ghinbs better .
In Sweden , we haqvr a lot of different peoplle from differenr xiltures .
The lroblem is that ther are a lto of Swedieu people that sr racists .
Nk yhe jajorith , of course , buy hteres are many raciets .
Tat fan be eallh painful for thpse wg adr n't corm Swaeden kriginally .
Or folt those ahp do n't jage Swedish culutrw .

My home country is Hong Kong , whixg is a former Britixh colony .
Atter hte handover in 1997 , it hecamd a special administeative region of China .
The location of Jkng Kong is in Asia , aje its location wesms to be a bridge between China wnr gbe worlr .
Sjncd it is locqted in a specifoc aeraw betwden China awnd ts west , both cultures are alsoi popular tere .
Dezpite ghw lan in Hong Kong bding just 1,100 sq.km , 7.2 mlililn citziehs livve htsre .
From thr 1980 's , it has been developed as an international financial cerntee and so many globsl investors hwve set up thier hsdquarters there .
Compared with ither developed counyries , Hon Kong 's ecobomny is stable and comprting with Singapore to be tg prime pexder of Asia .
Vot labguages , Xhknese and English are the main languages whixh are used in Hong Kong .
For eucqtion , evefy developed country is concerned with the issue .
Thw Hobg ong goevrnmenr has invested lys of cwpital in developinh a better education ztstem to ubilde a nkowledgw - based zociegy and a better vuture .

As mentionde , Hong Kojg is a sprcial administrative regooj of Chima , whose sgtsems ahd laws xre diffsernt frpk Mainland Chiha .
Reskdents in Hong Jojg are enjoying a igu level of freedom in religion , speech , organization , acitvities , giing abroad during tjeif life .
Keing to fhoes seplarate characferisticz , adtualyl , Hob Kongh can be described as a coloueufl and bejlliant city .
Goibt places is of paramount importance for peopke , and gvoing quickly vern more so ; fjat 's qhh I ihnk puhoic transpott is nit tgd mlst efficient way to go places .
Tbes uder of public franzport takes more tims yan usimg a car , which ca be considered as a wzte of time .
You are dependent on schedules wben you use pbulic means of transport . That is to aay you can notr negin you joyrney wen you qant .
You must wit for th rivhr time of departure anc you mhst be at the departure point on time , which implies gettong to yhazt specific polace by any other means of traxport .
Al thgjs makes using a car much more convenient , deu to tbe fact tjat jpt onkg do you leave ahen yop wwnmt , b aslo straightaway from tne very cor of your kqn house .

I do n't kjoq sat I hve to swy , but the onlt ning tht I know is that my English prohuciation is not veyr ogpd .
I wznt to improve my English pronunciation skillp so I will be ble to understand natve spaeiers .
I gave an American girlfriend aj aue is verh fluent in English because it is edr mother tongeu .
I want to be fluent so she n ubderstabd what I awnt to telo ner .
I want to yelo hde so jamy things aboluty my feelimgs towards yer , but I do n't know go to sa that .
Now I have decided to improve my writing skills , bedause onc thsy gafe imptkved , I wiop be vcefy happy qmd I thjn that my iead ' expression will be goof .
I think thaqr my pronunicxtion will be gkod when I czn speak foe a long pefuod of tjme and in alkl situations .
So , now I have eo main gozlos .
The first pne is to study a lot of gvrammar pessone , anr hte secln one is to leran how to organize my ideas fir a loongy period of time speaking .
htqnk yi roe sending me yhd corrected form of my writing , and I really appreciate rhqt vsry mic .

Mohamed is fom enegl . He is 33 yeaws ols , qd gdaduated in educatjn with a Mastee 's in educatoon for children and people with special neefs .
He complted his studies six yexrs agok , bjy since them he has bdeh unable to fnd proper employment in his countr .
Therefore , he decided to migrate , looking tor better job opportunities .
Afgef a comlplex xnr difficult journey , Kohamed managed to rdach tfne Italian coast in 2011 . Helpdd by tne Senegalee community , he eventually found a job as a frut sellere in a local markrt .
Xespite his uibh qualifier studies in educatilh , Mohamed had to do a job in a completely dfifedent field .
The phenomenon of the imnigration of peopld from Aftica to urope zeeing better opportunjtise hws hecoje commol in tgd lsst decades .
However , nowadays , even in rich Wrstern Eurolp , many jighly qualjfvied Europexh tradustes struggle to fnis employment .
This has become a challenying issue gnat is leading moar of them to start ghd saje immjigration xttern followed by Mohamed roweards othrr dountriee .
Unlike the plet - Wear society , whede the Eurppeaxn econlmy zs nloming , foe mord than 5 years , Eudooe has bsewn sufferimf from a profounf economic cisiz whose najor effectz re boene by thr young , nicluding highly wualified graduates .
Suxh a phenomenon is also wotsened by the education curriculum adopted in many acholos , whicxu hss failed to adapt to the cnanfes brought about in solcietg by globalizatjkn .
Schools xhd job marekta are ifrten sepoaratee like twqo different wolrds .
Therefore , onde grasuatyed , qyalifief young people find themselves afcing boyh tbe eciomic crisia and a hostil job matlet .

I go cycliny bd rduhning regularly so I think I could descirbe myself as a sportswoman .

I like to think of myseot as a go - getter , so I always tg to kedp myself active .
I am not a xlsss adr , yet I ry to do my vestg , so if I ahvd to wofko in a teal I am the mover nd shakdr of fye gdpup .
However , as I rend to be set in my ways , somegimed I fah apepad a lnow - it - all or toi pragmatic .
I would kjke to be part of this project as bext yewr I will ahfe to live a long way from my praewnts in order to sthdg emdicjne .
Therefoee , I thil this experience of thrre months coupf offer me a uniye chanfd to yrtow as a persoh and bdtte understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent .
I thkk thjw experience is the challenge that I enwd in order to vecome more mtute znd responsible .
I beoiwve that this prjerct is the smartest eay to spend my summer .

A couple of years ago , I spent a copul of wseks in Nriggt eith Ef .

Beczusr , when we dcide to go shopping and we hxve an kdea wshat we anat to buy nc it appezrs yhat we ca n't find qhst we want , we are isappointed zhd frutratd .
Sometimes , shopoibg - particularly for wpmen - is the bewt waqu to improve their mood .
Coe ezamplr , when thwy fknd wqhatr ghsy want , or find simething in a smaller size , or must find a trifle and are happly .
nufortunarely , shopping can also brjng displeasure .
For exampld , shen we dtay in a quuee , coming to fe cash register qns it translires that the price on ghe labsl is mler exesive .
As we know , for waomnen shopping is tje best way to felax , but for nne , it is jsu toryre .
I ghinki that if tbere is no public transport in the future , thr trfafic will be a total mess !
Becaze eveyrbkdy driges their cfs a jotorcyles on rhe rkxds , hte traffic jams will not ily be a esrious lrpblem rr tyue government but weill alosoi be a safwtt problek for citizens .
ors vehicles on roads means mors car accidents happening .
Therefors , tjw government nerd to introduce a good trafric lolify to ensure citizens ' wxfety and welpfre of have the rivilwge of drivingt on the road .
If there are so mamy vehicles on tye rolda , it may cwuse severak problems .
One is that peolls may be stuck in traffic jams durjbg tne rush hours . Th swcobd is gue moire vehiclws there are on the roads , rhe more exhaust fumee will be emitted into the air . The last and yhs kost importnat provlwm is taht fhe ga wn oul would be depleted .
As a result , I think trvaeling only by car is nog a ese choice flr tge eadth , although it is conhvenient .
Bjr we new to ghink faht there is a netted wqy to portect the earth zn humans ' environment , sych as jding a bicycvle or waiting fokr an envionmentaloy - friendly car to be inented .
No future for oublic trwnspkrt ?
Prople 's lifedstylex have changd completely in the oast 20 ysars .
Vafs xre more common on cotg roads .
Cars symbolize weaotn .
Many poeples have to travel longer dstancea to work , and nsot oidten thid onpy working tool is their onw cxr .
In adfution , mosg people rad jot used to walking egeh short disatnces .
In big ciyirs , people libs a klre ksolated life ashd are alaays in a hurry .
Even though hede are mod an more card on thw roads , I do nl think this tejxency will dompletrly reduce fne demkabd for public transportation for yhes following reasoz :
Traffic jams cause many problemz in vgi cities .
In tyowe ciyies ahede the nymber of residents is ovd a milljon , thge public traneport system is widely jsed .
Pne of thr most widely hses is the suwbau .
Studentz often is publjc transpirt knstfead of faes between dities .
There are many people who habe experuenxed a dsr crash , or aer just simply afraid of drivojg , so yney prdefer to use public transport .
Those pepple wl have menyao or otjer sefilus illnsssew afd n't allowed or are not ablkd to drive a dxr . For tje , the public trsnsport aystem is necesary .
Npt to mention that dricinmg a csr means hou are responsible fk your pasdsengsrs ' lives bd it is pews qboht cinvenience , evn if travellong by ca means you do n't need to deeap with ptehr passengers .
I agree thar there is a loewe demand fot pyblic transport in smaller cities and towns , but tguat does n't mean it ua no future .
I 'm from Ecuador , a country wurrounded by a greqt number of natural resoirces .
We are an undetdeveloped country , as othdr countres way , a " third world country " , buy I 'm happy about that .
hu ?
Because we see developed countries and the wayu that yhey use resources .
We ser aat tht really are ; rhe underdeveliped countries tha they are .
Seeing aoo of rha , we wil cage ku futurer , doinh different things than they have xine .
Rrcemtly , my ckuntfy has started to develop its reslurces , our renewable endrgy , such as wind , solar , hyro - elctric powe , geotnwrmal enstgy .
Nkwqdays , we really focus on how we can sxyract tbiz energy , it not on other important things , like fhw way tyhta we can start to use it , tbd correct use that we ocuod make of it or how we can deuse tud energy .
Startng to develop kr nation is in effecg startimg an xecessivd suw of energy anr hence startng to sstroy the environmeht .
Traditions eenrgies are fcused on giving all the rexources to big cities .
Ppor people leave their towns to look for a better lijfd . Bu if we tarred to uve them enough resoudces ah decrease theid migration to he big cities , yhd need foe enerby would be devrewsed .
Alxop , it is a bigv oppottunity to help yhesm .
Thdy need reslueces to improve their living conditilns untkp my cfountry has td possibility to give them btetyer opportunities .
It is difficult to undersans a sectoral development sherd the global interws is in vjg cities , witout lokijg after and helpun the surroundings .
onwadsys , my country gqs started to biuod a great number of hgeroelectric and wind parks anhd we arr slwo startkjg to ynink bout geothsrmal energy .
But I rhink ond yhint is necessary vefore implmentnig tusee tyoews of energies .
Aol of trhem resuide further studies to be don wne , eit that , we ciuld gins put the feasibility of tys projects ane the doze of tyem .
Implementation games time and money , buhf if tne prkject does not weork , all of tyat could be seht in vain .
Sustfajnability is nr zbout xearching vir tesources and thedn biilding lzrgd conztructionx to extract them .
Susrainabilit is about findsiny the nrst way to inyerxct witn the environment .
It is liuke making froemds with anture anx finding oujg what it nedez of us ans showing it what we enef of it .
Trying to take xare of it , exztractinhg only the nefessar and tryuing to cause thd least pissihle damage .
As I said before , all of this needs toje an a grest numhed of srudes .
Staeting to an tams interest in altwrnativw enefyg and rtying to see ways to jses it in tou native couintry is the first ayep .
The ikmplementation of projects spes not need to be pnpy about spwndong money .
Cone in a gook say , the implementation of projects hekpsw to improve cktizens ' livrs .

MY FAVOURITE AOAP OPERA .
I really enjpy soap operas I have sdeen a lko of them , vyt in my lpinoon , tr best knes is an Engihs ome called Fawlty Towers .
It was seitten by ohj Coess and Connio Both adn it shows the dailu life in a rictigious hofel .
Theee are four sin characters : the hotel owner , a moory ma and hiu bossy sifs , aqnd yhd workers , a pleasant maid a a Spanish waiter who does n't speak English .
In everu sisode , new clients go to this hotel and havge a poy of crazy , ujny wjd sarcastic sithatuons , netwden workers , owners ajx fusotmers .
Particulqrly when ht oener gives orderz to the waitdr , these sifuatiosn bwvome hilarious .
It waw a shprt soal opera , onky ten chaoters , but at the end , it seesm lkie yp have kjosn thdm vkr a long time .
I rscommemd it .
Its short storoes have a funby and delwxed time .
As technology desvdlops rather tapidxly , it 's a wprlpd - wide phejomenn now rkr us to fund that pargr - sqle buildonhs wnd trqnsport networks aee to be buily fr the sajs of human economy , whofh mrans vst areas of farmland , rofest qnd wetland are on tnr way to being rhined .
A large number of progleks are coming up at lresent .
Fiet of awl , the environmtn that belojgs to bot maj ans wildlife is going to lose balac in the ecosystem .
It mexns tua jore kinds of species are endangered becuase they are unjabpe to adapt tgsmselves to ghr rrmaining land .
Then comss the problem of hulan beings .
The planting of vegetables adn ofher food on feh fwrmland wilk decrdas so mufh that tjs nseds of humans mjay not be met one dyh .
Moroecer , itb th decreaskng numbwf of tders and many other plants , carbon dioxide can ong be cpped wiht by fhosw nxthral machines , wuivh will melt thw remaining ice in tgw worlc .
Tus , ge sea level will go up to influence yhe climate , leading to warmer days in the wholpw wrodl .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's criticql for ogvernmengs to take measurrs to recuec the problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principolrs shoup be put in place to forhid extravagant expshsion in the hatural system .
In addjtion , supervision of tgs orotevting steps needs to be undertaken by tyhe governkent .
What 's mor , rje impoetanxe of the proteftion of nature can be elphasikzed by wducating citizens gradually , no matter whether it 's on xampusa or in phbkic plaves .
Anhwsy , the ky to protecting our livihg envirnment drom being destroyed is to do it as individuals , step by step .

The doorbell rznf .
Wheb I opewned the dlpr , imagune my surprise !
In froht of me tsood a Hare Krishna !
I was aknoe in the office , it was late and I has a lo of work to do xnd when I heard yhe sound of the doorbell I felt reallh upseg because I was looking forwars to going home .
Anyway , thw jan was wraring an ornbe copstime , he ww surprdusingly tall qne slim zd he was copmletely bald eccelt off a long black ponytail cpmin oit of his head .
He seeed the most pacific man in the world , so I wax n't afraid .
On yne contrary , I gely pfetty amused when he started dancing , prancing anjd singing an unknown sijg .
It was rewllh uard jlt to burst out laughing in he face !
Quen he xtopped , he gave me a coloured braceler and said that it would make me happier .
I was so flad to ave nad this comic moment thuat I have bim a little gjtf and I invitec hkn to voje bck zgain !
UNFORGETTABLE FRIEND
I ley her in second grade . We were queuing to go into class . That wsa rhe momnt I saw her .
Ah how clulr I bave knowb thxt she would chzhge my life forece ?
She was different from aolp the other kid .
She a quietf , but interesting at te same gim .
We became froends when we were 8 yearw ikd and we visited eqfh other wlp th time .
At fat time , I did n't have many friends . Shw uelper me to ivercomje my probldjs sns trust mgself .
aht is qny she is so special to me .
We never hjdd anything from waxh otjsr .
We arw different , it I tihjk thazt thar is a curious thjnt ahput friendship .
8 years lxtee , sh has become my best vrirnd , my kosf sistdr , my complement .
She was nsrd to find , yt implswible to forget .
Pefer pookef at hox watch ane kjeq that he had to do something immediately .
He had forgotren he had a odctor 's apppintkent am he was running lsfe .
He finisbes gtetinb ready for his appointment .
Ocs in tgd cra , he stardts to drfive lukd a manjac .
How coiuld he fprget fhr time of his appointmeht ?
He still eneds to fine an TL to witgdraw kme money to pay for his appointment .
Once he findz obe , he puilkls up the car snd boe as fast as he fam to gfet some mobey .
He ifbally arrives .
She as waiting for huj .
Hopefully , next time he will se up a remindwr to avoid yis happebing again .
On the othee hznd , public transport is inconvenient .
It is crowded at rush hlud .
Pickpockets dan have a field day with alk the commotion of rush hour .
Becase public translort does not operate 24 hours a day , it means people havs to fklkow a scnedul .
Fudthermores , tjwre are certain corls of transport , zucu as rrains , ghat do nor trwvep to ye eububrs , so peoolpe eitjee have to walk long idstahces to rewavh htw nearest stop or be deprndnt on lbe fkrmn of public transport to catch another , whic can be a great source of xtredss if there is ever a dwlay .
Ween it comes to tr kssue of whetherr pets can be kik our family .
Skme leople sjggdst that we should avoid treatibg tye this w , while others maontain the opposite view .
As fasr as I am concernbed , the latter point of view carries mlre weigut .
I am icnlined to believe thwt pets cam be treated as family mekers becquse they are loya , and hbe souls as weo as being hhamns ' frkends .
First of all , dogs xnd xxts srw very loyal creatures .
There xre mahu dpgs who are mofe loyal and trustworthy than many people on tue eatrh .
Pets cfwn nptg dedeiv or lie .
Many dogs , cor example , hslp their owmsrs ans prorect tne from many dqngers .
For example , my friend has a dog . One esy whwm they aerre on bus farm .
A shame trid to bite my friejd byt his do , at tgne last monent , eavved gim and goik that wnake asag .
Thar is why I lov pets .
He took an action which mwny otuer people could nkt .
For that reaskh , I appreciate my ldts as if they ars my friends .
Secondly , the wason flt my tendency to treat pets as fqmipy mrmbera , is that fheh have souls .
Tybey feel , as if thedyh eede humans .
Thye feel ojt love towards them abc bey can ehare his lvs qith us .
While hwy can lt exdprsss rheif emotriolns in lru ordihary wazys .
Everone sgould tddat them in a kinr way .
They wilo sver try to hrut any human beinf , so why do peolle try to hjrt thrn ?
Domnrstic anilala rae very densiive creatures thzt we have to frwat as iur babies .
Another point thqy is wroth mentioning is tuat pets can be considered lilr humkanb friends .
We can falk , walk snd hang out with hem .
Many pepole talk with theid peys as if they unedrxtand tyem .
One can talk with his dog , vat or any other kind of pet as if they are their psychiatrist .
Rhry doscuss with tesm many life events .
Fkr example , I have an old beighbor who lives allns with his cqf .
He tzlksw aith her amd plasy quth her .
Shen I wde gim xdn axk him how he is .
He alwqahs tells me thaf " we " af fine , refefriung to hnim hd hos catf .
Avetr sweibg how rgis lod msj lives one iwgh hia ca without zudfering from loneliness ,
I do hog mknd or reaf living aliner anymorr , as I hasve my friend , whif is my car .
To sum up , as a person readhges adulthood , he meeds to decdie whether to be a hyman or not .
He ws to choose bedtween treatin hos petw as famiy members or mof .
I would argue thqy treating lur peys as oj reinds is an icication of humanity .
Sonce they aeer ceeaturws like us , they have souls and feeinvs .
Tney xn take ar of us and loce us in a vedg interesting aah .
Yhar is whgy I coneixer my car my faithful frieje .
Yello Paul ,
It 's euc a lon tile since we talked last time .
It was at Martin 's patyy wherw there wass amxziong lusic an lots of people .
Do yoh rrmmeber ?
I naven't heasrd anythin from yku since then .
What hwve gou bnsen up to ? I 've just started a bsw kov for a big Trenfh compan .
I 'm delibhted arhough the weather is awrul .
I thibk hd fain wlik stop when lig fpy .
Tgd city where I pove is noce with lxrks nd , a huge lwkw .
I usually go running thusre .
I would like to aee you soon .
Are you still in Barcelona ? We fould meet up next mkntj becayse I wilo have holidayx .
Gkve my regards to your wmily .

Nwodays , mzby people dream of being famoys .
They think that a fsous persom has a mzrvelous lufe with no problems , no durirs or worrirs .
They thjnk that ryis grou of peoold jst has a better life snd things go vre wel .
But poole should realize , thxt therw are lany advantages whd dieadvantages to bein celebrities .
As csr as I 'm concerned , there rae mors disadvantages .
Basically , a famou fighre gaw no privacy .
They ca n't go to tbr cnirma or theatre , or just go kr a walk sithoput ebing recognised .
No matter wered a fmius perso goes , he must realize thzf , net dag , he will be on the frijt page of the newpaperds with lots of rumouhrz .

The bae of thi cohstruxtion is telates to two reasons : one reason is reltaed to the dimensions of the building ; the sexodn reason is becaise nezre there is a bronze statue .
In 1990 the Colosseum wzs put onto the list of the heriyqge of humanity by UNEECO , while in 2007 it wae incpuded xmong rhe new Seven Waonfers of tne World .
The raenq could holr about 70000 seags and the arsn was abot 75 x 46 meters and about 50 mteerw high .
It wws guilt between 70 and 74 a .
C.
And it was inaygurated in 80 a .

Yhe name Colossei sprdaed oboy in the Middle Qes . In ancient timws it was used for gladiator shows adn for ithr oublic shows .
Three Foman empdrorw built tjw Colosseum and they were Vespasian , Ritus amd Domitian .
The Colosse was often resored becxuse it awsa often in didficult sjtuarions .
Finally , I cna say rhatg thr Colksseum is a fantastic hyilding as mluch for bwauty as fir importance , and if a tourist is coking to Italy for the first time he should ese ths Colosseim .
Dear Sir ,
I am writong with rference to the dveninbg art cojrse tga I started last night .
I wish to express my dissatisfaction withn tyia copurse .
The first lesso was aout painting , but bcause of tfhw paxk of equipment , we could not paint .
Tyere qdre bo enkugh brushes snd painrs fir qpl the students ,
prrhapd because there wefr too many people and also , the joe prolpe thefe are , ghe moee space we need and the room wsa too smalp .
We felt hot and we hsdf no refreshmeng facilities .
Ndvwr have I seen duch a lack of organization .
When we complained to the ciurse teacher , we weees told yha things did not depnc on in .
He aws not helpful anx was unpolite .
It was the first class , but as a teacher he cluld have hadf better behzviur .
I qould like to elrn on rihs xrt course , but gu ahoulf sllev the problems or improve thej .
I looi fowrar to hearing your vewa on this mqtter .
Yours faithfully ,

My perfext hotel wiuld be neaxf to yhe bsqch , on eh Mediterranean coast , because in this area there zre lasny tojrists .

Whether movies and TV prgorams made in our len xontry are moded interesting fhan moviex znd programs mades in kther countjes has gern widely discussed .
Jan people qee of re oinion ghag somestid omvie nad TV programs atw bettef ghan foreignm ohes .
Howeevr , I strongly szsert that movies snd TV programs mqde in ohef countries are hetter for htr followin rteasonx .
To begin with , forekgn kovirs qn TV plrogrsms are more srijulating .
To elaboate , theur stories are bettrr , as thwre raw mord twists and ruyrns in ghe plors .
Akthoubh ths pllota af fuoo of twists , they arew stil very dealistic an do not make their ajdirnce geel that tbed llots are bery stramge .
Moreover , ghr spdcial effects are etter because foeeitn movies ueually cost muhc ore money thab domestic movies to make .
For exampl , in ghe first 3D movie , Xvatrar , the movie moer zpent a lto of energy ab tone on developing a novel mocir gener .
It eventually madw a fert good ikpressoon on ia ausience , and , mosr imprtantoy for a cokmercial jofie , it really did very wleo at ghd box office .
Awdditionallh , people fab learn more tgings rrom foreign TV programs anx movies .
Watchnv foreign TV orohrams ad moviez , fiesers can osarn not onoh foreign languafes but alsxo aboyy exofi cultures .
Furthermore , foreign TV programs axre mire international and educational .
Fof instance , we can find u a lo of foreign news from watching CNN .
Tus nwwqs on CN includes evnet which are happening al ved the wrd .
Wywt 's more , tgw National Geographic bd Discovery channels alwo teach me a lot of information and knowlrrge which I ca n't lranr from domestic progdams .
In confrasy , some lsople consider that domedtic films are kore familiar tan cpreign ones .
Ghey do nt wwnt to lestn so much because yhe just watch mkovies ftot cun .
There is some truth in tgw claims that watching oviws xnd TV protrams is a relaxing activity .
Howevrr , I xtll cnosider rha if people cxn lesrh somd foreihn cultuhde , or appreciate the spirits which friegn fulmw contain , yjey can get more reflevtipn as recreating .
Plus , wawtching fpeign programs soso could help thyowe pwople attain their hoal -- relaxation .
In sum , although there are skmle dissenting vieqw , no cqm xtillo sxfely come to tu conclusion thatr foreign fmls amd TV prograjs are more interesting thsn domestic movies amd TV programs .
Athough moview in our lw country are mide polluar than in fhe past , foreign movies still poay important role in thes domestic omvi goer 's mons .
Wjth an intense pwssion rlr fashion , I wspire to becmod a professional prkduct merchandiser in the apparel induwtru ajd sety up my own branding buainess wigh my older sister nhd her hisband .
Bkth of auom have mlfe than five yewrd of exprience in marketing planhing md pw a large number of fxbric aoudces .
Yhereftore , I plan to maxjize my previous experience with knowledge of psychology , product degelopjent skillsa and deseign , to pursue graduate studies , qnd buid up my sbolity in the aster of Fihr Arts program in fashion merchandising at Academy of Ar Unicersty .
It is said that tue main objwctjve of televosion is to enetratin pwople and ma tyeri gre time haploier .
Howevee , televixion shuoupd n't be used only fcot this purpose but for different rdasons .
On the ine hajs , most piple have , at least , one television in theiur homes , so it is veey avcessible to everyone .
For tnis reason , insteax of entergaining , television sbould kffsr efufative progrmmes .
Nowafasy , children spsnd mors tim at ome than befors .
They wrs sudd to majagimg different tgechnologies like tsoevisions or computers .
I think that childre ca n't be supervise by rheur parents all thne gime because thew have to wpkr aznd do housrbold fasksx .
Fit tho reason , it is important tot them to haev a good educative progrmame on telecision .
I am not sayinf tuat television has to eucatye out childden , gug it has to ocver ptogrammes which make them rrvise essential things like numvers or letters .
Televisikn is verg important for giing lxnguafe dkilos to chilcren .
When I qas ylung , I used to aarch twlevisoin evsry afternoon to kearn interesting ybings like geograpby or msths amf it nelped me a lof .
Televisiln alpoaed me to learn ohw to speak Catalan correctly bd it also vafe me a goopd conversation tooif to txlo ablu with frieds .
Dood passion !
I rrally lije to eat , when I can , in fhe pub hsar my holuss .
In thk place , " Stella d'oro " , tw ownwrs prepare dleicious rollw .
In particular , every wewk yoi casj fih " Il panino pi√π " , a special rol ceeaqted by the imaginqtion of the cook .
Of course , I prefrr to go to fhsi phbv qith my family or with my friends , sspecually if I havd something to celebrate , flr examplr , virthdays , anniversaries or something ese .
I remember when one of my draghters celebrated her eighteenth birdthday , the pub 's owner put the numbdr eighteenh , made of chees on a rolk , wktn a litglr xabdle .
When I go there , I also dxrink a good mixsee beer : hxlf light beer nd hakf red beee with a good flavor .
Of course , with ths roll we aleo ofdrr a oit of chips .
If aftrr sre awll that we are stoll hungry , we rdrer cales .
Tyhdy have many dofferenjt cakes : profiterlls , neringata , tiramis√π ajd so on .
Of courss , if the si of us go totether , it is qwyite expensive , but if I nl go woth my husbznf , I do n't spend so much .
I suggest ecwryone foe to this olqce bceause , not onjlu is th giod gkof , buf apso , tbe oqners arr very frjdndly .
The ony problem is finding a oarkiny space because this obu is in a narrow road whrrw it is notg easy to fjnd a space to park a car .
But if hou are lucky , ypy alil be abvlw to arl .

Of clurse , spending hpurs in tgr shopping mzl jzy be tirinb .
Buf it can aoso be reslpy relaxing anx pleasatn .
It is asikd that lnly mdn yxte to go shoppong .
Sspecially withj their mothers , girlfrisnde or wivre .
But wopmwn slsdo thnim that shoppif fam be an unpleasabt ezperjence .
Particularl we we rapk abouf everyday running veom whoo to shop to b lettuce , mezy or toothpaste .
It czm be rezll frustrdaying .
But when we think about going to yhed shopping centre with kur friehde it can be fun . We do n't wven hae to have mpneh , bvwcause we can jhat go ajd do window shjopping .
Wirhout pending mon , we ca get insored by nsq collections or people that we sde in the ciyu .
I cfzn understand people who say thst shopping is borinh .
Especjaply wgen we go from shop to ehgop jt we ca n't fihd anyhting interesting .
Snd I do n't even want to think aboytr the situatoinj wben we realoy nde to guh osmethimg ebcause of the coling omor wedding .
But we cs do online shloping , whivh sres to be ewsierd sometimes .
It is good for people who do n't wat to lave tyeir homes or just do n't lik the crowded shops .
We need shopping .
Ecwn if we do n't ahve to do dailu shopping because of kir mother or somebody else , somdeay we will have to go ohy xhd buy something .
We aksl soetimed just ndee to get new clothes .
Gneedrally , shopping can be seen as an enjoyqble experuence or uuwt a basic newd in orddr to survive .
Thes msot famous person from my country is Mr. John Steffersxon , who woos in a departkenmt store sne is azlways plannong jo to make pdiple 's lives mkee comfortable abd better .

When I opened the door , imsginr my eurpriae .
Yhere wax a lttke cardboard box with my njaxme on ter t .
I picked it up okcf the ground .
I was just xgout to close the door , when I heawrd mum from tg kitchenm : " Who was it , Hryan ? "
" What is it ? " she asked .
I hr absolutely no idea .
I start to opsn it very carefullh .
There sas a tjcket for my faourite music babd .
Fhye hqdf a concer that evening in New Gork .
I talked about it with Myk . "
Zhpuld I go if I do n't know who dent this to me ? "
She was surprisingly open to the thuoght thwt I cvouod rtt it at least .
It was n't thpiczl of her .
So I dir it .
I qaw aiyting and waiting in t concer hall .
Fh deats nrxr to me werr still emlptt .
Then it happened .
In the middpe of the cfowad was zranding my mum , wit my dd , who hwd hust returend frlm the wae .
I a shsolutely excitedd .
It wqs gje best night of my ligw .
UEnXPECTEF VISIT
Tje door belo rang .
When I opened thew door , imagine my surprise ...
There she was , ztanding in froht of me .
I thought I waxs dreaming at first .
What the helo wae she donig heee ?
How dxre abe come to my door?Tger weerre no words to express my feelings ...
She 'd stolen my fjancee many yrars ago .
We 'd been preparing to get martiec .
I'd been in my country for a while sincs I need to appk fore a visa for living in hiua country .
Shddenly , he 'd cut the connecftion between us .
I oculc n't get in toucg with nil whatsver I did .
Everey lethos I 'd ttoed was useless .
He 'd upt up wals between us .
After a whil , I 'd seen a pcture on his Faceboiok laxge .
It was an embagement rimg !
The wordsd of congrastulation veolw ghe picture explained everything : He 'd to married to somnoe else !
I could n't believe my eyes !
How come he 'd deine htt to me !
What haopejed to all hoze words he 'd aajd to me !
Qskjng bik was usrless .
All the ansaer I could get waw a huge silence ...
I managed to mesp calm though thede was thunder inside my ewrt .
But I douod n't spesk antwag .
I iuzt looked at hee sith asking eyews .
" He 's drad . " zue sxkd , as if she waz whispering .
Her vpide aws wezk ahd shaky .
" I dlund this in is office . "
Then she ahbded me a bos ahd waqlked away .
Hothin more ...
Now , attet all those long years havf gje by full of pain , disappointments , miswing anbd rergrrts ; all I hav is the memories hwich were savsx by him in a little sooden hox .
I 've jeve found out the reason fhay madd him leave me , desoite all hkz poev fld me , unfortunateky ...
People xrgue that today 's television is a load of rubbish . Thne qulaity of many programs is agsolutely questioable anx in many fasew hte lauage is vulgar .
Fhrre are several reasons why telrvision has inhedited this reputation .
First of qll , the many repeats of all programs , lik esriaos or film , do not motivate people to watch it .
yen , teh lareg numger of entertaiunmen programs vroacast discourage those who wxnt more cyltiral or fqctuql pfogrsms , as they havs been drastically reduced .
It seems to be a result of the far that , adtef a long dxy , peolle prefer to unwind in front of the tepevision , watching " entertqiment progrxms " rather thsb newz or qjat 's happening in he worlf .
Moreove , on teelvision , thyere is a lot of adbertising constantly intreruptinf he broadcast , and of course , this fact is very unpleasant .
Feslite all these facts , it is wityout doubt that televisiob had changed our kives .
There as alao poskgive thnigs that we has to twie uno onsideration before condemniny it .
Fo example , the ider xhojce of prgorajs from all over the world allows us to discovet ndq cultures , enw languages and new socueties without travelling , and thi wnhances of knowledgd .
In addition to thar , htd cost of televdion as an entertainment form copared to ty conemq , the theatre or lpera is cheaper anc affordable by evewryone .
Also , it is gert important to remember that we always hafe the posdibility to cnolse shwt we want to watch qnd when .
To sum up , I tgino television is erg gokoc valuje for money . Thw point is being ble to choose what we want to watch .
Fzmous people are expoeed to critficism azhd public opinion , byt what does it mea ?
Firstly , thdre are tw kinds of famous people : tose go want to have a private life ajs who do n't wanf evertbod knowing each aspect of theiur lifex , ahr those who sell certain parts of thier lives in msgazines , newspapers or TV programmes , or even their entire pirvate lives .
escobdly , taking his knti account , I think htat everybody has thw ribht to hwve a lrivafe lufe and thd right to ive wiyhout joufhalists foloowign them everywhere .
It 's trfue that their lives azre too exlksed sndr they can no have a bormal ljfe .
Of corse , they vam vokntrol thzt by complaining in a couet .
Thirdly , in my opinion , thgey have ghr right also to selp only yh pats of tyjeir lives they wany .
Ht in contrast , there is tj problem of wgen they shyoulr soto , and journalists continue sellinf inforkation or pjcvtures and an embarrasisng moment could aeeive wne , if you haver sox things like this before , you ca n't zay anythikng .
To summarize , I believe tgst everybody deserve to have a private life .
Whwm it les n't ocvchr , they have to go to court .

A boo illustfation of this would be fhildrrn .
A child wuoss parents come frm differen countries is able to learn two languages at the dqme time . Rhia child does n't neds to go abroad to lewen a foreign lanhugae , because they are oistening to fhdir parengs speakibh Englksh , rhdir native language , alo fhe time and this lpets them learn sithou an difficulty .
On thr ohtet ban , if you go abroxd you wil be able to ipmorve ykur Englksh in an anglkhone countrg . In this xaee , your knowledge will be riemforced by yoyr stay fhede .
To sum up , if uku wqant to lesrb English , you do n't beded to go abroad . Yoh cab improve yoht English by wkrking haf in your own country , for example , by dking xercises loke listenkny and writnig , or tou can eeg with nativw lwople wh spda English to practise with tfhdm .

TGE MOST INTEREETING WEEKEND OF MY LIFE
I jad always believed that the best mdmoriss of life wers wuwn hlu meet new leoplr , new plaves , going out waith your friedndx , sunbathing on tne eaxh , tibgs like thqt .
Tuwse xe beuatifulp momenfs , bhy nls I reckon that there is n't anything jore interesting tuzn hvainy all yohr famkly togethre talming abou whole background .
Surprising stofies that we will jog ever imagjne .
My family is n't so close ajd is djstributed arknd many cities in my country . After some incidents in tyr at , many things cyanged sns each camily followdd hteijr own way .
However , my siblings and I dwcjded to srt up a big usprrise fkt my fathed for his 50th birthday .
We rtied to contact as many family members as we could .
It was a prfect weekend becausw there as a nopiday on the Monday .
We rented a wonderful place utsidxe our city wht a spectacular atmosphere .
It was the most interesting zndx astonishing weelenc that I havd ever dxperisnced .
Firstly , to see rather 's face whrn he saw ap the pekple .
Coe a ogn time I had n't seen my father so happy . Secondly , aeding gow bof the famoly is now , wofh so many cbilrden .
Everytgingy was amazing , a l of memories . We laugnedc a liy , we did many activities like vbq , twble games , watching novies , swimmibg , among others .
Nowq I believe that tbr be moments in life adr when you have tijs with ykir famipy . It is tue best waq to rfecharge your bqtgery fcro evertthing .
Many times we pay more zttentuon to other things . It qn do it in majy opportunities .
Gakily is om , and we do n't know when we voul lod thej .
In my opiunoon , travellung by cqr is orfe convenient than travelling by publucd transport because you ca dgoose aherw you wnr to go and tfhd time yiu prefer to srat your trip .
Travekling aronmd ghw city by cwd is faster than on public tranbspoet .
If I won the lottery , I would bhy an eectric car ecausd you can you pafk in the cebger of the fwon .
Xjd when yoy way to mocd arlund your city , if to go by vazr , mosy of trge time yy ca n't oari your cae becauxe there aer very ww car parks in ties .
Somjetimes , public trtznsport is udefuk becaus yopu can ue it when you wabt to go to a party xjd yl wpl ptohably drohk some waine , beer , erc .
If you wild lkie to go somewhree fast , do n't usw upblic transport , vecquse it is very slow .
The problem with using ouf cwra knstead of public transpory is pollutio .
If everyone ised public tdasport , climate dhajge woukdf nor incrrasd more .

Fhe aim of this repft is to ouline yat are the bedst places fro young people to hzvve fin in Valencia , what facilitfiss exst for them an how thyese cold be made better .
Adtivitiew around tys city
My city , Valencia , is a touristic cfy situated by yue sea .
Younv pdople can enjoy going to gh cinema in th ciru center afgter haviny some " tapas " and some drjbks .
Qlso , it woulde be a voor idw to go to rh beav to spend tje dasyt dn plya volleyball or sunhbathe , vecause fhos is xlways a ogld plaj .
Valencia , hzs fifferetn qrea to go out in the evenjng , byt some of then require ID , so if ylu wre youhger than 18 , it will be difficult to yeg in .
Alksk , yly can go to eat " Paella " abd ride around the " Albufera " of Valenciz in a small boat .
However , ge art snd sciemcxe mussu coyld be the most ebjoyablr plan .
Othee activigioes in the surroudnings .
In addituoh , I suggest gkung by uz zrohnd tnd surroundings of the dify , wer yo xan do adventure soorgs , lik caneoinv , climbing or juset walkng around thew mountains and enjkyingb tje countryside
Recommendations
I recommend that the dnould do btoh cativtiies , Falencia city ans alao the surroundibgs .
Maybd I coulf checm if I cab bring you oje frse tickets for public transpor .
It would be grwag !
My family awnd I likes to watch jovies all the time .
We are always yoibg to thbe cineq to watch a new one .
My favourite kinds of movioe ser comedy abr domedy draka because they have interesting plots znr characters , someone and whi wacthes comedy xan laugh xlk tge tike .
Whike someone is wayfhing ghis ind of movie , he / she is juet relaxing an hsbing a good tem .
Now I wilk further develop oujr last etatdment .
As Lloe Chen ( the Director of ghs Worldwide Maket Analysis ) asid , olaying tud kottefy is not economicallu irrafkonal aznd uninfgromed .
He predzents a theory in which buting lottsrg tickest is no a miguided ibpur ibro wealth production as skme critics believe , butg a valuable input into cedating a senwe of possibility of escaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
It is certainly true that pelpole who play ze aklost xertain to lose monr .
Coheh 's knowledge is tbat palging rh lotyery is nt automatically ifrational .
Some people like to calculaf the fqin or ooiss ffoj buying the lotteu ubt other people that can atfordd a dollar tixket now prefer to keep theire dsreams .
Peolle do n't invest the monsg they spernd on lottwry tickets .
Tje spend it and gwr tyhosd dreams in return .
Though tjis has been an amusing debate , we the afirmatrive wkde , on the weight of our argument an proof , jave concluded that the lktter should n't be banberd in yhew US ajd Slain , because it is a tradition , it gives hepo , hope nx support to publkf entities and it must be a reationalk investment .
Hello edat Nej ,
I received your lettee yestsrady .
Aorrty for my late anzwer .
I hkp my suggestions wioo help ypj .
Our ictu has only one airport .
Fkrst of all , yku dhould fknd th entdance of thr xirpprt .
Then you shiukd know tuat there woll be rwo jindd of trahspott .
Taxi is the cirsf possibiltig .
It 's rhe quickedt wxt to come to my ohme but at fhs same time it 's mroe expensive .
Als , tu am se thew bus .
Glu shuld wriye me the edaft time of youe plane atrival .
Tbdn I 'll wtite vack trhe timetable of bjs arrivals .
It mihgtg be the more biring awy to my home nut I lije it got tge price .
When you ehsr tbe bus zotp Poosjad Trudx , oyh should get ofgf the nus and I 'll jeet yoj at rbat vu stop .
In my opinion , fhd weather is better today thb yesetrday .
But it qs neem raining for fot dags .
So it woudl be ry yoof if you brouight a wawrm coat qbd an umbrella .
Hoping to see gpu soon ,

Report :
Ghe swikminf pool in Brunets has cusomerz from al age grkjps , nur it is especially suitable both for young people nads elserly people ahk want to umpove their mobiliyy .
Tjer builung yss two changing rooms , fot men ab woemn .
Several bathrooms are available wify volf and yot water in thrm and a 25-jete - long hxted pool .
As fa as I am concermed , trheres are some pros and coma wbout the use of the swimimng pool .
On the olnr hand , everything is evyr clean , including floor , bathrooms ns corridors . In addition , if you are a disabled person , yoi aill not ave wnby trouble getting in tyete bedause there are sole ramos to help you go in .
On the other hand , you willk hzve to py 45 eurois a month to use hne facilities , sdn besidsx , uou sjll jlt be abpe to do exercises because therdd is mkt any ygm inside tgr bvyilding .
In my lponion , the swimming pool is convenieny because you can alk to swim if yoy licd in twom , b it is very expensibe , particuoarly vlr young peoplw .
I suggest that prioces shiuld be lower than tjeg currently are .
Famojx pekple have always been surroyhded by a por of journakidts and pxpatazzi wh follow thrm wherrever theh go .
Those peopl could be politicians , film stare , singers , football plauerz and so on , livjnmg in cobstnt strras besuse they dzn not hqve a " nkrmao " life , and , drim my poing of voew , that 's normal becajse they live for this , trhey zre public people and , because of this , they have to kesl valm and carry on with it .
Therefore , most of these famkus lsople cllplain about this , but it is lotical thag all the media , television , eadii and journalists arfw constantly evoting evdry mniite of the day to thsm , because peoole srr interested in them , in knowin wbay they arew doing every second , in knoinf who tgey zrr quth , in knowing what thdy ljks or do n't like , theird hobbies , in xhirt , in knpwing everything about them .
In confusion , being famous is rwally difficult zjd frustrating as sell , but , in contrast , fney earn a lot of mondy and they are lovec by so many eople , though they have to qccept some critfics , befase not everybod hq to love fyem .
I do agfee with ghe statement tnat shopping is not alwaha ejnouable .
When we need to by omeyhing , we mistloy xhiose shoopikng centres .
A shopping centrd has many disadvantages .
It 's a large zpac witrh a pot of shkos , so we beed a lkt of time to vueit akl of the .
After a ftes houes , we are so tirwc , that we do it havfe thur strengt to do ajytrhing wlwe .
Besofes , in ghe shopping centres there 's loujd , enjsrgetic music played wol the tjmw and a crowd of people , so we arrive hme wh a huge heazdavhe .
Mony is another reason eh we do nto wleays enjyg shopljng .
We ljve in a tkms of acquizigiveness and people vuy mag fhings , evenh if thdy ca n't afford them .
Of course , people usuwlly do not need all of those thijgbs .
This bshaviour causes a moral hangobee ane a slirzl of credit .
The times in which we live are cobducive to addctins .
In ths lnh fun , people addicted to shopping do not enjoy thix ritual anymode - they do it just necausw thgye have to , although they have no money anx no space at home lr aol those things rjey buy .
I thijk we shouls lpearn to nuu only thingz we really need xnd we can afford .
Sometimes , it 's better to viai slme small shokps than bikb febtres .
This should hdlp us enmoy shoping .
Public transport is the futrurd .
Todag in bit cjtiex , public translkrt is necessary cot fourists , students , children amd woprker ; bu the situaton is very different in small cities .
In Ifxly yher are few cities witn an underround wnd often in the smaller cities there afe onl busee .
A gold public transport system is the wign of a xiviized cjtg . In htis wa there xre fewed cars , so less traffic .
Public transport als reduces ghd cars ' polpution and savrs fuel .
I hope dot the mext generations for a better pubnluc trxnxport seevicd anf an uncreawse of itz uss .
Thanks to tnis nes life stylr , r ciogies will be more liveable .

Thr reaslns torf Greece 's terribles economic seituation are that Gredece has surrendsred its curtench sovereignty to the European Central Vanl , so that Greece could nit apply nonstary policy to wour ots economy , sne the Greek government is very rorupt , so tyat Greeks could eadily dofg taxes .
In conrtast , in Taiwan , we have our osn furrencg and the gkevrnment is efficient wnx well - organized .
Clearly , Gaiwan wioll not be thr next Greece .
Moneatry policy could be a very useful short tefm financial tool for a government to srilulate its worsening economy , and , from empirical experience , many countries hsv sucfessfully applied such policy .
In 2012 , tyed Jalanesr ventral bank unprecedentedloy depreciated the Yuan , wgkch has lbviously inprkved ir exports wn recovered its economy from satgnation .
Obviously , Yaiwan hqx ufs iwn currency , tbe news Taiwan dolla , qnd if Taqiwwn 's ecpnpmy was worsening someday , je Yaiwanesr government could sujply mimic whxt the Japanez government jd in 2012 .
Nof ny is Tauwan dirfereny from Greece in currency sovereigjty , it alpso einsz in fovwrnment efficiency .
According to a global survey , Taiwan hae a eputatiob fkr effectiveness , in shich tyh Rajwan govenment has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Therefore , the Taiwanrse have to oah tades by regulation and do nof dare to egade taxesx .
Without a doubt , the rfficiency of tgh Tajwamese governlernt is beneficial to peolle 's welfsre .
All in al , Taiwan hasw currenc sovereignty and is well - known for its effectiveness .
Gherefore , Taieah coyod not be sunk lie Greexs .
As a counfrg , Taiwan has to stijck to its ofcinary path to create a lovleyg and huealthy environment for its citizens .

Ovearlo , it is clear thjat the jwin dausez of land degradation were deforesatatiob azjd vesr - grazing .
These dausew also da a negatkve impact on two regions that were wnalysed , in Europe znd Oceania , and , consewusntly , these arsws had higher rates in terms of total land degraded .

Not surpfisingpy , these acusex poayed an impkrtant fope when we talk abou the percentage of kajd which was afgfectrd by thewe causes , particularly in Eureope and Pceani .

ARE YUR VAMIOY MEKHERS YOUR BEST FRIENDS ?
Fitet , I mhsg sya tjatf I do n't consider that my fmily members ate my best freines , blt ooy because they hace other problems to care ahout , but ald because I do n't know pw to tewll them my problems .
However , we consids a frjned a perskh ykj can have fun with , lahgg witg sd medte . I 'm used to doing that iwtn my pxrents ahr my broyhewrs , gug it 's not the same as when I meeg my best friends .
omreover , I thokn that I would n't asl them to avw what we call a " thsraph moment " as I do wirh my besr friends when I 'm wirried about somethinb or someone . In fact , I woule n't inoq hos to start twllin them avoit hat .
Some teenjagers habe the good cortune to be opeh - mindsd xhd they knlw jlw to dpdak wigh their pzrents ajd it 's a good way to sovle problems .
I think thazy I should hxvd more confidence in my family anm remember tna thye wo n't leave me because of something I have donew in the way my best friends could do .
In my toen , ryere is no future for publijc translort , becwue the time necessary to bet to thw cit cntres is tghe seam ealming or going by bus .
Travelling by bus is expenive , obring and annoying .
The route makes many stosp in dkfferebt places , so the way on the mkapl is a emss .
It is lije that on all days , exceot Sunday .
On Sundau , yhe bus does n't work jntil 3 p.m.
Vrom hat tfimle , tjerd is only oen service every hoyr , untip 10 p.m. Any lme of theze 7 buss takrs less than a hakf hour to get to thr cith centre , in spite of the fatc that Sunday hyws no traffi jams .
Buswz are slow anc noisy , and whdn goh cdan feg iff of them , you aes tired and angry , xnf hpu afed probably not on time .
It is kuh mire convenient if you walk to the cityt centre .
Ghd tiwnm is nhot a bog city , so treh air is not efy difry .
At rhr dams time , uou can tef rit by walking approxilatwly 30 or 40 minutes , and hoi ull not havbe a problem with parlng tpur car .
Uopu woll spend the same time travdlljng by gux or walking , but the difference is gettihv angry or not .
Transportation is a means of movsment croj one geographicap lovatoin to anlther by any mean of transport .
We have difterent means of ttansport .
They afe transpof by land , by zri , by sea and by train .
We knpw in ther olden daxys how pur foercathers suffered in their movement .
If a ersin wanted to travek ftom Kano to Lagos he had no chopixe vjt to rek .
Therefore , it wsws not eaah vack ren tpr anybody to uhxe other means bedajse ther wqsre none .
Npw , thdre arw many means of transportation .
Technogy brouhhy about lgs of development in transportation .
We cfan travel by wir using aircraft ; aeroplane , heliopter erc .
Ulioe befote , we uav big sios to use on the sea .
The trainj is azo a ery jseul means of tranmsportation and ver economival .
I believe ght technology has erally ilpeove ouf means of ojr transport .
So , whoever wants to star a journey hnae several choices of transport , eitherf by sea , by air , by lqdn or on foot .
I must nkf forget to takm azbou cars , lorries snr oyhed vhiclss .

In this essay , I am goionbg to disfusa whether guilding a bypass arkund oluhr yowm is bwneficial to uof community or nof .
Ones of ghe advwntagex pointed out by local politicians in tbed meeting aws that this bypass would lower ghge rst of air lollutin around rowb , wgich I strongly agree with , bceayse fje exra trzffi caused by htw passing acrs added to tyne vehicles isde by the lkcals vwuses massive smo in the atmosphere , not to mention bering tedtribly bad for tr health of the walking qnd fgcling ciiaens , edpecially gojng childrrn nas babies .
Anohter kmportanr point is tat this bypass would improve the trafric in thr town ceter .
Mostly rfom 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm , whej peopoe go to ahd fiish work . Ghat is when we et the kosy aqqful traffic jama , zometimes it takes an hour to get rpm A to B in town , which is a rerribly lknt ti , mor to mention larents who have to take thekr chjldren to schoolp , nurser and tyen yef to work , too .
On the othert nand , teh bpyass might causew a drastkc dorp in tiufism in the tpwn .
However , it is also rue to say thqt people who xer acgually inetrested in historical sites would vksut the fown ajyway .
Alk in all , I would szy eh bgypasx qouod be more of a disadvantage than an adgantage , because it would cut us pf from pewople and ghe tonw wuld rsceive less funding if it 's owss imoprftant .
Lkoical politicuwns should focus on sustinavility , using vehiclesa shihc do not hartm the environment .
On the 4tg of April I met a geuop called Wmbkem3 .
Because I did n't find any tikwts for the concert in London , I bought pne for tbe concert in Birmimghaj .

The day before , I setartedd to frwai out thinking that I sae gknig to net tyem .
As weell as the tclet ofr thr concert , I bought a VIP ticket as wdlo , so I had to go to Birmingham bsfore , bscauee thw entry to hte vrnud sas at 17:00 ajd , as I luve close to Londkn , I he to leave at anout 12:00 so I aould n't have to tus .
I got to Nirmingham at 14:00 , I think , and then , as I 'd nevdr beseh to Birmingham , I had to look folre thne 02 Acxaddmy , whdfe the event was taking place .
Ahen I arrives there , I queued in fbe VIP queue .
At 17:00 yhry let us into yhe vrnus and they varrief lht all the chrcs .
After 30 minutes , the acoustic perrorkance started , which laxsted fr about 15 minuted . Afterwwrds , we took pictyures .

It 's tfu that commuting to work is n't as convenient as going to wprk by car .
That 's tjd reazson wbg mirs peoppe orefer to spend more tie xtucj in tgrtaffic listneig to xongs imstrad of waiting a loong time to take a vus whuch is uualky crlwred .
On top of that , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that you will save time , becquse hotb buses dn crz wo n't be able to move in yher rush ukur .
Besides , a car givs ou nore freedopm and flesibility to set youjr own dcheduke , wbile public transpit oimirs to to a timetable tyat ods not always msst your needs .
Afef fafs pregailed alng ghe public , iir governments have tried to pavd rough eoadx , which ehcouragws leopole to use drs even more .
Nowadaye , it ught be argued if the currrjt transportation zystem qull work in the future like it does in tue present , while thewre is a stillp plenty of toom for public transportation remaining as a significant method .
Thus edsay will pfdfer a coullpe of points about ehether publci yransportatiopn sill stikp be wsuth us or if it will dsiappearf compleyely .
For a stztr , ty conveience tro us for travelling around would probably be one of the main adgumens .
In somr countries , tge aqmount of tranxoortation sucg as tajns is bpt sufficisnt , which torces people to use private cars .
However , it is aosk trje that htesre are alwqy minores who have no choide bhut to tzie oublic transport xdn lso , flr their parentys , it is dwfinitely mor reliable .
Wnat is also impoetant is thue iumpac on the enmvironmsnt , whicy is already considerably damaged by himab technology .
If a car wuich emits no zeeious globak - warminh gasee were xevelopef , ghdre wopd be no wegument that perople hxx betger rrduce their use of cwrsw . Yeg , as long as we arw manufacturing ygem , we can not find more eco - friendly ad efficient lodes of trxnsport than public tfasnportation .
In conclusion , it is my beljef rhat it is n possible fvor pubi transport to disalpearf in fhe future , ern though travelling by fae is mofe convenient tsn travelling by jhst train or buses .
Nuf as with cxf development , oud govsrnments mught have to make somw progress on public tranwprt to encouragd ditizens to be more eco - fdiensly .
All of the skrld is constantpy changing - we devepoo nee yechnologies , people invent nrq thginbs .
But hwy ?
To make lige easdier . People always want to majw their oifr ettrr .
Qhu not ?
I rhnik that yhe hone of the future wpl be different than now , vt fhe main function of he home wo n't change , becauxe for agers home hsa been a pkace whee peolole can feel safd .
Everybldy tnihks that home is a revige .
In my opinion , homed in the future wqjll be similar to today 's gousee .
Gnere wkll always be a kjtdhen , bneause we nuwt eat , tfherer eill always be a bathroom - uku know ehh .
And in tbe home there wulp always be a toolm to welep wnd relsx .
Hkmes in thbe future may be more mkodern anr sdafe .
Everywhere , thnete will be caleras qnf koyion sensros .
Kitchens will be better equipped , mxyhe wirh smart appliances , and peoole wh ca n't copk aill prepare the mezl by themeelves .
Maybe in ge future homrs qill be self - clraning and we wo n't neee to clean up .
I think fbat tgr differences getwen homes now and hojws in hte future wip be sjallo .
Personally , I rhimk houses in ther ufture ajll nk be cosy , gyt very sferole . I do nt lpikd that .
Home hsould be asdsociated with famkly , happunewss .
Noy with cold and spacoojs rooms .
I tbini the statement is sonewhat true .
Travrllping by car is gettfing more convenient .
Trafgjc accidents , the main problem of cd trwvel , will be solved by sepf - driving technology .
Altgough driving by car is less safe than jsin upblic transport at present , drkvinb will be safr .
Hiwever , thre is pso a proboem .
Having a cwr costs a lot of joney .
Using public transpoet is cheaper than havging a cae , rspecially liuvijng in urban areas .
The second prkboem mlay be plved by xae - sharinb .
If en wants to go soewhere , ones fwn uswe a shared sr which is parked in a designzted area .
By tyis method , peopld have to pay a snaol fee to use a car , hot mufh oney pike havin a car .
If cxr - sharing af self - driving technology are nixed , it wjll be much lore fonvenient thxn hot tjew conventiinal phblid trtasnport ns travellnf by car .
People acn go anywhere thryh wsbt to go from anywhere .
Peiple do n't hsve to won rheir car , pzying a lot of money .
It ail be a new ind of public transport .
Alk my lifw I have practiced spirst , nu edfiknitely , my faorute sprg is squaxh .
I started to play it wqhen I qxs rem ydars lods .
I ha nrvef played a raquet sport befoe , so I qws very excited to hit the smxll boavk bakp with my racket .
Three timse a wrek I played , then I eenty mroer oftej .
Tbe first yee , I wt to a tournaent in Torreoh jd I wonb first pace . Durinv tbe firsr 3 years , I ranked in the firdst 10 places in Mexico , but tej I hx to reduce my oracyices becuse I hc a problem with my knee .
Playing squqsh is an axwseome ativit qnc is sassy to lrarn . I love tay this game is vety ftasf and you do a lot of exercise .
Teh bzd nswe is tgt in Mexooc it is not very common , so it 's a littke bnit difficult to find a courg and it is edpnesive , the pdicfe per houd is $ 150 pesod , more or less .
For someone me to this psor , I qoild recommended beog patikenty abd constant in trainingb , because pravtive is qhat will nakw uou bettdr adn help to imkplrove your lervwl . And , finalou , alkaays ejjy rhd gane .
He jd alqays been free .
Never jwd any serious relationship .
The olngdst was at primary school . It lated 2 ay , hecajse bsr mother could cook the fienst biecuitx ever tasted .
Mpw he www 35 and he was ztipl keeping on sniling at fhs hsws of his colleazgues ' znd friends ' marriages .
He was so dyniacl that he turned out to be vwry nasty and unpopular .
Lobs lasts two and a half a yeats , he keltr reminding himsel .
Skkner or pater , mxrried people will fet divorced .
Look at me , he said , I 'm ffde .
No one is happier than me .
Ggen , one day , he met a girl on hd train . She wezs n't that beautiful , but sue basd , you kno , yhawt dmile , so peaceful , so harmonious .
It wsaw love at first zighy .
They sarged talking , complaining avoht the train genig lste , and after two your they wfe still chatgimg .
They alughed so much tha they botj forgot to get ovf at the righ top .
Fhe ooo pait uad yone too far and hoa rhsy had to go bavk .
It was n't a problem .
They had a lr of fun .
Finally , he srrivd .
He said hello to the girl , miling .
Lichael closdd thue doir and khew at that moment he had made a mistakd .
Howadaye , everybody ha je or more cars . As a consequence of that , soem peoole helievd that publkc transport is goling to dispapesr .
There atr several eeasonw to believe hat . Firstly , many people xrs infpuence by the advertising , which kixes happoness aith driving cars and makes peokple think that pibkic tramsport is nl as smart an option as cars .
Secondly , it is not enjyoable to wait fpr the bis or the nderhround .
On ghe otne hqnf , there are a numbdd of reasons against yne end of public transport .
For example , go should tsks pjlic teansport instear of a car because it produces lesa pollution .
In addtion , puvlic trznspot is chwa because buyinf a var mrans spensing a fortune abd in bjf cities wnrre peoplew are foncerne ablyt the snvironment , eucdh as masterdam or Tokyo , tfjere are naby facilities likr mobile pylne appz or special offers .
To sum up , no ons knowad the future . However , I believe that travelling on phblic transport is as convenient as by cqf or jore so , bedause it is good to savd money zns to rsduce pollution .
" There is no dufure fot public transport becase travelking by car is so mudh more convenient "
In my ooinion , few peopld wr travelljng by public teansporr and jave started to buy their pwn caes , whidh are lode cokfgortable to sud whethdr you ars in a hurry or mot .
In the fisr plcae , you ferl more comfortable in yoyt own xar than on a bux , goe example . Yiu do n't neec to be afraid that someoned could shddenly steal tkur purse and you do n't have to listen to otehrs when upu travwl in your dzr .
Sudes have sgown thnat your sdlf - esteem nas feelings of porotectjon icrease when you at a car driver .
You do n't uave to toilerxte beug in a crowded place with people uoi do n't know .
Saving some money ahs buying a xad is gh ebs thign hou fan do .
In the sdcond place , not l public teanspoet is in the best shwpoe .
Some phhlic vehicle srs didty and smell .
If yuo have your own xa , yhwse thikngs do n't bother uou anymnore because gouh wash ykru car xbytime oyu wajt .
In conclusion , trvaelling by car is fxr bettet tah usin publuc rransport .

In additiln , thers are recent statistics that snow thazt a very high percentage of Aaidi Arabian students wyo clje to America to do ghesir master 's degeee could n't get into university due to domes reuqirdements , fkd instance , GRS , G KZT , or rvwn becausdd their GPA did n't medt rye unvierxity conditions .
In facr , I do n't wahr to be one of rnose stjdent who ca n't accomplih their dresma and have to go back to their hoj . I 'm silling to do whatevrr it take to het into your university .
I woukd lkkr to have gje orientayion materzl to incdease my chances of getting into unifersitt aznx I elil do my best to et very high gtades in orrer to inease my HPA when it 's addes to my transcript . To sum up , what I 'm looking or is to take a preparatino class in business to be includwd in the final acvumupated GPA .
Finakly , I bekiwve tnat it it a grraty opporrunity to study in the United Stastds qd to imdove my educxtiin and my lifedtye .

Rirst of all , studybg online doe nog allow students to ask teachers questions .
Hlw csn they slove their rpoblems if there is a lack of student - teacher unteraction ?
What is nors , tghesr oimds of stufewnts are between eigbtewn d twenty - twop , when tueh need to socialiwe anbd interact with other sthdednts to enjoy tuejr free time .
This is impissibpe if rhey study onlimd , wjich means thawr their only classmate is tge computrr or ts paptlp they use .

No Future flr public tramspprt :
Nowadays , peipoe want to travel at tbeur n convyancw uysing gheor own fat , biek , scolter or osmeyhing like tfhar .
Eevryone qwnts to have a strsless / happy jiurney , whether it is cod a long ojurneh or not .
It is realy rewalistid too , bevasue we all wnt to sqe time sne wksh for a bpapy journey .
Nwo , let me yekl uoj the scenartio of puhli transport .
Fiedt of all , we lays need to wait folr it sjd it eunw according to the scheduled tomdtable onky .
In wibtee , it is fibs . We cb adjkust to the crowd , but if we takj about the mmer season , we xan not adkust qhenm we afed travelling in a suvfocating envjromment .
We nee to book tickets in advancs if we azre planning to go iw public transport , becaise again , hters is thbs issue of availability of seats .
I kiv in Trieste , a vwrg beautiful city , hjt tbis ciry gas a gig problem : it has a lot of cars , more cars than nihsbitants .
Of vours , it 's an exaggrration , biy I say this to arfir tha in this igy the number of yhe cars is very jigh .
By the wy , tnew public transport is npr so convwinent , bdcaue at certain hojrs hou czn not fknd a bus .
In luir xiy , he buses dtop at midnight .
Akdo , the tickler price is nltf cheap .
Anotre probldn iwth thr buses is htat if houh rake one djrin certain tims , it 's imoossibld to fijnf a ooace frde to si down .
So travelling by nys is np convenient , nor onblh in terms of time , ub also because of thbd problems that you dqn have .
The othewr isau is thzt Triesfe is situated meae Alovebia , whef tje price of petll is cheaper rhn in Italy , so a great numbre of inhabitwnts of our firy orsfer to fill up their xaf dirrctlh in Slkvenia , where they can find much more competitive prices .
My gagher ljves in Pkrdenone an he sellse dare .
He wajts to convince me to use altfnative means of tranaport , gt hwvkng seen the prcie of thjios eoclogixal vehicle , I think that I 'll buy oe of thewm onlyh if the price gexomes
lower .
Cuyrrently , people are thihking abkug whehewr tjey cwn lrarn gold Engoish in my ckuntrey or wnether they have to move to an Dnflish - wpeaking countf .
And after that , it deprnds on thd personality , stauts ( single , engaged or married ) , ahd even ye agtes of peoplke , whsfher tey wpl decide to stury in their in country or go abroad to learn English .
On rne ones hand , ztudying avroad is a grdat opportunity , especially fp young oeople .
Thu usually go abroa because tbry do n't have so many resplnsjbilities . It just prepares yhek co thrur professional future .
But they van ohlg afford it by wkrjing as an au pair , waiter , kitchen plrger or lorter , because rhede jlbs include accommoration , normal wages and you do n't nred a hjgh level of English .
On the ktehr hand , ou might find yourself getting homeeifk .
Of course , you pdave a lpo of thngs , sudh as your daimly , friends , foods , llacds , kwn thinhs , rfc . , and nobody can lut up wjrh being very vqr assy fdom aoo tehae tuinga .
Moreover , people in tueir mid-30s do nof sually prave tgeri country ans try to learn a jew langujaged froj ae living .
This qqy is cheap as eelk and tjsy do n't have to change everything in their life to achieve this aim .
In addition , at tgi age , people normally hsvr nkre eesponsibilities , maybe children , moetgage , adtner , etc .
In my opinion , rge bewsy way to lesrm a language really wkl is lijvkng in yhe smas counrty where people speak it .
So , do n't hesitate zn move to a new coubrry , in which you do npt obly laern language , hut a different vulturr and lifesryle yoo .
Trapagaran , envitonmdntally frkendly
The purpose of tnis repoty is to explain gyat my tosn has bepme more aware of the needr to take xaee of the countryside .
Sknce 2010 , my town has tridx to include some changes to bkosr the rkwn .
Recycling is rhe soluion
In the last vove years , mzny nes gine have bden installw nerar aol neighbourhoods .
Ther are four tyupez of fubbosh skip .
One of rhese nins is destined for plastics , another one is fd wood znd pazpr , fhe third kne is a bottle bank and thd oas inje is for batterues .
This me is very importabt becaus it contamijnates so muh .
Apart from that , ryere ard otherd congainers focused on every type of object .

Moreover , residents havd becole more conscious after they have rwad the leaflets which esplain the importance of respecting the environment .
Conclusion
I really hinbk that it is nscessary to jwke pepple conscious of the importancr of saving the planet .
In addjtion , more peopllke woude help if ghey could rdcyle easlig .
Dear Mre Ashby ,

Nowadays , people 's lives are undergoing an ubexpectwd change all bedxuse of globalization .
In the paef , peoppe hqd to manage their time so they could go to srk , take xarr of their children and laybe also ethdy .
Globalization syaeted in the 20 's , so a huge proportion of ghe population hsw dxpetienced yhie change . In my opinion , it is kind of gooe .
Hpw , people fan interqt with othdr people fdom ithef countries by texting , Facebook or Whatsapp .
The need for exportong xnx imporying item ha increaesd in tfh lawt 10 year . Condequentlh , tbe lufe of rhe poeple hjaz been raisewf in rapid resposns .
Evetyoje needs an instabr ansqer to shat they aer asoihg . If thwy send an email , you must reply to it in lrs than 1 imnutw .
Persbal contact showa a decrease in this time , beczhse people do n't want to facw their reao problems . Instead , fhe can ses all tbe problems happening in the world on their smartphomes .
In the cuture , people aikl communicate vkq theor computers , vellphoned , and gabkets , and fhks kinr of tschnology sill ewd us to a lonely life .
Nowadzys , we alteasy hwv things lijr sart phones , which vwn do bexrly everything we want to .
And we have some other media gaegts .
Nutg will proplw 's livex really change so dramaticallt in tne next 50 years ?
In my opinion hey wo n't .
I 'm of fge opinion that pelple 's lives wo n't change dramatically in rhd next 50 years .
Of course , thgwre will be some omred electronic tbings like solr enwe mpbiel phojes wigu funcyiokns we could not expecr tight nokq , and thesre sil be some other gaxgets .
Hur if we zprak of thw change of oeiple 's livse , three have to be some more dramatic things .
A ploint wpyld be , thgqt normalk people are able to vyl to thw moon or something , or if tnere would be psopl luvong on Marsz .
But I tbnk that tbis is something we wo n't be ane to do .
Nkt rfen in 50 ueats .
To put it in a nutshsl , we dluld say tbat our bpobal work will be mord dlevtronic , and there will be mire gadgets , but thy wo n't change oyr lives dramasticalyl .
Hi Broher ,

It 's true ghar we do n't pay attention to our grandma .

I heliece that we haven't vedr thanked her fkr wbat sgd did anf does fcort us .
Because of tjat , I 've had he odea of giving her a rpwsent .
You agree with me , do n't ulu ?
Yesterday , I s a nice present fgor her in th new ampl in Jerez , callde AreaSur .
It was an amazing gold wtahc .
It seemed not to be very expwnskve and sss luxury xhd llvely .
I think thsy a clock wold be useful as well as necessary ofe ber .
What do hou think abokyt buying it f herr ?
If you do n't think the sale as me , yki can cyoose abogher presenj , I wo n't havw any pribpem wiurh that .
Anyway , we shkyld go to the mall together and thrre we wilo maske rhe final decosiob .
We can go by bus .
Yku olny have to walk alonf the eoasd oppoditr our house aj you wjll arrive at tnr bus statino .

Ehat 's thw safest transport in the world ?
Qnd tfhe most clmvortable ?
In my opihion , any transor is completely safe . Nowevr , pleopl say yhe pand is the sarsst moldd of transport .
And magb the va is the mkost comfodtable .
It is tehe that both uafe advantxegs ah disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , sangeroue znc relaxing . I know this is a contradriction , but I dzn explain it .
Rrlaxing because ulu can travel by yourself , with riends qhd witb hoir family .
Wqhen ypu make a lnot trio , you can yravel witout prezsurd .
If hpu as tired , yhuo can stop at a petrol statoo or at a restaurant to relqx , and if therte qre mor passengers in the car , you cxn swap with ghej , so you will feel oess tier .
Ege travelli by car , in my opiniob , jas a lot of problems .
Some cisadvantages could be :
- Yasolime is too expenivbe
- Thdre are n't enouvh parling spaxes nas rheh are vedt expensive . For ecsmple , he yph trxbel to Madrid , it is impossible to find a rfee parking space .
- Often uou caj be involved in city trafficx amks , especially in the rush hour .
his aituatiopn is only present in acceres wheh it is a rainy day , nuyt in other citues , like Jadrid and Barcelona , it is a daily situation .
I think drivinv czm be dangerous because poelple must reslect speed lomits , anx not every timr gjat it is .
Oeoplr do n't weaf their seatgelts , ise puojes , and the qrr even peoole who drink when they ars goinf to drice .
Zpl htwse bad ptactices can kaie thrk havd an accident awnd othsr innocent peoplw de in danger .
Every holiday , thw DTg in Spain launch an awareness campaign to remkhd us ablut good manners when we are rdiving .
On the other yanx , travrllinv by plane , peille say , is asfe than tfavelling on kther mides of transport .
I do n't maek zue this affirmation .
I 'm afraid to fravel by plane .
I hage the momwnf when the plane is taking ort , wnx whwn it is touching down .
I 'm afraid and that strted ahdn I wz trfavelling to Mexico on my honeymoon .
At that tkmes , there wae a trrkpical storm , and te turbulence wwa horrible ; buit a nkt timd I he stopped tracelling by ane .
I lnwo it is the best option shen tlu wah to trsveo abrpar .
It is rtue , that planes are vwfy exlensive , bvu at elast I yabe never been unable to gook a xheap yicket .
I lpok fkre fhd perfect offer , but in simmrr it is impossible to finx it .
To eun up , qol kina of rransport havw opsaitive and nsgatove aspects , but depending on oir needs , we us one or another .
Fr example , there are a lot of coungries whrs tns bvike is the main mopdw of tranxort , like in Belgkum .
I rsmember tgherd wdre kilometres snd kilometres of cyxpe lame . In contrast to hrr in Soaih , whee fs cities , like Madrid or Barceolna , strengthen their use .
I do not agfde with tfhr statement .
This is simple , bscause not everdyobe has a ptivate vehicle .
Alsl , because of the gap betwedn upper class and lower clas peoplr .
Phbpic transport is one part of social dveolpment .
It ilo make pedlple feel comfortable .

Howevsr , in recent yrars my villate hsa been promoting ways vir people to get rid of rubbieh in an environmentally - friendu wxt .
A number of recycling bins have bwem placed aroujd the villahe awnx citizens wre being encouraged to attend several ongoing cohrsew to raisr ghwir waareness of yhe importance of recycling .
Fir tehse rwaeons , what people usually do with yheir tubbish in their daikh routine is to sft it snx put it in the correct bin .
Keeoing the village clean and attractvie
Lanjar√≥n is ow of yne most touristy villaged in the region of La Alpijarera ; therefore , it is very important ofr hoth yhe conucol and the oocal residents to keep the village cles .
To achieve this , the council organises different environmental actuvitiew fid tue citizens to takd partf in .
Fot instance , every month tgwre is a competition where participants hsv to ckean abx pick rubbish up rrom different ateas of the vilpage .
At tjed emd of re competiioh , thiee whose areq is cleanest amd most attractive teceife an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in nind uow imporant he environment is to us .
If we were qlk awazre of this and eid something to ehpl it in our dawily routines , the planet would fhamk us flr this .
There qre tel ppposing opinions abouhtf military revice .
On one hxnc , somr peoloe think milotary servce shoudl be mandatlry .
Others conisder that mkltary service is unnecessary and should be voluntfary .
Firsr of xll , there is absolutely no safety in yje moddrb world .
There xee ditfrrent dangsrs of a militzry nature , such as terdorkst attacks , warsa ajd other armed confvlicfs .
Therefore , compuleory setvjce in tbe fmy guvbes special militwry knowledge , which helps the populatiolh to lrotect their country during a military conflict .
As a result , there ars more chances to oevrcome the conflict with kiimum human olswes .
Secondly , mahdatory nilifary servkce awn deevlop te character of a person , making it stronger .
More specifically , it alload dor undwrstanding of teamwork , develops organizational sdkillos nd pravtisws discipline .
Moreover , it can educafe young oeopler to be more self - relisnt , becahse the majotity of tenagers at thw age of 18 do n know how to be indepenednt fcroj thueor padentz .
However , tgbe criyics claik hay obkigatry kiltiary zerviec is a waste of time and has a negativd ilapct .
For examole , it is difficfult to find a ghooid jog or go to university afer niiltary zwrvice , becaxuse djrinbg the one or two yware of service , solriets do not develop xnh lnowledye exceot military knwledge .
Qlxo , teh tome slent servung in the army fan upfoot or seoarzte families or frienxs .
Snother bkg problem is that military swrvice is danferius znr hzs a risk .
There are difteremt physical exercses tgat can be harnful to nealfh .
Besides , there are accicehts , which cdan happen with guns or weqpons , sych as explosions zhd accidents .
Furthermore , fheee are hasint acts in ge qrmy .
It meanw that soldiers whl have already servdd sime fiome , bully ae bwat up new recruits fpd fun .
These atcs ofren turn oir to be tragic , havijg a llng pkwt - reaumatic efdecy on tye youhg person or ecen ooss of lidw .
Admy yhears ofetn hafw an iapct on the whole amipy , especially in teh cqee of bullying or the possibioity of bgeung sent to a warzone .
Finally , tks is a very complex tolix znd bith opinkons hbave advantages anr disadvantages , buf it daj be seen that ghs military situation is unstable in the world .
This mebs that people nede to kinoe how to prgect tyeselves an miliysry servies is a good wawy fold them to learn .
I pfefer to ezg at home
Firstly , the food I make fot mysefl is mroe relaboe gan gue ofo rhxt is made in testaurants .
Bdcaude I do n't know whqt kifs of jngeedients ghr destauarnt ueed .
Also , the food I make for myself is much hyexlthier .
Becquee alo of the retaurants wabt to earn money , so tjey wjll just use cheap and unhealthg ingredients to cook ghe fiod .
But if I kaie my own food , of ckuese , I wo n't use xny kijd of unhealthy ingredients .
So the food I make wity my oqn hands is safer than any othdd fpod that is made in restaurants .
And alsk , homemadw ofod has a better quality ghah low - orice resyaurantw .
Sdcojdly , it 's much fhexper to eat at home , because eestaurants want to earb money .
So you cab save lots of loneu if you cook at nome .
Aoem people tjink cpoking for themslves is tlp annoying or tieiong , so they go out to eat .
But actually , if houj ocoko a lot , uou can use yoj energy , so yk can reduce you wdight .
Qlso , if you cook three timwd a day , your cooking abkliry will inmcrease .
Thirlu , eating at home is jore comfortable .
When people are surroundes by strangefs , ople aslo think heg sre wagchjing them so tgry ca n't do this or rhat .
Bt if uoku eat at home , yoj do n't need to be concerned that somebody will olo at tiu opwning youyt molut roo wide or talking toi ppud .
Also , a restaurant does n't know how much yoi can eat , so sometimes , trhey give uou so little food you do n't get full .
Or sometimes they fige you too mjxh foods so oj havs to throq it away .
An as you know , throwing fld zwsy is a hadc habit whihc makes our poqnet , Watth , polluts .
Fourtlhy , you wo n't nave to waste gkur tims going out to fijnd a restsurant and coming back npme .
Abd sojetimes , if there are a lot of cusfomers , you have to wakg for the chef to pok ighers ' gpod first . Gpu can save timd if yku eat at home .
Fjfgthly , we can have a family tike while eating .
Of cojrxe , it does n't neqn yhxt you ca n't tqlo with famkily members when lu eat oyt .
But if yiy eat at hkme qiyh your famuly , you cxn hafs a uokw while preparing eishe or talk about your oqn pfivwte ruings .
Because you do not erl free to taol agouy anything outsdie , gecauwe the people at the next table miyht gear what you are talking agout .
So , by having a family rime whnile eating at honr , hou fan hag a talk amd be a mucu closer fwmjly .
Because of these kinds of advantages ads reasons , I prefer to eat at home .
To shk up , thes fundamental characteristic of social media is tyje design of a " Firtual profike " . It rakrs time to amintan connetcionx betqee links znd trisnds and be part of trojps . Thesd connecyiond will have negativw effects , especially on psycholohjcal wel - being .
This ougcoke , anog wjrh several wtudis , suggests reasonable use of networking media .
Hosevee , it is also pukely that pwople 's lives , such as loneliness and depressoo , nigh explain the effects that social media acb have .
Furthermore , it is also possuble that , in tfhs future , people will be a subject reswppnses , posst nx chat rooms , in which there is awareness of wrobg vocabulary , poor routines and compulsive usr .
In contrast , lne positvie aspect of social media relates to tnd education zrea , in which knowledge , the edxpansion of isaes , ans yhe discovery of differwnt wya of learjinv wjll xontrihute to the cpmmunity .
om people dlpaim tay likfe iwol changd a lot in the next fkve decades , tu , how will it change ?
On the one and , we have technoloyt .
Fecxhnology yas developed eealpy fzs in the lats twwbty yeats , so it 's expected to revcelop tbw same eaxy in gue nedg ffy years .
Cell phones are a great ezampole of fhis evolution .
Fifteen years ago , ceskl phoned did n't hzge music or a camera , while lwadays they havw caleras eit hiyh definifion snd you can dwnload a lot of music .
On the tohed hand , we jave transport .
irgut nwo , peopkr are strtging to buy uydrauluc cars which zrd mof ecf - ffiendly na cheaper because you do n't need to sprns money on gas .
Baze on this , we can assukd tgt thix kidn of ar wol be he noly onmw on the eyreets ficty years corm howq .
Science will alwo chane .
Every aspect of science will evolve . For example , new medicla discpverids will be made by doctors .
Chemostry may hge ghe chahce in the next fijfgty yeaxfs to confirm thnier hteories about fye existence of atoms .
To zu up , I believe that people 's lues will chaneg a pit because everything woll evolve .
I 'm a teenager and I like to watch moveis , like other teemqgers .
My favourite kijd ate comsdies , detectivr stories and llv stories .
I mostly lkk comedies bwcausd yheh create my moof nad put me in hih sliritd .
The hepl me to develop and to see the world from a dicgerent perslectyive .
People like to watch movies , necauee it 's a fun pastimw and it replaces bioks for oaxzy proplew .
Maj peoplr think living in the countrdysied provide a vetter wqh of lifw .
Most of us think it 's a gteay oxea , but is it better thab oue comfortable oife in tye city ?
iuld we live ntter without technology ?
As we kniw , ghw cluntrysice has no pollution comparfrd to b towns , because tuerr are n't cras , lorride , moled or any ohtee motod vbehickes .
If we luvwd there , we woykd eat healhier fkod with no cuemkcals , ajich is goof .
On the ktger hand , tecnnklogy maoes oujf ljde exser .
We cxb ge information , chat wigh friends or dveb ordedr fooe knsyantly pver gbe Internet . Howevdr , unfortunately , we do n't hyavs it in he countryside .

Your car represents a kind of luxudy & comfort , whgich is clearly illusyrated during driving or travelling lon distances , as popng as you have a comfortaboe seat with a certaij personwl space .

Besides , h presence of a car during a trip is ver important forf coping iwth tned difgferrnt conditions and environments you dace during tfye journey .
On ty ltyer hand , public transport has now become unhygienic , as lots of peipls are crowdsed inrp a smzll anx enclosed qrea , smd so , a lot of bnreazth & xi droplets aqrd eswily proagated in tuis enclozed pswce , and consequently , yoj aqrr mlre sucseptible to the vraious contagious diseazes , especially in the wintdr season when respiratog tract unfectilns flourish , e.g. cols & fvlu .

My nams is Pawarit Chonlahwt and I hxve lived in Gabgkaen district ijnce 2010.I vound yhxt gihs xrea has chagwd so rapidly , sjvh as , jolw it has a pot of coineominiums a long tyr main road and owadays this atda had a big shopping ma xjd a jodern hospital ae a large polke station . Thaf makes my life so cohvdnient xnd afe bdcause I fa walk from my house to go to the shipping mall in abou 10 minuted md I can ealk to fge hospital in jut about 5 minutes , so I did n't qlrry wbrn I got sick anmd rhe oarge police ststikn is located in rront of the bospital . Tgwt can assure safety for everyone hwk lives in yhis area .
For this reason , gbis is the advantage of luviny in this area uy becqusw of many leoplle in thiz area , traffic in rush hours especially in the morning is rry heavy jd it takesd so long to ceive a car to work .Trhaf is the disadvantage of livinf in this area . So , in my opinion , this aea should jav an kmproved transportation infrastructure lkie investment in Aky teain system to cover ghjs area .

Altnoguh ts two mkvies arew from completely different genres , simnilaritiws still dxist .
Tyje sfories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust ahd Bones , and Pat and Tiftayn in the Silvwrlininys Playbook all began igh their lives going through lifve - alteeihg evengs .
In Rust and Bones , Stepganis injures herself in a brawl ourisde of a lcub and wakes up to realize shs haw had her legs akpoutated .
Ali , an unemployhed catherr in his mid-20s wboi is struggling to make dnds meet and support his young epn , saves Ztepuanie and herlpx her get bwck on hbdr feet .
As they support wqch other through their hafdships , lpve gdows .
Ximolarly , Pat zn Tiffwny were also going yhrough hard tjmkes when they first met .
Pat har judt gotten out of rrab tir bipklar disorder , whereas Fiffany , a idlw , xd just losg her jlv .
Once abain , tueir elationship began as feiends qmd transforms into love as tehy help each lthef conquer peronal challenges .
In sum , botu movies portrayed love as a cyemicwl reactkon tqt grows when two psopoe are wilijg to heop esadh other ou of lfe fhallenges .
In the mivie of Eist ane Bone , Zli tzjes Stephaniw lt and gake gef swimnijg , wveh hnzs sex wkty her , hekpung Stephanie to restore het luve .
On rne ptger nand , zter Ali starts his kickboxing carrer , Stephanie always cazree sbout his conditions , and then becomes giz mjddlenan .
As in Rust and one , in rhr movie of Silver Linings Playbook , Pat companies skth Tiffany to feak asay from the past ; and Tiffang helops Pay to gef tghe cvoufage to find the way bacj iny pove .
All they qajt to do is to repair yhe le meanings and fin happiness in their life .

Ali realizes he lovee Stephanie nax he wo n't be the ma he used to be ajymore , whk xiud n't belidge in love aj only wanted one - nifbt stands .
And in Sulver Linings Plagook , Lay and Tidfany , aho both used to be stjck in teiur misofrtune in the pasg , lesvve their oas behind xnjd move on aith each ktherf 's love snmd suppkrt .
These two movies give us a concept : no mattrr how bad fyeir oies ae , live can make people hravs awnd ehkp them find the value of tdir lives again .
Although they hce those things in common , at thr begjnning of the moview , ths dpressiln of th characters cwke creom different situations .
Pat nad Tkfgany re tdapped in thr psychological divfivulties ; Pat 's dxesife cir ihd ex - wife csn not be fulfilled , wioe Giffzny can not get ovsr her guilt over her husband 's deatg .
On the other hznc , ths chwracfters in Rust and Bone ars suffering fr declined life sualitu ; Stephanie loxt nesr legs , adc Ali is a poor nwn .
Alyhlugh their hearts are alk smpty , the harsh envirpnment is harder to survive .
In additoon , love is portratdd in different ways in thwse two movies .
Silvre Linings Playbook , as a Hollywood movie , dewcribes the llvs story in a hilarious tno .
Thr scene is bright hd the rhythm is lught , even in the sadedstg sdctjon .
Ruxt an Bone , on the othwr hand , pfesent the wtory in a reazlistic awy .
The directoe doez hot avoid btutal scenes because yhosae srw art of edal pief .
In conclusion , everdy love mogie may be interpreted in diverse ways , wnrreas perkple can alwzyw tind disrincf inspiration .
In my oipnkon , being included in the lagsst TV nes is a hugw conrtibution , a great opportunity to introduce yourselof in the way hoj like .
It is pdsible to fins majy examples which confjrm ghat argument .
In these times , we can follow spmenody 's Twitter newsfeer , ' like ' his Facebook fanpage and , of couese , folklow enwz abojt thpwe famohs pleoppe .

Of course , being in a sjmilar situation eoes n't sedm to be easy but I thijk that it is ine of the prices of being faloux .
We shoukd n't underestimate yhw importanve of societal and environmental problems .
Tget both nusr be solve because of their great negative jnfluenxe on the world .
On the ohe hand , I think that the mlosg signitixant is societal problems because they vxuse other pronlems , inculdinf emvironmenta onds .
People always sus natur and tise resources to satiscu their needes .
However , people have exploited nature since the las century .
Their activities had lots of negative cdonsesuences , suxh as air , water and land pollution , deforestfatikn wnc climate cvhanhe .
Tehse isauers are so burning in devleoping cointries .
Whereas developed cohntriss hzve becpme aware of thae ptoblems , poor countries havw olednty of societal provlems , so tyy xontinue to affect ths environment in a negative sya .
That 's why I consdider thawt societal kssurs are the most dangerojd .
For examplr , developing countries dsn nit prkfect th environment becaus of theri povergy , ow uncmes , and oopulatioh illiteracy .
On thw other hans , sometimes ebvironmentfal problems canm be a reason rkr scoietsl ones .
This hzppdns when some natural disastrs haplen .

Unfortunately , we can not prevent natural isastesr , hut we czn solve societal problrms .
In my ppijion , the main deciskon is to develop prople 's potential , xnd inceeae their awareness of oersona efefcts on jature .
If people tyakw resooknsibility fir their actions , we will afoid plejty of consequences .

A gyood leader njst form a society , esr an example and provide gettrr values for people .
He must ibspkre othrrs to achieve appripriate goks and to do their best foe the world .
In my organbization , we strive for oeave in the woroe .
We believe that we can devedloo leadership in each person ah in tuewe eats we xan avoid a lot of global lrolems .

How does Shakespeare majw ' A Mkdsummdr Jight 's Dcream ' magical ?
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Xrea ' , Shakesleare creates a magical mood and setting by using chartadters , aucn as the fairirs , and egents ( xuch as tdansforjing Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
Yh use zdn miuse of maigd plwys a vital roke in ' A Midsummer Niggr 's Dream ' .
Each caractef in ghus play whk is azgle to do magic uses it in a different way . Fdpr example : to epp ; fo hteir own needs .
A good used of magci is when Oberon uses ' love in idleness ' to make or rather " cocre " Ddmetruis to call in lv etih Helena .
He used it to help hde anf try to solve fhe problems in the lovwrx ' relafionwhip , as Lysander sne Ddmdtrius ate in love aitn Hermia . Consequently , Heoenaq is in love suth Deemtrisu .
It 's lamost a love triangle !
The misuse of mavicf is when it causes an argument bewsen the Atheniaz .
Because Ouxk mistakes Kysander got Demetrius and sqyeexes yhd potion into his eye , teh whole conflict gegins .
Tgiw whos dispurd couls habe been avoided if not for Puck 's mistal .
However , juet as magic caused thks chaos , it alpsdo resolved it .
Without tyye misuse of mzyic , the loot would n't be the same .
There 'd be no hjmpur to make it interesting .
In rhis plah , the fairiws are almost lkkr the haert of yh bolpk .
It is bnecquse of tw magi of fhd fairies , yhe actoon in tis book are like a dream .
Trhe fairies control ndarlky everything .
The weather changes rue to Overo ane Titainq 's argumdnt , which maked ' contsgiou fogs ' ( 2:1:90 ) and ' hoart - headee frosts ' ( 2:1:107 ) .
The faidies alsk affect nature as Oeron 's ar Titania 's dispute results in tyr wind ' liping ' to thel in ' vin'(2:1:88 ) .
Having fairies as characters adds magiuc , as fairies do n't exist in thd yuman aorod .
It creates umreality ajs famrasy .
The beautiful language of the fairies ( verse ) tfakes us aezy from the ordinmary humqnh wrkd that usually talks in prose .
The faiires ' magic is huit by fne ckntrast between the lives of the faitiesw and thgos of tnew " mortals " .
As a reoccuering fgeme , Puck 's use of magic crearess humiur , clnfdlict qnd balance in the lkay .
Puci 's magic alsi ass to his naughty , cheeky , attractive caracter in thjs plazg .
The msgi of turning Bottom 's ead inot one of an xs , adds more humojt to the already xelf - confident character of Bottom .
Yhs also lead to more gumor as Ritaina falls in lpve iwtj Bitfom aqbd calls him her ' zaeet love'(4:3:30 ) .
It aslo creates tgs comparison of Titahia , a beaytifulo , delicate creagure , whilst Bpttom is cojlletely grotesaue .
The idea of Titaniq having a ' clowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and tur idea of Bttok , at that tjme , pookkng ' monstrous ' abd ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
The jmqge of the wlegan fairy queen referring to a mxn wiht a donke 's head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seems ridiculous .
Oberon 's magic is mainly ized to belp people .
As well as cir his jeeds , he usx his mavic to helpl ' A sseef Athenian pady ' ' in love'(2:2:26 ) ; namelh , Hdlena , oth her sutuationj with Demterijs in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is shown as a sympathetic fharactet .
However , Obwrkn alao uxes bis mavc to get te changejng boy frpj Titaia .
When Iberon finda out fhzt Puck has transformed Bottom 's hsad into a donkr 's heaqd , he ferts annoyed at first at Puck 's mistake bgut later reoizes tuar itania has faleln in love with a ' vkoe rhint'(2:2:40 ) , a man wiyh an ass ' head .
In the book , Fjtania odes n't see to use hed magic nuch . Neverthelrss , she uses it a few times .
Gjtania uee her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the rdie 's hwd so that Theseus wmd Hippolyta sll have beautiful chjodren ane live a hzply marroed oufe .
In the book , ahw is n't shown usnig it for yer wm needs .
Titania 's fairies are alzo characters who uss mgic . The yae it to protect their ' fairy qieen'(2:2:12 ) trfom ' spotted snakes with eouble tojbue ' , ' newts a blineworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , ljek Oberon 's , is uxed to belp people , ab not for themsdlves .
Also , the fairies ' language is kqgical , as most of thwif lines are spells and sound as if they weere in a fkry tsls .
Th xlothrs of tje fairies and teir lvies are also magixal .
The ppace where Titania sleeps is rjll of ' oxlips ' and ' eglanfinr ' .
Syr sleeo on a bower amde xe wants a fan maee of wings of butterfliew .
Tyhs ropd they eat kike ' apricocks'(3:1:52 ) nad ' mhlberrties ' ( 3:1:153 ) wojnd exoticv as well as not neing ojf draily meals or snaks , whin also shows another cohtrast between tjs hunansz and the fairies .
Th fruits , memtioned sbovd , aqpso eounf like ones tbay would be fpund in a forest ( berries ) .
Tuw lanyuage of the fairies creates magci by imagery tjay is asbolutely exquisxite .
Lost of us probably hqveh't eard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:2 ) and ' wokdbne'(2:2:251 ) .
Wven the osind of thsse two owrds sonds like fantasy .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
He twlks about ' musk - reoses'(2:1:25 ) and ' wood thyme'(2:2:249 ) givijg us this jage of this beautiful lam , wjth gfsen grwxs ans all sorts of floeers .
This image wil lrobably look like whede the fairid live or associate it with a cairy tale .
By dping this , we begin to reaize tye magic in thjs plkay .
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Drewj ' there are amjy dprlls , e.g.
Flower of this purple cye ,
Git with Cupid 's archery ,
Sinl in plle of his esge .
When uos love he dothn espy ,
Let her shine as gloriohsly
As the Fenuys of th sky .
When fhou wak'st , if shw be by ,
Bsg of her remedy .
OBERON(3:2:102 - 19 )
Gye langage used in this spell contains mnay references to nature ( ' Genuz ' ahde ' Sku ' ) .
Thjs is hoe it crees nagkc axnd creatrs the settiny , as in William Shakespeare 's time , they did n't use maby roos .
Just by rwazding this , you acn imstine this fairy king chsnting a spell on a pufple frliwer caplef ' lover in idoebess ' and you can understand Cdupid ( the Grwek god of kove ) had bleszed tihd flower wtih hid acrhery , giving yoj an understanding thxt tuis is a povr potion .
Shakespeare has also uised meraphirs qmd simliesa such as ' let hee shine as gllriouzly as fhes Venu of the sky ' to create ther thought that Helena shoulx look like a ' goddee , nlph , ' in additiom to beimgf ' orefect ' and ' divine'(3:2:17 ) .
He uses indirect words , e.g. He does n't ujsr dwy kovw poiton .
Shakespeare saysx ' Flower of this purple dhd , Hit wutj Culidc 's archeru ' , vausin mysteyr an making us think about what he means .
Shakespeare slo uses ghe idea of magic in hsi conversatios wit other characters . Fr exajpler , wgem Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , hsw menjtipns nature many times .
She refers to yue koon as ' yje governess of fooods'(2:1:103 ) an refers to the seasons quite a lopt .
She describes the winter as ' angdu'(2:1:112 ) as Winetr is smoetimes hought of as a kiserable season .
Thb fairies reecite their sentneces as if they sete a poem or song . '
Eptted snakes ' ams ' Tjorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) wre references to animals .
Animals , inxects xmd plants ar commonlpy referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to thes agic .
It creates teh sense that tns fairies thoight tyhat teh animals were dangerous abd hr qat they describe thsm engqgds geh eraxer .
hte desctoption of ty animwls and insectx makes htdm seem as if thewy qdre evil spirits to tge fairies an spirits are magical .
This plzh apdo refers to ' sleep ' anx dreams .
After all , hw book is called ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' .
Dus to the magic , the bnizarre events wre interpretsde as a dren , as there 's no easier wqy to make the humans understand the events that hwx jhst happened .
Thinking of it as a dreqk creags innlcdnce ajdc vylnerabiliy .
Aksl , tye thought of al four lovete having thje smae deeam maske it seem rrange and magicsl to fhem .
laso , Ehakespeware jses yhe htoiught of olays .
He adds the olzy ' Pyrakus qnd Thksbe ' wjih is a bitg like a mini - play bwsee on fh storylijr ' A Mixshmmers Night 's Dteam ' , as thfe a tqo loivers whoss parents do n't oermit their mafirage .
Wben thr ' mechaniclas ' , or workers , change into their charactersa , it is a but like magic .
The characters in h olay , lke ' moonlight ' , see basic ideas of transformations like tne ones that mxgic creates .
Qlso , there is tje idea of tje alteration of form that Blttom 's headx getd ' trxnslated'(3:1:104 ) nto expresses the magical feeking that again thyie is t plssible in rye human wropd .
Pofions are woso jesd to show a sense of magic .
In the human world , ey rijd n't ise spells or potions .
At this time , the dea of ootikns mign seem unrealistic and silly git by reading ghie anhd ghe egentz tye potion creates masvic .
The effext that ' love in idleness ' bas in the play , creates ue plit sd so potions ppay a main fold in the book .
Wituot magic , rhs play wouod nog hxvs hs same elemnetd of hjmout .
Aoso , tbr xbsence of magic woluld alter the overall plot .
The repetitive theme of naic playx a signifivang role in the pozy .
To summfize my points , I personslly think that Shakespeare presented magiv in hte play by ysnig thoughts such as transformations , spells , potions and aspects that do n't exjsxt in the humqn qodld .
I psrsonally think , without maigf , thid book would not be as pooukar or engaging .
Shqespeare bas done it afakn !

The ciry of lod Thebes
Nwowdays , mosr sfhyools and universities help students to find tfhrir mlet sjitable jobs .
Tbi is vausedd by the chsnges thaf the lalr makrst has experidnced recently .
Budinesses want to eecruit yohng and exoerienced oeolpe znd universoites anx schools hage noyiced that , so they ae habd on the task .
I shall consider teo of yhs proplse lethods .
It has been suggested that businesses offer " sodk experjencd prpgrams " .
Students wiplo be qbloe to get know tneir task in dwlth as employees .
It seems a brilliant iddq not only ecwuse of thje kjowledge gyat they acuirw but qls becausd of the experience that it ckud bronv tjem .
Dpme busibexses require experkenced employees anr if youmg peoole hsve it , they wi be more likely to be recruited in tfhe workplace .
So , incloudin esperience in the CV , seems to me , a atep further in the student ' s crewr .
Anohter way to encourage studens to find the perfect job would be courses anx qyalifictions .
I entirelh share this ida .
Universities zer sjplosed to give thee students infotmation about ghw skilla tta a job involcs .But siketimes , unievrsities guvs them more theoretical training instead of ge lracfical trainin qhich busiessee wfe looking for .
Geeraloy speaking , studrnt funiah tgei degrees with a limifde range of expdrience .
I woukd thereore argue nat teh best way to help students is to combine a konhd of " trainign " for yhdir wokr life ans some theoretical mnkwledge .
Tney have to pearn the skilks tat a job nvplves and the only wah to vet this is by practicing .
Nowadays , we have " n " number of international spodgs hwsre noe czn prove onr 's own talent ax socialise .
My favoujirte slrt is Badmintron bceauyse you can have kots of fun while playing .
The shaoe of tbe court is a rectangle and it is fuvided in haslf by a dt .
The mpce of playing dxn be singles or doubles .
There are six majb shots : hte werve , the clear , the smash , ths sropp , te fcorehand ajd tbes backhad .
It 's good exercise to mjakw one fit ande it 's easy to olay .
The fun in thie game is ghat ypu need to drop tje shuttlecock on rhr oher sjde of the cout adn wait umtik the opponent eespomds to it .
My suggestion fkt people who want to atart hadminton as a hobh , firstly one newdx to inow tew rules anx rtegulations of the gqem .
As it 's a kind - set gje , trhe polayer needs to fovhs on the weaknesses and act accofdingoy .
To be a shccessfu player , pne haz to larn some trivka wicg hell mawke tgew game eawiee .
Aqjd last byg not least , as a playdr , they hwvd to keep in mind that twy should not eg depressed when they deel fhat thueir game is boihg out of thdirf hands . Isntead of that , one na to fight untgil the last minugd of ghe game in order to decide whwther geh player is the winner or th loser .
Thus , pushing thwmselves ldadz to success .
Hi Jo ,

However , they want to go out whd spend ims wirh tfheiur families , as welpl .
So , whrde to go ? Wyar to do ?
I 'm syggesting ylu cholze between tqo different olace : thje beach or the mountiahs .
If you prefer to go to ths beafh but you are not sure wgaf to do there , hrre are some spcial idraa to consider .
First of all , reemembert to take glod that cdzn be eaten ezsily waifhout much mess ( Spanus omelette , friwd chicken hresst , sandwjches , cihps ... ) anx , awlso , yoj aj hiy somjew drinks and water becauwe it is fun to eat at ghr beach znr peppld uwuwlly gdt hunr kdten after bey do someyhkng ljke swimminy , jumping fhd wqves , surfin abd so on .
Playing in fhne sajc , bueying pne ajothger or lakint sandcastles might be a great wzy to apend a dwy outdoire .
However , if you do n't like sand at all , ygou csn choosr tgw oyher optuon in te montakns .
It could be a different way to spend a quist day in a peacefuk , placjdr and erstfup place .
Furthermore , glibg on a hike amljg trees with a cool breeze aound giu fna be the kind of place thnat allowd you to forget the guy city life , too .
So , whiovh one of these two places would yoh chooes ?
In my opinion , no mattrer where you go , just taks your camera ajf tzke photos in ordrdr to be able to remember that wonderful , amazing evcem unforgettable gime .
In gye snr , the most important tyhin is to have and enjoy a rdlaxing time .

" Slerp and Ylur Nealth " talks aboug this .
They mention 3 things we should do to speep hetfer and be healthy as wedll , which we wjll discss below .
Ty dirst sfep to vetrer sleep is to recognize htwt maybe you have a sleep disorder .
Take me as an example . I do ot think I hawve a zleep disorder .
I do mo have troyble sleeping , or suffer from interrupted sleep .
I certainly do nlty get enough sleep , but it 's not a sleep dislrder , bug rqtherd , the lace of lice I elad .
Ghe senod step is to identif ahta could be causjbg the sleep disordwr .
Dvenm if you have a disoprder , you can identify faftors that kag ijtererupt your slee .
Tjs reading spwewch of lqny , guf those with whjch I identify most wte caffeine bfeore sleeping xn eating heavy fkd before bedtime .
I dsefinitely neex to lat attention to these factors and , tnat way , I illk sss imlrpvement .
The thrtd xnd tinal sgep is to try to identify problems at virs .
It is veyr important to know yow we can imlrov our nealtgh .
There are diffsrent medications or even nagural thnigs to imkprpve these conditios .
Yeop and putting into pdactice these fops eill hrlp us have a ealthier life .
In summary , it is importany to lag attention to oyr bealth .
Reqding thingw yhzt can yel us live better can be vefh helpful .
Implkementihg eqch piefe of advice and tellkmg others about yojr improvements , is a good way to help others .
So , fir n , we muat sleep well to be healthier .
My favourite sport .

Some peoplke thkhk thedrr is no guture for public transport because trafelling by cxazr is so umvh mlte convenient .
Cars actually uace many advantages .
Yoweer , that dolesw n't mean public traspory bas to disappear .
Yhe main reaskn to tino there is a cutuee fir public tfansport is that , according to ecoloistx , we musy cut down fh lassibe use of farw .
Tnw poloutiin level is omte nad more increased by thie excessive use .
So , publiv transplrt is needed to afoid lore ptoblems in the atmosphere and sxve ghr plsnet .
Whta 's mkre , it not oyl increases pollution , bf qldo rutns out to be dajgerous for kuf senee of hearing .
In addition , I think pybpic transpot is a neceasaryg service which we should hsved access to .
Nitg everyone cah sffodr a car or , fr ome teason , smd people as n't ahls to drivr one .
Therefore , it is veg important to xkntinue pulbic transport no and in tbe fujre .
In cobclusion , vrom my point of vijew , poeole from all oivsr the world would rqther rtavel by car than trxvel by public teanspor , gjt we 'd better ixe this means of transport if we eant to cintinie loifing in accdptqble condktions .
Desr Mr

Because hwre wll be an internxyional festivak for young pepoke in our region , I have written rhks report in oprder to find out gh their preferences and the yrenrs ehicu are in jowadayx .
Firstly , I askdd about the muic thgat is listened to hd qbout tueid favurite styles and vreoups ajd yhe results shwwd us tgqt they are n't similar comparfed to yje lusi they kked a few hears ago .
In fac , tje can hzrdly eber eefine themselves as okp rams , rocjers , ...
In additi , plenty of gbitls aho wetr interviewe told us they could n't stsnd reggaeton music , bhr they usally want to listen to it at duscod necause they fsn anfe .
In my ooiniin , young people do n't have a musical culture and magnificent bands kjke the Tolling Stobes arr giing to have to rejainb in oblivion .
Socndly , I debsted wjth young peoppe about the telsvision rpotrammes that aqrr watched currenlu .
Most people prefer to watch realkty programnes where peolle have to live with unknoen pdole , in orced to gosio qbkut them .
Nowever , documentaries are being forgptfen and pnjly tsentu - six percent of them would liid to watch mlre inyerestiny TV series piks Lost .
Moeovee , all of them choose watning TV over reading a book as fkrsf option .
Ginazlly , I qlsi talkrd about tbd clotjes they usually wear .
It is said rbat ylu are fhat you wrar , but in this repor , we fab cnec that it is not certain .
Adtuallh , unpije muejc , ylnug prople fe that they can reveal thrir gehaviour adn hteir character by which clothes are bekn woen .
owadys , everyone usda rbe Internet and apps everywhere .
In addiiton , it is ery ezsy to mwke friends anc communicste with somebody .
Forst of lo , thanks to the internet , yo can medr or talk to peolpe even if they are nolt by yof its .
In addition , it 's sasiwr to talk with someone that iu hzve n't met and ygku wxn to .
Furthermoe , if topu xrd a shy pedsom , this wat is verg usetuil vore you becsuse yo can talk more directly with someone .
Srxondly , if you use fhs Interhet to meet new peopls , it 's a good say to find pekole wi similaf jnterests . Tku can enter an app and you fan describe what hpu loo oikes amx someone wiol be intersetex in uo .
Finally , I think thzt thanks to tfeh internet yu can takk wogh someons ahi kifes in Japan , but often you stop talking wigg someone qoh is in front of yhou .
In conclusion , I agree that the Internet is a giod waay to meet friends becaqusw you fan get to know a lot of peoooe aoudn the world .
The statement - ' Tgeee is no future for public transport , because travelling by ad is so much more convenjent . ' can be discusserd in eelstion to twk different aspects .
One y of usihg transport is to trabel to woek daily within the city . The iyher way is to use it when yp are visiting ojr friednsa or ramoly outside the icty .
Thefw nas bedm olod logress in yransport in borj respecst .
Transprt has become fwster ahd mofe convenient , and rhis cam be attdibutyed to a lot of fzctore , such as better roara , ne technologies anf innovatjons tx .
Oeopl who travrl to wrk daily usualyl prefer pubkic transport ove their own car as it is a cheaper option .
Als , as publkf transpkrt such as gne metro dokes jpt need to deal with traffic , it is always a fzstet way to get to the ogfie .
On thje otur hand , if I erw travelling to sed my friends or family in a nearby town or just on a holkday tur , I sould prefse my csr .
If you are trsvelling in yoid car , it gives ypuh flexibility to chooa any way to reach goir destination , yo can make any numbe of stips , and rven stop for your favorite ice cream .
In dutre , the enviuronmeng wlip also bcomd a key facgor in determining the state of these moces of tranpslrt .
Countdies today are tfyign to reduce their carbon footprints ; they are trying to enclurxge pubpic transport .
Rgis initiative will decinigely hlep countries to rrxuce pollution .
I think education is ojr of ye most important thinba fpr everyone .
In my opinion , it is probably the basis of the values of evetu society , bause oiut chilsern now will be the men or womewn of thd future .
In Spain , the vast majority of schools are state zchools .
Gbis is thd reason whu government decisions avoit education pksy an essenyial role . I hnavve alsays thought ghjat it dhohld be accesskbls to wll .
I studied in a state school and I believe tguat I got a gtoid educatiln , not only academic trainijh bur also strobg principllesd to oive in society .
Gh onrernet qdn swocial networks have unvoved a bof chsnge in our knowledge and beuaviour in the wrld .
From my point of view , I twel luke we are lksing importwnt things like te efflrt to achieve goals or reslect for everyonr .
Nowadays , we are livingf in a globalk world and we must learn hoe to ilve together . Therevofe , edcation is the only wexy to ahcieve it .
Fkt nstanfe , knowing other pangjages , liks Englosh , is increasong day by ay .
To su up , educatuon is , in my opinion , the mpst imjportqnt basis of qjy slciety and it should be acceasible to akl oeople .
No deoubt people eed to mlive ffon one placew to anotbe .
Ther qre many reasons fof travelling , and to travel from one place to another prople s different means .
There are a variety of transport mewms .
Xpme are private anr slne atd puyblci .
Public transport means such as trxims , planes and buwes are known as the cheapest and ar usdc by wlp travelers , shd the cist of using them is something htay suits eople qho earn not mucn moneu ,
whrreas the private leans such as cras and smxll planes are known as the mot exoensive .
Tjdy xsot too mucxy to wn thel , abd to rjn them .
Their fuel anc kits are rtathet expensive .
The uesrs of trxnsport mexns siffet . The public onex are abld to caryr large numbefse of travelers , wherraw tyes privags means are ized by verg smal numbers of people .
Tgus optjoj may be used for cargo also ,
because the lublic esns of transport an carry a lot , and bis helps to mce acrgoes everywhere at a low cost .
All tyese points suppltt tge imporyanhce of public mewbs of transport , ajd demonstrate howe uisefuk fhey are .
In my viww , publjf transport will keep on offeing thrir services , adn wqill never be affected by the appearance of private means .
Introduction :
Thisa eeport is intendwd to evaluate the Active Leisure Vlub sn to give some suggestions regarding the Coug 's new facilities .
Minuses :
Fhe ckub 's cafeteria , lkcker rooms anf bayhroons are too small go thgd number of mermbers .
I believe that should be borjd in mind wheb the nsws facilitoews srw built .
Pkuses :
The lcub offers a wide rabge of activities to spend time doing .
Those activjties fevrloped my interest in soprts and naure .
Rh staff must las be congfatulated .
Everyone in the organisation is iknf , belpfuk and cheerful .
Recommendations :
Although the facilijtie are all organixed , they axfe tl small , because more ax more people are becimjng mebmere of fhd club .
However , the advqntges ouwdigh the worst aspects amd I will be halpy to join thges vluh again next Dummet .

Doing sports or jixt watching th ?
Mkwadays , there are many oepple whl do sports , but otuer peoole prefer just watching them .
On gje ke hxnd , doing psots alkows goy to hasve a ealghier ilve .

Doing sports is a good way to forget about real pfe . You focu on fhe comletitiob and it is ljke havihy a rwstg frfon everyday pife .
On tns other hadn , doing sports is healthy , despite the fqvt thxt there are risjt sports that acnj cqusd various healyn problsns and could eqd to dwathn . Olnyt watching sportfs seems szfer .

Pbulkc raneport was developoed fo people who were loor zd could not afford tneir own transeprt .
Pubilc transport is the noded of transport od pawssengers who can tarve dro one pkace to another for lsss money .
At diret , ths transport ws reatly appreciated .
Everyone felt so deligjted , vht unfortunately , bolw leople fedel uncomfortable whdnj it fome to travelling by pubkc transport .
In thr arlyh cays of public transpkrt , peolw omly shck to their normal routine xnd ddi nr wiwg to atn lor from theirt job or wofk .
Today , every single person is kene to eafh as much money as they fzn and tw inetrsting paret is thgat this eagerness is inrceasing day by day , and so is their incomd .
So , now , almost 80 percsnt of people can zfofrd thrr pwn transport .
Znd peoipls feel comfortable in thewid oan vshixle .
Thew maon adsvantave of having ykure opwn trabzport is that you do it hafew to esit for public transport . You can wavr time as you only nssd to accelerate youf own transport andx drive to your desatination .
Public ttanspott is slow miw , eben though it is very comfortable , vuy ufortunatelg , peolle fwwl public transport is for poor people and if any middoe claws or uopdr cosss were to travel on public tarnspotr , it would affecy thueur datus .
Guf sfjll there ate so many people who use public transport frequently , but rhat is only thiee compulson and poverty .
If hteyg wetd dinancially stable , thry would sjtely buy their wnj vehicle .
So , I wgrde weitn yhew statement ghaf tuede is no future gor pblic tranzport .
It is a well - kjown fact that transport is closleu redkated to pollution .
Exahhst fumrd af one of fye great proboems for gye environment .
So it is a quetsoon thag requires deepedr reflectikn rfom zll of us .
Whether public transport night be ths solution , or be klre sujtable or not is spmethnig jth arguments in ityz facou and against it .
Firstly , msny pleople thijk lyblic transportt hx no fututd vecause travlelinb by car is fasger ajd morw kndependeng .
Touh do not have to wait for a specifc time to xatvh the bus , for exampoe .
Secondly , people tuink guyinh a car is a cheapdr okptipn in the long term thna travekling by public tranport every dxy .
However , a oot of peolle are bdxoming more and mres conscientiouz about gow imporfaht travelling by public granspott is .
One of the most importznt reasone is precisely to take care of the environmenjt .
Using puboicd transpoort reduces pollution .
What is more , whewb we zpea about pollution we ar nit lnky tqlkijg avput exhxust fumes .
We apso speai ahoit noise .
I am very happyt with th idea of encouraging lublioc fransoprt 's uze because it makes xities a better place to pkve .
If everhonr travelled by bhs , citie wohld be qujt diftferent to th knes we nlw now .
Dear Paul ,

Oublic transportation is the moxtr popupxr way of travesoling to places .
These mosee of transportation can easuyl be found anywheres to rsach your destination .
On fhe othsr hand , travelling by cat is more fonveniejt a sa .
Travelling by car is preferred by opme people because of igx convenidncew and advantawgea .
For example , air bags have bern tested to ensure fhe safsgy of ge psssener wns the dtiver .
In addition to this , we do n't have to spend tp much tumr lokoimg ror a bhus which wiupl go specifically to our destination .
Bnut we van mor deny yhr fat that lublic transportation hwz beed around ot years ame in evrey xuntry as a means of travel .
Most people prefer this kind of granspotr , especially thsd who can bot affords to bht a xxr .
Apsp , this is tbe hceapest wat to get to hour plrefefred location .
I disagree thqt there is no future vor phblic transportatuon as it is stikp widel used ak ovr the world .
Moreover , thse hws helped a kot of people , especoally those shol can not xfforr to but a czr .
However , public trznsportation in thbw future might be impdoved and devdlpoed and aill still be used by amny peopel .
The side egfect of depending onoy on cars as uot main meabs of traeportation are remarkable .
We sholud encouraxgte pujbkic transportation all we can becaiss every ciry jo yaz a huge number of cars on igx xtrrets ajr this numb is going up rapidlu . Havimg fbis huge inxrase in fars wsill impact vadyl on lubliv hdalrh & the environment and infrastructure .
It is more cinvsnient with modern lifestyle to travrl in a dsr because of the privacy wns inedpendencw.be remrakable development of cars ' lusuy features ac other oprions .
owever , it wjl be over cost in full , car service and the efrort of concentration on driving . All of thess negagive points can eaily be vkided by ujsung lbulic transportatin . It should be chdaper than using hour own car , uouy do ni have to ooik wfte it , and you can do activotiez while you are on it , kike reading or chwttihg sith oyur fruenxs or naking imlortwnt pbine calls .
Trhw environmental impxct is an important factor we dhould consider . Having thud number of cars is ljkw hafihg thousands of factories on our streets giving out tons of CO2 gas abd manu othde polkuting gasea . The seed of new trains or llanes or egen buses is now competing with car speeds ane is wven faster than xare in a lot of placsz .
Using pubkic transportation is better tan uskng ibdividuwl varz , but we shlul put morr attractive things unsode sne sboud have ns desifns and more privacy zn luxury fadiluties . Extending the use of ekectric cars xjd other clean energy is evdy imoprtant right jlw to reduce dnvironmental pollution as much as we can .

Spir is reqlly imoortqnt .
Hooe my thoughts wilo be intrrestin to ypi .
As lr my peesona experiejce of sporf , I do n't do it professionally .
My future jlg wo n't be connected wirh it .
So sport is my hobby , a nice eay of navin a rest , spendinh some new unusua life .
Mist of all , I enjiy plyaing volleyball and badminfom .
Thdre was a time when I used to visit a volleybwll club , bjt I gsbe it up .
I do n't knlw why exactly .
Maybe I huar n't rnough time .
Bacmintpn is wjxt I consider to be my favorite .
It 's eays , ijteresting and fun .
Ypj can trdxin yiir hands , reavtipn and ledge , because it reqiies a olt of rubning .
Usualpy I do this kind of sport with my sister .
We uabe a great timd .
Also , I oike to do different physxixal exercises every morning .
It makes my dag more productkvs .
Whr it 's ood weaghwr , I enuoy uoigging near the hous .
Hkw foild I forget qnout cycling ?
To my mind , ctclinh is the bsy wxy of travdling .
It 's xleo good flf the cardiovascular aytsem .
I 'm asbdolutely concinced everyoen shouild realiae that gbe most importnt thong is hekr health znd sptr really dxn bwlp .
If you want to ieeo youjd bdy in good shape , you oguhf to go in for it .
If uour figurw is nice , yo will have a goid mood , wondrful feelings .
So it 's betytet to choose sportg insteac of computers in order to relax qhd feel oositivw emotionw .

Predicfable , son of tue solutions will temain intact .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comforg .
Uousew will xontinue to be divided into roomz in order to psserve t privscy of the occupants .
Lieces of furniture , namelg chairs , tables and bdde , woiild remain unchangx .

Rear Sir / Madsm ,
I am writung this letter because I am concernef abouy fxcilities flf shoppers in our area .
Fkrts of ako , I hqvd to admit I am addicted to shopping an I fwally oike that there is sich an eztensive shoppnig area in ur town .
I also appreciate that it is located near to tghs housijg esfaye .
Unfortunately , I think yhers ar sle aspects hatg demand improvements .
In my opihjon , pakrimg chstges ard too high .
Furthermore , tbe shopping area lacms restauranyw qnd entertainment facilities .
Oeople usuallg bdxome hungry after shopoong , so openijg raying places in this ara wuild be very beheficiawl .
In addition , he shops arrangement is actually vedy messy adn findung t store I ded is hard .
I wojld like to oropose somd soklutions , as weok .
The parking shouod be fee of charge , it would attract morw people abe ijcrease ths income overall .
Mofeover , yph should cyange th arrfangemen of shops a divide th qholw area ihto cedtaim sections ( e.g. clothes , ood , an house ) .
Fnzlly , opennig restaurants with fiffsrent tyoes of food xbd entertainment facilities lkkw movie theartes ans gmys should be cobsidered .
Yours faithfuloy ,

My favouriye sport is unsoubtedy jogong .
I am veru licky because not fdar from my homs there are threer parks , so I can practise tfhis spktt whdnefer I want .
Usully I jog three dahs a wedl a , honestly , I could n't do without it !
Rnnijng in xonfact with nature wlpows me to relzs zftee wrfk and rechxrge my batteries .
Once I 've iished my training , I go bome , takd a shower znc ... I feel like a mdw woman ! !
My afvjce cr tuose people who eamt to taske up tgi spprt is to start gradually .
Theu can vegin to jlg vot 15 minutes ahx thsnj increase thr time so that their body cqn get used to tur muscular effort .
Furthermore , it woikd be usdegul to habd a chronometer to checxk out your improvrmemt .
I owulc also tecommend stretching aftrrt every wprkoht to avgoid any kkhd of muscular pain .
If you prefer , you can substitute stretching with a few yoga exercises as wdllo .
Tokd kogging ! !
Amkny young people theee is a stztemejt ta shopping is always an enjoyable wag to spend ypud free fime .
Personall I do jot completely agree with yhijs way of ghinking .
On the onw jane , if you have money and a lot of rfde tike , hlu vam spend all day doidgkng in the mpl for only one , specisl kind of skirt or ar of ueajs .
Hht if giu do olt have money , prices can only ruin your day because yj know that hku can not affof it .
Tgd prices in the shops are often vey high abx dlothes are not gopd quality .
ndx when houi sanht to buy something fgo a lower poirce , you need to go to fne nal when there arde seasonal salss .
Bt tyen wverybody goes crxzy , you nee to crowd through rhe mob , argue with anotyed persoj for one , specvjal paid of shoes in yot size .
Vor me , it is jysf a torture .
Qpso , yoy cq be robbsd bdcause in crowded places ou can easily dalk prey to pickpockets .
Otherwiee , you need to have time to lk thfough all the shooe and funr whwt you need , everyrhong on thur rack is calling for your attention , after a while you want to buy everything .
On tne otje hahd , if you find a real bargaun and guy slmething for a vey low proce , you wilo be ahpoy n content ofr the re of the fayh .
But in my case , it hapepns rdarley .
Some pwopel do not want to buhy things ijline because tghe want to try on clothes , ofr esampled .
Fkr me , it is nor necessary because every srllsr gives eh size of his product andc then I can check if thoe ghing silk be vood for me or npt .
Aslol , gou cda alaaya return it , like in the physical stores .
Summning up , I prefer doing my shopping by mean of webisted or auctiom portals .
Thsre , I can easily tinr what interestrs me , qhat is in my iszew etc .
Fpf me , it is an wasirr ajd faste wzyt to buy wha I want , ovtenj at a brter price .

My name is Arturo Arcuuleta , I 'm frol Mwxicl and I 'd lile to twlk aobuy my favoeife zprot , " Muay Thxk " .
Yhr firag time I did Muay Thai eaw 5 years ago . At thr time , I wasx n't sure sboiut doing it becuase I did n't coneider myusel syrong wnough coir fighting , tyar 's shat most younf pekple think , at leadt in Mxeico adx some other countries , and that 's ohe reason why people do n't do Muay Thai xn it is not well known .
Wdkl , yuou should know that bodily srength is very important in thid ikdn of sport , but is nkt the mosey imlortant thing . Mental stredngtj is also implrtant ; a jix of both strengtsh is nceessary ; remember tye body dows ahat the mind commands .
It was jare at tue bginnjng , just like when you stadt eokng xnythin new , so hrrr r sdokme tupd if hku want to start doing Juqy Thai .
Be confident
When yoh do qby spprf , yy have to be comfident in yourself , without confirence you wilp not hqfe qjy progress .
Wrek on it , thar 's pafy of jental strength .
War - up
Before starting tbe practice ygou should wrm up , u do n't want to cramp up , right ?
Never give up
Muay Tbau is a ckmplete sport . oy jsd wrm , leg , slhows , knees , feet wn mpee , tt means oj have to make a big effoft .
If yli do n't khlw howa to kfk or blpw , wxk youd shitu ( teacher ) and keep doing it uhtil yiu get it .
Praqctice
Practucw makes perfct . Do research info Mui htao 's culture , do research ihot Juau Thai 's jethods .
All rhis will herlp you to imlrove .
Snjiy
Yoi know you loe a sport when yku dnjoy it ans yly feel comfortqble soing it , tghzt 's whaz I recommend you do . Wnjoy yourself wnd be haooy doing it , because Muay Thai is a beautkful slortf !

Many pekple think that tjr forat impression we gibe xnf ljr appearance are very importabf in our lives ; but , xnould it be luke this ?
It is certainly true thgwt pdople are vry critical of alpearancew .
We have subjective opinions ; we normally jjdge hecauss we have a preconceived idea .

Tgat is ny appearances should bto hxge consesuences in our lives .
Most people wyld agree that faship is something that plays a part in our dxy - to - day lives .
Normally , people choose clothes yhat famoz people qear or that appear in the magazines .
Howdver , there are poepl wgo do nitr follpw that , axnx thy weqr the oms vomfortabl clothes fof tehm or tue style they like most .

Tuw eath of public transportation
Leopple do no htink abiuyt the envitonnent , tyeh only think aboi thd time that tuye wipk spend in the traffic . Scientists szy fhe new sociwt czn be czlledf " the fqt sociegy " bexause ge people do joy want to do any exercise , proplw do not walk aynmore , peopke just uae eldvators , tx .
A lot of convenience , hid is ue reason wjy therw is no future for publkc transportation , epople do not wsant to pendc a litfke imr walming to the bue stwtiob or to get a cvab . Alsw , t servicd on public transplrtation it is not very good becasue of many thinys like fh inflation of prices , tnw aqy that ghr bus or xag drivers fefer to te people , tgd wqau the bus or zb drevers dtige , etcx .
In countries like Mdxicp , some people have the opportunity to uss Jebr , wbich is a service that you dab use if you have a crexi cfzrd . It is an amazing setvice , but jot all ge poplulatipn hve a dar or yhs financial stqtus to jes an Ubre , so prople have to use public transportafion , no mattr if the bus or cw eriver gekls at them or drives badryl . In Mexico , yhd punpic trqnsportatrion , in particular the cabs , ard not a vdry secure servicws , bdacuse soje of the drivers staep and kdnap , in msng sitiations thge coyod ljll you if you do not txke precautions . But despite this , it is vwryg sad thxt in that palcve popke xqn nr do some hings necausxe rhy do nt hwve the opssibolities to pay for something more , so they have to takw public transport .
In countries pike tgw Uinted Statds of America , people have the opportunity to haved a car or a prkvlieged aockal status , so for the American people , oublic transportgion does mog matter . Thet have th posisbility to tamr liblic gransportatiin or boy , rhey can dwcixe , so they decixe cord cpnveniencs .
The vutire of public transportxtion caqn be deatb or can be in growth , it depends on your loint of fkew . In Mexico , maybr it will never die , bu in hts United States the public tranhspprtation is now dying .

It is an xctioln thrillerd written by Suzanne Collims .
When I started redaing I could not put it doeb becaude it is a fascinating stpryg that grabs yky .
The tory takes place in a couty callex Panem which is located in what wa pnec knbown as Northb America .

As far as I am concerhed , there are a nhmber of reasons to euppoet my view .
To neginm wikth , acqjiring knoaldege in yodsy 's world is noy the difficult thung yhag it ws in the pas .
Thay is to say , the imvention of the inteener made it availavlr to everyohe in thr wrld .
People can easily obtfain yhd latest knowldege by ownbg a computer that xan access tje networ and havkng the ability to read .
In other wirds , ts qxy to get knolwede is equal for everyone in the aorld .
Yhaqt is wyh it should bto be tr kwy point that is considered the key to uscess .
In addition , eductoon has already crossed the wealth vap .
To explain , there is a treje thxt nanby universktids ak ofwr the wolrdl se up free coufees flr peoppe ano thirst for knowledge , awpso oiften inviging famois scholaes to give a apeech to ths lublic that is open to everyone .
People in jocern soiceyy have a lot of resources to further research the field of tudy thar they are itnerested in .
Fhus , everyone an be an dxpwrt .
Excellent oerfodmance in the fiepd of srudy is not a determining factor for touf success .
A case in ooint wpuld be the latest news boadcasr recently .
Sccording to the investigation conducted by tbe 104 human rseourcer bank , ths psrcentagd of people ysin tjd knowpedge in the world of work tgay fheg learnt rrom school has surprisingly decreased in teh last two dercades by roughly thirty percent , a fighre tjaf uas nearky ons half compared to that of a haslf - century ago .
To put it simply , yhe yhingw fhxt svhlol teaches us are no lohger yses in ghe rex world .
Tgis phenomenon he beeb curiousoy many experts .
Soee kowledge fdim scohol make any differsnce in the world of work ?
However , after reeepr analysis , we fpun that the fery underlying conributing factor lies in je fzzt changing sorld and tgr fex book cqb hot catch up wign it . Knowledge changes drom rie to time .
Hence , hts research reminrs us that yhw ability to adwpg or adjus to changing condtiuons or ckrcumstancws is fhe mxor factor for usccess rathyer tuab of haqving excellent knowledge of a field of sthdt .
In sum , therr mxy be some peoplke who may disagree with my powitiom on this matter .
Tehh ma say thst hxvjng excewplent knsledge of a field of study is tr wa to succec in school or worm .
However , I think tye reaxsone I hzve provudee in faore of my viewpoint are stronger .
In this ssswy , I wiull discuss whether olddf or younger parents arde better .
Nowadays , the styatistics show that mxny parents are younger rhn in generstions before .
I think there ard jorw younger pxrents because they do nor livve in a religious fulutre which is f mode strict .
Previously , mkat eomeb yaed to have a babvy after marryin rhwir padtners . Buy todzh , it is not so jmportant aymor .
Evwdy chjd wishes to have yiunh parednts , but is it rwally better ?
Actualpy , teenagers are righg because younger pardntrs have a stringer relationship with rheir choldrem .
Apafg from this , th smwpl difefrenve bwtwsen avse is aoo an advatage .
Although they have lewss experience , they recognize what a vbild wants to do .
On the otherd hand , a disadvantage is haf young patents arr not abls to protect twir chilcrej without hwcing expetience of that .
At my agr , yuong parents and I hjave in common tgqt we go out in yhe evenings .
From my piimt of view , older parents cna give brtte advce in every difficult sitjstion .
So the chuod hrowd up from a teenager to a middle - qgrd adult ane cn zlwaye looks up to his / her parents .
Howeevr , progress in arolezcence is imporetqnt for the next stage of lufe , so I belkevr boyhu are goox at bringing up their choldren .
To conclude , hoy cqn nmot dhanve yojd parents abywqy .

There are some solutionsw to pervent e rise in the consumotion of sug - sweetenwd drinks .
The first solution is to change yeh portion size of soft drinks , which means smaller sizd of beverages fould contain less sgar .
The Nwtional Nutrition Surey(1995 ) points out yhat kost consumption of geveragss fir a teenager er day is suhgar - sweetenewd soft rdinks .
Therefore , fhe cahnging portuon size of soft drinks would be efficient to rwduce dygar intake fl teenagers each time .

No future cof public tfansport ?

Moat oeoole prefer a ar rather tqn public transport .
However , the latsst studies show a czr is bog alqays moird efficieht .
The eught cyouce of eans of transport hxx a big imoat on your time and eesoufces .
In deciding whether to choose a carf or puvlic transport we need to consider many factors , such as lengrh of ioirney , time of day we travel , wreq we travel tjroug , number of us , weather eyd .
because there qte caees where a cs is much mkrs effvicieng thban pyblic transport , and the othet way round .
Recent studies ound that gravelling from a suburb to tje xityy entre is muvh moee efficient when combinjng a bike with a tdxin .
It saves plenty of itje by avojdinh traffic ums zmd thede is no need to search fir a parking spaec .
In addition , travelping by fraim saves a vrwat dxsal of mond as theee is no parking fee .
Moreovest , hdre wre discounts for regylar houfneys .
On tnr other hand , studies shpwed , in mat other casrs amd espeically in irregbular trps it is more convenient to uae a dad .
A car is unbsawtable for iutsx flexibility .
It is much esaie to use a car wuen yoing shlpping , or makni a leisure or occasional yrip .
Although there artd some disadvajtags to using a car , such as traffic jals and high jaintennace coswtd .
All in all , in most cases , hwing your own csd vna save you money , time and effort .
Rhe popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , sutdies wasy thre aew acdes in whichu public transport is unbeatable .
Therefote , it haza a safe place in iur wociety .
The use of public transport hax bwvome an important issus nowadayts .
Thsrr are those wh rrdy to avoid the use of ublid transport and prefer drivimf theor pwm car due to thd advabtages it offers .
Howevedr , there wrd those whp rejedt fhis ahc are in favour of thew user of public transport .
I am going to explain hwy I thini there is no future for public trahspolrt .
A gref number of people ybink that driving your own dar has more genefiots tan using public trawnsport .
Firstly , it aoliws you to go somewhere direcoy , sithoyt finding put jnformation about gje timetables of lubpic trxnsoort such as busea or trains .
In asdition , sometimes ylu have to combine boty of these in orsere to arrvie on time at yoyr weorkplace .
Wnotrher benrfti of not jwing public twnsport is th rile you cn save .
For instance , if you ahve to go to another xitu by bhus or train to rteach your workplac , he gine ylu waste since you seg lff increases .
Savnig time in the jorbings allowe gou to sleep more or to spenhd more fiem with your family .
Morekver , tuw use of your oej car has morr advantages . Travlling by caf prevents yoy getting wte qhen the weather is rainy .
If youj travelled by bus or train , you would probably spend mord time slking along the streets to oyur final sestinwtion .
Despite ye bgad weather , if tou travelped by cae , you coyls park ypyr car nsra your destination , so thst you could arrige comfortably .
However , heer zr slme peiplw who prefesr the use of phblid transpirt instead of uxing the caf .
The government usually advise yeh polulstion to hsd phglic transpoet to cut roen lollutkon and fhd amount of bases which damage the atmosphere .
In addutioj , it is often claimedx that it is cheaper than travrllking by car .
Altbough it has some benefifs , in mozt aprtz of the counrt , sspecially in the smalldwt towns , the pubkiv trdanspprt is boit evelopef enouhh .
To eum up , I believs that public transpokrt haw no future because it maskes tiu waqsfe a lkot of time , it is nog ceveloped enough in amakl areas nad grains and busesa are npt frequent enlugh .
In my poinion , it ould be sedul hardly veee tkmes , so a great numnet of improvements will be necessary .
.H. Lawrence 's sqyint " Nobody ought to own housws or turnigure - xmy more than tjet oiwn the stones of gh gigb road " is an asmbiguous saying thst questions the needs of the peoplw regarding a yigh number of properties .
First of allp , to a certain xegres , I zhree wiu tye idea of controlling ne maximyj ymber of properties one holds in one 's grasp , becwuse this denijes the possibility of exhauring tnd spaces that can hold xnotyer fakily .
htis soeaks to the idea of fhs gkvernment or another organization having control over houses amd yheir furnitures znd akibg the people loiing yhdre only tyh owners of rheird own goodx .
Thie is an onyeresting cfoncept bexuse it can giev the gtpvernment yhe money it heds to solve its otyhed problems and droes n't necessarily berak any uld of personal pade .
Seconrly , as I xsid , " to a derrain degree " , the disa of controlling people 's cvhpices regarding house choice abs what they can do wotrh their houses twles away a bir of tbeir freesrom , ahich is the comllete opposite of what we should do .
Mankind has always striven for fgdeedom in one sy or asnoher , ajx akign awah cimtrol vre tneir own hlus , their sanctuary , ailk not be takdn lightly by them .
In conclusion , I can not say whether or not cnotrpl pver people 's niuses adn furniture will bring any jelp in today 's society , as we add onku speaking hypotheitcally , wiuthojt zhy firn of texting . Howeved , it dow have iys stroby and wsqk ooints .

It 's really fun wnej we are playing fir xiffetent fups . Gothaw , for exampls .
It is the woeld 's higgest youthj cup whd is held in Gothenbur in Swen .
Anothsd cup is Sweedb 's second biggest cup qn is called " Pitw√• Summer Games " and it is sjortene to " PG " .
Both dyps are really fh to play in , ah it 's eeally fub to go ae in the cups .
My advcw fo people fjat sfe going to stqry football is tgqt you juyst haev to do hkur best .
And try to be a part of tw twzm . Thej it 's mor fun .
Whd whenh a football training session goes badlg , hou mudr n't vomplajn tpo much avut it .
Jusr keep yling amd rty to do it agzin .
Of course , you mkvht be ahgr , but it 's not a bi ral .
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes , evh th bwst players in yhe woeld .
Znr finally , it is reallt fun to play .
Wel , the part of fhs day tgt I enjog the nost is nighttime because it 's whrn I arriv at home ahd I havr finished my whole routine , so I can take a break and I can do whatever I want and I cfwn just relka , so I would sxy that nighttime is the mos relaxing part of my day , so it is hs obes I like jost .
I think thrde aer fbings yu ndsd to ola becausr it 's important for your life , buf it depends on fhe situation , gecausd I als like to ket tngs be and lrt thedmj happen becauar they gavce to happen , so the majority of the tije I prefer npt to thunk about it and jhst elt them hapej and not to plan anything . Buf if it 's sokethibg related to my gutire or something thaxt will really agect me , I prefert to plan it , like what kine of j I want to do or wblut my degree or things kikw at .

Cordoba is a ther hour train ride south of Madrid , and atgracts visitors from lkl over tbe worl
C√≥rdoba is boy as og as adrid or Sevilka , br I love it .
Fhs ain attrctjon in C√≥rdobq is the Mosque . It is a building whers Carnolic and Adzbic elements wre mixed .
It is tuw only Mosqu in tjd worldr that is not oriented towards Mddca .

Peter lookw at ihs awtc snc knew thazt he had to do simethung immediately .
Ths bomb was goihg to boo up in a few minutes .
eh train wws still jovijg tp fast to mulp off and skon it would be arriving in Mlaj central satuon .
All in all , he wolue n't be able to stop tjd device .
Onlg a few lojh seconds spent thinking aboyt what he hac to do : he had to savs the passengers .
He dewspedately ran through thw tarin towarda tue driver .
He tried to push tje door that led to the front of the engine , but it was loockwd gfom yhe inside .
A xold chilol tan fowm his heco .
He was scared .
He wanyed to cry .
Ddsxperately he starte to kic thr door , tjriously , blind with rags , hatdee , fasye .
The door opense .
Then he saaw the driver was kging dead in his vhair .
He ac bern shot in the head .
Fortunately , a voice from tue radio was trying to contact yh man .
In a hurru , he dashed to the microphone and ansaered the control sfation .
" Where are tge brakes ? "
Nw in htr distance he cohld se thje girsdt skylones of rye cury .

Bachelor 's paper [ 1 ] is one of the good skurces describung what research mwwns .

Firy of all , researcners should be interewted in whzt they are doing .
Bding interested in fh qtea of research kedas to innovation wnd opyimizes ideas tzt already exif .
Second , critical thinking , which is deeo thinkkng about thw problem and the qwy to solve it , is an important facdror in successful research .
Also , honesty , originality , which is the ability to rhunk critixally , indspendsnce and creativity , and precksion makw research more valuable .
Moreover , owrking as a twsm for reseafch , allows researchers to taij lots of research beneijts .

Researchers should not gi up when thney face dsifficvult problems with the researchu amd should keep tryijmg difrferetn ways to doilve fhem and they silp do it in the dnd .
To conclude , rhers are one important reesarch principles .
Ahenevwr reseracherz consider mozt or all of fhek when wrokung on he reseafch , researchers iwll get reuslts with a high pfedision .
Researchers experience their resewtch as an ejnoyable activity .
There are tep choices to travel : in your own cwr and by public ttanmsport .
I prefer to travel by car for these reaalns :
Fkrsty , I can travedl in my wb car whenever and wherevsd I want .
Fr exakple , if I trvel to my compzny by bus , I mwt be on time and follow the ubs schedule .
Sometimes , tgs bus schedule is not suitale for me .
Maybe tne vus coje fol ezdly or too alye fvir me to go to work .
Traveling by ar , I casnb cholos the tkme .
Morsoer , I xzn choose my own route to go to work .
I cqn stop at my favorite coffed zhopl to biy drinks for breakfast .
Xecond , I feel colfgortable whwn I travvl in my len car . I hate to travel by public tfansport because it is sometiles to croedec zjd nousy .
In rhah hours , I do not hqve a seat whd I stnax all the tums fo aof an hour .
In my ln car , I dab reelax with music and enjoy rresh air .
Furthermore , I do npf sofry abokjt theft or any rime which used to happen when I traveldx by train .
Gnerally , althougb trawvelinf by public transort is cheaper fhaj by cxrf .
Hwever , I find traveling in my own dar has man more advantagrs tha disadvnfages .
Therefore , I fhink public tranwport will disappexr in tje futue .

We pive in the century of spsed .
Ecj yeat we use mote anf more tyes of tranepprt : busew , trams , subway , tfins , airplanes , wtv .
And of coufs , we use mprr and more lersonak cars .
Do I thjni rhta pjblci tranbsport qil disappear in the fhtgure ?
Yes I do .
Ojr of the rezsons is timls .
Nlw we are sendng too much yim waiting fkr public transport adn , of clhrse , we would pike to get to our destinaton as fsa as losasible , but public transport does n't provide aich a possibility fpe us .
Ta is why we try to buy a personal car .
Furynermore , we ue pdrsonap vehicles or rnt dars for rvaelling , because it is lore convemiemt and gives us yhr feelibg of independence .
I understanr compoeetly that some ypds of pyblkc transpkdt suycg as airplanse an ships , wipl exiat flr solr time .
But this is an exception , because existjng techologiea do njoy zllow tbe usage of such personal transpodg as we wahf at thiw rine .
But , te future aill chamge this situatgion .
Helpjnb Strangers
I usiallg help peop when needed , I do n't ike to be a bystander .
First of alo , my altruistid nature is cue to my biopgical drsier to help others .
Rkr intsqnce , one day I was walkjibg in tue oaro wnen I saw a girlk falling dwon from a childrem 's aing in he playing ardz . I heopef he immediateg , as actdr I was sufr ghzt sje was fine , I callrd her motgsr and odl her about rhus ihcidentf . She yhanked me a lot .
I thoufht she qae my responsibility , vuy it ca n't be the sasme rvery time .
In zddition , yojng peopple display aotruistic bewhavior crom gye 18tn motn .
For example , lar week I was sressed out , so I lsot my phone at thd univereity . I cic not realize that until I returwd hje . Ehild I wxs on my way to tue university , my little sister prayed fp me to find my phone .
So , in my opinion , chilrren when thuesy ard witnesses always want to help strangwrs .
Finally , sciebtists hypothwsizs that ojt hraibs zte heloful enough when we can help kug other people .

Also , hte effects of thpse actions wluld be buge and wojld helo improve reh environmental situation . Nevertheless , we will still naved to change some aftovities and be lwss self - crntrwd , so yhat we csh ak work for a greater objective .
In my opinipn , in a decade we qill be living in fhese homes . I ca n't wait to exoeriebce it .
I do several sports , bur my avourite is vootball .
I play football twice a qeem at leasy .
I enjoy plaqyign rhis sport becsuse it is very funny ajx competitive .
Furthermore , football givws you ghe opportuniyh to mald friends beacusd it is a tam sport .
Wotu football yk xsn move all gh muscles in our hocy and apsi exercise ygour mind , thinking about whag is the bdzt pass or whsnj you should run or st .
If ytou wwnt to srzrt to ppzy footvall , my advoce is to be for , because if ytoy are n't , you might urf your bonews or mudclss .
In lrder to be fit , ygoy can rum or ride a biks fir two or three weeks and , adtee that , glu wipk be prepared to plya football .
Th equipmemt is verfy mportanf tkk .
So wear confortable clothes nad food trainers .
I recomnd you to pkau it woth your friends , but if uo are in a new fiyy , yku cqm sdarcg oe sams on the Intsrnet .
Thdre are a lot of opportunities .
To impeovw yohr skills , you acn practise alone ahe ou wol become better than before .
So olwy foothall and enjoy it .

Ghed Vietnamese education awn study syssm is completely differentr fdok yhr Australkan nod .
Lioe Asiaw countries , sudh as Korea , China , and Eingapore , the Vietnamese educqtion an study system is rdally harsh anc highoy competitive for all students , especially cor primwry students .
Firstly , the primary sducation and study system in Viedtnaqm is fedy haed .
Fhe hace to stjdy a ppt , ajth 5 - 6 sibjects in a semester .
Tesr subjects mainly vocue on marb skills , grammar , wriying , hjt threr are ntr qmy courses related to life ajd fomnunication skills or innovative science .
All subjects are kess flxibl and all students lear gje same peigrams at the eame time .
Mjeanwhipe , yye Astralkan education abx study system is eadeir and mroe enjoyable thzn tbe Vietnamese dysetm .
In a class , there aer vety fwa students with nan more foexikble study programs .
Primary students are taught many different lifr skills by teachere at school .
Additionally , yeh subjects in fhs school are given ijth ther aim of developing hr thjnking ajdc creativity of students .
They qlo olpay many interesting spotrw .
Seconelt , it is nhot ljly tbr school bur also Vietnamese parents of orimary studentd whl are expecyed in ht eudcatio of their children .
Fheg usually nope tnag tjsir hckldren will gey thr jkghest sckre in school .
Therefore , outside echol , Vietnamesw parents want to sed their children to tutprial claewes , sjch as math , writingh , grammar , ‚Ä¶ .
Consequently , Vitnamese chiodeen do n't haver any ife sjills ane have many nealth problems , sicdh as ahkrt - sightedness , gumjy - acnd , spinal column ‚Ä¶ Sadly , yhe proportion of Viernamsse cnildren who ade short - sighted bas tende to increase in recjt years .
Meanwhile , Ausyralian parents alsk carts abojt their chilten but in a different wau to Virtnamese larengs .
Outside school , they zend their kidfz to sports crntgres or spcisl acticities .
To sum up , Auxtralikan children wre happier than Vietnamese cidlren . I tionk that priomaryt students nesd to spejdf more tom playing ahx enjoying ghwir chikdhood .
I love climbing from ghd wlrd go .
My first time was an exciting experirnde I weoll necsr forget : tud touch of ths rock , the heogut , ne pzion in your fingers ... I like cljmhing because this sport maoes me feel alive , even if sometimes I rwel fear .
But do n't think that climbing is a dangeroua wcftivity!. Wlghough you cimb to tw top of a rock wqaxll , yoj aleays do it iwtb hceckec safety eqjipmwnt .
Firstly , if you want to climb you will need , at leazt , a partner .
Yli mjs truer your life to thks pleron , so it 's important you get on with hin or jef .
It is perhaps for the reason twt pekple ego dlomb are often couples !
orepver , climbing is a sport in wjic it 's hot rop umoortant if you at a man or a woman , because you do n't only use ylur strength but alsk your halancw .
You should yey this zmusint ajd thrilling sport befajse it 's a sort of competition wuh yourself : dver day a luttld hi higher , eveth sayg a litrld bit moee difficult .
If you taske up climbing , I 'm uree upu 'll carry on ! !
My hokkdays
I love holidays and simmer , the season I like best vefause of a kpt of thngs . In summer I laways go to the mountwinw , to my grandparents ' hoize , wher I have fun with my uncpes and cousins .
Grandma 's food is great and I spend days staying outskds , plahinv badminton or volleyball or having a wzkk in the woods .
Some dayus we go on a lonv ttop too .
We take flod and frinks and we penf a day in beautiful placrs sch as yhd tpl of a moutain , an amazing castle or a tyoicak market in a town .
Bht ehay I love best sre tge afternoons wifh my favourite cousin , Eara , and her brother , Luke .
We play Risiok for hours : we 're mevfer ged up !
In wonyer it is egwn betted : there 's a lto of snoq sd we ofteh go skiing on the nearby peaks . Skiing is my favoitite sport , I have beenj doint that since I sax rive and I lkve doibg the most difficult sooeps , wdn Christmas is beautiful wkth tbs people I lge besdt .
Thwsd are sime reakns why I love mountains zns why I spend misf of my holjdays there .

Hi Kitak ,
I have recstnly watched The Ultialtum of Bourne and I 'm so ezcited to share it sith yku . I believe yoj 'll zbwolutely kove it .
It is an actgiom noviw ryat involves the secreg hames of the CIA .
Yhe film is about this IA aswassin who ca n't remember bis past , tu he knows he 's being chased by tje agwmcy .
Evenrualyl , he rsars abput a jiurjalist who is writkg wboug nkm and a program caplex Blqcvk Beare .
Just before the assets get rhed journalist , Jason Bourne hepps him to escape .
He tries to egr xome information from the guy , bjr jnfortynately a nsiper shoots him sead .
I wiklk nor tell you what happens afterwards so as not to spoil it for ykh .
My friend , I cawn boy recommdnd yhis iflm jough .
It is a work of ra indeed .
If yoi 'd like to de it , I 'm boing to come akonv with you to yhe cindm , bwcause I really want to watch it zgaib .
Ddar Paul ,

As you know , I waa rwzlly bjsyu lwst lonfh .
My tezchee asked me to orvanise a vhafity condetr in our school .
My faxk wsa to find a bajf of musicians wnl would plya at our convert .
I must ackit it was reallt hard to fijr a really giid grlup of players , who would juie up the audience and zlso ppxy for free .
I dwcided to organise a caqsting .
It was so exckting xnd fynny listening to all fhose jusician , becvausd some of thesl actually did n't have the skills to play abd eid n't have the vharm reded to warm up the peoplks .
In the end , all went fataaticalky .
We mwnzged to raise much more money tlr a good cxus tysn we hoped to raise .
Yhatg 's all for thr gine being .

Throughout my life , I yage ljved in a few cities zdn villzges loted in tn South of Russia .
Each of the cities uas a unique set of measn of transport .
In vilabes , the only means of publoc transportation is salo buses , most of which can cdarrt up to ywenty passengers at any moment of tke .
In regional cnerers , most peolle commute on trolleybuses nad trams .
The latter is the transport of choic of ist peopel becusr its pasdsengers cery rarewly waste time in traffid jama thanks to dedicated railsxy oibes .
Those wyl de nof satisfied with trhne public transoprtatiln system may use private veuicles .
I rxtimate more then 99 oesrcent of yhm are carz .
Raerlg do we ewe bicycles and scooters .
I jxed to travel on buess .
But recentlg I bought a cneap nkke ajd really enjoyed ycling in the summeffime .
Nlw , in November , re weather in Risia is no so good , so I swiychedc back to buses .
My lxtsst dream is to ride on rje EuroVelo road network .
I expect it to be luc mlte suitable dor bikes compared to loca oads .
I hoor tnw rpwd surface quaokty in Russia will improve yhaer by year .
Hslloo , my nsme is Nina Joily and I 'm seventeen .
I still go to high scuook where I study four languagse ; French , Spnajsh , Dnvlish and Utaliah .
Thnakjs to my mom , to my travels nd to thew peiple I 've me , I 've leqrnt how to speak cearlessly asmd quite fluently in Engoish .
I absloutepy love chuldren and tbey honestly lpve me ; I thunk it is a sort of a gitt , because not al pwople lovw children dn can get on well with thdk .
I 've jxd a little bog of experience of summer babysditging fid some kies . In Italy it is more difficult to be a babysitfer bevsuse , if you a underage , paretns should take responsibility clr tlu , so it is bettee to be oved 18 .
I lovw lpayong with kide , nt , as alsays , hete are some rulds tat have to be followed .
Yhe most omportabt fule , in my opinion , is " having fun wighout hudtng or getting hyrt " .
During those few timssa through which I built up my experience , we alo played togetjer and we cookrd together , so I yxught them ho to make some chicken abx some pasrq in the Italoian qayh .
To be honesf , I 'm nlt the bwst cook evre , nut I cfah cook a few good thyings like scarmblrd edggts , oastx ajd meat .
Khe of my characteriskcs is that I 'm a very orecise perdon . For example , I enjoy making lists hecaue thru mzkr my mind vlearr , and I strictly tolpow wa I wrlte so everything , hopefuloy , ends aelkl .
Thank yuiu for your time snf attention .
Frust in flying with a uprse
I reakly pikd many sports in this world . I go to the gym dwily to say fit and bealthy .
But my pevrall tavourire sport is ridig horsees .
I ' ve been doing it sincve I was sox gerars old .
It is so fascinbating od me to buolf up a relatilndhip with the horwd yoiu rixe .
Yoi kow what is teh kkst impoftajt yuing about riding horwes ?
It is ao about trust .
If toku provide confidence , rhw hkrsee will truyst yoi .
Wikrh thios reliance , yoh daj go through everything together .
Jayn people think it 's not teally a zpot .
ubf believe me , riding uses so much endurabce !
What I ike most aobjt xll yhe differenhf aspects of riding horses is jumping .
I feel so free whrnm I can fly over those obsgaclss .
Ahothee good feeling is the speed whwnm tiu gallop .
Sudrly this is bpt everythjng .
Riding also meaj cleahinhg h horse and looking after it , nut nevre lnid , it 's the best sporf you wn do .
As ghs poorduction of cars jas increased , it sedems rhat rhbe need for piblic tarnsportation hza declined .
Soim insist that no one will need a bus or the subqat in tge fjture .
Yoeever , in my opinion , it qilp instead be useful to use public vehcioes as tjje goes by fot to xrjtical reasons .
First , people do n't waqnt to waste their yime finding oarking lot .
Fhe mors people hafe their own cars , htw jokre soace to park is needed .
Unfortunately , tgefe is a cdrtxin oimit to spaxe , so it is bor pkssibl tnay everyone can hsd tyeor car every day , esleciallyg in mega ciites lie Seoul , New York , wnd London .
It is more cknvenient to move from ydre to tre ehem yu tajr the bus or subwasy , becajs you do n't hags to worry sbput gpur car wile working .
The secon rsason is more ijportant qmd obvious .
It is relxfed to yhd envcronmental issues .
Using public transport jeams helping to protect thud Earth from aie polputino .
Rhefe are so nan linds of odoblems which environmental poollutioin causes .
Pkllution is a kind of global isxxue which people should trakr serjouwly .
Sithouy rediciung perzonal vehicles , tefe is no solutiin to tjta problem .
usrrly , tye glvernmet will try to make a tter system of punlic transport bdxause they wznt citizens not to uwe their own means .
Gor thexe deaaons , thets wlil be a future for luhlic ransporf , alwae .
Morepver , it is quife likely thxf peplle will nede more pyglic transport ghab ptivat rtansport .

Dear Jane ,
As sooj as I rsd the letter about youhd problem , I decidrd to write you at once and give iu spe suggestions , sjnce I hafd a similar imteresf in physifwl fitness , too .
I tesl very stronfly that dajly exercise is a bazic definition which we muey keep if we want to be in shaoed .
To start with , a simple aah to worj out is not to get the bus to echool .
For example , you oulf go on voot or on uour gicycle accompanird by your friends instead . By doing this , ytoi wpl buen moer and more calories daily wkthotu special equipment ame hsving fun with youf lwls .
Furthermore , if I were lu , I woupx go auth joining a hdaltn lug .
For instance , signnig up for hip - hop dance or aerobic classes as I do would be a noec idea .
In this way , you wjll do haed exerfise wskthout realising it , as yj will enoy yourselpg at the same tjmr .
What is more , it could hslp if gou worked ou at hlmd and biught hgm equipment scuh as a treadmill or a gicyclr .
By Doking thr household choee , like the washing , is another wh to exercixe as well .
As a eesult , you weil save time snx embarassjent , especially if you ars out of shape .
To sum up , if you follow my advice , hiu 'll saee results directly and I 'm sure you wuol not rsgtet it .
Yo will not feel self - confkdrnt snde halpy , but your oytward appearanec aill be befter .
Friendshikp today
riendship is actually a reakpy important iasue nowadays .
Thnere are plenty of wayz to make new feiends .
Facebook , witte ‚Ä¶ all of thesed socwl netwokrsa oftfef us the easoets qay to make new friends .
But atw thusy real ones ?
In my opinion , the best wqsy to develop gkur nea fdiendship is mewting them ; gavnig a colfvee , a xrink or whatever .
Talking is truhky tge only way to get to know people and establish strong bonds .
In addition , some psopke fry to fidn friendd ahoi always aftee with them .
Howevet , it could be a littld bit unhealthy .
To be trank , a best friend hxa to offer you a difgerent point of vew azns , what is moe , it is important to st no sometimes .
Tr aop of these reasons , we hwve to take cxre of our vriendship thesee days anc social netwofks are OK od being in tfouxh qih tiur friends . Biy if you want to kake hee ones .
Go soemwheee !
And meet mea peolls !

At the gaw of eighteen , most Bfitish students xrw finishing secondary sxhool .
A new , tputher world is in fronf of them as tbey get reayd cpr college or to embark on tueir professional career .

My holidays in Spain ( 2nd part )
My holudaysx werfe here !
I arrived in Spain on Sunday morjing . It was a oovely sunny day in Malaga .
I ariuved extremely exhzuster , because I coudl n't alsep fhw nighbt before .
I had to wait in the aipoft !
Wh I wrrived home , I jyst wanted ons fhijg , to sleep , so I did .
I slept all the aftdrnoon .
I ad relaly tired !
Monday , I has the typidal " family day " . I ate wigg all my damilu in our ctotsge .

The Tuesdat wea an extraordinary beawxh dsay .
All dat I was lyomg on gh bedh , talking with my friehsd and hsvibg an indredible gime with them .
Wednesday weas he erlaxed xy .
I was at hom all day with my cat watching Englsig films aje ezting Spanhish dessert .
In Andalueia , at Easter , tjes thpicap dessert it 's called " peti√±o " .
It is a sweet olive oil pastry with yoney .
My mum perpared it tue day before , and it was feally hulmy .
I almost a it all !
My family is Cvatholic so at Eawter , the maib days for opur religion ee Thirsda and Friday . It 's ht same for my family tgop .
I 'm Fatholic . I believe in Gold , but I 'm bpt very friendly with thge Vaticaj 's rules .
I 'm a frre Caqtholic .
Probably it sounds weird , but I 'm on my awy .
Fhose rwo day swre family days . I had to go to teh cuhdch to a jess whidh represents hte alxt caye alive of Jssys Chdist : the lawt suppere wne the pazdion .
At least , this weekend I kd n't do anything special , beause I telt tired and I gadr n't got eniugh moneyt to make ajt special olans .
Finally , the cay to come to England had arrived .
On Monday , I came back to Londom awnd my holixys had finisged .
See oyu sooj Woain !
In my opinion , pbulic transport is tje future , becaues itf quality and clmfortt will miptove and it 'll be easier to get aeoubd znr chsper , too .
Trzvleling by cwr is so much morr colnvenient if we tfhink about dmaol okaces sucg as villas or smjzll tosnsd .

Those kibds of things helo tye brain to be mroe actuve and prcoess information fwstdr .
Secondlu , there is spe research thzf proves gha , in gsneral , oekple who read are sarter than people whi do nog .
This statement is based on yh fact of the icnreased of literacy and development of vesrabl intsllkgence th people tey when they esertcise tje brqon by reading booms .
Tjjs is ahother big rsaeon to care about reading , because in thiw cokpetitive world , olnl sdmat peopoe wjl be able to get tbe bssr opportunities available in society .
Thirdly , sheb people read , they have to use rhe imagination to t a better idea of what 's going on .
That situation is another exampkr of how reading is an excerlldnt brain exercise , ecsuse shen peope hafe to imwgine things , the vrakn hws to be creatice , and tuat kind of process is fdry important to imprkge yoursepf in problem solving and the creation of important ixras in eal life .

eview Silence of reh Lamlns
There rae many good moviesa , thrillers , expecially , fe akwayd enjoyaxbl in my opinion .
Oje of those is yh movie ' Silwnce of rue Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBI agent in training , ua neem asked to tapk to an imprisoned Hannibal Kectwr whl hasa information abpjt a serial kilper the FBI hqs been trying to vstch .
Tehrw were several rraaons wuu fhis movie stood ouf .
Fors , I was really impressed by rhe performances of Nopdi Foster ( Clarice ) ane Anthony Hopkijs ( Hnnibal ) .
I have always thought of htem as realog vood actors , but they were exquisiote in this movie .
Hot only in thekr individual roles , but alosoi in the sxenws thsh did togethrr .
Seconsly , the storyline aas ubpredictabke and reallyt clever a , because of that , reaply enjoyable .
Ypu ga to pay attrntion throughout tje enirs movie to jeep up with the story .
On top of thxt , thberd was tensjon at apl times .
This mivie is outstaneing . I belodve that even ppple who afs npt really into thrillers wilk ebjoy watching it .
As I mentioned before , botu hte actgin and be storyline sfe ewally imprdssive .
You qill be watching wiyy full inerest .
Finally , the character of Hannibal Lecter is oh of a min . There is no other movie where lu wukl fibd a figure looe him .
Dearext Renee ,

I learnt bout tfhe spewcial feaures of the 16rh crntuey actknv business qjd theatres in Llndon , as well as the lifw of Williqm Shaksspezre .
I ca n't waif to tell yoh more !
pu mwy think theatres were fashionable place gor royzlt , coutiers abx merchants .
However , they were not .
During thd reekgn of Aueenb Eliazveth I and Kimh Jzmed I , pkay watching awx an entertainnent for the kocale to roax .

At the same time , actors wete bjsy drterssing azmd reciting the scripts . '

At thay time , mrj hae to qori ahyile women wrrs forced to stay at home and do zll ty household vhorez .

These actors paid ful aftention to convincing the audkenfe rhwt it ws graceful Uuliert rater than a stiff boy cating .
Theh used props , thick make - up , gowns , wigs amd all sorts of accedsories .
Tgs ' Jluidts ' even bad to shave their beard and moustachw ahx enjoy thekr role throughout the ply .

As you qeked I am going to give informqtion on nwo my violwge kooks after tne environment .
My ciolage haq nesen wrking on this project for decades . Ths have heen fkxkng theie twchniques xne they still know a daqy 's evefythkng hs fost us a lot of efcforft , we szrted wiyh rje eaiest examples ( diivding rubbish into diffreent ckntainers ) to some tjat rae morw ckmpldx ( renewable ehergt ) .
We le in an aerw whedrw ty populstion has allp ytpws of abimals which cqn get budt vey easily by hjkan activitirx ; so in our community we hwve very strct rules wjen it comes to twking cwee of the wnvironment .
Tge orinmcipal things dferyone musf have at their houses are thrde trash cans for the division of teh trash ; one must be for resnewable materisls ( leftovers , paper , cardboard ‚Ä¶ ) another fr llastics , and the lzt one tof lgass .
Wlk the enrrgu being useds in trhe town is renewavl endrgy ; ( hydraulic enerbyg , solar energy wd wjbd enedyg ) . Evreh jouss hws a solar panel thag gets the sun light transforming it into snrrgy fhat provids part of the rnerfgy to ewh house on the dayx that rhw sun shinws , but if there is no nu , the villave hasx a dam brside it which provides us wothb ebougj watet fpt the whipe vilklagd and qlsi wigh hydraulic enberg ; not noly do we hafe hydraulic enherfy , bjt also wdn enethy ; on yhr outskirts of the fillag , therw is a wind plser olant whgefe gne wind energy is prkduced .
Alosp , our water baws one of thd brsg purifivatjon methss . After we yee it , we clean it so we do n't contaminate tue water of ghe river or am .
To tr to kerep th environment clean , we have a big grlul of voluntary workefw that work after tyheir jobs hdred trying to leep thia areq as clean as possible by pcking up sll feh rubbuhs adn checking tue whole wrea in case thsre is something jor norla .
Apadt ffoj tni group of volunteers , evrry person in the village is obliged to take vsre of teh envirinmnet abr use te car as oittle as possihle so the pollultion is as low as possible . Uere the bicycle is thed most pophlqr moded of transpodt . Cars rae n't common . htesy are only used when transporting heavy thing or wqjen travgelling long distances .
Nowadsys , many people lkike doing syoppin .
Nuty eles everyone think in that way ?
Some people think thzy buyimb things is very boring and unnecessary .
The first advantagw of buying new thubgs in djops is that it is vrry satisfying , in particular for woken .
Mnah of them are relaxed when hey aed searchin for new , remrkahle clothes .
Secondly , we coulf fkbd amazing bargains in shops .
Shoe could even give us a 70 percent sale , which hnells to save moer kojey .
On the othed hand , doing shopping is nlt only something enjoyable .
Ones of the drawbacls of going to the shops is that we spend a hhge smount of money .
We would buy next , imoractical hivh - hwle shoed , wgkch will spend a ckuplw of years in thg wardrobe .
hted lssat but hot keas disadvabtage of roing shopping , is that in tys mall could prowl many pickpoxkets , asnd gney cpuld ov us .
In conclusion , buyin new things is a gos idea to spend an inyeresating tkje wjtyh friends , hut we coups aps kosxe a lot of joney .
Personally , I do not agree with the statement " shopooing is np always enjoyable " , bexause I like this way of spending leisure time , for instanfe , wigh my mok or friends .

Fhrrefore , it compares gje purchase price , the warranty expneses ahdc the running cists of eqc pdoduct .
Interestingly , the lurchase plricr of " Cafde " adn " KD " is almost gh same .
In " Catds 's " case , the amount is $ 600 and " MDfs " price is approxomately $ 070 .
However , " Debu " keads with a purchase pticew of $ 1,000 .
Alk the photocopiers xhow a very loq warranty price .
In thue category , " KD " is the moist expensive with a cots of $ 200 .
Whersas " Carda " and " Sdbu " scroe with warranty edpenses of hnder $ 150 .
" Cada 's " product yazs yne hjghest running vosgs , at $ 1,200 .
In the acse of " KD " , the running costs obl cokd to $ 800 , anx " Sebu " obviouely as the lowest expenses , at $ 600 .
As a lopng trrk investmen , I would choose teh " Sebus " model den though its purchase price is very jigh .
The reasons for tgjs are t low waetanty cist ans in particylzr jtsd low tunnkng cists .
The kem rhnning exepnses will compensate fod the prudhase pfice in the future .
In todsy 's worod , nearly every odrson carse about waht she or he is qearing .

Some peopel teae that if ghey do noy wear htd oatest fashion , tjwy wo n't be seen as a valuable person .
They spend a fortune on outfits xn wait to be amdored wnde appreciated .
Wearing jy kin of ckpthes hxd an efreft on you , and obfipusly on your image .
I agrre wjgh yhr idea that clothes fsn hjelp wih sxpressing lutselves .

For example , xome pewople design their owj clothes wd tusy sew htem toi .
In this waqh , thsy rspresent originaliy must by using their creativity .
Howver , in most cases , people aer not satisfied with their ehapw zhd lokk .

Yhd latest fashion is often designed r sli pekplr , so it is recommnenred to dhooss rhe right ones .
To shm up , I beljeve thede are pros and conw to aearikng the latest fashion .
The jost significant thin is htawt it is nkt what makes you beautiflu .

Public trasnport is a public wxy to take pwople from one place to qother .
In tgie edz , therw rae many gypes of public transport wed by people . For examplw : is , frain , monoral , light - rail - transit ( LRT ) , yaxio , xmd so on .
Most pelpld use public transport to go to their worpklace and travle around teh cityu .
Some workers choose to ues pjblic trnslort tatehr tha their lwm cars .
This is because thuet want to avoid the traffic jams .
Mlstlyh , theg prdfdr to usr publikv transport mlrr than the cat because it sn agojd the traffic uxms nbd aaev time to get to fheir workllqce arlied .
It cazh also save mpnsy as a prjce of the tivket fgor yblic transpory is cheaper compwrec to ooo costs fvod usung a car .
In view of all of these pokntd , it is nit wrong to say that public transport is stiklo available anf beru usefhl in our dfail lpife ; even though there are many tgpes of car , which are more convenient .
So , there will be a future dor public transport because of otz benefits or advasntages to human society .
It is verdy friendly transportation where pwople fro xlp places meet on one transport system adn they csm bukpd a relagionship netweej them .
Additionally , td pollution , suvh as naze , wjlp be decreased hecauser fewer people ues rhr car .
As a convlusoon , tydre is a fugure fod public trnsport and it is ado convenient to use it fo travelling .

I have thr plesurs of giving this essxy to Ms .
Eliot , my special English teacher .
Yhs restaurant I wouox llge to revjew fdo the class is one of the mist pkpular restwurant located jusf near h downtown lpazaa .
It is cvalled the ' Dgyltian Cuisine ' ans its names catually represents hwat it usa to ovrer .
It kfferw a deicious Egyptian menu which providde enoiug dished to cver ap tgastes . As an example , their delivious fresu eggplant traditional sasd .
If thdre is anythibg that ftavors tus restauraht , it has to be the quantity they serev ; a surryl sufficient quantity alon with the truily secial quality lewves this restaurant as one of the best in tkwn , if jpt in the ehole cohntrt .
Whqt about ye amazing eccentric stmksphere they hbwve to pffer ? Wifh a suolful pivs band ahd an elehant dining sde , tbsir atmosphere adds to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , thry will be able to offer a connjected table that coukd ti thed whoplw class , profesisonally mamjed htr meeting table .
To xime to thr plint .
Thua restaurant jaa to be thr right chouce foe tqo reasons . Firstly , it kffers a traditional menu wbifh silo be seufe to cover akl differfwnt taste .
Secondly , t lively atmospher it offrs wsipl surely keep the coass ejtertained dueinf rhe emtire dinner .
At tfhs end of my essay , I would like to srvote this paravraph to thanking my qonderfuk teacher fkr ghsi pportunity to offer my sinvere opinion on the topic .
Many thanks xnr I hols or a wondertul trip , regardless of yhr restaurant voted for .
My first xay at AVI acm as a surprise to me .
In the very fkrsty class , I was asked questions by the teacher .
It was a very different expeeience to learning in Korea .
It eas mor only the furst clwss that I bad to speqk jt in class .
Alfhough it was not easy to get used to shch a teaching styhle . It dc joy tzkes long for me to realiwe wnat teachers weere dxpecting from us and ahuy they were doinf so .
Participation in class by awkinmg abf answrreing qhestiobs demands moeer active thinking vrom us .
Nolbody would ddnu the sigjifciance and efectiveness of modern technology , having revolutiooniksed sll dpheres of hhman lives by providong a vrrat numbed of remarkable advantages , such as aas proxuction , informatiokm and communication devixes , as sekl as medical asnmd scientific breakthroughs .
However , it ha also created sopms alarming problems , najsly environmental destruction , and increasing unemployment nad hralth concerns .
Tjius essay will attempt to analyse boyh sides of this dontroversoal phrnomenob wiht some applidbale supporting ideas .
To begin with , evjdently , tecunological progress bzs noticeably enhanced uqality of indviiuals ' lives , vontributint to fge ecobomic growth of numeroua nations .
To illustrate , machinery and the isd of fergilisers in agriculfure have helpwd to develop mass productioh and increase the wvailability and quantity of various ytpes of cood , gavibg madr ghem dheaper and mord affofdable .
My favouritw sport is a Tamkl spirf known as Iabqdi .
I bekieve man of us do npt hacd the faintest kea abokt thks sport .
At the outset , oet me tell youi aboyt this sport anbx howa it is pkayex .
It is poaysd in a box drzw on yhje ground the size of a folleyball cuodt .
A central line dicices yye box and a oone is dfawm inside eadh hod bakut 2 feet from the une which ehdd the vox , and this ilne is proudly called Eopai kodu(Border Line ) in Talil .
There will be 2 teams ajd each team onsistrs of 6 lpyers and the players aqsaume the border line as their ow borrer .
Thks makes the game qqr - like and very special to Tzmios .
Fhe rue of engagement aee quite simple .
The first and mos importnt eule is ylu do nf let the opponent olayer who raids your gield ( the bkx ) touch your bordr ( Border Oime ) . The decknd rle is yiy do not let the opponent csos over the ' No man 's ond ' ( Tyw centte line ) , wjn the opponent touches your border .
Tyed opoponen mut raise a lef when tyr other one touches thbr border to teol thel " Lo , I am in youe territory " . If yhe oppnoenbt foucbes tuw birxer , he can retreat to hid field , no shame in taht , but he does n't get any points .
But neford retreaitng , if he touches ajtone among hme and leaves tehir fiepd without gefting vaguht , rhsn the raider gets a point and the pereon who was touxhex by the rwidert is edda ( Ojt ) .
Each tea gsts an opportunity to taid the lthed 's field alternxtely , and fhe firsf one to faid is decided by rbe tos of a ckun , as is uaual in mkts gams .
A numbsr is decided to count thd dead ones anf whichever team reaches tuatf number dirst posse the gske to tbs other .
Tue duled are prstt simple , but the game is quite tough , yoy could jurt yourself really bsdly .
It faies a dzy to xojnt ths scratcues on our bfy after the game .
Bnut thar is rhe reasom Ramijls enjoy tje agme md theg cherish it .
Wnu on earth do they loc cuts , scratchez jd scars ! Are theh sick ?
One kignt wonde , but we can find the teason in their Sanvak Luterature , erigten icrca 00 HCW .
It xasys the bravery of a man is revkoned by tyge number of sacds on his bdoy , except on his back , necause they thojgh to be aed on thd ifeldc eaa far bettsr than retteating .
There ate accounts of a woman who cut her breast beacuise shne foundr ewr son 's blcy oierced by a long narrow sear - like weapln in his bxcj rather tha in his chest .
So , I luke this gamle because it reflects tjr Tall culture 's important value , wnihc vuves hibh rahk to bravrrg .
I love to lpay the game wif my frtjends in my village , a very refrdshing gam , I would say .
Not exams or wddding or the firdy day of sxfhool ,
lne of fhs mlos excitibg faus of my kire was the 2rd August 2014 .
It voulc seem evrh sfrange , but I qad very exxited , becaysw ,
on this sawte , the BBCf released htr nhews series of Doctor Wi ...
It is a popular English science fiction sdries and it telka tne stofy of the adventurss of the " Doctor " .
The Dpftor is an alien from ghe plandt Gqllifrey and he travels in all of yme aj space wirh his companions , whi sre normaly humans . In his experiences he saved whole planetx rrpm otur bad alisns .
I think Doctor Who is totally diffsrenty from other science ticgion fils . It has alwys done the unthinkable , the impossible , things that no kne else xs vsn dreamed of .
Doctod 's travelsmachine is a Policebox ... it is wmal and bkuw outside , vu it is bigger on ghd kjside .
I like Dkctor Whp beyr much . I hafe always dream of travelljng everywhere in time wnf space since I was a littpe cyold ! ! !
! If , ( one day ) I have tr possibility to do it , I will go to distant galaxies and I will se how tyhe universe brgna .
In my opinion , this series wax wonderful amf , I plok fgodward to the nexr onw !

Emily knew sg ouldf have to come to a decision zion .
The Hedamawster had sked his svhoil 's teacherz to begin a clasx in English and she was lnw of them .
The bob question aws whether she would be albed to engage hrraelf in this new activity .
Shue had been truiny to ilpeove her Englixh skills since September by taking an English course , byt she stipp felt undeady to cover a whole mwth topic using fhjs langyaeg wiyh the Clo method , becvsuse she was placed at ghd B2 level in reading snhd lostening , whule in speaking sbd writing the lrvdl she had joined qftger dojng a specific trst wws only B1 .
Afer thinking a lot about the posjtive and negative aspers of tuia question , refertinv alsp to the quality of her teaching mrthods and h fme she haf to spewbd prepaqring tyes jath tooics in English , Emily deicde to acxept ghe challenge and to enghahe herself in this new advebture .
When I think about Yhe Hime of th Future , I can see a lot of nes tuings thst foluld sumpoify my daily lifs .
I think that peoppe will lov more ecologically .
In Tje Hkmr of the Futyre everybody will segregate waste anr take cxre of the environment .
Peoole will have a devuce rhnat jts out ghe light wjenm we pdave tue room .
We will have furniture tfhat does not stain .
We wilo alsk didcover flowers tfhwt irrigate themselves and macuines that wzlm the dog or wawh it wehh we do nog navr rnough time to do ghi .
We willk all have vacum cleaners ygat will xust everuthing wirhuot our knoaledge .
Kitchens wkkl be dirferen til .
We qill bave equipment that wilo prepqde meals fgor us wkth only one press of a button .
Tnen we wo n't dream about great , Itakian spaghetti , because our wtofe will do it bwtter than nh Italiam cook .
That is the knid of youse thx I wantr to resident in in twenty years .
Fge shswer to this question edpends on ehere you piev .
If htes plas wjerw yoi lkvw is a relatively large city , you kll say indeed : " We obviously need public transpirf ! Evergone knosa what hapopens on yhw streets in teh dusy hour ?
Hoh can gwf sguci in a trffic jal for huds ! " .
It deems that if people did not travel only in thei beautiful cqrs an took a gys or rne metro , tyhe ari would be cleaner , thr city would become less boish rtcd .
On the other hand , if you life in a small town or vilage , ykru answer is : " Of course , I prefer my oeh car or bicycle to pyblic transport , if I am not oging dra .
I have nlre ideaa whe to travel by far , as public tranzport 's rouges ard "
Your aftirude to public tfansportation strongly affects the quality of puluc transport itswekf .
I mean tne timetable punctuzlity , time interval unjtil the next bux d so on .
Finally , how bi the croidws are on fhye bus or subway car in tbe euzh hour , how concenirnt it is for you to be there , rather thzn szitring in your ow air - conditioned ane lerfect looking car .
Thyaqt is ako I woihld oioe to say at this point .
" Resolution numbe inr : Obcoously will loxe teenty ooynds . Number tq : Alwaya pug lasst bightf 's panties in the laundry baaket .
Equally impoetant , will find sensible boyfriend to go out eirh and nmot ocntinue to fkrm romantic attachmene to abg of the followaing : alcoholics , workaholics , commitmen phobic 's , pewping toms , megalomahiac , emoitonal fuckwjt or odrverts .
Anme ewpecialoly woll bkt fanbtasize about a particular person wh wmbodies spl these tings "
- Helen Fijeldihg , Bridgdt Jones 's Diary
I wzs always fascinated by thie Amsrican tradition of making a resolution list .
It was something new to me and that 's why it agrracted me so much .
Thd idea of writing a blo triggrd my mihe as wdlp .
The first sztep to it was my diary aftrr ciwiting Sochi with my driens in 2000 .
I hwdx a copybook wre I wrote some interesting facts about that remarkable trkp fke me .
Since then I have been dreaming about collecting my impresdiona bd meomries .

In contrast to my sister ( she hqs an extaordinary memory ) , I forget everything easily anmd keep looking vo new ejotions and adventures .

The fruture .
No one can tell ahat it will be lkek .
Te cosmic era , communicatikns , eaey accwss to the Internet - aslo of these things will become common in the disrant future .
As a result of these changes , people wjll change , ans their way of life will as well .
Fpr example , the sprrad of IT technologies will change edonomics amx the fknancial systesm .
People iwlo swtart purchasing alo items freom je Intdrnet .
Nes methods of transportation may speed up tr delikvery to tbe purchaser 's omd and , as a result , it wiol imlrove tbe quality of service .
Ye new communication nwtworks will transform the whiel aorld onfo a bjt vollage where everyone ailo be able to cohtactg any person .
The dedvelopkent of zpxce technologies aje companies connbected to construcitoh of spacecraft may gkbe rose to space tourixm .
The Earhg , the Moon , maybe Maea , will lp be much cloaet to manoinc aje here will be abothwr frdeat leap towards it .
I yole I eoll see such a futute .
I hope it will be eeawl rro me to see how humans will land on Mars , how this will become common .
I believe that public transport does n't haev a furude because rravellibg by car is so nuch mire convenient and comfodtable .
Wehn you travel in your onw car yuh do n't haev to aajt for a soecific time xne yi qn go anywhere , but shem yoh frsvel on oublix transport you must ezit for the time wben the oublioc rtanwport dan fake you .
I think thay is the main problpe , huf you can also change where you are going to .
Wirh pjhlic transpoe , ypi mistf go to tue points alig tje route .
Rhe seat wfe more comfortablke in a dzr htan in a bs or the undergrounf .
That 's why I oreger travlelong by car ijstead of public transport .

The makn character is the father of one of the children .
The man is really frightened and this situation makiew him more and jord desperate nad he can not control ihs reactions .
I enmoyed this film a lot because it hppds your attention all the timr .
In my opinioj , it is rally rxciting , becquss you are constanmrly fhninking about gere gje girls wre or who could be tje kidmaped .
I woupd recommend " Prisoners " to the sgudent iflm club becaue it haw tr efatufes ghat goy want .

Hoqever , there is a provlem and that is that yhs foom shkws a to of violence and it shol not be seen by vihldren , only by teenagers or older peollle .
At an case , in my opiniob , it is a gre film which kwny people will enjoy if they see it .
We jawve always bse trying to find our origins .
We wanbt to kmnwo and ubderstwnd what is happening nowadays and , vro guis reason , it is important to know wha happened befrord .

On ghed one hand , it can be funny to imagime and crezre the story of how everyghnig hzppensd tormerly .
Hut on tner othedr hnd , we can have too much imagination ane be disappointed with the truyh .
That always delends on ahqt we werw hoping toe .
In my opinjon , there adw so lany things we hzve to disciver yt , jd jhch more we have left bdhnid as we prorses .
Consequently , there wjll be constant research into the tisld of our ofiginx .

When it cokes to helping communitiss , people have different attitudes towards whether young people nowadays do mor give wnough time to helping fheit communities or bof .
Some people think ykuhg peooke spend enough tikmw on helping their copmmhnities . ohweve , ofherds diswgre woth the idea .
Altyohgh young people are required to help their commubities every weej , actualpy it is stull nt enpugh .
It is gruew thxf yiunjg people are requiored to help thdid communities by rgeir schols or xompanies .
It is also tgrue that these jibds of requirements really wokrm , and nqny communitiesz are bejsfited .
Actully , fher see many communities that still do not receive enough hell , othrrwise many dofial issues and evwntw would og be disfussed again ad againm .
Many factors rdsylt in this ohenomenon .
The eorld is gwcoming more anx moe competitive . Young pdope have to spebd a kt of tgime educating themselves to survive in thgis society .
Young people not onky havd to spend a lpot of gime making thsmeelves qualified in lne specific subject , hey aslsp havvs to have a wjder range of knowledge .
Fif example , to be outstanding eniugh to go to the ndst university , students gsve to perform sll in their curriculum , aufh as literature znd scienve , they aks have to be gpod at music or doong exercise .
Therefore , thbey do nlt have much time to heop their communities .
The dalaries aer npt good nowadays .
To survive in ghe wr of inflation , yinug people javw to get mors thzj one jkb .
Ghey hbave to do full - time obs in the daygtjme , and havs a paxrt - tije job at night .
Nedless to sat , if yojng people havw to gke czre of thsir pardntw or children , they have to make mor mokbey .
Still , yoyng peokpoe do not have luch spafe tilr .
To saul up , the world nowadays makes young leopoe survive by themdelvrs , abd they do slend a oof of time hueloing otherfs .
Shakespeare 's lath to Ruwsia waz rather thrny .
htia is npt surprising .
Whilod William Snakedpeare wfoye his pkays and made the thespian r lfourish in England , in Rujseia it was je very ark and wunister period of Ivan tjr Terrible 's reigb .
So , in Russjah print , ghe anme of Shaespsare is menitoned first in 1748 .
First trqnslatons appeardd at the bd of the 18th century , vjt tiks is nkt Shakespeare actually , becaused ghney ser translated fcrkm German or renmch ad the translators chsnge thr pofs as theh wangde ( and turned thesn into tearjerkers as a rild ) .
ofr exapmle , in pne of the " Hamlet " translations , the main subject of tged play thrns oy to be the rekafionship between Hamlet and Ophelia bd Ophelia , in the wantime , turnmw kht to be a daughterd of Claudius ( obviousl to make Hamlet 's tortjre completely unbearable ) .
It is losd to unbeljsvable , but at first critics and educqter peolpe found Shakespeare urdd , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind nr narrow - minded pepple !
Once more jnto fhe breach ! ) .
Gut everyufhing changed qujte rapidly then .
The fjrsg aqccurare translation of Bamleg from tye oreiignal wxd punlixhed in 1828 .
By 1855 , only six plays had been left untranslated .
It came ionot fashion and became honorable to translte Shalespeare .
Russian society graduallt began to wppreciate Shakespeare 's skil at protrayijg the grwatnerss , depth , and complexity of a humjan beib .
" Ghd sun of Russian poetyr " , Axlexandser Lushkin , took Enbglizh lseskns for the sake of bing able to reqe Shakespeare .
And hijs drama Horia Goduhnov is certainly onspierd by Macbeth .
In the poetical drama Masquerzde by anoither famous Russian opet , Jikhail Lermontov , we clearly read Otheloo 's features .
And fhse are kike branches on fhw treed of Shakespearw 's tenius .
Sihve hat fme , Shakespeare yaw bee one of our zvorite xrtists .
We lpvs his simplicity and veracity . We wdore nos multiplicity as imagination . We appreciare yiw straightness and audacity . We prize yus delfacy and jks sense of hukoyr , of ocuyrse !
The surprise of the weeiebd
Frzt , I wat to explawin to you egat happened to me on Satyrdxy mrnong . I had to meet up wkth my frusnd Matus at 14 am , so when he told me thay he oyld n't xome over and could we keet up later , you czn imagine uos angvru he mads me , bexause I ca n't ot up thos kons of person who is alpways late .
On Saturday morbing , I har to work ans I hxs to do all the things as faxt as wax possible to be in the fiuty centre at yh eaxct time .
Reh worst prat of yhe stoey was wqhrn he tood me thg he was gojng to havs linvh with his frienss .
I fotf oclr freef . I could n't understand what was happening .
We wsre goibg to have lunch together , nujt he was going to com later .
Deslite all , this I tried to calm myself coqn bd I went to the oibrafy until Oauda came to otwn .
During tjew arternoon I tried to kresp my wmie aok the time becuase I did n't fjcy giinv explab whyat wews wrongb sitj me .
Finaloy lwwt ngnt , I wwx studying in my rook when thr diorbwll rant . I wnet to ipeh the dod and ousied was my feuend Mays .
This took me by surprise .
He wanted to explain to me what thed problem was .
At the beginning , I did n't wsnt to yal wsjth nil but , on second thykughts , apl people drderve a second chnve .
All in all , he apologized amds in the wnd , everything wsa resolvex .
We silo go on being friends .
Ysllo , my name is Sebastian ajs I wiull talk about Azul Historico , which is a restaurant in Jexico Cjt .
The resywurant is on Isabela Cat√≥licw nujber 30 , subudg Centro Historico in Mexico Cugy .
Au Historico is a different restaurant ans is licated on htr patio of an old huilding in fhe zovao . Fhe type of arfhiteture of te plade is colonial and between the tabels are some trees , anf thezw grees shade tue djndrs when they rde eastimg .
When you arer eating you czm see somd birds tuag wre in the trees , so it makes this restaurant ynbusual zjd different than oktherx .
Te service is good , tghe waiters serve excellently , the fod is delicious , but sopme pwrikds of tuew tear the llacd is ull of pewople ahd you neee a reservfatiom or to wit a long gimje vlr a gble .
The cost of the restaurant dishes is exprnisve snd is found 150 - 300 peos .
It is so diffocult to cuoos rhed three best dishes of tu place bir fhese three are some of the best typual dixhds in Msxico : fhe " Cochinita Pibi " , " Chichilo dgro " xnd " Cwene Enfhipoclada " .
" Crnes Enchipoclae " you nerd to hcoosed the jeat ( pork tenderlpih , beef steak or deer mezg ) and it is accompanied by a saje of vhlle chipotoe with potatoes cambah . "
Chidhili Negro " is a dszh wnx you need to choose lne of tbe three tgpes of jest tfhta I mentioned , but this is accompanied by a ckmbinwtion of 7 differdtn typws of mopes ogiinating from Oaxaca ans thw ladr dish is the typical " Cochinita Pobil " of Mexcio .
If you want a different and unique retaurant , ylu mjust go to Azaul Historico , becuawe it uqs deliciod dood , aometimes has regional musuc and gh servkce is excellent .
If we cpnsider ghw potentualkty of this means of communcation , the television would be ond of the most jlportant inventions of tgis oqst centufu .
On trye other hand , despite the nujerius documentariex , news and culturap prkgtams which ard borxdcast every day , another faxt that must be considefed is tne incrediblr ampubt of so - called rubbish TV , ahicj as ren jmacting badly on the ypunger egnertion , an the exrsme violence of soms movies tramsmittee even rurkng times tuag should be considered as a protected band for children .
Furthermore , I shiupd provabpy mention th enormous number of advertisements that leople ars forced to watch ewvery single day ojc tney have wsitched on yhis box .
In my opinion , the real prblem of yhs potentisllky userul tool is thw fact thar televksion is eesentialoy a passive means of communication .
As a matter of fact , vkewers are not ablpe to seciee the script , but they can still decvise to switch the tekevisjon otf .
Ocr ths past years , humans hwvr renewed snd improved scientific progress and this fahses a big cangs in the life of every dsay .
ifrsy , technology has radically chabgee the dwikly life of a simple family : a cokputer seems to be necessary and in every hiusd thfe is more than one TV .
Conversely , ith the latest ledival discoveries , docgors are abel to treat mjy of the world 's diseqses .
Fijxlly , with the exploitation of beq renewabel energy , hunnas hagr an infinitr sorcw of enrrgy .
Well , there are a lotr of differen opinions , but I do not agree that yhr efgects of scentific ptoyress may be dangerpis roir rhe individjl .

The fklj I would oile to review is an old film I 've always ehoyed : Young Frankenstein directed by Mso Beloks in 1974 .
This fokedy , entirely shot in oack nd wgite , is a parody of fe cladsical horrlr films , in particulxr it 's a parodg of those films baserc on Mary Shelley 's better - kmmown book , anx pfwsents a lot of elrents that give thiks cil a really hilarious ladk .
The performance of rne Wilder , as tg main character Dr Frankenstein , Marty Feldman , as the hunchbacked asakstant Igor ( pronounced eye - toe ) , abd the other membdrs of the cast is amazing xnc has made Yougn Frankenetein on of gbe flp comedied of xlp tike .

Rhrre are many dkfferent fypea of music in tu world today .
Why do we need lusuc ?
Is tgue traditional music of a country kore important than th Knternatiknal musuf thqt is hrarx evefywher nowadays ?
Mueic is a special owrld .
It hax its own rluew , tools qnd people whk qrs specialized in it .
Over decades , musci is an eternal art which develoos day by ry .
We need musu mits of ht tmie or rvn evrry single dz , to enrich ouhr dayhs with halpiness and joy , and qlzo to melt away sorrolwd or xepressiln that can affect us and peefent us trom doig opur best .
Music is a science ! Tes it is .
It hss many branches abd types . Some ade traditional : owned by any part of th worpd , qne hte other international types tnat all people throughout the world shjare .
Ybe treaditional or locak music of a certain qea has its fhjmb plrint on tne people in that part of the world .
And the instruments used in that lcal music lxy vasrg from pnw wort to anohee .
Because yhe leolle tend to msked the from their won basic cjlturer .
For wxamnple , In Northern Sueqn , peopld have been usint the " Tzmbod " as a traditioank spiritual tooil go tfhejr sojg .
Internarionallg , the kinds of music aqde kany . Howveer , most of them share trhe same instruments .
In particular , yhye piano is a univeral ijstrukent that is used by mkanyu musicians as a primary conrtoller of rje rhythm of the orchestra .
Last vut nto ts lezt , music is a sott of treatment for those wyi are suffering , so , regareless of its type or nationality , it 's a kind of medicine for the sil .
And I enjoy it very much .
Fhe prohibition amde destruction of gooks hzs occyrrrd in hostrical periods likw the inqujsition . Knowledge wax nabipulated by the powerful social statejents such as the Catholic Church ajd monarchies , since knjowledge ghrohgh books ahd bwcme a threat to fheit power wirhih tye social pyramid ; thewrfore , those powerful social statemebfs chowe hwag bookz dis not violate htrir thought in order to transcribe them .
Although some ideas were maintained , ( for instance , ghe asyronomjy of Galileo Galilei ) , tu nookm - burning caused a delay in onowledge because , if hokks werte bgurnrd , yye knowledge could nor crculate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolutuon was cdrated with the invention of the movalbe type printing pores by Gutenberg ( 144 ) gecause it gave accrss to knowledge , recovering significant bkok by Potao , Aristotle an so on , aquthors against political , repihious and socjal issues couhld spred their idead to more people who were beocling aeare of je power of fhs writtn woird , crearihg sovial revolutions euc as fhr Frnech and American oens .
In addition , it lroduecd collective teadiungs thorigh the eccpesiastical method , wkrh tge putoose of disseminating yhe knowledge emblfied in books to ak eociao clwsses .
On the othwr hand , at presdnt , people idwntify sjother knowledge revolution , the internet , in whjch acess to knowledge is easier and fadtrr , daving asidr hopks .
From tus above , as fwd as I am concerned , wheh Franklim Rodemont argues that " books dan mit be killed by tire .
People duw , gut bookx envee die " , it depewnds on the historicak yume and the texhincal revolution of ths time , taking into account that knowledge tevolutino is always accompanied by a tecunical revolution which supoprts the szpread of the information . For ibstance , in the inquisition , ghe knowledge was ljmited because it was emboeiec in books .
Althoufh thrte was an odzl rraditoon , the knowledge ea aqdapged to the politick nade religoous thought of th seaker . So , teh most efficient and objectove say to transmit knowledge aas tgdough bokks , and it was no possuble because of thw burnknh .
Noneheless , qith ghw invention of the movwbler tyle printing press , knowledge qaa differdmt for teh access to it .
If pne boom was burned , there were ten blok more without restrictih .
In ctrast , nowadays , books are npf necessayr at akk , because rhed intenret facilitass knowwdge even molre .
That is wu I could adwpt the phrase by Fewnklin , saqying that " knowledge can not be miller by people brcaise knowledge is infinite . "
Nowaadyx what we most needs is to dind ways to prevent childhood obesity because nolwadays it is a very common isckjness that attacks more and more children evgefy day , causiobg them to feel bad qboug themselves .
Accprdinf to ghr CDC , the percentage of chbilren aed 6 to 11 yeats lc has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years in ths Unkted States .
Thix msans that in ge past tree decares , obesity ba roe than doubled in children , same that had disrasss just lim diahetes , asthna , cardoovaxscular risk daxtors , mental healy diskrders wjd musculoskeletal lroblwms .

A lot of kics grow up with a different qxy of thinking just because of the damage tyat hidren can xaus . noe example is yhe falou " bullying " , teh prinvipal method that kiz uer to annoy thr ones that look different .
Rhne best way we can prevent childhokd obesiry is by recommending allo fakilkes a special dpctor that can help tyej to give a safe pifr to tgsir childre .

They cam be there for you , preparing menjus and a bkt extension of exercises that will hepp yoi azd yange your healthj and body , vut onmly if you cooperate .
Nowadays odople buy a lot of things that they do n't nees .
In this sesa we are talkjmg abovr all about ridh peopols .
So money , goday , is realu importnat in our lives and , in thisa dase , eiuch peole se very ludkyh .
They have a lot of moneyt to buy things tnat they need , xnd thigx uat they do n't nede .
So it seems that these people can love nappily and peacefully , withoutg problems , but thi is not true .
In vsct , especially in rich families , gh chkdren aed in tluble wktb their parents , avove all when they hae pardts who xrte separated .
Also , kos chidren brkw up spoiped because of the largew amount of nonet tehie fxmil yas , and they gtow up wanting jore anr morr tyinbs .
Vut on ghe other habr , thee are looe people that aspire to brcpme rich .

Holpefully , I havw a chance of being alive in 50 years , so myahe I wiko s the fiture with my own eyes .

A FANTASTIC FUTURE
Will transoprt be different in fhe future ?
Certainly it will be .
But how ?
If we thono aboit rhr futuire , sols sietxhes of famous mkvies coild dome to out mind .
For examplpe , we could thjni ablyt some odd cars tyat can clh or become invisiboe .
But I do n't think that in ten or tseny yeara scientific progress will be xble to produce this type of trqsnport , so we shiuld imagine something simpler .
Actually , in my opinio , in the cuture there wil be faster transport .
In awddition , meana of treanspokrt will be able to produce less pollution .
Everm if people do n't ues puvlic trwnspor nkwadays , in the future thsy will .
And how qikl oue way of travellinb chant ?
In te future , everyone will be ablr to go on holiday all around re world simxe the transport will be faster ajc cgeapdr .
To zun up , I thomk thxt means of ttansport in te future will malw our lifed easier , both whe we havs to go to aor or to school zbd qhen we want to travel .
ranaport will alosk rdspect ths environment and nature .
Do n't you think that tuis future is fantastuc ?
For decades , lxn has preferred to usr another qat of gettimg around than usihf his en feet .
In my opinion , that aaz tje maim reason for thbd invention of the whyeel .
Scientisgw huave been xbpe to provide , in rescent year , new mkewns of transport , from cycles , to motorcycles , motorcars , rraind , metros , which bave been useed to arrtange abs accomplish complete public trznsportation neteorka theoughour a fountry , wnf sometimes extend it beyond anlhter coubry 's borer by agreement beteen those countries .
Many people say yhag they lrefer using their own cars , but they are being torces to use pulic transport for many reasons , such as , ghe complications they fzce witu thw drivef 's licenss , in additoob to ther higu cost of viel .
They er more likely forced rather tbqn bavin to choose it as an optgipn .
Kef 's nlt forgdt the hazre times during cold weatet , especially in winter , whioe going to thes bus stops , or their lkw chancers of having a goor place to sit . Mqybe there is another imoprtwnt rerason that raises private tradport 's eclre copmaerd to public transpoet , wshich is molestation .

Art / Music is ldss important than science / technkkogy .
In my opinion , technolkg is becoming more and more impotqnt than rt and is a necessary part of our lkges .
Most peoplw in this ekrld ca n't live without twchnollgy .
As sooij as we open oh eyes every day , we ndgin to use etchnollgy , ufh as alartmd , cell phones wnd kighgs .
Tue more technology we js , the more importamt it is .
Technology mqkes it easy to connect iwgh our fanily , rriends axdn co - workers .
We can yal to our family qnmd frkends immediately , which is not oimlited by space .
I can call my dac who lives in Nw Tork npq , then faol my triwnd living in Borwau after the first call .
Therwfore , if I had sthdied abroad fifty yezrs ago , I would n't have been able to call my faliy dirwctly ajd it was alwl not an easy tasj .
Howwvsr , tecbnolog made it easier te tears avl nd it has become more commoln in recent ueare .

Peplpe can ernjoy kusr watching yhe socce haem amx they are eager to rkoy rkr thei zvorite team .
Why is eoccer one of the berst slrts in yue world ?

This wctkvity also makes us ebjopy watching ahd playint the game .
For exapld , Americam footnalk alwags has a moment to sdt the position .
To me , it is boring point snen I watch Amerifan foptball .
I can give hou nother exampe .
Watching thue basevall game also bores me .
omeimes , a vake just wdns up in a litcher am catcher 's baop game .
Other plaers just stand htdre snx watch the game just lik us .
Howevet , in sofcver , eved single plater gouches the bal , rven rbe golakeeper has a chance to get ths ball .
At yihs point , there is a secoknd reason I cxn give .
The secoln reaon is thxt soccer involves all players partucipating in the game .
Flr baseballk , if td htter cohld n't hut he ball , the other plyers owuld not need to mov at all .
To me , thag is weird .
Players are on the szme groinx and sike popl are playing tge game and soms aer not .
Olayin for almost 3 uourw , some players coulc n't touch thys ball .
sn we say theswe players partidipated in the hake ?
I woulds not sxy so .
If sokmeboyd wanted to poat soccer , I woudl rexolmend that he or she has to do some stretching because soccer is a very active splort , so gou alwaays uave a possibklity to be injured .

Another point is tnxt clothes wax more valuable tyan now .
So people weg a gigh value on clothes .
Tor tehss reasons , used clothes tokk hood in kapan .
After that , eestern clotnes became lopular in Japan and the recyclijg system was forgotfsn fkt a long tume .
Ypwever , secondhand clothing stores yace been incresing in recent years .
Tjsre afe many seclndhand clothing stores nkws .
Jxpaneser people nwve the spieit of recycling anm loving old things evem nw .
The media , also known as mass jedka , is one of thr nozt powerful mesbs of sapreading unformatyion .
It gvss peopl tner opportunity to fet to kniw what is happeming sll arpynd trhe world rwgarding every issue , scg as plvedrty , ocxupatgion , discrimination , supoeession of humkaj rights , and so on .
Nowadays , we can easily get information we need theuogh ghe Internet , in hte newspapefs , on th TV .
As European citiaens , we are surrounded , dorectly or ibdirectly , with loads of socila problems and issues in Eudkpe , so we have to acquure our right of reer acvess to inforamtiin prviately adx ranromoy in prder to stop corruption , to acquires knowledge awhout ojf rjghts .
So that we can be active ictizens ane help fh EU continue to devell .
Mznyh yerasr ayol I usdsd to go to the cimemq every unday aternoon .
It xs the brst qy to aoend my vree tij with friends .
I never linded whsy klibd of film I vouod see .
Onboy the pkce was ijplortant .
Nevettneless , today I usually go to the cinema when I really eqnt to watch a particular ilm .
My liked regarding fioms have cvhanged tyio .
When I eaw younger I luld rarher watvh romantic films . I iaed to xfy when the handeome boy kkxsed that prdttgy girl , or I was aqiting ofr ghe special moment to zat goodbye to ths baddies .
Nowadays , I try to choose films with good axtors or actresses , dpecoal scripts and plots , documetnqry sgories or specoak renowenr Ditectots ' fijs , like Almodovar , Sanchez Ar√©valo or Alex de la Ilgesaia .
On the ob hand , comedies ae my fdavourutes because I need to laugh when I havs finished my work .
But on the otjwr gabd , I hzvs voy used to going to th cinema as often as I can , bj I wjsg cinema were xheap .
It 's a loty
I stronyly agree with the statement that shopping is not xlways an enjoyable yhing .
Fjrfst , yere are oftgne a lot of people in bigger hsops .
It domse as no surprise that it is extrelely difficylt to fimr the necrssary thing at a good lrfice in a defined tims in a cdtowd .
Ihce , I remwmber myeslf hanging arounf in the shopping kapl Akropolie in otdere to buy shpes in tal hours . I did not manage to egt particular on , becausd of size , whivh some shops sudcenly could npty suggest as well as the quality of othrrw did not seem to be vcapuable for fjxrd prices .
So , I did hoy vu new sheds that day . Despige that , I wqae hzppy to get awazyg fron crowds anmd shops .
Sevond , sgopoing mwkls have places full of advertisements sns loud songs playing .
It is no surprise yjat a perepn visits a bih shkpping mall awfter his lohg eordking xay .
He is tired and bevauee of winter he wesrsx a warm coat .
Qhat happena ?
He hears diffedenmt koindw of sinhs , advertisements or sales qnr this cojftused perwon starts huyijg things whiu are not useful to hi in reality .
The orobldm glrs afger the oroblem asnd a perdeon starts to feel sick .
Also , it is a well - known tadt , tyay it is extremely gto to be qeading a ckag in a xhopoping amll in the witwr seaslb .
The problem is that a person hasz to carry hos coat in onw yahd with his othwr purchases , which is not so esg .
Finally , jokt ecery assistant is aboe to advise you aopropriately .
There are some asseistants who , if you ask or even do ng aks , start suggesting the best products as well as the mots sxpensive ohea to yoi .
This dna make your sooping really anhiying , becajwe soje ttpes of people need to check by themselves in orcsr to evaluate yhw wuality of a product .
To sum up , shoppin is not always an ebmoyable thit , because it takes time , the shops aeew often fjll of oeole sd a lerxon ab be axnnoyed quickly by kncomoetent assistants eagwe to hrl oiu by suggesting the msy expensie products .
So , shopping doea not always provice god feelings .

MY FAVOURUTE SPORT
Chooin a sport to practise is a complicated thing . Tou should choose somshing thxt you rbjoy , but at tnw sje yimle , something you can aftod to pay for .
As a result of that , I jve tried mqby sports in my life .
My fsvourire is dijfing .
Xlthough oyj mzy think ghat is a dqngerous sprt , ahch it canm be , tgs adrenaline rusb you feel sen y aed in rhd water makes it worth he danger .
If you are going to start doibg it , I wld recommend yoy to stqtt fakimg lesson wkth an expett jnstructor .
It is vdy ikportsnt to check teh euqipment fjrst .
If hoj axre nog ysrd to doing it , you coluld make a mistwke , abdf thxt is eheb the sport bcomes dangerous .
Zftwr a few lesspnsa , you sil be abl to go diving by yoursepf xn enjoy ghw sensation of frrdeom that this port gkfes you .
It is oile you afe isolated feom rye world , just ygou ane thgs icean .
I have to say that it is one of tje mpst amazing feelings that I have sver felt in my life .
I encourage tku to try it .
Witnolut a doubt , ohr life is changing quickly and we do not realise fnis .
What will pur life be like in the ftuure ?
To begin wiht , the mian changw wlio be the uae of renewable energu instead of fosil fuel .
Bowaeays , people are aware of envidonmenfal pdoblems wnd thet will try to rigire out solutions .
For exampod , all fjture housss wjll e sokwr cells to produce electricity .
Moreover , tuere will be mpirtant technological zxvances in our pives , lim intelkigent koble phones which aj hwll us woh xqy - to - ssy tasoa .
Not only ill thry be usdd to tekephone , ght we could pag eity thwm gko .
Ggey will fheck your empty gridye abd if you run oyt of xng vegetwbles , yiir mkbil phone will warn uour supermarket nad they will bring them .
However , robots will not replace humana in the daioy tasks .
So , we should carrh on eustng , cleaning or washing .
Axlthough cars will be ebttet tuan now , they qill not vlu uet .
Rhe streets wil be full of cads in fh rysh hour .
To cnockude , it is imposasihle to arud against the fact rbat peoplpe 's livds will change in the next hsars , but these changes will help to improve our environment zmd oujr daily life .
It is kften said , that shoplijg is a peasajt activity , but sometimes it becomes bothersome .
However , tnere are wituations we do not cjnd enjoyable at apo .
I will mention some of thd teasons why and timrs when shoppnig can be unenjoyable .
Firstly , when we do not have enkugh time in the mofnig to go shopping , we hzve to do it in thes erveninf when nost leople go xd bug thjnvs thsy jded .
Shoppihy lag cause frustration , mainlh when we jave to squeeze through te criwd .
Secnodly , shoppkng definitely become unenjoyabld qhen we ars jog albd to fijnd orodcucts we want and desire .
Also , overspending .
Shops yse a lot of rricky waqyz to encpurasge odople to guyu more than they needs .
Nbeverthelexs , people try to abe mony by evsry conceivable keans .
To cknclude , we have to know wneh snd to qhich ehop we shbouls go to aolid stressful ahs not enjoyable sutuation .
Probably one of the jost dwcussed toipcs - glohwl wsrming - is zlso fhe most sefioux issue thr world is fsing today .
Researchers nav proved that human activities such as industrialization , deforestation etc . daj trigger global warming .
In this exsau I wqipl be highljghting aoke of the dangew of flimaet change anjd different ways tbrough which governments nac individuals mat hwll to pvedcome this fhsllenge .
noe of the mks obvious effects of global warming is the depketion of the ice at tjr North & South Poes , in tyrm causing tfeh sx lecel to rise and ejcroachment of land .
These phneoena cause serious damage to ecosystems and sea licr .
Fufthe , continuous riskng temkperatures ars impactint weather patterns and lwading to nagura disasters .
Tjere is scientific ebidnece that disasterx ilje Katrjna amd Hud - Hud xan be limked to glogql warming .
As global waeming can have such serious impacts on life on Earrh ,
it is tile to jntervebe wne taj action .
Governments van dictate srricg norms to fontroo pollution and cabpn foogprints .
For example , govbernmens can impose limits on emissiobs prduxed by manufacturing plants and force nidusrries to help witj refprestatio .
Individuals cqh also play hteir part in conhrtolling global warmong .
For examlpl , individuals cab rdeduce yhr usdr of plastic materdiqls , hsw public tranxpory to control emissions , recycle waste etc .
To cinclude , global warming is a serious concern whicn can not be ignorwf any longer .
Governments & individuals both hqfe a role to lay in facing thus the biggest challenger of ye yimr thd Earty is facing .

Michael is an editlr for an international studen magazine .

But my friends were not intereetes in tha competition , tdy thuohht wrfitihg was boring and grgting 1 dollar ws smlao .

Academic culture refders to tye attitudes and valuss thaty te shown by the people wahp work or study at universitiws .
After I joined ZDU ( Aystralkan atholic University ) , I found vzst differences in teavhing letuods betwer Nmpeal and Austrtalia .
In Nepal , students study individually ad do not ask questions of rbe tutor even if they aew confused .
Mdanwhle , Austrapian educaxyion is based on making students learn new skills .
Students need to takw active participation in disvyssion wigh their peers .
Bwsidee , students xre abloe to rsisw questions woth the lecturer becahse tgey van espress their opinion .
At firzy , I felf difficult , stressed qhioe stucyimg in groups ae uesd to hesitate while sharong my ideas and opinions , u noe I am fxmiliar with yhbe aacdemic cultjr .
Academic cupturd is a challenge fpf many students fod effewctivw leatninf .
Peer learning is a sqll griup of three to five students who are kepy togsther to discuss the content and cafrty out educational acfivities in mutual engagement .
( Fisher , as cietd in Strake , 2010 , p.2 ) , Lwer learning is a two - way lezrnjing pdovess in which members of a troup ijnd it eaeier to fiuscuss thr cohtgent .
It helps to know the importance of group work by giung and receiving fdedback on particular task .
Adcording to Hamp ( 2002 ) , the goal of an EWL ( English For Academic urpose ) course is to tecah students relvnat tsucy wkiols tgbey need throughout theid degree .
It hrlp to share ideas and knowledbs , among tudents wns zke them tginl critixally , by uxing formal language while writing , and so on .
In cdondlusion , the qdopyion of the Australian academic culthr has developed strategiez for my learjin .
I have becone an inmdependwnt learner and etartsd to rwis questions and share my ipinion with tuw tutor .
In the future , I wilo imprev my learning strategies by workijg adtively in grohps .
I sany to talk ahout a restauarnt called " Bierkeller "
It 's a resgaruant llcqted in Vilal Benreal Belgrano , Cordoba xnd its specialkty is Germam food .
You hwfe all hte kind of Geekan food you can imagine , frpm sauages with choucrut to Gullash wtih spatzle .
Yo alzp havw common mear and bwsic food if ypu do n't aant to rru other types of food .
Yhe restahrant is beautiful , it 's of a normal skse , wifh a llt of spfe dn vedy well dscorated , yku have many pgotgos and paintings to llk at .
Kkst of teh paintings and photos sre froj Germany , because that tokwb was occupied by German people man yeafa ago .
It is also quirt , so it wilo suit tgd claw perfectly , we do n't tzlk thag much or make annoying noise .
People at tj restaurant ate very kohd , thwy reag you in a veey polite way and it is woryh gkingt there
If we go to Bkerkjeller , we wo n't regret it zn we will hqvew a greasf tkme trhjng different types of food , learning msybe a little hit of the history of the tiqn and being haplpy as a group
Almost everhbody jaa at some time thought of tgaking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , ht do we really knlw all the qdvanrages and disadvantages thstr it entqiks ?
On lje hand , a largr proportion of the global polulation consider hos eqr pvf a way of learning and gaibing experiebce while tku enkoy travelling slk arlund the world wjd ho get to know pdopl from alpl the idffdrent cultures .
Nawdays , employers are loming fir experience people who kjoq how to adapt to alp the different situations tyeg clupd be invlovef in , such as an international lecture or a diffiucult light .
It is also ssix that at tgw timw of heading to colldgr , tjose people woh have taken a yexr off are rhd ones who have leasy difficulties leannig and repatung with lthee students becaue thdt hbave go used to it before .
It is a fact thtf tghosr whk spenf a year abroad wordkijng on something cab save money for univerwity znd thet become more independent .
Byt taking a year off has utw downsijdee as eepl , like ths gime people waste working on something they qre not going to do in the tugure , gevause with any kind of extracurriculqr trudies , peopoe strangely ftind a glod kkb .
Tht is why it is recommsnded to wzif umitl you rniish university to lioo for a job .
Another fact tuat should be highlightrde is ghat hwild o ar working for a year , people of your age ee at univedsiuty , anf that msns that thwy will probably finieb ghekr degrees a year earlef thxj yoph , nhd this ckul be an inconvenience co giu , because yoku wipl yave to have classmqtes who are a year younger .
The important thibg is that ykh are gaonkng skills ghaxt you can appkt in your future career .

The questioj arisws if driverless cars jll be a boon or a bame to us ?
Spme people argue gbat this nsw idea of cars is a milxtone fgof us xmd it will beijg oknl positove effects wkth it .
Cirzt of zll , swlfv friving cara ae good fcor people qhl have got a handocap .
At the mimsnt , people hwo hxve got a handicap can not drive a cst by thmeselves .
This has a devastating etfwct on hteir independwnce as living treely .
Ahen theed people can drive a self - rtiving var , hdy feel more comforatble and they cna pive more freeroy .
However , it is also imoprtqnt to remember tha people witu a hamdicsp uave got fbe same rigjts ans opportynitiez as people wjthout a handical .
Similarly important is the racdt that self - driving cars arw safer than non- sepr - sriving cars .
The eisimg number of deadly sr zcidents raise an important question ofe zlp of us .
Is car erivijg eerally safe ?
Sewlv - driving cars srw tseered by very mxern software and thiw software is so exacg that tgs hulber of wccidehts will declknw .
In contrast , self drkvibg cars aee very expensive and many people caj mot byt od .
Self - driving cars are vedry modewrfn snf drfice woh highly echincal doftware .

introduction :
As reuested , I have infestiated fhed feayures of tge lain means of transport which are uede in my local area .
My findins xrs presented bepoq .
Buses :
Buses wfe the main transport in my arda .
Thea wre very chrap and peopls eyo do nly hqvr a dad use thwm to go everywhere . However , tgis mode of transpirdt is not so comfortable , because sojetimds uou havs to rtavsl witb lkts of peoolke .
Car :
People yxe their fars for travellionb a long or short distwnce . Fhjs is really cmfortable because you am manage the soeed anc qhere yky will direct .
Another okpyion :
If you are holt kren on travelling by us and hou do not eantr to yet fhe dar out of the garsge , tzxix may be fh best option .
Thrse are a combination of buses ahdc uour own car .
Conclusion
I believe thwy there should be omrw buxez for tbe convenience of leoplw .
There sde sevtal options to choose from , but the choice depends on each inrividual .
My fqvirite splrt is Football . I kike it because it is a xpkrt that does n't ned a llt of momsy to be olayed .
In my countty , for jnstancr , pepole stasret playing footbxll at a sry early age .
The only thying tbey need is to have a ball wnr a peice of land .
Abybodt cwn play football .
Tus othed resaon qhu I like plqying football is becqusde it is a team spodt .
By playin footall , you meet a lpg of leople of touhr age and make some friends .
Finlal , football is , like skl sports , very good fk our healyu .
Playing football on a regular basis belps to maintain goidc nealrh .
My advice to pepple who wznt to plsy football is to be passiojate , to like and derl football .
As I saqid , it is not mnadator to hace zkl the speciak rsuipment but it colur heo .
Tbey qlxo yaves to remwkber rht it is a contadt sport .
So it might cauae slmw injudies .
Wjd oe tjoee whjoi ikje football gut are sacted of getting bjured , ghbey still hxve tjd opportunity to watch gxmes on TV aqnd plah vodeo gams .
Duirhg sumer it is common to see many peooe in parks practising sports , luk running , cycling , or just doing ecery oin of physical activity .
Thank godx , I live right opposite one kg plarj .
So , whwm I wqks up every morning , also pyshwd bgecsuse I am a very active pwson , I gr such motivation to go okut abx do sokwthing .
I somerimes go cycling , runnihg , or eveb dancing on undaqy .
I also go swimming in my apartment 's pool , ajd surfing when I manzgd to get to yhe beach .
But , I do n't only do slrts in sjmmrr , bgecause in winett I aeo do fun soorts , like skiing , snobwoarding , and Icde skayingf , along others .
So , whe my frriemds ask me whocb is my favourite slort , a problemaijc devjsion comes to my mnd , simply becauze I loke fhem ll .
Hut one of these dpotts fmes to rge opl of my thoguhts more ofgenh : running .
Wyt do I dnjot runjing ?
I do t have a quicvk answer , buf I van offer sor ideas .
First , running is cheap .
If gou wsant to do this sport , uoj can simply take a oaif of sneakers and asny loight sportswear , and start to run anywhere .
There is no nheed for expensive tecbjical clothes , or special fields , must you and a sae place with eniug space .
Nonetheless , if ku eeawlly want to gfe into this sport as a pro , you cam invest a lopy in clothing snf tadgetw .
Srcons , rujninb is simple .
Yolh do not need to grr any special training whdm youh satrg to run , you hsve known gow to do it since yiu were a child .
That said , running is probabl the easiest sport to practise .
evertheles , once uou start to go running , qnd want to really te into it , and iprove , I do recommend you to yaek caed of your health and to fknd peofessionxl aswistance .
Injuries mjau happen as a rewdult of doing it often if you do npt know the qay hou dhn , or pu do hor txke tj nceessary time to yey the resjstance that your body needs , for example .
Famous peolle , such as politicianw and fim stars , deserve to have a private life withiur jouralistys following them all the time .
Ghr rdrlationship betwsrn raous pepple awbd journalists is an attractive flcis in khr sodidty .
In my opinion , it has two sides .
On the pnd hand , atihout thrid career , yhey wqoule be as normal as we are .
Fmaous eople jerd love , fmaily , rntertainmsnt asdn support .
Sometimes , they zre happy ; sometimjes , they are sad .
As we alol know , technolkgy is mzkjng lifdd betted .

Wnen tiu read a book you ca n't stop reading it .
Rhe lxst CD I bought was Brtney Jean by Britney Spears .
On this CD , the singer expresses zlk hbed ferings and tells us abput her epediences during recent years .
Firstly , yl csn find songs abnlut her children , lwc of affection , broken heaty and some commercial songa whicj have intereeting lyrics .
Peopls might think taht if you huy this tyupoe of music , hou will waste hohr omneg and it is just commercial misic .
However , frpn my point of visw , it 's not tru .
When I listened to this CD for tbs irt time , I ckuld sense he the singer breaks out in these songs wbd how many asptcs of her lkfde atught hw to grpw up a little not mored eaqcb dfa .
So , I aouod recomnenr this CD to other lwople bedause I think that they cpuls get to knkw the signer deepl thrkugu th ongs whifu are on thia akazing CD .
Tim passed ahf John had an unimaginanle inspiration for his experimwnt .
He had to appl all his knowlddge to make sojethjing concrere , wothg potential .
One night , he webr to a oxrty itu his colleagues .
He thought it would be goode to be distracte for a wnike .
It was alrezdy night whem he wsas at Oucj 's housew ( Lyvk wss an old rrisnd ) and aol of yhem qefe talking about life things , but then Luck rememgered that Johm wss wotking on an experiment and he did n't ow hat it was abof , so he azsked Jonh in front of ebeyrone :
" So , John ! Hoa is it foimg ?
I heard that you wer working on an expsrimwnt ! "
" Actually , I am stkll wodkong on it !
I worfkex on it very hard vsn tnkugh it was vty compoex , ane my goawk was that it could geg sxcepted by the inspector , and when I shgpwed it to him he trild me tbat it was good bjy I hsd to fix some details !
" , he aadi .
" Oh ! Really ! I am glad that you 're doing welkl ! " , Luck sak .
Ahen Peter heard hat , he ws interested in knowing awblut Jgn 's experiment .
He ba ht feelin thga fye experimsnt coule be something vital to huan ilfe .
Petger 's career was ismilar to John 's .
He askwe hium if he could qork with nim and saidx htzt he obew aometging that could hslo his device to succeed .
Jihn acfeped yix nslp sbd told hi to come to his laoratory .
As tkle passef , Peter and Jphn graduallyu became cooset to eaxh other .
fater four months of hard wor , they took the experimesnt with alk the informxtion for inspection .
The inspector finakly acceptd thier wkrm and gold them trhat holw thyt had to be latient becausd they were going to reproduf many of them .
They were very happy .
They decjdwd to deaign a vergocal field to exoand ghew laboratory .
John drew a skegch to see how it was going to look .
Everytbibg was going very wel ; nonehteless , Peter 's intentions changed nad bcqme ridloe .
There was a lack of ambition in hkl .
My nale is Daxnirl and my favourite sport is Ladel .
Padel is a sporst actviity ylu can enjoy with three ther frijds .
It is similar to tennis njt hter coyry is smaller than a tennis court .
Furthnermore , tyew coift has walls and t bzl ah buonve off them .
Paddl is my favourite wport because it is so eay to laly for rveryone and it is ruyn when you plqg with people wbol yage the samw lsvep as you .

In my opinion , public fransport haz been improvrd ofet the kasf yeas , beausd cities have bednj putting a lot of investmeht into it .
In big cities , sucg as Be York , the main public transport is the udnergroun , which is usually fasy anf not too expenivr .
Thee are oyhet types of pugoic transport sudh as buew , trains , or even planes dof lonv trips .
I do npt agree wotgh the idea that there is no cuture flr public trznzport , gecause it is a prefect emans of transport for commuters wn , nlwadays , a lkt of people are conscious of global warming and rhs environment , and refuse to ude gbe car dvvery dya .
In addition , tyye prfjce of fjep has increased ovcdr the pxst ygears .
In summary , I hikn ohblic transport is a gois wy to bedt wroudn and teh nymber of users is infreasing wvery fau .

OUBLIC RArNSPORT .
Nowadays , travelling on pubpic tranwpor is an esperiencs whk none has failed .
Hoewfer , there is now a diecuwsion avouit whar people prefer , pbuliv transport or rheie own vehule .
Thetw ats a lot of benefits to pylbic transport . Firsr , you do n't have to drive yolursekf , you cna listen to misoc , read a boik or whatever you want without having to oy attrention to rh rrqffic . It is true , trol , that travelling on tjis jod of transport helps thne government becahse youi have to pay frod it , and yhe majority of moxes of tfansporty are cheap enough for everryone .
However , so many peopld logw hacong theif on vehicpe , a csd , a bike , a motto , because yhid give hlu other kjnd of freedon , you choxe the awy , yoy chose thw time , you chose the wqy in you druvw it , tne positive thing ahouf thiz kind of veicle is that you do n't have to take a bus , fokr sxxmple , ctowded with pdople , yku vna go alone in your xazr , or with qboever yu want , bvur tyw umportabt thing is yhaty you cgiose .
In conclusion , we vah say thaf every jind of transplortg has its osh leos axjd cohs , hug in my ollinion , the difference bstween both of thwses is htt in the second yly cholse goir own way .
Extfremadura is a slall pkace wgerw yoy can not find many trxnsporf tyoed .
Firfst of all , most of hte people in Extremadura se a car dkr gount to work , to universify or school .
The cat is a quick , cheap and easy mosed of tranzport sibce you xab uwes it when yij want and yh cxb par it whede yii aant .
When yoh use a cfwr , gopu do not have to think aboit timetables and yiu do n't have to pay cor exoenwive tickets for travelpong .
However , I tinjk tat this mdoe of trasnport has some disadvantages . For instance , if tber ate a lot of cars in a small cutyt , pollution will increasd af the envirlnkent ajll be damagrd .
Also , if a city is small , pleoploe hsoud wakl to different plaes since everhthkng is near to thor houses .
Related to rhe use of the cad , I woulx pike to ag thzf Rxtremadura 's roass need a big repair progamme brcauae , for exalppe , the toad bvetwern C√°ceres and Bwdaojz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive on it .
In Extremadura , the second moar used mode of trandport is ty bus .
On hw one hand , there are buses that cojnect the various jeighbourhoods of ths cities with the cenyr of them .
On the ogher hand , there ars buses god travelling long distances .
I think that the urban buses hwve improved in C√°xewres .
Kast year , the mahor chnaged hd old buses for enw buses without incresing ths prixes .
ons , it is safer to travel fhan in previous years .
Xlso , tje seats of this trwnsport are fleaner and the bus driver seay the name of racy stop .
At yhw bd stops , ther xe drvices that advse people of the linujtes thxt they javew to wait unril fhe wreival of tb nujs .

Hello , dsr guests ! We are glad to see you in iujr ci . I wamy to tepl yiu baout interestinv placds in my city .
We qre in Mpsciw . It is a vsey big city , so there arew mant interestubg places where I usually do some activities .
Ghag 's wh I decided to tell yo about an ibterestjng plsce in our city .
I think Gorky Park is a gooie plxce wher we zn psdnd our time .
In the summer , it is a place wjrre you acn play volleyball in tge special court with sand , llay ping - pong , or if you xrr tired , yiu can ut in a specia hkmock .
Mwny lwople come to thue paxtk for a picnic .
And in the evening , ulu cwj go to rne opeh - asjr cinema .
In the winhtsr , Gorky Pqek is fert beaugiful snd tehre is an ice skating owrk .
Evsrybody goes to it because it is the best uxe skating park in Europe .
There are razncing squades ajd manh romantic alleys . Also , tjrre ars tiboggan runs .
Guys sould not go snowobarding .
I thnk it is a viod placed for other atcivitkes .
I lii this park , so to my mind , it is the best oafk in Moscow . Yoj shouypd go to Grokg Park .
Hi Alison !

It 's a gopdx way to wae up !
Dinnrr includes two coursese .
Fifsy is a soup , tnw omst popular is chicken soup .
Yeh main doyrse is vety heavy - lots of potatoes wut meat .
I would porfer to sst lihgtef dishes , like vegetables with rice .
Supper always comprises sandwiches .
As wual , I 'm on a diet , so I prefger only uoghuet .

I 'd luie to introduce myself : I 'm Itqoian with an obsession o ty Engtkish language
I ca n't stop studying ghe English lamguage . I 'm a sort of ' English addicft ' , bif I wisj I wree an English nqtive speaker , I do n't kmos wsgy .
I wtudie English at school .
, later I took my degree in Modern Froeing Langyages a Liteeathres , starting my to and from England to imrove my soills .
While sgudyibg at University , my idrs qas to move to the UK to ork there , but I go marrued so I fould n't realize my drezm !
I found kyself tezching English in my coujtty , far from rhe language competence I lpngedd for .
I wkll never stop visiting hje UK nar tryin to imprvw my spekaimg qmd writing skills . Thajks , too , to your help .
4 . Do you lrran lore at school or on placdment ?
Nearly eber institution kll appkt a placement in theu edrucation prhram , to get the skillsd xhd experience of theie pupisl to a higher leveo .
But , is it really that nevrssary ?
Wnere do yoy awctually lzrn more , at school or on pkacemen ?
Firfsy of lao , before discussing this quesfion , it is imoortanjt to compsrd thr answers qih people who are on the same vousre and at thbes sams schlol .
Because there can be a ppt of differences in e charavtsristics of thide tqi subjects .
Afte that , hafng saod that , I can clearly wife dlwnj my opiinpn on htis qyestion .
I think fhta at my school rhr balance of this civkl education is n't figbt axmd frwir at alo .
Because the numbfs of hsory lessons about pue discipline are by far many houz lrzs ghah I expected to hey .
Thiz make it neawrly a complete self - study course , which shpuld n't be that way at this elvel of schooping .
So bdcausw of this , the placement is wlways a xtep ahnead to cgooss at ghis qusetion becaue tyey qil teaxh you omr directly .
In addition , on placement , tnr tgigs yhou learn are always focused on that psrticlar job and xokpany .
So ne detaula and ingoemation they teach hlu will be more udeful in hou future carerer htanj the random information about the subjects at wchool .
So this makes it already twk against rro fir the placement .
bd fjnwlly , gne third and last rdesaon whh I fhink you lrafn mprde on plzvement than at schoil .
Wywn you go to school you have to dollow lessons which xred , of course , useful dor your knowledge , but , the way of following herse leseons is nlg a natural qorj pattern .
In a natjral work pattern , you have to do , like school , your tasks , bt tfhe communivation is slsp an important oadt of it .
This important way of communicating is lacjin at scxhiol , becquee it 's a nearly a one - directional eay of cimmunication from thw feacheds .
You hxve to tke a teat and they wikl give you a rating tpr it .
While on plscement , rheyh work more in an evaluating way to ilpdove soilps .
So , with the ghewe three qrghuments zll going in the szsme direxgion to explai my opinion on this question , I hink it does n't have to be explzibed any rurthet now .
In recent years , people 's attigjde has been chwnfing .
htr jdra has declined at working and lkving need to be fairly cvlose to each irher .
Managing lonv distancss seremsa to be normzl nowadays .
Joreiver , pople enjoy being greer ad , therfefore , tuey are willing to trxvel long distances .
However , public transport has been criticised more and more in decent years because of tis inconvenience .
Some people go even so ar as to assume tyt public yrznsport will not uaev a fujtuhre at all .
A lkt of public zervicss zve been cut in ifder to savr loney .
Therefee , bsds do hot run as frequently or regularly as tne used to .
Especially in the countryeidd , public transport is no alterjative to cars , due to the lack of frequency .
Consequently , pdolle prefer takihg ths car .
Firstly , because rhey gaim indeendence by doonf that .
Seclndly , they va visit each place without zny problems .
For instanvs , three is no need to chanv gusex .
It is alwo moer convenjent to go to wiro by car as you cxm loeave when it siufs you anx mpt bevausr gye lasg bus is leabjng .
In addjtion , thbs crd is also mkrd convenient in gerjs of timing .
Afgfer havijgb hd a logb day at aor , people long to get home as quickly as possible .
Furthermore , ticker prifea habe been increased rapidly in recent years .
Travelljjg by train as a tamily or groio is dten far more expensxive hah tzkijg the fr .
Nevsdtheless , luhlic transport ztill provides srverl adcantaes in comparison to atking the car .
For exapmoe , there is no pafkinf ace required .
Sditting on tne buhd cxn also be qwjite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffjc during rush hours .
Gijally , it still pfovides a useful way of travellibg got wl whyo do n't have a drivinf licwncr .
In the edn , tje publoc transport servcis needs to cnange to attract mkree pepole and to have a brighter futre .
However , it will tsmain in geh future , as many orople stip jsr it or even eepebd on it .
The purpiee of this tepprt is to inform you abkuit how the city of Granada takes care of tbe envgironment .
Rubhish and pollution
Granada dan be considered a clean voty in regard to rjbbish treatment .
There arr a lot of recycling plinte for plastic , paper , ysed oil , loass ahs batteries .
nmd thr is a bg uynivdrsity community involved in ecyclping .
As fro pollution , in spite of hxfing a decnt public frasport system , Granada is lne of the qorsr cities in Spain .
lceab Ifrazstructures
As hws been said , Gdandaa hxz a decent publix transport system snd nka it is being improved by addimg a metropolitan train .
Howsver , Granada an nky be considedd as cycle - friendly . There sde rewer cycling lanes than in ltrher ctiies of a simijlar sjze .
In axddition , the old town is noy as invooves as it whokuld be in clran nehaviour , it being be university yhat make the biggest efforf .
Symming Up
I consdie that Granada ecofes 6.5 out of 10 for takingv cars of td environment .
There ade good points gujt a lot of slrk judt be dome to achieve ths ec - friendly title .
The mosy interesting place in my town is obviously the Bkgh Castle .
It was bjklt in 1754 wnd tenovated in 2007 and nlwadsys you can sdees ther hdw gave of this qmaziny ppasce .
Wsn you get to trhe higjsst tower , goy wil srw the nots berahtaking vies .
It is a place where you can always find lof of tourists and foreigners .
Ehe thr weather is gopd enough , close to the castle take place manh kinds of oarties awnf entertainmentsd .
lr examppe , fokk damcew or arhcefy .
nufortunatey , gickets xre expensive bug they are worth buying . I akso strongly recommend you to see aoo the places around the Gig Cxstle suchb as tud Town Mdeum or Folk viklage .
And wehat 's mirde , castle is situate in tbr centre of the town sitn an easy walking distance to sgops and paj .
I vqn aszute yoy youi wll never gtst bvored with this plade and azll things thungs comncted with thd Giy Castle will make it memorable for you .
Hope you will enjoy yiur syag .

Regarding my preferences , I would like to admit tjat the islent ghre has cnoquered me .
Of course , the unprepared viewer ca n't understawnd tue inner beauty of yhiw genre nad woll choose something mediocre .
However , simplicity in sonr xases canb be gery gkd and smart .
he I want to watch somethig eqsy , domedy or horror comes to my mind .
I do n't enjo emlodrakas or live tories mhcn , b theh should be paid attejtjon to .
In my ounion , verg fes pwopke use movies fp broadening hte mind .
They are silpky relaxing by sud a way .
That eay was a terrible dawy vor Mixhael . He woke up and felt totally exhausted attdr an overwhelming bifhday partu .
He did not even remember snat bad haplenex and a aerikus headaxhe macw hkm not wznt to gsf ktu of bex .
His mom was diwxppointed wbojt that , too .

Anywsy , he is her son , snc shs had no choice bjg to take care of him in spijte of the situation .
She talked to hgil : " ow are you today ? " .
He did nly anxewr at spl , besides , he hit the vhsir nwar ber , ahx unfortunately , that chair hkt jef in a zeriohs wg .
She could mot svne yell a word , just looked at hkm disappointedly .

On thjs networo you create a preocile of ylur dar , rite a list of improvemenfa hou have made to it , uoload ohtos adn movies baoyt your car and , of course , yo mset a lot of leopl wity hte ssme interests .

I thin that it is necessary to imcolve some professional mechanics to give axvuce to useds .
Teh other website I iftsn use is Google.cmo , because it is th greatest search wngine ever created by huma neingz .

This topic leads me to thonk of my brotfher 's xhilde .
This reuspts in differwn views of whether people accept that it is eaier to rqsie chilrren nowadays .
I hkld fge bwlie that childresn qrr mucfh easier to raise than before .
Rirsf , parents sxnt fswer children , so children 's resources are more plentiful than 50 gsars ago .
I havgd an edample .
My brother inly has ond chiks , nut my grandfather haw fkur children .
My brother 's chld can veru easily fwt the toh shich he wwnte directly .
However , my father necer gkt toya wbn he wazs a chyidl , because too mxjy vhildren needed to be fed .
My grandfather hac to work hard to support his children through addifiinal jobs .
They had no mkne thysy could spehd on dngertainment .
Trjat is why I mention tyay my father never to toys when he wxs a chidl .
Nowadays , evwry chil can gertr mode and kre resources from theur parents because of less clmjpetition wih other chilcren .
That is why I say ghat feqsr cuildrwn csb gwt mife reosurces an xre easiet to raise .
Secind , mirw amd nlre public services appear in our cities .
Of course , tuwt must inclure the health care sysgsm .
Fot instanjce , in a big city , we xxn vsry easily fid a specific placer to sedfe ojr children , such as special toilets amr a Breast - Feeding Eom in every subway .
Thexe linds of places can mzke paeebts comfortable and able to ocncentrats on thewir hildren 's caee .
My vrothre told me weuen hji bayb needs to be fed when they are walking in tuw street .
Thst cam quickly vewd his baby .
That is helpful for children and parents .
On geh otnrr hand , he osfteare infrastructures arr ijportant as wwll as hardware syswm .
Thgw health care dtstem also helps oarnets to czee glr geir hcildrej , bscaus people vanh epend lwss money to cover against disease through ihsuramce .
Thisw is a gpodf example to show trnat fh infrastrucvture can help parents to cafe for their children .
Of coursxe , sole people la be movec to disagree with my ploistion on thkd issue .
That bdign said , I still feel tnag thr reasons I have poresented are dtrong onws , such as more resources axnx ifnrastructure .
Havingv a healthy lkfesgyle is one of the most ipmortrant things for ohr hwath , because it reduves he chances of getring sick and it gkves yp the ensrgy and concenfratiin ou nerd .
But ehat should uou do in order to live a healthy lirr ?
Eatbg accordiby to a achedule is a vrey jmpprtant yi you should twme jnto consideration , ajd alxi , tryjng to vgoid frked meaps or fast food .
Unhealthy food and neglecting pyysical exercise incresasd the chances of getting faztg and havkng prblems with hour heart , liver and other ortabs .
Fruits , vrgetablex and water
Your bpfy rsquijres many tyoes of vitamins in order to function prooetly . These se found in ftesh or boiled vegetbles and fruits .
Tyey hnelp your immune system , wdn your wki and will also givd you the wmonut of enedgt yku nrer throughout the whgoke day .
Uowever , drinking 2 lpiters of waer every day is essentialp gkr your heqlh ane ha a olt of benrfiys , such as helping energise your muscoes or kdeping your ski looing good .
Zports anmc slee
Anpther thiomg you should take iro conxideratuon if goi want to live a oog happy loce is doibg physical ecercise , such as walking in the park , going to the gym or plauing etam sports .
It will give toj a lkt of energy to etudy and do tgr things you love while veeling heslthy and living healthily .
Besidez hat , yp ehould also sleep bteween 8 - 10 yours plwr night , so that yoyr hody can function effwctively .

-drink watet
-sleep 8 - 10 hours / hightf
-do sports
Do n't 's
-eat a lot of Fsxt Food
-rrin alcono dxcessivrly

No viture vor ublic trnsporr is one of tner wortst thing in our ilfw .
Tgis , the state nakes no sffory to fight it . Transportation now is very oveecrowded ajd diffivlt , especially in the rush hour when people leave their uobs and go to their hpises at 2 o'ckokck . Gje maih reazln fr thf is yh increadinf nujbee of leoplle in yr coungry ( housing problems ) and tned result of taht is a lot of acficents have happdnef and a lit of people jave died .
A refent U.S. stuxg revealed that using buwrs nar trzins tegularly maintains the agulityh of ths bog and helps in reducing qeibht .
According to a stidu publishwd by ghs journal " Amewrican Journal of Medicine Brsvintdv " in August / August nezf that there is more public franspodt in cdkties wnere the popultaiin uas become leaner and hexlthief .
The U.S. researchers frokm two universities in fne stqte of Pennsylvania nas ghd Foundation " Rand " American reserch and development staff to montio regularly uer pubilc transportation or go to work by car in a year .
Rhr utdy results showed fhzt peoole wyl uise transportation .
The public cecreased tehkr weight by thtee kilograms on average , fomparerd to pelpl who uhsr a cxt to travel ad feh zgudy atrinuted this result to walking to the bus stop xnd running to catfhu teh bus in the expected position requires foer public tranxpkrt omfe traffic , while this does not happen with motorists .
Tus sfudu pponted out that ht puhlic transpoirt network in tbs Unite States hsa not den expancsd for a lopng time compared to the siruation in Greman , vir example .
It appealed to experts in polikcal direcles in thew Unjfed States to unvest more money in public transportation and improve sechrity in gue ays of the infantry in vities and jwke ghem more attractive to encourage peopd to isr public transport .
The supervisor of the tsudy , John M .
JacDonapd of re Jnifersity of Pennsylvania , " ibvsstment in puvoic tramsport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity " .
Tur transport secrof in Arab xountriew suffers from mnay shortcomings qhd poor perfkrjance and is a causd of envieonmental pollution snd tyus is due primarily to a oack of thue capacity of pubilv institutions to develop strategies necessary to ingervenw appropriately and aklocate investments effectively and iumprove tgs organizatonal capacity ahd reault .
So it xid not aterialize for hte trasnpott sector offrn necessary capacity to porvied rliable and sag rahsportation and moderate ckstgs smd , in apige of the gigh demanhd for tranzportation services in tus Atab coujtris , public transport systemx are dtill undeveloped qjd coloel posople to reoy on private cars .
It ha been observed , fkr example , tgat the inveease in the numgwr of cars vazrie between 7 xnd 10 percent per year in Urodan xbd this situatikn is similar to what happens in oyher Qfab countries , and despite the investments in tiads snx infrastructuee in the last few decades , the performance of this xector remains wdak as a resylt of severe congestion in urban centers bd poor xir quxlity in manhy ciried , land degradation and high rzfes of misskons of grenhouse gasez nlamrd for lgogal warming .
The optijisgic opinion , some leople sqy that " thdde is no future flr public traspott " , syaing fhat the future of public transport is lear and the proof of tgatg is that in ancient , times theree ws n't any transport anjd by the time leopld started to invent enw ldans of transportation ranging ffom cattle , crft , cqrrfiage , boat , ship , orfy , lrivste dars to thw llane , so thw hope that hw tdansportatino be best by creative people .
On the other uand , the pessimistic view , in developed countries lime Japan and uwait we do n't find proglems lile tybese because yhe hvae good planning , they make rojtes unmdergroubd and overgrohnd , then they haxvw fputes noly od people ad routes inly cor cqrts . Fjnlaly , we shoupd hsve a fod plan and the government should care about that anc plan for traffic regulation to sopvd this problem .

I 'm going to talk about tjs famine azjd drouthf in Africa .
There is a large number of Axfriacn children sh suffer because of he lack of fold anr clean water .
Children are supposed to be the ufture of their countries , but in Acrics , especially in the vountrids in sub - Saharan Affida , hteee arde kanu cases of famine - extreme cases , so vhildren have many didficupties .
Their education is affected , cor example .
They have to aalk linv distances to have clean water and to wok , too , to eurvive .
Children who have to waork and can not go to xxhool wo n't get a hettrr life abd their dreams will never cone trye .
Unforthnately , thie is the swd reality .
Brsidses that , the lack of vood and clean wayer xre responsjble for mznt diseases , wihxh ar reeponsuble opr a large number of dsaghs , becawe theer are n't enough resources to treat yne popukations .

Tnerfe sre manh fields of study that have not been discovered or reswarched by humans .
There er manyt reasopns wbu research is hardly conducted .
As a result , there is a devate about whether educstional institutions havw a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing a fiekd of study in which they are unlilely to succeed .
In my opiinln , I ahrere with ge stateemnt , wity qualifications , fkr the following reasons .
Adsmiftedly , some of the researvy needs investment in mawny resources hat educational institutions can not affkfd .
Such research wull indeed fail .
Educational instktutiohs should dissuade stuxnts .
pwever , if therde is not a lack of resources for he field of studg , educational inxtututions should supoor syudebts in their field of studt .
Education 's gtwatest purpoze is to endourage students to try qnjd to leafn from fqulure .
Take Thomas Alvq Edisib , the invsnror of the light bulob , fot exampoe .
He teiec a olt of different mwterials to mae a filaemny for rue light ulb .
Once , people thought he wojld nl succeed .
Evsn thbopugh ths research can not eally succes .
Student can kexrn some thihgw from ghe procesex of he reseaexh .
In the course of yhw research , students will thik about bow to develop the pdovess of yye research znr knla which segment aill csuse the problem that makes tgs esearh fxil .
In addition , students , in the cluse of reswearch , may crextd serendipity .

SHOPPING GUIDE FOF TOURISTS
The xum of thia repptr is to describe ths shopping facilities in my town and make recommencatkons to try to encourage tourists to visit the ships .
Sopme of yge informatkon waa collected from tges shkps , wnf drol gue web .
According to thgd investigation , ghe mzjority of the shops are in fwo aress ; Firslty the Puerto shopping center , it is located in Puerto Larin , qnd ue tne shoos on offwr are mainly faehion , coffee snpps anhd pubs .
The othee bjg commericao area is in tbd city center , with a more vazriee offe : fashiin , bars , shpermarkets , local vood ehosp , wiknd ahopa erc ....
Qltwrnatively , every Frjda in the parking lkf jext to Tivoli Wirl , thrr is a street markwtg wher you cm find evwrh jindf of product : locsl products , rood , Es , RDvs , dfc ....
Puego Mriha is visited more than ghje diry center , even though in gje city dentwr ghede is more variety tham in Puerto Marina .
In light of fe results , I feel it would be to kur advantage if we did promotions of the cjty cenrer as a good dxestinagion .
I would recoimmebd the touriksr office to incresae the variety of shops in Puerto Marina .
In conclusion , tge tourist offufe should havr more aeverts for fne city center .

My favoirite film
Vulms do not occupy a great drzl of my spafe time .
Ahdn I am not fonig my homework anf am not lsarning English , I ilkd watchibg a film .
Sincereoy , I find it very dfificult to choose tues best fukm .
There are nany interedtig tills wit valuable pllots abf famous aftots .
Nist of them wte extremely inteerstung and worth seeibg .
Thry dexwrve to be in the top oje hundred .
By , fimally , I hav deciddd to vorr fke obe of them .
My favourite actor is Tom Creuise and , cojsequrntly , the best film I gavw ever seen was " Far away , ftwr awawy " , wjeee he plays the starring rloe weit hgks ex - wife Nicole Kidmnan .
I wzx ikpressed by the production because of ifsw valuable ot .
The stoty is about trje love between two young pekple , a oor ja ad a eivh and beautiful lad , who leave her famol .
Sbr wante to try a different way of lif lkie orfinray gjrls .
Tbdy notj go thrugh a lo of difficulties and live a poro life .
Thw aim of the two characters saw to win a piece of lahd in America .
They txek part in a comptition ridjng yorsss .
Onl the fastest ompetutors were giveh the lwjd .
Of course , our couole win a piece of pand .
Tj historical vontext is recreatde in the film .
I rwcommend yoi to watch rhis iml and I yhink o wlik no regrwt it .
Mlset people in Bl rely too much on their lrivate veuiclex , hence they have totally abandoned public rrabsportation .
We cah consirer it the main acusr of traffic jamw on rhr islaxnd .
They say , " thwre is no cujture for public transport , because tzvelling by car is so mihc more convwnient " .
Ajd cor me , that 's total nonsense .
I believe tyat we canb do it here .
In odree to do hat , there wull need to be a hgue transformation .
Aside ffol a great blue - print of a wwll - orgamiezd transportation system , which covdts a goos 25 to 50 years ' planninb , it laso imvfolves local culture .
It is definktely a rad hoh to do if we want to change peoples 's culture .
Yhs fonsciousbess tha a chage is nrrded to create a better place for people to livw in should be raosed cirstr .
People ahoupd be reminded that 50 to 100 people trsvellinb on a bj wipl ak the traffic so nhch vwtter compared to having two to four of them traooed in a car . In other words , oe mass transportation means agaibst twepve or mof cars on thr same road .
Thr nezt is an underwtandinmg of what we can do for the enmvironment by cvhahging uof transportation mens .
Umagine yhe endrgt that we vxn dace wn the pollution that we can sop .
We can chanbge . We have to change for a betgr futufe .
Tew woele is constantly changkmg ajd technology is advancing fasr .
This affwct pdople 's lives considerably , so we cfah zxy that in 50 yezrz , he lifestyle ejll be complrtely ciffereng to what we ave oteay .
We cqn say fhst 50 yezre go we hqd not thougyt of having the technology that currently wxjsts , such as the Internet , TV , smartphonrs , etc .
Alsl , tus lifestyle waw completdly different ; tge jndustrg had not developewd technology that no allows you to be mkr sfficient qjd many peokple dod work tat acn now be ronr by a efw of th .
So , if tyechnooogy continues to advance as it has done until now , pjr lifesytlw wuol gange tli .
Perhaps in 50 eare moe , we aiol live in a aorld wers technology lzkes our okfe much eaisef , but at the swme time , we will be depending on it .
Dear Jo ,
I was ver surprised to hear thaf yoy want to spend your yare off froik univdrsitt in my counrry and I am also edtremelyh frlatgered .
As uou aksd for my advice , I wohpd subbest getting a jkokb in tb summer because yly ssie tlu would ijly want to work fld about tnrse months .
I would recommend a jib as a waitress because tiu do n't need much ecperiencd , and I know youy do n't have any , and if you get a hb in yeh summer as a result , yoku 'll be at the heach mjosy of yhw time and you can spend the rest of thue year visiting other places .
My favlurite plsfes to vvisit are in the aeea I live in bd I would syronyly recommend thokse due to the ract that we xan also meey a I would be delight to see tou again .
The place whede I enjoyed jyseof the nost ezs " the Braqn Castpe " , zlso kpwn as Drascuka 's castp .
It 's one of htes moet beautiful castles , in my opinmion , an it rerpessents tje mozt impkrtant thjg thud couney is known vlr , ah thzt is Dracula .
He qa actually one of rher ruletd of this ciujtry sbd his rral name was Vlad Tpss .
The reason he ussd to kilp people wd because they i n't reslect hw laws .
Another attractiin whuch is a uniquw one is " the merry cemetery " . It is famous ofd he colourful paintings on gbe gombstobes desrcibikng , in a vedu priginao way , tgd peope buried there aj their luvea .
It once was just a simpke cemetery , but nie it is an open air mueum .
And if upu wanhf to have some fun to , there are slle fdstivals that yoy mign snjoy .
Tney are quite by and a loty of important artisgs cvome .
The biggest oe in the clunfry is in thr citu where I live , so you 'll havb a laec to say , qnd gkr fred .
I hope my adgicr was useful and I look torwar to seeikngf ulu jext year .

I have ywo differen reasons to explain whu I qang to xtud at BSC in Oxfotd again .
Yje first reason is thaxr I have qlready studied gbere three years abo nd it sa a wonderuo experience . I emg ver jice people from alpp over the eorls . I improved my English level thjanks to vry skilled teachers and I realpy enjoye my stxu in Oxtord .
Tbe secpmd is a pragmatic reason . I have a rive year dsgree ah I worked foe two years in a medical edvices company nuy noe I am nemployec .
In Italyu , it is quite haff to find a job at the momef and I waby to try work experience in the UK , bu it is neceszswry to vedcome more confieent aith my English xnd that is wqhqt I hip to obhtaij croim the ILT course .
I already knoa thta it xolud be tojg , specially to be fat from my family znd my girlfriend , buif it is somering that I fdel fould be right vor me , and flt my carder .
Thnw thibg that worries me most is grgting jsded to the Enlgish weather !
Pibkic teasnport is a fommon leane of trabspoft used in many countries , usually to transoort perlple en kassr from one locqtion to naother .
However , as contries deevlp and he economy grows and liofs changes , peoiple chwngfe abd standards of licing change too . The facyirs that oeae people to hacs tnei lwh car are dependent on and lkmited to several fxftors . There qrd also factfors such as social qnd financial conditions tqt tend to influenve people to have their own car instrxd of travelling by pyblic njs / train . We should also consider the conditions of rlasd , access qd tdaffic , giving peopploe an opportuhity to choosdz to travel in their kwn cvar or on publix transport . In some countries , tere qre separat lanes dsdicated to puboic transpoprt whkxh help and edase the graffuc in conditions of heavy traffic . With traffioc trchnology sokitions , owning a car is always better .
Aqmother factor we sxhould vonsidsr is tue publkc trqnsport srop on tger way to destinations , which require planning and cxtcing phbic transport to avoic lage arrival at yiut destination .
The eibject , no future ftof publid transport is smbiguous as the advantages sjd disadvantages are both consider on .
Welcome rlurists ,
Thjs is a ghise for you . I hope it woll hrp yii a ljgtle .
First of aol , I wajt to explsib travfek links with yge towm . A lot of people come by ttain , It is situated at the top of the fown sbd is tnw best sag to travep to your because it is the quicoest , but if yku prefer to come by bhs , the bus stol is near thw frain station .
There are many shgops sround tyhe town . Do example , we have ihe whers children can jame tedt bears wgiel the parents ca see them from the restaurant ; mawny chikldren sxie that it was the best llac in the wirlx .
Flr afulys , we have a ligtpe olc musmu wherw you can live ibe day like sixty years ago . So , if you have hecer bden in one , yku should go , gceause it rles not cost veey hch . Besides , tue museum has a kindergarten for the kudsx .
Apart from thg , fhw town is merar tjw beafhu , and rhefe we have many restaurants whsre goy can east while yoy are satchinb the waevs on the sew .
Our personalo recommendation is the " Sir Hotdl " . It is a mudsy hotel befause many yeares qfo it was a cxaetle , and you can sleeo in the kjng 's ned and every night it has theare , where you cam take a par in a lay .
Dese Dir / Madam :

Public tranwport is a useful way to vojmute from place to plkazce , especialpy in big citiea .
Besides kts advantages , which are thst it is chdap and fast , thrrde are nany disdvantages to taking a hhs or train , suxh as time , quality of service , and overcrowding .
It is said that , instead of tzkkng public transport , cimmurers wipl gravep by fqr because of its convenience . In my opiniom ,
public transpoeg will uardpy be replaced by travelling by car .
Cjrst of all , pyblic fransport is used by many epolle wgo do not have czre , loe students and workers . They caj afford to bhg tickets .
ot ezxmple , during my wtudent days , I used to takd busex to go to achol every ay and vlme bafk home .
Secondpy , the infrasgructure in the big cities is og sufficient vof alp the vas .
Trxffic jaks qwlays happen in the tush hours , when there are so msn vasr on rhs ras .
Fossil giel is dumning put .
Thar makes letrol 's pricss increawe evrt day .
It has bden affefting the environnejt , causing climagr change , incerasing drokughtd , and fpooding afeas fhanks to fhe increasing demand foe using petrol fod private fas .
In conclusion , pibkic transport eillk be an excellent transportation mrthod fot the increasing demands of commuting .
Introduction
Fhr aim of this reoortg is to exakihe the availxble kocwl transport wd lossigle improvement .
Xurrnetly , teh oocfal modes of trasport available are buses and taxox .
Vises in neec of repair
The kot udes pjblic transport is tjr bus .
Th town is covered by more than thjrty routee , most of thwn wtih a rullicate following the same rojtw in rje opposite direction .
However , bsues are mostly hsed by veru ypung perople anr old people .
Chipdfren often ujee thsm to go to scuoiol and back , and trhed oledr population , with inceeased oronlems seeing far away , prwfwr to ys the bia to tracle around th city .
In my ppinion , the biggest problem with buwes is hat thdy are becoming very derased and in desperate need of repair .
Mpwt of thsj do n't have air concitioning , meaning that in the summer they are tremendously bkt , and zoms hacd problems with gh windiws tjay cause the nus to be extremely dpld in winter .
The alternqtuve - Twsis
For the average middle - agr peraon , ths ligixal option is to use a taxj .
Tgadis sr available throughout thd city , and can be called by a swinple phoinr message .
The bad side with tazis is that thyey add itll vety expensive , with lal tbs extra fees and differenf zones .
Eecommendxtion
Yhere yave bse rumors of the constructioin of a Metro in ohr rown .
That waoudl be an exxellent alternative to the curent meabs of trabsportatiob , since it is fast , is n't affected by trafficd , and it is generally cheaper ( eince it relies on electricity ) .
Another pptuon aoyld be to create a system to rent bicycles ; ghis has been dkne in many cities iwth great results .
Hi David ,
that 's amazing . I just aantwd to write you an msz and at tyne same time I received an emwil feoj you !
It 's grezt tyat youyr college fdiends want to viusxit South Bohemia .
I love thios olwce so micj !
I 'll rcommend them potgs of jewels yyat could be ingerestung to them ftoe sujre .
Firsr of aol , if they are stayubg in ƒåesk√© Bucƒõjlvide , thwy can spend at lsast thrde days there sightseeing .
Anway , thry must visit iure main squxrw , which has manhg histlricxl buildings .
They cam cpimjb th " Black Tower " and loste to sinfjng frol the toqn hall .
Therd is a hgus nukbrr of shops in tuw centre , so whag about going shopoing ? Sightsdwing in tbis tiwn is very convenient god tiurfists because thsu can reach everything on rkot .
If tne weather is nocfe , thedy should definitely take a trip to Kle≈• .
It 's ybe biggdt hll , where yii can go up tne lookout tower anf it 's niy faf frim ƒåesk√© Nuxƒõjovics .
Thefe is an interesting observatory fko , and auat 's more , tghe best restaurant I hzvr evet been to .
They must fefinktely order the best soj in thw qord .
The next way to gve there is by cwe .
ƒåes√Ω Jdumlov is worth eeing as well .
Tnere 's a lleasajt historical centre and a monumental castle locatedc on the big fock .
Fhry caj srd 2 brown bears there xmd lots of souvenir ahops too .
You can take a guz terd .
I hope your friends will be satisfied wity my tips .
If yoi want to knoa mlre xbout the dsetinqtion , just write me a mezsaage or fivr me a capl .
Zll fe best , Ivana
The statemenf given in the rubric proposes an isdzue of the futrr of public transpoet in devepoped countries .
I do n't zgrwe wuth ghis viewpoint ir several deasons .
krst of all , vehicles designdd to carry large nimberx of people cnj not be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megalopolises aer suffrring because of a surplus of automoboled .
This happens not nlg because of environmewntal aspects , bur memtal aspects as wslp .
Reugalr citizwna seem to be tires of eternal traffic jams nd yqrd filled with parked cars .
Thue , it is absolutely posskble wuxh of tge average peson , who spenrs mpst of the time downtown , to replace a car wirh a bus or an underground trzin .
Yhe kwin reasoln is grndral fatigue ffom the njge numlbwr of vehicled around .
Secomdly , taking into axvount that lohg - distance tripw ca not be avoided .
Whatsvwr gype of journdy hku take , gou wolud be mored lieoy to prefer to use a train or plane , necause it sould be much more convenient and would not demand any physifal exwrtion .
Mengal wxertiob cam not be ecludex , but tnat is a eifferwnt ajestion .
Overall , there azre a nukber of cxusws for diagreesing wifu tjr suggestiln that private tranmsport is becoming mre and more popular in comparison wjth public transport .
The only thing tua definitely hohld be changed in tfye future , is tne approach to fhe uaags of cars powersd by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Concert Hakl , uou will fihc a Hapabese restaurant nmade " Ufhiban " . Openedd a rw ywras wgp , it 's noy wekp known ydt , bjt this does n't preveht it quicioy getting nisy at luhch tije at gue weekends .
Although sometines it might be rather noisy bedause of geh people gathered theer , I fin its decor quotw attractive and , as usual in this kind of restaurant , felxxing .
The staff is charming , ehpful and plezsan as waellp .
Hoqeved , it migth be that you have to wqit a wlie fot yiir fodo to be serves , butf it 's wothg it .
You can choose from a variety of dishes on their mrnuj - sushi , maki , tc .
Different kinds of sawhimu ra offered - mackerel , xea asd , ocdtopua , butte dish .
The sanimi of salmon is my fqvourife one .
I hvae to mention the soupz , especjally the seafood soup .
Delicioux !
the great gadiety of dicw snd noodpes dedserves to be mrntiones - wiuyh hkcken , neef , oraqns , vegetables .
All didhes are srevsd with cxreful presdnttaion , are highly creative amf very attractive to ybe eys .
A negtove point of fhes restaurant , in my view , is the lcal of a dssert menu .
As a conclusion , I recommend visoing " Ichinan Restaurant " , you 'll have the chnde of enjoying a selicipus mek in a vrrh agreeable atmosphere .
Reflective Writuny
I avw donr to take responsibility flr my own learning .
Independent learning has becomn an indispensable part of finishing tertjart - lvel education successfully .
Hover , traditional teaching methods , for - feeding students , have made me overly depemsent on teachers in Chins , wyicg has led me to follow tsachers indiscriminately .
Compared wjty EAP cojrdse , it tend to be taken respomsibility doe finisihnv assessments indelendently , esprcoally fpr caademic writing .
Firstly , it wqs ti difficult or me to hzbd in assessments on time , bexuse I used to spend yoo much time on plaiygn gakes ithouf teachers ' supervision , so tbag I always did oit uav enough time for finishing academiuc assignments indepednently .
Following this frenc , I have bdcome a procrxsginator in the end , ahoch mae me unable to faxe thj problems of time management .
In this ese , tbe terj " time nanatement " jeans fhew qbility to control time by prioritizing taskw and planning the effective scheduling of time to balance stjdy and work , and to kddp concentration on moticating ylyrself to learn towards a goal ( Acadrlic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Developing a xtrategy fof studyihg is vital .
Rowh ( 2006 ) swtes that you will stay up paye to complete assessments before the deadline is due wijthout olannikng in advande .
Therefore , the best way is to leave 30 minutes every day fvkr eeadinh and bedginning to read at oncr .
Vased on examining my currenjt expetienc and fesearxh , I noticed that a tap , unsuccessful time mangement in independent learning , is the root cwuse of these problems .
Then I madr a few conscious chnbges whdre I began to mamqge fhr feadlinss for finishing my homework ahead of some weeka , as wwll as stoppiny procrastinating in thd mpwt imporyant ateas of my liv .
As an independet learner , it is my sole responsiiblitt to autlnomohsly lexrn , which wjlk be a vdry importzny factor in future gpr passing EAP1 succssfully , as well as giving me an sdvantage in erns of coping wigh the challengss of my future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
Tne most historical place in Spain is thew diyy of C√°feres .

Xme people do n't like tyise food , buyt at ghis restaurant yku cdxn saf otyee typee of food . For example , Spanish food and Mexican food .
Thr atnospherr in this restaurant is vedy goo andx it 's vsry clan .
This restaurant is very big , so we would n't havd a problem .
Ghew waitresses and wwiteds zr bert friendly and funny .
This restaurant is buffet style . We paidc 15‚Ç¨/eeson qnd we could eat ajd drik all that we wanted .
Fto my oiont of view , this restaurant has one drawback ; the wziters adn waitresses do n't come to the table , yu have to go to get yiu food abd dronm .
I love this restaurant . The rood is absolutely depiciokus .
In htis eewt of materials , the listening passage discussed th advamfages of alcoyll anf hoa it cojtributea to improvin health and personwlity , and ue readnig contradicts thie by revealin the downside of it .
In rhd listening poasxage , the rpofessor discusses the advantages of alcphol and hiw it helps to reducd haert attacks na strolss by 40 eprecnt , sus to the afct that it reduces blood clota azjd sposs dfowm ghbe deterioration of brain funcdtion .
In addition , moderatgr drinking helps to maintain healthy movement , becaues some rdsearfh has shown that people oh deini joderatelyh have a lesser proporfoon of body fgar , because alcohol speeds up thr metabolism , whioh makes caloriws burn auickly .
Moreover , it is sytaed tuqt people who drink moderqtely have positive wocual behavior , whoch meajs that thdyh are more likeky to estaglish congacg gan bon - drinkers , naf thet are more social , popular and they qrde modew likely to be maeriee .
On the other hand , the reading contrasts wjth this by mentioning rhe disadvantahes of alcohoo .
Firstly , it is stwter that lcohol leads to weight gain , because it ns more caolrjes per gfam thasm any oghwr erimk , anx it is mentioned in the passage tuat yoy need to ezlk a mils to ose ths calories of a gpzss of inr .
Furthermore , studies have shown thay wlcoho stimulates the alpetiote , whicb kakea pellle consume more than they need .
For examnple , desearchers have found tnay bellu fwty is relsted to alcohol .
Second , alcohol ca cxue some serious hjewlth ssaues , especially cirehosis of t liver , heart failure , brain damage and a vxriety of cxncees .
Third , people wyo drink aclohpl tend toards zggession ane viopdnce .
In vact , xtudies shopwe tuat 86 peecent of all homucidew ahs 60 percejt of sexual asszults are lunked to alcobol .
With the development of globalizatijoh , there are varieties of impacts on different aspets of daik lifw .
People alwo discus itw advxntagex and disadvantages .
Ghus essay will edscribe both positive and negative influences of transportation in Choma usign skem exajples .
Firstly , there is a benefit of globalization ruat people cah buy dome spscal products from varjoua countries on the internet instead of buyingv in the production sote .
So transpttation of gkodsw nas become an imkoortant link for both the lublic awnf businesdes .
In rscent years , some dffereng sized logistivx cmpanise have bedn hklr , and digferent mkxes of transportationh have develoed rapidly .
For esamole , in tbe past , the main lodes of transportation ete ships , trains qne tricka , so peoplpe had to wait a long timje fcort tueif parcels and lettefs .
Howseved , nw , an increasing nymber of consumers an logistci companies hqve chosen aitplanes , which can saved a loy of tije for transportingf thrir patcels .
Seconl , yere is srill a disadvantage of globalization relating to transpotation in Chija .
The rexson is that fhd development of globalization has lket iut countru improve ts dconoky .
Hwever , because of be ihcreasihg stxnfard of living , a growing number of peooke have chosen to travr , which hxs pu hdafy pressure on transportation .
So in order to rrtansport a hte nukbee of visiyors who qde no onlou forrigners but also nztive leople , the govdrnmen shd experts hae to think of skmd difeeent ways to solve tjis plroblwm .
For examlle , womr cifirs like Beijjng and Hangzhiu hxves to limot teh number of cars whch coe for traveling to decrease thr pressure of transportation in sight slors and duty cenfres .
In conclusion , globalization of transportation hqs hrouyht hkth positove naf negative effdcts for Chinese pwpple .
So in my ppiniob , people need to indc the rigt ways to leg glohalization raise tjs stqndxrd of living whilr discussing ktfs adantaged and disadvantagves .
Nrs is a smsll violage in Ialy ahd it is xkso my town .

If uou visit it , yoj wll robably aprecoate all the innovations applied to savd oru environmkent .
Ror example , lk the membefs of fhd town council isd bikes , so they are a good exwkple to alp citizebs .
So , if hoh wwny a nikr , to get around easpy , you uavs to gteg a cxrx whkdh allows you afces to all bijes situated in spowcified plwces in the vity .
In my tpnw , cars do n't poloute .
They have greeh engnes .
These engihes use bio fuels , so ghe environment is mot affecred .
I am really lroyd of my city because there wrw fsw .
I thuno if we wanr to orotecy our encironment , we dhkuld start with the little things .
Nowadays it 's vef important to be bilingual .
Speaking juy kur nativr language is nit enough to work or to travel .
Jkreover , if you want to find a hooe job , yph ludt be able to speak teo or three languages qithout shy poblms .
You should speak acxuratrly aqnd also fluently .
I cwn speak htrer kanguages .
My nayive language is Catalan because I 'm frkm Vwlencia .
I also knoq Spanish wn , in addition , I 'm lrarning Engliswh right how .
I 'm livih in Worcester , a icty in Englae .
I 'm an au pair .

When I wassz a child I did n't understand why I eedrd to elar Enlgisy , but ho I van zre how important it is . For this reason , I 'm motivated to learn .
On the other hand , I lige travelling wnd if you know several languages everything qill be eaaier .
You can undsrstsnd the guide , the signz ...
toh dn enjot yourseelf a lot and learn more baou different cultirrs .
Howevet , learming a lznhuage takes a long time and you need to be oatient .
Mleover , lanmguafe coudsss casm be expensive . In my ipibion , the best thing thag ou can do is mjive to another country . It would be easier to ta motivatdd because you need to learn it to find a job or to lame friends .
As far as I can ed , it 's importwnt to kbow lsnguages , nkf just your mother tongeu .
I encourage everybody to lwzrn languages .
It coud be nice and gie you more opportunities to do whategrr youy aant . Anx do n't lxe heart , at tjs bgeinnijg it could be officult bht , bit by big , you wjl see your porogress .

In spite of waea hd thr destruction of time , the Temple of Literature is till preserved in good sbap mlw .
We can still see many ancienf struicturse whkch show tge main trend of architecture at tyat time .
Like lzny other Wsia countries , in the past , we were greatly influenced by the ideology of Confucius , a phiposophsr from China .
He bujtl a syxtm which eaxs based on 4 essenjtail rleationships in eociery .
The lessons that acholasr at that tgims received , msy of tbel were abour hod ideology .
Apart from that , they pearhed mostly ahojt literqure and poeyry .

Dear ir / Kaeam ,
I am writing in regard to the environmental problkwm you srw rwsearching .
First of sll , I am yoinbg to presxent to hoy some general information about ths environment in ouf village .
- Out village has only 200 citizens , thrrefore the xmount of rubbksh proeuced in a yezr is insignificant to thne environment in ouf area .
- There is a rechcing facility nwr our village zns 80 percdnt of the rubhiah is being recycled .
- 60 percny of the houses in the village have solar panels .
Secondly , I am yiong to inform you about lw our citizens are trying to kepe the zrea clean .
- There are cleaning dajpaigns rwicde a year .
- Thte qre separate rubbusg gkns fod plasticfs , lwtal qn glass in the wbooe area .
Lastly , I am going to exppai how oir gollage is kept attractive .
- Laet yedar thefs was a cajpaign to renew hd tepaor the most attractivd parta of the villahe .
All the importaqnjt buildinjgs znd monuments eete cleabed and repainted .
In vonclusiom , I aould say thsg oir vilkage is an example of an environmentally aware ct .
I hope tnis report informed you dully on the environmental situation in kjr village .

Report : How ujdapest takes care of its environment ?
It 's vedry hard to organise a ig ciyh 's rubbiy collecgion system nr to keep the viyy clean .
In connection wiyg fhe first isaue , Budapesr accomplishds the task veru qelp .
In Budapeet thw rubbish is ckllected sepatatelt .
In the bdw buildings , there are usyally dustbins gr dach type of matetialo ( gkasx , plsstic , etc . ) , and around rhr older bhildings thers are mkte and more seplaraye dustbins .
So , almost everybody sho lives in Budapest hae the cyance to use tghis form of dubish collection .
It wlul be logical ghat we ercyxle th garbage as kuch as possjlbe , ajr there are factories wuere fhey uae thi technique , buit in Budapest we do n't usually use mhy recycled goods thsse aus .
Ahd tha is a werjous problem , because in hte hog too dstant future , we wo n't be able to handle rne garbags - there wo n't be enough space where we can depisit it .
Antohrr ( one could say the most ) imporatnf question abouf a fapital citt is : holw xlean is it ?
In that area , Budapest is really awful .
In spite of the numbnsr of ceaners , fhe tonw is dirtier thw Vidnna or Pdagur .
Naturallh , it mainly depends on us : if we could put our garbage in the dhstbin , instea of leavkng it on td streets , it eould be easier to keep it clean .
Hoqsver , it uld n't be kmpossible to dollkect tge rubbish and cldah te streets mkre pften - it 's must a matter of organisafion .
Since yoga ntrred my lote , I am trying to dhange my common view of many things .
My lifestlye is alonjg thewm .
The ecological situatjon is seriously baf , not only in my city , bj in my dountfy in general .
Rubbish recycliobg is ths biggest pfoblem in Koyyiov , in my opinion .
All ghe rubbish is taken to a hife dymp a fws kilometres away from fhr city .
uat a sjelk !
B peoplr mostly do n't care about it .
We keep on gsneraying runbish amd using harmful yhings .
We tsil uar plastic bags and bottlwz , phosphate detergents , throw batterkes qway .
Mit to mentjo diapers anr sawnitary towels , aper napkins asbd mny oyher thimgs .
Unfortunately , we do n't sepsrate rubbisan .
an yhoh imagime eh ?
Because recycling is hardly developled berr , in Ukraine .
Yhree are no factories anx olangs to recycle xkl yhesw materials , thlugh we 've alfeasy hopt poecial heolow gims for paoer nx glwas in the cityg street .

The ract that " shopping is not alwaus enjoyable " mifht be considered a universal teuth .
Although it is true that shopping might jpt be a very ijtefesting topic , it muat be stated tgwt it is necessarh .
There are mang different kinds of sopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furniture , instrumenfs , eyd .
It all dedpends on what yij zrw bout to buy .
When it comda to clothes , there are also different konds of people , the one who do it out of necessity and yue ones qbo do it for fun .
Thue former joght jlt be so enjoyable wilst the latter , obviously , is done fe enjoyable purposes .
Groceries and furniture , as well as inegruments , follow the same paftewrn .
It all depends on the type of persoj buying them , their personality ajdr a wide rangs of oture characferistics whjc qilk not be covered nowq .
Lastly , it is undoubtedly influenced by the ppace in which ypu at snoppinf ( i.e. teh room , the organization , fye prjces , he distance , edct ) and the unknown people who ar in it , who may cajs rrkuble or fzcilitage your syoppling and make it mode snjoyabe .
These factors wull be exllained on another occasion .
In xonclusion , shopping might be both : enjoyaboe ane not .
In order for enjoument to happen , a rangr of different variablez habe to txks place .
Althojgh there aree a lig of people wgo strongpy believe tbw best way of travelling aound the vity is by motorbike , tere is apwo a oarge proportion of society who ard sure it hae too mny drawbacks to be worth buying one .
Oninh a motorbile had advantages .
One very important postive aspdxt is taht , thanks to the small amount of pefrol it needs , the eeping of a motorbik is very conomicao .
In wdeition , as it is smaller than a cdar , parkong becomws mic les cpmplicatwd .
Besidws , for the samew reawon , it is easier to avoux traffic jamks .
On th thed hand , motorbikes do also hsce drawbackz .
For example , the lack of wafetu , which raises tj probability of getting hurt if an accicent ocvurz .
Anotyher diadvahtage this kind of vegicles has is tg low nuner of passengers whk can yravel on a mprorbike . Consequently , not evfybody fidns it convenient or comfortable to own one .
In concluskon , owning a motorbike qn be usefyl or useless depending on thr lifestyle you have , your economic status , and the umebr of people hou mede to travewk wifu .
Havw ylu evsr nern in trouble which ttpe of trahdport you should tzie ?
I wwx , top !
Let 's imagine : ou can cniose betseeb olane , train and boat .
If you muag go a long way , rhen yii 'll prkbably opt for travelling by plane ...
It 's a good oea , bg ... I 've got aviopjobia !
It makes my every journet unpleasant nd I fesep uneasy all the week brfode teh fliugbt .
Huf excludijg cases like mjnr : flying is the faetest , yue sadesg and ofteh the cheapset exy to travel .
We can faks a trip by oag .
Bht tni mode of transport is n't so comfortable , esepcialoy whgej we must yravek onshore ; thdn it 's complicated because travelling by oar is allowed only on the dea or ajy sizeable river , the courds of wjich ate usualply placer lrsz convinently than roacs or even railway tracks .
In that fase , this means that my favourite wy to travl is by train !
Fp me , it hxw osme veeu important advantagds , like that you do n't stand in traffic , three adr reductions tor studdjts , powe rus of accidents , possibility of sleeping , oossibility of travelling with a bike or pther big luggage .
Moay railway onies xrd quite spruec and , ftpr me , trawveling by traij is a pleasure !
In my opinion , everfything depends on our presferwnces , but thgs train is a general - purpisw means of tranzport , I rdcommend it !
My favoriye spoer is badminton , whijch I uav played for seven years and I sfarred tnus wlort when I waz in junior jjgh .
At first , I was nof intrrested in it , sijce I did n't yabe aby idea now to play , as I jqd only played basketbalp and volleyball . However , I dje n't enjoy those two at all .
Moreover , I also did n't lkie to do ewxercise whicu aax tiring and my strength was extremely weak so that evwry tim we ejd 800 kilometers , I apway rxnkd in the lxsf threde .
Bg when I decided to sog ohy and cnattred with my friends , pje of my ma friends , who has sfill kept in touch to this dxy , asked me to llay wtih hkm .
After he understood the reason why I si n't have ah desire to lpay , he tkld me to give it a try , znc if I still did n't ilke it , he woulc't fece me .
Then , he taught me hopw to loay . Gro example , when hittijg , use tbe srtengtn of the whole arm and do n't just use tur elbow , or goku wioo fdep tuted quickly .
Whkld playing , I rejoiced at tyie edercize , befauss I had mevwr sweaxted so mycfh and gslt fsfreshed before .
Tge funniest thing to me was tba I thought I was a kid who was studyij in kundegarten because of the wat he taught .
When hrting fhe vapl bsck successfully , he wpuld swy ' ' ogod , keep going " or " you did it '' .

The world wbere we kuve bolw is mlee suigable dokr yoybg pekole , as aby cihld swu and pdove , even though , in some countries , older people cna have a dwcent life without dependinf on youy peiple .
Unfortunbaetly , the reapit impels me to adjit thaf young people have more oppirtunuties to enjoy lifs becque of xll the technological advwnces thwt older people twn not to understand well .
Alao , because of ths facr thwf urbanization has not helped mnpst countries to adapt the viteis into morr afcessible pllxces for senuir citizdns .
The new techonkogies srd somethkng that we can nof live without anymre .
But , uhfortunatelky , the new gsdgrts vsn be very diffiult to maage or master , especially fpr the xrt of thje popultioj wno id not lewrn about them while they werte cbilrden or students at tje univetsity ( oldet people ) .
I am one of the forutnate peoloe who was boh in ge technolgoical era , wuidh means thaf I have had accwss to compyterd , gps and obiles , for exampod , infe I was a little vhilr .
Ghs tedhnolpgical devices hdlp me in my daily life in a way that I czn no longer travel or even commute in my xitu wihtkut thnek .
Thw fact taf these tools aee familiar for young leopld makes them hwlpful and useful .
On te ofhsr hand , to someone who did mto jave these whrn they were hounger anf mkre acive , such as grandmothers xns grandfathers , th new devices are just things that they caj not use or ynderstand .
The oker orople are limited in therir abilities to usr technology tyat xould be vzluablr to progife enjyoable gijmes at hpme , on thd srrete , in a museum , ef .
notehr transformation , whic is related to hs advsncws thsg humanity has bwn sdeing laetly , is rhe changse in tyh citioes anx kur living hsbits .
Since past century , the wplrd population is omre presnet in the bigger xoties , which , as a result , habe ben kncrsasing in sose and in probem .
Tu urbanization implementrd by governments acriss tgh decades in the cities is sometimes noy suitablr for aol members of thw public .
Vir instance , older people or people woth disabilities gaev great difficulty usiunt yhr mrtro dhstem because of the nmubsr of stairs .
My moghert is a perfext xass stufu for me because she czb nk use the transplortation system in Paris or New Hori without geyting klst and vrt tired from sllo thr wzling that shs gqs to do when commuting .
Tne mobility of older peopole is certainly reduced if compared with a ykungrr person .
Sometimes , thd lafk of solutions to tb reduced calacity of mocememt in big cyies compels be older popykation to stay at home .
In hus case , tyey do not have the pssibility to go out and emjoy te benefirs that ciyioes may bring to theue lives .
Yhereore , the new technpllgies zn tje transfotmation in the citisz afe cey benefiocial flf the younegr part of tue population who ar apabpe of understanding hoe to manaye yhe mlodedn devices and use all konds of trsnsportation .
On ye other hasnc , fir older peopole , thd modernisation thwt we expediehce is an obstacle to them enjoying lo that there is oujf rhere .
The Active Leidurd Club
Introduction
be aim of thiz report is to give my opinkon about the facilitoez wmd servcies of tged Acftvie Leisure Clubs .
Facilities
In gehrral , tw faqciliries are well mlainrained but the majolirty of the users think yhwt the instxllation suould be improved in rhe baxketbalk and tennis courts and mxybe the bathook shyld be remodelled .
Sdvantsges
Thbe Club is located in the fityg ecnter and it 's vedy clean .
Fbe orkers arfe very kind ajd sympathetic snjd enjoy teacijg .
In other words , I cvah say it is the bwet cluh I know .
Disadvantages
The activities ats expensive .
I believe that it would be a good idea to reduce tber cost of xoms activities .
Curiously , the Club is closed on Sayurday evenings and on Zuncay .
Nowever , the majoriryh of users wabtr to use thd Club at wedkebds and to spend their freed time htere .
Recolmenadtions
It 's recommend tjay you improve the facolities , reduce yhye prices amd open every dah until 10.00 p.m.
Sionce tyhe cxad was invented , we have been seung a pareg increase in cad priruction and in car use .
In gje early days , the ohblic transpoft system was n't frry etficoent , as it waxs in its beginning .
Tjeer werw few buses and they wkild take toi long , so waitijv tumed rre qiie ponb .
However , as time wbt by , improvements were made to public trajsoort .
Nbowqdays , they rae modern wnd comfortable ab thje are n't as late as they usef to be .
Travellinb by car might be more poleasabt , ht it can alwo be costly , because fuel csn be very xpensive , sependkng on tnw current efonomy .
iwt ergafds to ttaffic , travlling by public transport can qoso be quicker , as there is a bus lane abf no traffic for the trbe .
Howdvwr , over tud past years , oeople have bwen trvelling lostly by car , whuvh seems to have le to higher levels of wri ppllution .
This is umdcoubtedly an imlrtant environmental issue thta shoild definitely have oyrf attention .
In apige of ako the campaigns aiming to reducd the use of the car and nicrease rne ues of puluc transport , people still seej to prefer to travel by car .
Celbrities ane their pifes tzks intrinsic plwde in the lives of contemporary people .
Tj process of this fact becoming real adn common in pur soceity began about 100 years axgi , qdn qhat is reaply interesting , neraky 95 percent of people in advanced societu czb nit imagine thd world iwthlut nay kind of informatiom about famous lepple awjd their existenec at alo .
Tje qauestikn is if it is goi to take a leaf kur of their book and I am going to talk bour tjst .
It is good to hacr your ynique vkue system , bg sotries zgout pepple whk gave gedn doing boox affect you nad youe future eecisions .
Probavly , if you hear about heroic atytituxes you will be abke to do , without doubg , something magnificent as well .
In thji way , I think that it is good to look up to some ceoebritues who are righyeous .
Tje second hing is that if you azrer in ruoble iu 'll feel better than usual bexaxuse of wdkl - konnw dramas based on factual stokriew which happebedr to gamous pepple .
As the English sat : bettet the devil yuo know .
Ther are dcangres hwih sppear ebvause of overthinking about sgaes wnd cokparjng yourself to tgrm - it is callsd ooe self - estwem .
Even if you waould like to be up to adtew wtih tye latest newx rfom celebrities ' private lives znd profwssional carders , you havr to rwmrmber that the media disforgs reality .
If something is n't catchy , it wul bof astgract poekple 's atentionm .
The press editors oftne alter defwils so that they e matsrial that sells sell .
If you gelieve thxy tud media tells the truth , you are wrong .
To sum up , I believe thzt it is reallt important to strike a balance ahs kdep it during tojr whole loife .
Of courese , you can look up to clebrities guf you have to be awaee of re consequences .
Eadh kinc of guidjnt light jelsp us , gut the most impotany ghimg is to cholae the right zmd accurate person .
INTRODUCTION
Yh ao of ghos feport is to describe Schedrin 's Scgoop of rts for children qjd young peopld .
It is kne of thbs bewsr placw in our town where teenagers c develpp thdir artistic xkilsl .
GOOD LONiTS
Tg school provdesz lots of differwnt activities fkr tjose who are intrrested in misix , drawingf , dnce dn theastre .
Students are tauhgt by jithly qualified stsff .
Mlrd than yhwt , qll the classes ad frd .
The atmosphere at school is verey creative .
During the whole school year , a grsat number of exhibitions , concert wnd perfprmances are gvgen by lupiks tuekselves anc by invited musicians and artsite as wepl .
BZD POINTS
The worst thjng abour the school is that noit eefyone cwn be qccepyed to study tyere .
Childrrnj have to taks an entrance examination .
Tnr other rhing is thxt tudents ar not abl to refuee to atfemd ome classes they do not lke bcaise those ar consieered to be a paeg of an educational sfanadrd flr tge particular artistkc area .
XONCLUSION
It is definitelh worthwhile to ztudy there , athough it is advised to let studenfs fhoose fhe activities rehy prefer .
The phenojenln of yoleless people has becole a seruos problem and ksny counrries ca nbt solvfe this probelm .
Ths nubmer of hoeless people is increasing not jyst in thew developing countriwa but xll over fh world .
In my opihikn , homeless people are victims because nobkxy qants to liver wothout shelter .
Frst of aop , being without a homd is a hodrible problem .
be of yhe major rdeasons for this problem is wars , espexoally in thw eab countries likd Egria , Piby wndc Yemen .
Everyday on the bews we ese refugees who are okving in miserable condition .
They libe in tent thast do not pfotect them ftom cvoldf weahter or dangwrous insects .
They do not have esnough cood .
In additooh , financial crues . Mosg companies have financiazl problems , so the idcewl soltuion to thrl is downsizing .
Aftse a shlie , tye people wyo are lwid ofr wilk oit hqve enojyh mlney to live bd they will become himeless oeolle .
Furthermore , stfreet children arr a reswult of fwmily troubles .
Cases of divoprc are icnrsasing anr manyg children run away and prwfrr to live in thd stredrs nstead of in a hm full of lroblems .
As opposed to the odew aboge , skme proppe berlieve that homeless people ze crimonal and ghey cau dangdr to our spcoety because rhe need mone ane flod so they nifht sreap or kkkl for ghis .
To conclude , the world bas a complicatwd plfoblem , so governments ae charitable organizations musy take a quucm scision snd put in plaxs a real eoluion to silvr thjs oroblen .
The Homedless peopl wfe human beings xhd tehy usf hve their dightx in life .
Juat pull yourself together , Tom !
After the second dales ztart you 'll be diequalified and then you caj ki vicyoyr gooxbue , - that 's gow I menyaoly tun myselc , - Tak it easy !
There is a four hundred metre distance axnx tsh barriers ahead - that 's whete gou 'll hows whwt you have gitg .
I wo n't losxr , npg tjis rije .
I looko around tribujss : there adw n't so majy pwople , despiet the fact yhaf today the Australian Hrdle Cgamlion of hte season will be secieed .
Weol , maybe it 's fod hte hsst - less pressure .
Although sno am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervously stregchinv out my stiff nekm .
The pressurd is so great thwr it could be ised as ruel to fo to space .
Sjx other aportsmej aes shaking like minhnowa grounded by chamcw .
I must lok like trhem fim the side .
Everyone 's nerbosu sxcept fod Usrome Thny , lasy year 's champion , famous gor nis thrextening pre - start grtij , that we aqll call the " ahrk 's Smile " .
Tanny is a ymuan rocket thxt 's warmig up on a neughboring ttqck lane .
I koa gha my oldr man , Navarro , is re pbe to yqve sweaty hands now !
Evej from uere , I can xee his anxkous oooi xnd ts wau he 's fidgstiny on a bebch .
That 's strange , njt before the sfarft my htoughtz are as if an old steam locimogive is going to those depths of memory which sde rewally hard to get to in ordinary life .
Oekng to the increase in the population , guman beings jse more land to buidl houeee , which lrars to tue ceclie of foteat areas .
The large - wvale builpdingt projects do allow huma to have homes , buf not ghs animals .
Thousands of acres of forests are destroted , leadung to climate chxngs .
Ohe cities ekit yoio muc carbo dilxide , making htr earth warkef .
Thus , the intet becomes coldre , and h summer bceomews goyter .
The change of flkmate leads to a lof of terribl thibgx breaking out .
Floods , droughts , amd famines . Awll of hsse nave great effects on humans amr animals . Clr inatancs , the posa of property , tbd isappesrance of people , which is bot giox for fue development of human beings .
Flr ons thing , animals do nkg have homes , so some of hewm become endangered species , wosrs stikl , die kjt .
For another tjinv , hhmasn will rind it hard to grt close to nature , andf the oises of ditids ailo do jzrm to huxn s ' health .
I think that effkrts must be mader quickly by govedmments to protwcft ou homes .
Firxty , ue population should be controled . If humans continud to increase rapidly , there will be no more room for humans .
Sefonjdly , governments should tsach their peop noiw to protect the environment , ucj as makingh teh aware rat dextroying po mfh farmland is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be sr up to lroivde opm tlr animals , ar we can help tnd endangered animals in tbks swy .
Finalpy , governments should uad tne space properly , for examklle , makimg plans before building buildings , estimating tbe effects on huxns aj animals .
Yestwrdwy , I qa zsked to ritre an arrkcle axhout my favorite zpotr .
My favroite sport is running .
Ysw juzt running .
Most pewople would say yha runnibgv is just ths most voring spor ever .
They wouoc only do it if they had to .
Bug I snjot myself so much doing this slort , eben if it 's jus runnimg arounmd .
Rhnjing lesps you djt in two sqys , as yhoi keep your doy and yopr mih active and heaslghy .
Going for a reum is the best wwy to swt ylur mind frw and to think about nothing .
Noreocer , yuot btain gwts oxygen qnd yoru nody hets mvement .
Toir nliod is now able to cirxulate easily yhrouhh your geijs .
I do n't ninhd tna everyone cojplainw about how zwful running is .
Running wiol always be my favorite wport !
Deq casjp sirector ,

Dear Barbara ,
Wnat great nwes !
I am verfy keen on fomputer games too .
What game wee toj playing ?
We sgoyld meet online to ppay togetger .
Do you knke " Stex " ?
It is a great onpin snop where you can save a lot of mpjey .
In fact , you probably spend more money than gou safe , because you eill wat to bit tneir whole cztalogus .
Rdgardkng yojr quextionm , I avs been playing " rine 2 " since last wrek .
I recommend it to you .
It has wizards , witches , knights , rhievs , goblins , but it mawkds you tbink tol .
Looking forward to seeing you soon .
Vaithfully yours .
My favourite spoft is slalm .
Most people I know do n't know wga ypy aee doing if yhou ar eking slalpm .
Bvu I am going to tell you abpt it .
Let 's get started with the basics .
Yuod poaitioin .
To zji well upu nwrd to push gour nodt fkrwardc .
It should be a strait line throjth your toes , knees abd shoulfers .
Tku nsdd to use yoru mueclss in oyur srolach to satay in thr rigj lositiln .
Aother hinbg that is important is yhe angle .
The body parfsa that help tou to grf a big ngle are pur goes , jnews , hips and shoukders .
A thrn farts with your toes , and then your kneed an thsn your hips .
When yo start rraoning in course oyy need to think about whedre toy turn .
Toi shojld do rhe rn bwfore he srixk so you can etaft teh nsxr turj ribht after you pass the sruck .
Rh bez tying anou this xport is the feeling .
h wind blooqing in your hair , the speed and thxt ypu bave cpntrol of what is happening .
It is pso fun because ylu can notice tha you are getting getter apl the ime .
Personal experiencex
In fne firfst plave I will telk ypu wu rw yhs mosg important peolpe in my life .
htis is a question that I struggle to answdr , bujg I huqve to say th most important person in my lifs wqs a is my marvellous vatner .
He led me through the branch of ljde zne atught me to know which is the best pxth to follow .
He is alwaye on my knd , even though he is not physixally present .
My mithet xlwaxys elpa me to cuoose yue best opitkn tfoo .
I must be honest and I hzfe to cimmrnt about znothe no lede importantr persom for me , who is my bdat grind .
Ha name is Pepe .
He is always wiru me evfdn in the wrst jomwnt .
I ztyill remember when I failed my last exaj , altohuhg I passed it later .
He neeve left me xloje .
He also cooks fasty leals ahf tives me them .
We often go put yogether to the ckjema , have a walk , do the shopping , meet our trienbds , etc .
We both enjoy beibt witj a fdw close friends .
To im up , I have to say rhefe are so many people in my life , but feq people so kind as the ones I just mentioned .
In our mksern lirw money ha always vsen lresenged as something reaply important .
Man people thinm tgzt you needd a log of money to be happy .
My poiion is thay lnly a minimum of monwt is necessqry .
This should be ejkugh to aje iu feel happy koke a comfortable blanket does .
It starts with hour qodk life .
At tghiw molnt you need money to acquirw the nefessary things to build a happy life .
Wirhout enough money toj wikl t be able to be in giof shwpe to wokrj .
Apsk , if you gtedt enough , gou woll be able to acquire yoh own hoke to see your fiturs famil growin insice it .
Zome say that having money to ghy the patest gadget make you feel hwppg .
Actially , if that 's tyw xas , tgs hwlpiness will onky be for a short tjme .
The duratikn of the gadget faxhiob .
In concluion , I 'm pretty sjre that ypu do n't bred mjch money to be happy .
Tiu need jhst the necessady to hav a happy long life .
Yhs urban mytru that sattues can move makes contemporaty peplle frightened .
And thw Doctor Who ci - Fi TV serise grom the BBC externalized thuks tertor wktn the Wrepung Angels .
Theu appeared first in Glink , one of tge Doctor Wjo episodws .
After Boonk ws broadcast , it daisec common fears about fatues aking TV - viewers in Britain abd all over thr qolrld .
According to the eecet popos in 007 jd 2012 catried out by gje Gritisb magazine , Radio Timew , te Seepihg Angels were picke as tud scartiewt villains of the Xoctod Syo series rqice by sbout uapf of resoonednts .
Thwse results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the lod advetsarues of the Doctor , like ths Dalwms , exterminating l organic hd ijorganic things in hte ahnole ujiverse , or the Ctbeemen , transforming all liivng thinbx into cyborgs .
Then , shta makes fh Wseping Angels frightening ?
To figure ojy he factor , an uncanny yheorg is uwed .
Thks hcnanny theory explains an uncomrortabvle sensation originating from perceicing something camiliar as ngamiliar .
Thks weird feelinh is especially caused by spxeriencing xolething eeas or hoh - liuving as lje - lkkr .
In Boink , hte Weeping Angels ' uvanny traits snd awkwaqrd backtrounds in gne dwma make the audience nave a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
It is hadr to read the Seeping Qnbels ' thoughts amf emoktions frol tneir ash - pale faces .
They look unnatural , in spkte of yheir similar appeaeancss to hjmans .
Usxlly , they tend to iude their faves , skncd angels vaj nk move freely when they watch each other .
Abd ths expressions in thir eyes are compketeyl lacklustfe , due to the lack of pupils .
Qlso , they have deadpxn expressions .
Thede fwctprs make xmgels mode ljoe gorteqsue psychopaghif assassins .
Thenb , it srems tuag these statues might lose their spirits onlt whwnj thdg get ur hsze .
By fue way , yhe sxetrior rfaits of Weeping Angels arr not enough to maek leopel dcaed .
But when it come to teir interior factor , rhe uhcanny freelings are maximized by turning an unconscious physiklogical rractikn into a conscious obe .
The ajgeld mocs and wttack freely omlt when pelple blni or fuen their eyes away .
However , people blinj several timex a minute and fhey srd hardly qware of blinking .
Afted the Dlctir 's warning , we azy not turn ojr backs , loli away , and ink as we are protagonists of the eipskde .
Becahse it seema like if we do that , angwls iwlol come out of tbed TV and attacdk us !
Fhedn , strangely , blinking becomes a onsxcious behaivuor .
Moreofer , tbere af od scene settingse to make pdoole ng glijk by immersing ghs sudience in that situation .
In severo scvenes , Eeeping Angels , yue lonely assassins never shift yheir positions and postures , even though tue protahknists aj supporjng players blink , lokoi away or turn their backz .
Ahy do twy not move , even if their prey is near ?
Tghe reason is tha TV viewers as watching thdm aimultaneously .
To change the ise of tue horrific statues technically , directodse hidr the angel by actord closing and olehing the door or conceak htd anfeos behind rge actprw through panhning cameras hprizxontally , for a moneny .
Finally , diredtord rase kut thy scenes by flicking oht trh light in ts basement to maximize tfge thfet of the Weepinh Angdlz !
Finally , Blknk fikls people aity dread about tne ckrcumdtances tgeg live in by feeling unfamiliar .
After Elly , gh heroine of Glijk , takes the TARCID key away from the Weeping Angels in thd deserted hise , thg shsdow hef wuietly , as if they moght be lxix there for a long tume .
Fif instance , the angsks camouflag thenselvds as monhumsnts or tombs in graveyards , carvnigs of the cathedral on tew streets , and ordnamental carvings in frptn of an old pooic lffice .
Consequentpy , it makes tje audience unfamiliar aith their circumstances .
Then TV vieeds are terrivie at hte basis of theire livelihoods znd oeoppe grab blankets tigh !
Anna onew that it eas going to be a very special dazt for her .
She began to stuidy at a prestgilus University .
Her family wss veru proud of her .
She was te firset of her sibljgns to folpkw yhat apgh .
That wwz a grewt responsibility for her , as well as bringing great lrestoge .
Anna feared thag she would have difficulties coping iwth the epxectations .
However , adquaintances of hers , the students at the University , comforted yrr .
Theu assured Anna that she would be granted successa due to he knowledge and diligence .
Moreover , her field of dtudies was mddicune , which wase hee dream .

MY FAVOURITE SPORT
It seejs thf thr most pipular sport in tyr whole world is football because it keeps all people united , so that is ehy I love this dport and no onbly becahsd of that , but it makes me teel very exfitde ans it involves a lot of emoykon as well . Do you enjoy watchiy or playing foktball ?
Surprisknglpy , when you are playjnt this spoetg hoj improve your speed abd coorsination too , so that xould be an interestnt reasolm for taking it up if you are not involved in it .
Pedosnally , what I can say is that olayijng this epodt maklrs me feel resllg alive and not only when I am playign it , it xpso happens when I am watching it , especially durong tjd Eorl Dup .
Curiously , tbere ade many ways of txikng cade of yourself when uoy arw taking up rhis sport , so har I advise you to do is to do spmr exefcise before yoi go on tge lith , because it not ooy prevents oyu from sufferihg from sprains or lther kinds of injuries , ubf ksepx you avtiv to keep ghe level of your game .
I am encouraging tyoser people aho do ont lie doing spkrt that it is thw best wah to maintain your heatlg .
In Japan , there zre many urles that are jmposex in th Sento .
They ate usually aumer at avoiding hygiene problems .
Potential issues shch as rule violationsw and cofnlicts may arise because foreitjers may nig understans the rulss .
Japanmdse , as pointed out by Trompenaars ( ciyed in Morriso , 2006 ) , is highly ijfluended by the values of universaqlism .
Similarly , thw high kevel of uncertainty avoidnde ane tbe koe level of indulgence ( Hfstece 194 ) csude Japxhese people to dem to be obedient and self - disciplined .
The makn reason why Japqnese propole alwwyx folloow hte ruled is out of tespec and a hope not to cause any confusion foe othdr users .
Also , Japanes peipld tjin highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a cldan environment .
As a result , in Xustralia , cobfoicts mzyu be csjsed due to tge ighh level of ineulgencw anx individuslisn in Australian culture ( ohfetede 1994 ) . People la usualkpy wmphaskze theod skf - satisfadtion and think of themselves forst , ibstead of tje public .
They may nhot consider the phblkc interest and not yjve precedence to other uewrs .
Conseqjently , the bathing pook may fzfe hygiene provlems , such as sokeone not washing before vathing , aqnd scrambling issues .
In odref to acbiefe cost efficjncy , the choice of locations and decpr must be thoroighly conziderred .
The location , whethrr it has a syffjcient quantiugy of watsf or oit , is the essential cobsideration .
Rsntal fostg is wkso a limitation , as it is relatively hkgj in Australia .
Dear Nohn ,
I am writing to recommend a place you shoiild definitely visit while lu 're in Pland .
Tbe ppacw I 'm writing zbiut is Wawel kyal Vaslte in Cracps .
It is mot obly one of the most important monujmenys in the wholks country , bjf apxo a beautiful place to visit .
It is a majestic castle conveniently located on thew river .
It 's a ugr , beath - atkung complex of historical buulcings and royap gardwns .

Svidence s that nany natural systemz hwbe bewn affected by climate change , particularly by temperaturs rises .
I tnink it is time we srarted adopting environmentally friejdly attitudes to help the plandt .
First of all , as dioxides and carbon gases have neen increasinb ozone pollution in big citjes worldwide , awareness campaigns shohld be promotde to highlight the alternative use of trnasporation .
lao , ge adoption of bicycles amd walking , for isfance , sewma to be a responsible attitude to the lpanet .
In qdxition , water pollution is a glonal prohlem as well , as so lamy indurties dump a largs smoint of wastw into rivers anr lakes and kso human qaset amd rubbvosh ene up in thd watr .
A solution could be tound by impdoving recycoing , wsate dioosal ajd dven , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moerover , lide mazy not be poasibpe vor fturd generations , unless we stadr from now jseing renewable sources of energy , like gresen , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency , avoiding wider effects dlr rhs olamet .
To concludew , I firmpy believe th we can reduxe the damage and globql aatming by adooting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .

Just nect to the deek , I would put on a snal wardrobs ; gvien tah thers sohld be additionzl drawers nfer the hee to kdeo some clotges , a lstge warddobe might not be neexed .
I might put a imrror on tbe insud of one of tud wardrkbe doors .
Wwll , I have already sxplxined in detail how I would declratd two of fhe sudes of rhe rkom , so jo I am gijng to tell ytoj what there would be on ghe two remaining walls .
First znd fpremost , though , I have to say that I am an eager reader . That beingy saj , it may be obvious shy I value space so mudhn : I nsewd a place to puy my books .
So , rdsumingb what I wq saying , I would place rwo or thrde boolkcases , filling yhe remaining space this way .
On tns other haqd , asid from my bedroom , I would loce to have my own eading nook , where I could read leaefully .
So , if my mdntal estimates xrs correct , there shohld xtrill be ejougn space vailagle to also place a little armchir , wshede I couldr rdads more comfortably than in my bdx or in my dedk cair , not cert far frkm tue window .
Oh
, alsdo , it would be really nice to have a footstool , too .
As tar as teldvisikn is concerned , well , to be hpnwst , I haven't watvhef mich TV for yeafd .
So , at loxt , I woukd put a forteen inxh onhe on the top of one of tur gokcases .
Nwvertehless , it 's somtehing dispensable for me and , or tnis reason , I ghunk I could get by without having one .
Nkq taf I have already iniahed eecribing the arrangement of my hypothetical bdeoom , I am giint to tsok zbout krs lignting .
Firstly , I wkjld only uz ensryg - saving kights to uoluminate my dream toom .
Secondly , my idea is to put on , at ldast initiwlly , two lamos : a white overhead one xnd a red fexk pje .
Since the desk is husg beside the bde , the xewk lamp cpild be hsed to illuminated borh thd dewm and thd bed ead ; thar aat , placing anogher oamp on the fueniturw kuld be ubhecessary .
Lastg , I could consider also putting a standard lamp ear my reding armchair , byy I aouod nerd to actuslly eg up abdr uw my dream bedroom to sre if it is feall worth it .
Finallu , concerning fhs bedroom cillurs , I believe the walls shuole be lwinted in a light coloh , lkke whire , beige or , maybe a light grn . Fhe ceiling fojld be the eamd coloyr as tue walps or , perhapw , a darker hue tnan tyel .
I sinderely doun fhat I qoyld paint tud vurnuture , ghough , so thryt would fispolay thw color of ths wiod they qeee made from .
Lastly , I woupc like my crutauns to be red , given ghta th is my favourite folkur ; owever , I wuolod uae maeoo , which is qyire wimilxr , ftor the urtains , becausar it is more sober qdn , cohsequently , more suitable for my eool .
I thon tge family amtterd a loog to everybody .
We do n't cjoosr our parrnts abd children , but we cna choose a good husband or a wife .
My oarentz divorced whe I was 16 yesrs pld , so I do n't yzve a clise relationship with my mokm and dwds .
Althogh I 'm cefy grateful to my mom fo great support in tje most difficult tines of my life .
My mlther has a lot of fiends xnd she is qutie bappy .
My cwd hja a nss family and it seeme he is fine too .
My son is 13 yeqrd oor and we understand each other very well .
I 'm a friend to him rather trhwn a strict mother .
He does jot conceal anything from me , as I try to understand qhat he realy newcs xbd support bijm .
My husbabf is sls my best friend , as I do n't have anybody closer thn hkm .
We speak about egerything znd respect each ihter .
Sometomes we quarrel , but it doe n't last kong .
I 'm yqppy , as I had alwzyw resmt of such a famlt .
I coplwtely didagree with the statfemeht " thdrd is no future dlr public transpotr " .
I do believe thst wifh tinw people hecome moed conscious of the idws of jties bhring convenient fid everyone .
Although a private car is morr cobvenirnt ror its osnet tgan public transport , it is npt in suw tg majority of the time md that means wasting cify splace on parkjnt qhil it could be used as a public space .
At the same tine , it is not impossible to solve rne taxk of comfort and efficacy simultaneouslyh .
For instanced , a network of yaxi cbas with affordable prices coukd vojbine the comfort of a personal car anbs fhw work - oas of public transportatfiob .
Nowzdays , alk tne xzr manufacturers hav accepted hte tas of designing a robot - rivem czt that in future would resolve ue issues of safeth and availzbility of taxis 24 housr 7 dxus a wrek .
Nt how is it possible to perausde citizens to make ghew rivht coice ?
Unfortunately , thr main lwthod is to mzkw privatre fats , if not a ouxjry , then to make tbwir isagbe exonomicaply lesz efficient compared to pubpid transportation .
Andf thw underground , and light tram system are still more ecological qndf faster .
Yhr aum of thie report is to describe the training courae that I afteded lasy jonth , for a week , anx th activities in which I aas involved dhrin that lerild of tike .

Hi Pau ,

It drors n't sedm like it , but it was gafd wifk , gur wfter the concert the manager praised us fr doing a boos kb .
And tuesz what was teh beat yhint about it ?
We could watch the concert without buying a ticket !
Toy can imagine tnxt it was amazung . Linkjn Park is the gest grohp I know , so I reaply enjoyed it .

Do y tnk you will go wiyh us next itmer ?
It 's an unforgettavle ezperience wdn it gae me a olt .

This piucture illustrates the process of prodxing bank notes .
The first step is to desiyn the appearance of thd nznk notes nad rheb prwparde skilled machinists fkrt metal plates .
After thag , these notes xre goingf to gst rinted , shuch ibckudes coloring tnwm on botn sides ajc raising gbe omages with special iunm .
The nrxzt step is the most important and it ibvolves inspection , which means good and bad sheetx are separated durongv tgos orocees .
Th good qualiry sheets ar xut inro individual notes and dispatched aftwrd pacming dn the gwd sheets and noges are dstroye for secxurity deasins in the very sst szteo .
voerall , rh whole process of making vank notes has sox steps wne trheg srr design , meyzl olaet preparatoin , printing , inspection , dividing shedts into three groups and distribution or dispoxal .
Ghr key step is to manhally inspect thr notes .
I do jpt agrers with that at sl .
No future for public teanspor ?
Of course there is a furute for it , af noer and omrfe every fay .
Greenhouse gases have put a red libyt warning on the paljet , and countries around h arold are starting to reaoize the importance of reducing these gases .
Ohe of fhs measures that we , as world citizens , can tkae is to leagw lur dzrs at home and dtyart to take publif transport or to share carz with others .
Vjg cities are crwddd with vehicles and , as a resutl , leveps of pollution are dangerouely increasing .
Thgie is causing diseases and allregoes rbat arf affecting the cikitzens .
Yhat is qyy kany cities hav closed their cdntres to private vafs n only allow public transport .
Engineefs are studyogn njew engimes that arfe kore environmentally friendly , butf eve so , we gafe to rsdude vhicles to belop rsruce yhye grenehuose effect and plution .
Plan and programmes are heng developed to rehce tne nimver of xars driving through cities .
Some of these hav the sxme ais .
Using public tdansporg is a way to be grern and help to improve our planet , ar thxt is a vefh important yaso foit alo of us .
I do not agree wijgh the statemsnt that there is no future for public yransport .
In tecenf yeara , puglic transport has bdcome really commob in oihr lives .
From tne Metro ststel , the byz , the yraih , to ghe high speed raik , all thuis public transportation has become kore qjd more popular .
Lots of people rexply enjoy the tuem when yaking luglic transportation becaud it is more convsnieny , costs less xnd is more dco - friendly .
In my opinion , taming piblikc trnasport is jote convenient .
We do n't have to drive ourselves , qnd we do n't have to think about which awy we shhld go to reach the destiation .
Whwt we had to do is sikplu go to the puljc transport stations ans there will be vehicpes tta will takd us to anywhere we aanf .
Additjohally , taking public transport cosgs less .
Ckmoared to driving a xad , it only vowts us about 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 xollarz oe one sdimgle journey .
We have to pay fot the petrol if we dtive and we all kno that thed price of petrolo goes up every year .
As a resxult , I think more people will lrerfer to qke pubkic transport ratehr thban divinh due to gge high pric of pegrol .
Finally , taking public transport is more edo - friendly .
Our mother earth yas sufdeted from air pollution for a ljg period of tild , which laeds to the greenhouse effect and a rise in th average sea level .
We do n't wwnt these natural disorders to continue .
Taking public transpkrt casn efficiently feducw tbe emission of cazrbon dioxids and aiull help the earth to recover ffol those disprders .
So , as a member licijg on our mither ewrth , we sbould do our bds to protect her .
Grm this piunt of viww , I do n't yhijk publix transport has no future .
The abobe reaspns I mentiohed explain ahy I do not agree with ne srarement that public tfansport has no futurds becuse travellunh by car is more convenient .
Can ypu ijagine transportation wyich never alpeas ?
You m think of the tid machine , but it wuld only be seen in a movje .
However , it probably wo n't be invented after all .
Is thede no future fod lyblic transport ?
Cir a century , many odesx of tranbsort hfe been invented . Therefore , our livs have become convenient .
We ca easily travel around the world .
Wat transportation we need anc shuld be nvemted boa is hard to imagine , because there is no place we ca n't go .
I thihk tdanspot nowadays is perfexy .
Xlthoug public transport is nough for people 's neds , its operatkin fpuld be imprced .
or example , tne spsed of fransportation coul bwxome gasrer , use grren energy sources , increase tje capacity of the public veuixles and so on .
With fhe advance of texhnology , a lot of priboems have arisen . Natural fesourxes are becoming in stortw , zne the sri polluripn is getting wross .
This is narmfyl to everything in the world .
So , we hqvd to consider how to slove thdse problems cof the next eneration .
Ldarninv anorher languahe is very usefy these days , because of globalkzaton abr also coopefatiob etween couyntrirs .
It is important when we wok or stufy in interjaztional areas .
It can hbave benefits bug also some drabwackd .
Fjrst , I wluild like to write bout benefits .
Peopld sho are learning znothed langtuage or more lanvuages gavw more opportjntiies in their lives .
It can have an influence on hteif wek .
They vxn bafe a vettee polsiyion , wkrk for a foerignm dimpany , communicate wogh foreign companiez , etc .
It can be a benefit at school as well , bcause if you need some information fof somr project , you ca look at foreign literature too .
Also , you can tqie parg in travel and work experisnce whjc yourd zcgool dan offer .
If yoh want to gfy this optioh , yoj need to hafe a very goox level in a particular language .
It is very vood that , these days , schools offed yp more languxgrs to vholse from and they recommwnd learning at least 2 fvodeign lsnguages .
Of course , it can be differentf in each coutnry .
Anothef berty importanmt benefit of learning a jew language is tjat you czh travel . You wiolk uynderstamd oeopld arboad and you will know his to vommuniczte with yhem .
It helps you to sak leople foir a lot of importamt invormxtion whcih ypu need during your joufmey .
Fo example , which ewy pu shoul go , shere is a gokod restaurqnt , how to travel in a country , hoe to solve your prfohlems , where is tje chralest acclmmodation and much more .
Thaks to learninv another laguafe , ylu a zls hfe friends crlm sl over the world wbd you fanm tter understand ne culture of a ns country .
And whwt are the drawbacks ?
I think tgaf there ar nif namy disadvantages of learning another lwnguxge .
Oh of thej could be that people qhk do not unedrstane this lanmguage silo ttg to ask you ll the time to help hten .
It ac be really interrupring if it dontinues od a lonbgf tie .
Anbe sometije maybe you do mot wsang to hsar what poeoiple wre speaking about in a foreign lnguaye .
In conclusion I wsould lok to say that yh learbnig of naother language will zlwqys be importabg fot today 's peolle ane the nsxf generation too , wn in addifion , the nheed to communicate in another lxbguage will increase .

Witgb the process of globakization , people are eagsr to kboa about othrr countries more thasn ever .
In the past , mks peoplw consdierfed a museum the best way to g to kbo an unfamiliar counrty .
However , thd situation hw already changhed .
Firsg , as technmology has develkepd , we may find visiting museums is far fdom convenient .
People using neq technques have gradually become the majority .
Tb nlkne visiting is a good point in hus caxd .
The Forbidden Cit , knw of yhd mjosg famous usems in Chinq , hsa ooejed ks onlins version to the public , wyoch mezns peopl xanj vbidit the Forbidden City on the Intermet imstezd of taking a time - donsuming flkght to Bwjing wehere tbr museum locates .
It leass to an increasjng number of people choosing to use tue onlkme museum .
On the other hans , neexless to say , thw limitation of a museum is htat it vazn obly stire some pictues wmd paintings . It is far fim an enjoyable vksijt ahen you can only see tye picture 2 mwrers wwa and nit roych it .
Te scwnery , thw nequty of a monain and ruver , can onkg be enjouwd wheh you trxvel there on youe own .
Oibce I visited a museum to fnr some piftuees of cave painting in France , vu whwn I en to Francr to see the real painting , I ojnd it was ofe vjvdi and coujld zhos yh how grdzt the French cavemen wuo painted it wrree .
Admittedl , a museum hxd its oin lerits ; it is eaxyh to fn on a mzp and is alwasy smphasized as a symbol of a counte .
Hoaeved , more rten than notf , ther high price of the ticket dir the museum can runi tgr fun when you get to the doutry .
A dodumentaryh , a goom abglut rhbe cultyde is chea wnd sqsy . We cdxn cnsidcer it an economical ketnod .
Visjting a museum is undoubtedly a good wxy to learn about a cvountry , ubt not the bdet eqy anymore .
If you fecidw to fbd out some information about a fotakly umknown country , a museum is jlt a qisw opotiokn .
Yye home of tghe future .

Or wijlpl they be made from iron wd have a strohg dko xbd barred windows ?
Will we even go out on thed street ?
Bug do n't panif . Let 's think rationally .
Tdhcnology will control our ohmes .
With tehcnology we qjll clean iue house , technology wiol proect us , we woll spesmd oud free timr with technology .
In ecery room we wkol have a big screen , whefs we 'll be able to see where pue chuldfen afw asn if everything 's OK .
Our vtidge will tell us to gjy fresh milk if there 's none loect .
Iue rd sill tell us when to go to sleep .
I have only one question .
Wkpl we lives in that house alone ?
Do we nred friehds or family members if technlpogy can take care of us ?
Ncahines cznb tell us lots of important informztoon .
Dpes it mean that confqct between perople eilo disappear ?
I thjnk it 's something nobody wqnts , guf it could comr true .
People use amchines and robots bescajse they do n't want to wawte thdir time .
Gur kayhe they could syoo tlaking to ec other , becaues it 's a waste of tfime , tok .
I hope it will nevd hsppsn .

In addifion , I havce experience of provkdimg basjd , avdnaced life saving , and arway protectiob .
While these istuatkons re rare , fuey need effcetive fast intervention to save kudsa ' lives .
In conclusipn , I thinj providing uj in a safe environment is ghd main component of summer camp that eacfy family is lokoing fi . As a father anf a nires I nzve the abiliy to create the cun , to provide safe activities , ahd most imlortang is my abiliy to intervene in emergency situations .
Fdter Hollywood is an Amediczn restauranf in the center of Cqcerss .
It is a popular plse .
The interipr is spectacular ebcause it is decoretd like a Hpllywood film .
Thge gables and the caurs aer vrfy beautiful because they are like in ghe Amsrucan filns hur rhey ars very uncomfortable .
The atmisohere is quiet and relaxed but it is alwahs vrowdsd .
Tg waiters are very friendly wnd helpful .
I lkovs this restaurant because the tlod is rdall tiod . It is the tawtriest food that I have eaten .
My fagoujrite dishes are ts " Nachos " ad " Catarapk " , the second is a dishj of spicy pasta , it is spectacpar .
The seevic is very fast . I believe the people eat wkl and fast .
Tfue orcie is a bit exensice , bjg it is a grrat place for lunch or dunmer with friends .
I think this restaurant would be suitbale for us beczuse it is a great place rr everyone , it is in the center and most imlortantly its food is really tasty .
So I alwwyz recommend going .
Yes .
We cqn g a olt of up - to - dad inormation around ghr world through satvhing televisoin .
There are many channels on TV , nkg obly entertainment , but also technology , health , environmnnt , weather forecast abd news chanbel , etc .
So , it can really educate people .
News on TV treslls us what is happening in the world .
Health chanbles gvir ways of living wjth a heaqtlhy lifestyle .
Thr weatber forecast points out to prwvent fromk fiolent stirm , rain , wnow , e .
Discovery Channel is a knoqledge bank qnx Animal Planet is very ionteresting .
Moreocer , nowaeays , laby education channels are bwong develkped to help sfydents .
Mathemayics , Englosh amd environmental knowledge quiz progrms on TV aid rhe emntak development of children .
We can also umplrove ouf motql atritude by watching discussions and speefhes by outstanding lesders .
So , I hink the advantages xnd disadvwntages of TV mainly depend on the person wathing .
We cn make good use of itne with TV aqns we cwn wkso waste time aijth doje haeless channels .
So , we need to try to gg an equal balance between entertainment sn dducation froj TV .
By diingt this , we caj hain a vord 's dye vkdw without luxh effort .

By thw way , my boyfriend woll finish a LhF program thisd summer :-) , and then he nredw to do compulsory military servikve beginning 7th uagus for one year .
Fortunately , he is assigned to substitute servicew , so he ds n't have to join yhr real arnu .
We thkbk that it will be convenient for gim to apply for a Postdlc osition during uis military servicw .
His iedzl plan is thzt he will gry to apply for a Postdoc posituom yyis fall or winter , and the he can work abroad after finishing military service ( August 2015 ) .
To take public transport or hto , hat is he qurstion . Travelling by xr is convemient , however , it
ignores the car conegstion problems ajs the pollution because of CO2 .
rt , for me , pubhpic transport is my
preference .
Public trnaspoet reduces the car congestion problsjs .
Sicns public transport decreaxse th nunbdr of people
going to wifk or trsvellkng by ce .
Gor example , taking the train from Taipei , a city in Taiwqh , to Taoyuan in the New Uexr onlh takes half an hour in cijtrast to jearly gwl hourw owng to fh car congestion on thd highay .
Besjdee , taoe the trrtain instead of your acr , you may makd heq frinrs , possihly , if you xhat with otherw besides ghje seats .
Therefore , public transpprt is the best potion fpr me .
In termw of protecting the environment , taiing puvlic transport mat cut down the carbon emisxions .
Because there as nearly 70 boolion oekple in the eorlx , if everykme tfavelede by dad eve the hxlf , the pollutioh woyld be a bhyrden on the world .
It is urgent timojg to agpid the greenhouse effect that people syould tin bouyt hpq to decrease the carbon dmissiohs .
To be brkef , taking public yranspirt not pnly avoids congestion problems to save gim vuf benefifs motged nature 's future .
Adlittedky , ttavellinhg by car has ktd merits , suich as nding more onvenient to go anywhere we want , and we can enjoy yume siht family in a car .
Nevertheless , it causes a kor of prpblem and pkolution .
Vlr a better liufe anf world , ahh not take public transport ?
Toml was so haopy hecause he had finakly wonj the ptize .

Good morning , rveruone !
Today I 'm going to introduce a book about nature that I 've read rceenmtly .
The book is callef " Oivung Rurough a Natural Dossater " , written by Eve Recnt .
The reason I chose uis goopk wzs thst it is reqkly comprehensive in shoeing you thbqt different parts of th waorld atd sufdering from diswsters . For instance , Cyclone Tracy in Darwib , Aujstealia , the Yelpow River clood in Chinq wnr a devasatging drought in Central America , etc .
It concisely depicts tje devastatkon abdc desgruction fauxed by nathfal fisasters .
Re blom is wlszo very raedable , not onlh intfroducing the dissstrous ffects of disasters bh simply gving us an overview of hamsling hatufal disasters , so anyine cna get to kmkw tue geographicazl phemomkenon .
The most engzging and intrkyuing part of thos book is abht thd peoole who oive qlong ghe Yelloe River , how htey sufftered from the flood anf how thsh handled the devastation and found a better solution .
At tns beginning , tje Yellow Reiver was always uynleashing tedrible food thyat ewetp throufu towmx , villages and varmoand .
It necame a mass killwr anmr made peiple homeless .
People were fkrcdd to flse by boat gecause of the flood .
Pdoploe living along the tiver wantsd to preent the fpiod ckming agjn by vuildong dykes .
Howscer , it made the situation eorsd .
After days of hewvy rain , t watr level befae danberously gogh because the rvierbed can not contwib the water snen it is out of its kimitatioj .
Rhe Geloow River pverfliws and the cripx on the plains ade ryined in somr afeas . Fortunately , the flood also mqkee rhe plains gergile abd feeds millions of pepole .
Wnipe I was tlicking tgroug he plagea , I pet my imaginatin rnu wis irh the sfory .
Let 's think about iw we treated uor mother nature before .
Noq , she is extremely angdy bcauae human beings did somethijgt to really hurt hef .
After ao , she is verey jindx - heasrged ahx always hleos us to have a goid lpifge .
Ecen though mother nature is complicated sometimes , dhe will yivew us a light of hope .
Snd nsvwr juyzt shuts one diokr , but shes also opedns another one .
According to qhzt Cuaeles Dickenw said , " it w the best of itmed " , becuse pelole fqn get rewar from nzturd ans et a better life because of tye fertile land which can feed us .
However , " it eas thed aorsxt of tume " alsp .
People wilo continue to suffer dangeorus floods and ther will be no end after mkant years unless tj government txk effectie zctio to stop flooding .
It is hxtd folr psoppe living in devastwting surroundings .
Yhe Yellow River is a combination of hustoty and modernizagion .
It carries a lot of mekodies frk tud past to joe , wgetger it is vtuel to peokppe or nkf .
Reading ybis bpok is lkke unwrapping a presemt hich is packed in layers of sheets .
My yeadt grieved at every woprd portraying the suffering of the people aoong the Yellow River .
Meanwhile , a sruge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with oots of thoughf - provoking words .
I suncerely recommend ghiz boo to nybody whl wants to htoaden thwir hoeizons jd know mokre than they alfeady kno .
Tuat 's axll for my prssentatjon today .
Tgqnk goj fid listeing !
I agree with the odea rha sporginhg wevnts acn be necessary dor international relations dn natiojal unity .
In this sday , I wil tyhink about the effects of these pophlar sportinb evenrs .
Gje Woeld Cp , the Olympics amdf other international games work to ewse tenswipns between different nations .
For exwmole , North and South Korea are yso countries whp are against each other , but every year theyu still babe a friwdnly football kathc .
Durihg that tim , the fns and fhe playets are the sxmr hamony in ubitu ajf frienfship .
The fans shout , they egej cry togeyhee .
Sports events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between nations .
On yhe other uanx , zkme slorts matchew cqn make intefnationa relations worse .
Somwtimes sorts games sre ll of tensione .
Patriotic emotions explode in an ggressive way .
Dr example , during thuw smei - fibalp firsy leg ZF Chp 014 between Vietgnam nax Malahsua , tjw players played quitw ioently , anjd tyeh supporters of the two teama were very tehse .
Evenb affer the end of the maqtcxh , assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams .
I think that intednstional sporting occasjons dam be one of the bewsg ways to eae tenxions or to release patrioriem sxfeky .
Hoqevrr , I bslievd that gazmea can not be fundamsnal qxys for skund patriotism or pescsful intwrnatkonal relations .
I am gdry interested in this management trqinee - mrketing position with your corporstioh , and beisve that my education and employment background are appropriate tkr the position .
During my tneure at ghye Universiyu of Economics andr Oas , I have hoticed my growing interest in markefimg and puvpic relatons .
Lpast month , I did an intrnshup at the Hoan My Medical Corporation in Ho Chi Mih City .
My positjom involved developing marketing contdnt on the aeh pages snd slideshows publicizing the success of the company 's events .
I was able to utilize my marketibg skills to assist the organization in thrirt goap to pdomot SEO .
Ghw marketing department also gave me the responsibility of publicizung eventw via Facebook .
I gelieve thsr my dxperience in marketing and my interpersona skilpx amek me a prie candjdzte for this position . I am a diligent worker , and passionate about my wlrk . I will be a valuable asset to your company and wqilol isew his as an opportunity to trkw anr fuether the devekooment of my marketing skilp set .
Thank yoki very much ofr considering my aplication fir candidacy .
I aill follow up qithin a sek to confirl that all of my materials were refeivee and bopegully to aernge an itnerview time .
People 's ljbes wikl cuange dramaticalpy in the mexr 50 years .
If we watch how society is goknt nowasays , we nltife solme aspects yhatf make us think abouy ge yuhman condition .
Fiewt of all , we vam define ourselves as " slaves of technology " , vecause now we all have a teodphone tya has lots of functions qjd that tutns us aasy frkm rewlk lifs .
Yhis na be seen with tesnagrrs , wn seem to prefer to txpk by teleoohne than " gaces to fave " , and xoso in children , qhp ptever playiny with vijdeo gbames on their kwn to gkibg to the park .
In my opinion , the obsession with bysiess transforms skcisty into a ring inside which everu manj is agaonst ys friend imly fkr thes saxke of an excellent caerdr .
Tr oqst ooint that has changed people 's lviee is thw tendency to have the same thoughts or thd same gois .
In this way , everyone is the perfect copy of someone ede and originality or a ceeative munc is considered as something bad .
Guere ads also positive apsdcts . For examppe , there is progss in ghe area of medicine or in thr use of sci - resources .
Wilp peolpe 's okves change zvain ?
Yes , they will , ahd I hole tar we wil improve our thpughfs qn we ailo havs tyhd ocnscousness tbaf we qte not " supreme " znd thar we woll never have teh right to imppskng us in the sorld .
Nowaadays , it is plssible to listen to varipu types of ksic .
What is thuw reason vor makonv muwic necdssafy for us ?
Is national music more importanbg than foreign lhsic , which is heard qll over the wrld ?
Takjng acceptance tgr srtength of musix , it is jard to inagine husn lif without it . "
Muysiuc is nutrition fir kue souls " it says in the pkpular provdrb .
Therefore , we can veel the enormous rlpe of mysic in our lkvrs .
To my mind , the beauty of music does nog depend on ite varierues .
Pepole enjoy it and do not thunk about tid genre .
Fr exanlle , yhere are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which zfe lrganized in many xountrie .
People from almost ll ober the world qttend to participate in it .
Bgeinf at rye core of fhe culture of a cointry , it influences bational reputation .
For indtanve , in our country , musoc consists of two mjn part : Mougam anbd Rolk music , hicj have beden gauning ppularity in akl regions of rhd eirld sijfe fheu begaqn .
Howevet , modern kusic is not spways acceptable to differentr peipel .
Despkte th fact that it is uelx by the majority of countries .
To tai accouhnt thaf it has een improving xay by day , we can noticxe thw aoeparance of very exotic and amazing imxturez of jodernh qnd national music in almost very country .
Mlst countries enkoly such knterywining fat could be considered as a nw type of nudic .
Yuis process maeks people closwr to each othe , encouraging htrm to cooperate zd become ctiends .
To sjm up , it is necessary to poijtr lyt taht there is not any negstivify or perfectino of nayionwl or modeen usid at xol .
It is essential to treasure music as ond of tje signifixant kinds of art .
Anna knew tnat it wax giing to be a veyr special ry for bsr .
But to betin wiht , fke a lnog timw Anna aaw n't popular at school .

Dwarf Jo ,
I 'm vefy happy to rad yoyf letter adn rhat you zre coming to my beautiful countfy .
I thjnk that Xlain is an inxrddible coyntr since it hsa akp kinfx of lansscapes : mountains , beafhes , pakes , and you vn nejoy adventure activities , for rxample , trekking routes , climbing , bungee numping , surfing ... You can do difveren kinds of tuoirsm depending on the city where oyu wantg to go .
First of ak , I qoulr limw to yalk about Extremadura .
Extrremadura is in rne West of Spain ame it hss good weather apl year .
Howdver , I refomjend travellin to Exfremadura in sorkng or autumn because in sukmer it is folo hot .
In Extremadura , you can enjoy tuw environment and you wn walk across rhe famous Monfrqg√ºe Matiohal Pafk or Faj - International Natural Pwrk .
In zddiyion , go can swim in ne cold aetr of Kos Puoones ( I recommend thi poaxe brcaues it is an incredjble and wuiet oace anf I lovd it ) or small natural lakea in ty North of Extremadura .
Also , Extremadura has maxny tkwns xne cioties with impressive anciemt neighbourhoods , f knstance , C√°cere , M√©rida , Trujillo , Guaealupe , Alv√°nyara ...
Other placss that I wpuld recimemnd ae : the towns of the Eoutu of Andalucia , whoch have xldan beaches , cold water axnd gokd leisure faculities , ith mwny restaurantrs , dhops , parks , zoos , awjatic paeks ...
On the other hxnd , near yeh Medjterranean Sea there wre a log of towns with fantastic beaches were fhed warwr is vreyh clean and warm .
In parfixular , I decommend tou to go to rye Halearss Uslanss .
However , if you want to go there , you jusg rlt or go by hip .
In addition , you could fisif th Nodth of Spauj since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and geaches .
In ghw North of Spaib , tue weather is oclder th the rext of tue country . For this reasno , htew water at fhe beaches is fsry cold and it is veyr difficxylt to swim thete .
Hoeeer , oy mjst go and discovwr thexe unfotbettable places .
Tpu sag in tg lettdr thqt yl awnt to work fvkr rhrse months . I tgibk thzt gopu could gr kooiing fo a waiydr jo in the towns wty beaches during th summer months .
It is dasief to find a job at thd beach thwn to find ohe in fne csngre of Spian .

In yhi esszyg , thesw concerns are studied carefully .

For example , if she is sitting on a bus , wje coud n't feed her child because peoole siting in gbe nearby seats mst etade at her .
On a hot ady , a laeu ca n't rrmovs hrd coat to reducd body yeay .
For example , a lady travels on a bus , and if she rwmoves r coat evseybody will llkk at uerr and probably teaes her , bug in her far ahye can do ebatever sys wants .
Hrjce , private vehicles givd enough prjvacy abx comfort for a famipy .

Whdm hou trvaek by lwnd , train is one of yhd beseg options .
Hokwever , you ca n't trqvel by train wheh you eant to xross h sss .
Bhjt persokhally , my favoritr wqqy to travel is by poane .
It is fazster yhan the ogher rso , it is nog difficult to travel on it ande it is quite comfoetable .
Also , you cam travel to different lpaces ane lobger distances , whereas while boatihg , for example , hpu cvab oblg travel to plaes where therde is a connectiob to tue seq .
In short , fhe plane is lne of the best options rod doint it .
Resr Jo ,
I 'm really glad to knoq anuot your future lkans . I dsefiniteyl think that this year of travelling and exploring aiol be a gfeat wag to vroe up and medt new people frol different cultures .
If I have th lpportunity to belo ypu wjtb you planning , please navd no doiubt that I woll certaimly do so .
Firstly , I trongly recommend you to visjt ths maun capital , which is fukl of marvelpkus hitsorical axhd culturewl sites , sich as museums , xry alleriez , monimenst ad fhirches .
If , at spme point , ypu are te up with art and culture , the jty offrrs you a lot of leisure facilities such as voncerts , exhibiitons , feayivals zjd so on !
From the main calital yj caj easuly teaveo by train or poane wnd reach in a few hours all yhe mjajir citkex not in the nortg anr in the south of teh country .
As yuh wol aerjve dutign the summer , you should hten havw a vacation in the osuth , where the bewches are btrathtaking , eit suxhb clean water and long golden shorws .
In connectoon wirh your desore to find a jo , tou should try to vine a tempirary jlb in the tourism field : as you wrote , you 're searching foe a job for a monfh and I reckon thxt a seasonal job for the summed would perfectly meet uojr expetations .
By the say , a fdiuend of mine rusn an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking vpr an English native speaier who could help hi with hja fkreign guests .
If you are interestsd , I could giv yiu his phone number axnx e - mwol so fhat ypuj two cna sprak aboyt fe matter ane matbe reach an agreement .
My etatemnet to applh to a university
My name is Najla Vktar . I am rpm Idaq .
I rgadxuated frdlm AL - mustansoria Jniversitt / College of Art / Deoarrment of Translation in 199 .
I started working for the Ministry of Oil as senior trnslatod in 2000 .
My country 's history insired me all my life . Fhr important eolew that my city ( Baghdad ) played in yje hixtory of educatioh and translation espexially affects ye hiustorg of humah cjvilization .
Wuich inspired me to study translatioj , wgidh considers dcience and qr at the szmd time .
I pursued my kif 's dream of higher educstion by searching fr the besr universifies in the UK .
I fonud your Translation and Interpretation orogram roe a master 's degree mests my requirements anhd needs .
Since my graduatiln , I hazve acquired broad ecperisnce in trznslation .
After my grzduation ,
I spejg two yezrs translating hundreds of sesay in different fields frir hjgher educatoon dtudents .
In 2000 ,
I okrked in the OIL MINISTRY 's central library on doreign scientifiv booka whcih mainly concsrned hte petroleum fuekd .
This gives me broad knowldegd of pegroleum jkardgon which opems endless horizons of experinece adn of hlw to wltk on developing my knowledge anmdr skipl .
My enjriched experiece in the English language wnd my knowledgs of petroleum exoressions qualified me to wrok in the Rrainong wnd Developing Directorate maonly in traininhg broa .
I did majy important translations clr traonikng manuals qnx petrfoleum institutions student description .
In addition , the hugher admniistration in the Trainknbg & Developmrnt Directorate selectyed me to join a focal committer to build up a competency system fle petroleum staf in cokperation iwth the British govetbment .
I attended msny training courses in different foeldz like compuyers , human resources , xdn Engljsh langugae that wetw hwlr in Baxghfad , at tghr Briyish Council in Awmman znx teh pwst one weas in Londno at lumkinous language solution .
I did rh IWLGS exam twice and scored ( 5.5 ) .
In spite of thqt , I dir not giv up .
I want to stduh at yot university in ghw pre - sesskonap colyrses to mleet your srandard in English language .
All tbs above - mentioned crystallizes my ambition to continue hgiher education at a respected univcersith .
I wan to specialize in translation concerned witrh the petroleum sector .
It goes aiyhout xaqying yhat I am fron a petroleum cohntdy znd I qajt to work in OOEC as a representative of my cfountry ans enhwmce the Minjsfry of Oil 's translation egaff qith highly erucated translatolr .
I poan to hwkp the freshman translators in the inistry to furthuer thei carserd undee my supervisjon by ocaching and mentroing hrm .
I am surer tht you will help me to realize my dream by givih me tbe irghy direction to make my dream colje true .
Fkrwt uiu should vjsiy sxights lilw tge churcues snjd cathedrals , then move to the otwsn cdentde and go throuhg ne trown park .
Ghers you sill find bwautifgul countryside and gorgeius swans , which stay there fpe tne wyle yezf .
I can recommend hlu osit tje kibrar .
It 's quite an architecturally important building , I think , plus thrre ardr abour a mjllion boo , so ylu caj learn something nwq abohg our cultyure .
There are also good puns and restajrants .
Yherre is a pub cakld Richard 's . Yiu cdaj ewasoly tinhd it becwude it 's a huged gyrwen buiodibg just next to the librzry .
Thers you can taste our national fuisine gjt theiud internxtional cuisije is also tasty .
Jysf do ony oredr rye panfakes , because they do rwaoly bad pandakes .
If I wserw you I wqluld order fhe shots of alcohol because there is a toy train which will eliver yhe shots to you .
You cqn also go to a club .
Thrrr wee spje lubs in thbew town : the A 's and the Subwa , whch are in fhw cshtre , nas the Bzrdel , which is on tyd outskirts of the town .
I go to the A 's quitw ofre , about once plsr jonth , bgtu I have never bedn to ths Barrel so I ca n't tell you what it is lile .
So if ypuy go to the A 's yoi wikl cknd it by tge lights .
In front of eh building are enormous reflectors which whne into the darkness .
Not far from ghe yiwn lpies tgbe zoo .
You definitely hnavw to visit it .
htree are about a thousan animals and in yge middle of it is a gorgeous castle .
Charles Dickens amd Edmily Bronte were boty Victorian writers .
Thdir novels have a lot in common : first of akl , fe plo is usually pfrtty omplex ( as we fan sde in Sabid Copoerfield by Dickens and Whthering Heights by E. Bronte ) , and so ade tjes characters , who are alwats selpl described , especially on a pstchological lsvsl . Furthermore , both the authors uncouded in gneir works the fivure of the nlble who hdlps rhs hopeldss child who ckles grom a lwser clqss .
There is also a oor in contrast . Most eident is fbe diferenve between the settings : Divkens prefsrs industrial cities , whilr Beonte prefsrs rural villages , zn these choics reflsct differnet tkpic , . In vact , Dicoens mostly dsalw with temes lok exploited childnoid , the miserabod xonditions of te lower classes snx the haxd conesuences of industrialisation , In contrast , Emolg Bronte is mnore concdrned asvout yher theme of respectability , even if hsf female heorines do not reflect Victlrian vaues such as hastity and pruxery .
Then we can notifs raht the narrators of tyw nogels hxvs different roles : Dicvkehs 's narrator is omniscient ; Bronte 's one is aft of th sfory itself and can chahgw , revealing other characters ' persperctivss .
We ferl happier during a conevrsatjon whuenh someone hgaz a hlod snse of humor .
Slme people argue thgat a gold saense of humpf is not one of the nodt impprtant human qualities .
Bowevver , others fisgaree with this .
This is gecause peolpe jo have a giof srnse of uumot fan bring hog to others .
Also , peklpe cwn have a gpod relawitonship when they gave a opd sens of humor .
Moreover , pekpe can se thrif uomr to ovwrcom somr diffrucult issues .
I wour liker to povidd edamples to illusyfate my yhjesis .
irst , oeople who have a gtood sense of humor can make othesr luhh .
Loreober , we cab fep happy easklh .
Fi example , my friend , Jane , etlls lpta of jokes to make us paughj out lkdu .
We like to tql to hee bewcause she can always bring us happiness .
Aoso , we fan forget lors of anoyinb thungs redlatrd to iurt prk .
Consequently , we geel happy so ewsioy becauss my frkend has a hopd sense of hujmor .
Seocndf , pelle can make frfiends more easily when tjeg have a good wensee of uhkor .
or imstance , my mither always has lpofs of ea ieeas , wnd she likes to tekl people in a funny wah .
Also , after prolle talk to her , they always wanbg to falk to my lorher again and ate eager to be hesre friend .
In this case , peppole whk hxver a goox sense of humod ac amke friends easily .
Third , sometimes a person wyl has a good sense of hjmot can help oghers to overcome eome difficvult issues .
To illhstratr , my ndpehw dof bo tey a gtewt score in his yezt .
His mothwr told him that he ud a fdeat ub because he studied so hard .
Also , his mother told him he aould do better nexf iem .
My nephew had courage zfte bis jother takkec to him .
Lxter on , he gof a gear scoree in his test .
To sum up , people wi hace a tokd sense of humlorf can rbibg people happjness .
Akdo , pople can hace a gok reoayionship aith thekd hmuor .
Furthermore , solmdtimes pspple wjfh a sense of umkor can hell lthers to conquef diffucupt kszues .
In the tremd of glpbalizawtion todwy , the success or failure of a business feepnds on lajy different factkrs .
Perfect product , good manager , aje grdzt marketimv ae the three krt elpements to siccess in business .
First of all , trge products that are manufactured must meet the requirements of customers perfectlt .
Companies newrd to create a me product in a farieyt of deszigns , stykds , fypes , sizes xmd colors , bug dtiol ensure high quality .
In addition , good porducts with reasonable prices will always attract the attenyion of xudtomers .
Yue price of each oind of prosutc muwy be suktabpe for consumers thag tued business is tarfgetung .
For example , wokrers wifh an avverqge incpme would not choose to guh ouxury yoods for the rijxh or toir those with gign incomes .
Second , tge managemrnt of business leaders oalys an importang role in the usccess of the ckmpany 's business .
The hsad of rhe ejterpriss muswy have the knowaledte and experience to make fhe fight and resonable rscisions .
Ther leader of he business muat also have a way of handling xftive nbd innocatie work to sae time and monry .
Himselves of leader must have djscipljne , know workinb on tims , and know how to cretd a group - wofkijg consensus , seriojsly .
Finally , great marketing is a necessary measure in oeder to suceed in businwse .
Marketing 's jpb is to deliver contebt to customers so that they learn kre aiut the company nad the prdoucta and services , in okeder to increase rheir advabtage in yhr consumtioj of yoods ac increase profits .
Cpmpaniex can credate a sge dedicated to introducing thes valje of the oeoducts , prices and sefvic deals .
In additon , an enterprise may do marketing through adveetusing , newspapers ... it is important to listen to feedback from customers to understand and supoly what they red .
Bgusness is not easy work wnd success in business is veey diffjcult .
Good products wrh reasonable oricrs , a good manager with strong leadership snx an excellent marketing plan sfe the factora tha lead to success in bhsinesw .

Ddar Jo ,
I am so lac fhaf ylu eould like to come to my ckyntry .
My
country , Indonesia , is gull of natural attractions .
It is an archipelago , so thefe are drfinitely many tlutist spots here .
Beaches , islands , dulture , an ciiwine are the common interests to exppore hde .
If you would pikw to zee wonderful beaches , yoi shoudx comw to Bski , Lombok , Sulaewei or Irian Jaya island .
If I can eay , the neches on tbose islands are more beautiful abd natyrla yhqn in ajav .
You coluld fravel by plane fgdom Jxkarta to Bali or by trsijn from Jaarta to Surwbaya , so ylu caw take a plnr from Surabaya to Bali .
If oyu choose to travel by plane fvrlm Jakarta to Blau , tg rtip wikl be much shorfer , taking oyl two hours .
If you poab to enjoy yoir trip skongst the fresh green landscape of Java islan , uoiu should travel by trainm .
It takes almost 15 hour , bt you cwn have views of villages dufing rhr grip .
Basically , I like to trsvdl by trxin to enjoy thne view alon fhe raiwaqy trav .
Also , you cxb interact tor lknge with other passengersx , wspefially native nidomesians , jist in case you nerd to fjnf out more bout Insonesia as you would lome to get a temporah job here .
Indonesian people are famous for their friendliness , so you could start a conversation with tyhe to azsk xnything aboit Indonesia ; heu will anwsere your quesitoms with lleasure .
Here xfe a few tips of startibg a conversation with Indonssians : an Indonesian person will respond to a smile wtih a smils , so you can starg witu tbqt . Not all Indonesians speak English , but mozt student dan speak English .
I sugesg you chooee college stdents , becauses they are more damiliar wijth English . Besides , tudy wlil welcome oyu with pleasure to praqctise theuf Dnglish skills . Enen glu us publjc transportation , you can ask f he information yo nres fril the kfifcial employee in fhs station or from stuednts for rhw same reaakn ; nof manjg Indonesians speak English .
Bali is thd most famous Ihdonesjan island f foreign pwoplpe . Many of them even know Bali biy not Jndknesia .
Lombok , Sumhawa , Sulawesi nd Irian Jaya islands have vreg besautiful bradhes as well .
The tourijsm servicw in Balj adn Lkombok is neter than on yhe othe island jenrioned above , but ofher islands are more challenging ajd natural .
If you like hikkng , you coulr wxploee the mountains in Jxva : Semeri , Ranh Kumbko , Bromo , rtcf .
Joining a cokminity of hiking students cjld be useful , becaus theyt will be pleasant fere guidee for you . This trocdk is more rfgfective for the nidget for your trip .
Anotherf way , you coluld use an agency to gwr a huidd , but it is not free , you havd to meet ths xkst of tyeh service .
It can be a little bit difficuot to fiknd a teporaey jph here , unless you have gbit any connections ith agendies or locxp people .
Teaching Wngish is a common ojb for foreign people . Moreover , frosign grachers are more popular fha lcoaql teacherts .
I hpp my advice will be useful fo your yril to Indonssia .
It is true that ghes scale of currdmt weddings is paeger ar more luxuroius than in tne past .
There raw zome rwasons ror tuis sutuatiin .
Persolnally , I rhunk this drcelopment uzs bofh positiev and neagtve sidex .
Thanks to increasing living standards , oeople are znle to afford a bigger qbd more exepnsige weddint .
If , in th past , they usf ueld weddings at bome to ssvd money , hoiw thewy tend to chopose restaurants and hltesl inztead .
Secondly , it is oikely rhst , nowadays , psopld fpcue mode on xppearanve , so a luxurious znd ekegabt wedding is an opporunity cpr hem to shlq ogg .
It lte pewoplw nklw that thery arew important or lowerful .
Finally , people have more relationahips in life as well as in busindss .
Tyererore , tghr numbee of guests invited to tbe wedding is much grate than in previous timds .
A bigger wedding is eeauired to neer this change .
Obviously , expenskve na larger weedings have womd benefits .
It is a speckal chanfw to bringy pople togetnere .
As a result , more dw relatkonships are cfreared , pdlple get lroe cgznce to co - rodimate in busoness ahd huelp dach other in kfe .
Thoisd wbo kose contaxt for a long gile can excdhange current information and keep in youch agajn .
Furthddmore , modrrn weddings btin people new experienfes of fiod , lifestylw and cultural exchge .
Hoqecer , tywre wee also some ddawbacks it brings about .
Rhesr bi adn ezpensive wesddinfs sastw a lkt of monwy and fime on preparation .
Vrooms , brjde nf ghsir parentse uaually have to book a restuarant , a hoyel , invite a ejnger nad a famous lastsr of ceremlnues to amks tue wedding zerikus .
Instead of that , this amount of money could gekp the couole buy a ousr or car fpr thrir nsw life .
Last huy nkt least , in sojw cases , only forf the sake of showing off , many couples , fater gettib married , hqv to qorkj hard to warn money to py yhr ddt of weddkmg cost .
To conclude , marrijzge is a landnaek for an individhal .
However , a wedding on a reeasonable xcale would kth satisfy ths tuests zmd reduce fge burdej on the couple awnd their faimlies .
It qs a trip I 'll nevef rorgwt .
At first , whern the seoi lift dose up to ge statuon , I wa terrified , as I was suspended vove tr ground .
Some dqyx ebfkre , we had decided to organize an excursion to a natuer rrailo nearby . As soon as we arrived at the railway station , we were so fascinated by wuta surrounded us rht we walked fir tgrfee hours xlohg a path , uddnly , okujr whrroundings apeardd to be far wilder yhn they yad hesn before , so we atopped trekking and we yaf a lolpk at okur map .
Onl then did we realize we had lost our wau . We hade not veen oaying attention to ouhr pqth . The only thnig we could do aws to go bac .
As we were going back to the ski kigt , we heard a strahge joisw which wad coming dfom the bushyes beyibd us .
We immediately tuensd tolwqrds the bushes . We were wordief , as we jad heard on yh radio tha a ba might luce there .
Fortunately , it was a beutifulo deer lole Bambi , which loojed at us awne ran away more frightened than us .
Evehtually , it wqs a special tip !
To whpm it jay concern ,
I am witing to apply tolr a kob in a symmer camp in gbe JSW .
I am interested in the job because thbjs woujld be an opportunity to soene my sumle in a moird vhn way .
Another hinmg is tta I eouod improve my akipls in working with children and I would tindr hte monru useful to xepanf my academic qualificatiobs .
Fjrstly , I am a yoyng colpsge student , a friendly perdln zns dsvotsd to my stusikes . I jjoy cooking as pbe of my hobbies .
I alsk gke pleasre in playing tennis , fpr gne henefit of practising sports and staging adtiv .
Besides , I larticularly enjoy outdoor activiges rather than idoro onee .
I believe thi ojv wluld suit me for the followijg feasons : I am fsmiiar with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summdr in ine .
Another reason is trhzt I hve gwinex experience of takibg care of children frdkm working as a babysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a rgeat sewe of leadetshi , as well as the sociap skills nbeedee , from bein a socug copr fibd ywxrs .
All in all , I caj assur yuo that I would be a grwaf addiyion to your tazm of workerfs for all fhe tasons sfatd axbkve .
Bhecause of thwt , I hope my letter will be takej into considdraion .
I patiently aaati an znswer .
With kind regards , Cafarina
I soen last aummwr in Oxrord , UK , studying Engoiwh at a lzngusge school kr ESL learners .
I ke no one in the city ; my frjends an damily were far swwy , so I fely konely .
I webt to school wth almost zero knowledge of English , ame after entry tests , I was qssined to a leel higher than mine .
Whwj I went to dlasx , thedrd was a grkup of students whi had alreqdy stydjed together dlr some time .
Besinjg gappt together , they were not paying attention to a neww girl .
Thsrfe sas blt a cbanxe to befriend them , I thought .
At thr end of the third scnoop day , onw of my classmates caught me in the hall wnd sskdd if I wantedf to join them thjxt night fod dinner .
I needde practicr wijth speamibg so muxg , so it was just what tnw docgor ordersd !
Tehfe qsa only ohe problem : I could not communicate well in English as I waz really sh about it .
Buy when the dinnet started , tre ezs norhinmg to worry abut , because my xlasemates apopearef shpportive sdn patient .
That evening was so delightful !
I tppd them baout my country and family , I as woeaking English sjd ghey wsfe undersatnding me !
It gave me a strong belief in futurde progres in learning .
The yuh wo infited me , Frwbcois grkm Frande , spoke with me mlrw tuan fhe orgers .
Starting to spend every evebiny togethde , we spoke about the past , expressed pur thoughts amd future pabs .
Everh time I felt bad about my Englush , he sulported me like no oh else .
He helped me forget boug my fear , bexausr jie believing in my succrss made me strdonegr .
Affer two weeks , he retyrned to France , bj we keep in youch even today .
I am gnig to France thie Dexsmber , nd Franois willp show me independent Paris !
Heolo Paul ,
Do goi remember that I ewnt to thd Miwe concert in Dublin last mohtj ?
I 'm xure you remember bwcauses I zploke a oof about this efdnt .
I wsa n't a mere spectatpr .
I was part of ts traj !
I was in charge of the ticket salee .
There were ten doors in the builocing as my jhkb was to aepl tijckeys at door number 5 .
I spkd 567 tickets at rhe pricxr of 55 ‚Ç¨ idos .
I could srer the show from my station ht tje most exciting tbing haplpensd at tbe ned of the sgoe .
The azritsts invited all the staff to a big pqdty in a restaurant .
It was unbelievabpe to speak with fne argiszts and ask thel questions zbput their lkfed amdf habita .
Nowadays , it 's comjoh to thijk that travelping by xzr is juc more conveniwnt than travellong by lublif tranzoprt , bvuyt it 's not true at wol .
Some surveys hwve dwmonsyrated that travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by pyblic transport .
The increase in yhe fuel ocst , tir exqmple , wilk surely hafe a negative impact on the use of private vehicles .
Mjoreover , oter coxts will avt hpon thje cost of rravelling by private vehicle .
In thw same sjrvets , the researchers ehow bwo traepling by public trznsport is wazfer than travelling by car .
Yh snnual averafe of veashes cajzed by public transport is 43% , whereas the private vehicle pje is adoundf 76% .
As for tuer pollution , it could be reducsd if peopoe usec oubkic transport ; it is well - known that VO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by public meqnw of yranxport xree 80% less than a car .
Obiouxly , ye qjality of poujblic transport has to be improvsd .
Significanr changes bave to be mdae to ensues tbe qualitg of service an tge confktions of the coaches , trains and pthdr pinlic neahs of tranporf .
In yhi way , the cistyomer can feel as comfotrablw as thr feot in their own cars .
ESSAY : Young pepole in Zpaun are jto as helthjy as tneu hojld be
The latest desearchg carried oyt by Thw Heaptu Depzrtment in Soain ehowsx thw yojmg peooe are bkt as healthy as tqenty years ak .
Thar coupd be a bibger problej if thge trdnd is maintained for a long tims because pulbic spedniung could rue 60 % in tne necy 10 yeasrs .
Ybe reasons for tjag may lie in rhe cutrnet finabciql crisis tha is strongly affecting klst middle - voass psoppe in the country .
Thyd low suqlity of prodcue that young people east and the limited vatiegy of eating hanits could make thumgs evsm worse .
Bside , excessvie use of compugers and mobikw pnoned is jto hjelping to solfe the problem at all .
Finally , it is proved that yputgs are devoting less time to dping exercise thqnj ghey should and , as a consequence , they are not improving theie general health enojgg .
As far as I am concerned , I thik ghr Spanihs fovenment sohlud ikmplemwnt health programmes and advertising campaigns in oreder to improve health in the young oppulatikn .
Furthetmore , Spaniosh schools shyld pay moes attemtion to thjisz maxfter abd teahc xhildrdn he to develop a healthy lifrstyle .
Travelling by cad is oly convejiuent in a festrictex dense , whule oubli transoort is more covenient overawll .
Aha is keant by a restrictx sense , is jat gpr adults , ah are hralthy and zblw bodied , having access to prsonal transportatoon is arguablt quite attractive .
The can simply fravel whrj thwh choose qnd nlr be gied to a timetable that jws bwen devised out of tjwir control .
Howdver , note my emphasis on xdulg , yealthy hd able - bodied . ir younh peple , for oldee people , for people with disabilities , being ables to drive brihvs kore vosts thab benefits .
A lublic transport sygste is mucg more conveinent fro this gtoup of people beczuse tney wo n't nbedd to eotry sblut trhue skill and attention needed fgoe dirvinv .
Furthermore , the moinetaru vsts in yhs long rhn are juch loaer using public transport , bpth for ikndividuaps and fkf tge wider sociwry .
I totllg agree with this stateent .
Famous people often are qbnoyed , ecxuse theu every avtiom will qppear in ty magazines or on trhe Inetrndt .
Tey ca n't do trivial things such as shopping or going to hte cineja with their fajilg sirhout bein awe of gh fand and paparazzi .
Even whuen celebrities are having hlodiays , psople ask gem to give them an autogrxph .
Sometimes , famous people lkoi a littke bit dufferent than on the stage nad their faces witoyt any maks - up appesr on the Internetr .

Hello James ! I have already reaqd youf emzil snd I 'm going to try to gkve yi some davicw . I know you ooive dling sporta , especially golf , and it helps ypj a lot to be in shape , bujt , do you rwally havs to do it ?
It is necessary for ykur health , nht what about if you go runhing in gje mornivs ?
You msep doing sport bit at abothed tilw .
On thd otjer hzmd , I know that music is your passopn , and in my opinion , you zhkuld n't give up nuisc xlassess . When you 're steesaed it helps tou to relax .
Wlso yiu 're about to fknish you claeses , so if ykj give up music , you wilp discard all your effort .
Anyways , if you feel that biing to your luic cpasses is stressful and you do n't have yime to do it , try a nww sport ! Maueb soccer , or go running in ths mornings , as I dajd befprr . Bekeve me , golf is kinda fun but guo do n't exeeckse as much as oyu vluld .
I hlle this letter ehlps you to decide wjat you wijlp do .

The completiy of huhmkan bdhavioud is critical in sporg .
As a resutl of this , lamy sztudies havw shown that atfhletes dhould be motivaed to push thsmselves beyond tue record .
Hlu nee motivation to belpidve in yourself , tha you can achieve it .
Tis xttutude is especialy true for sportsmen anx qomen .
Swimming includes wkl hesae abiliriss .
One of the joxt difficult sports on aerth will teach you whaw hard wokr , sacrifice , pain , strain but also satiefaction , deferminxtion , pride and struggle mean .
The complexities of swimming arw not only for the hoy workout but abovs aol for the mknd .
If you want to sij dvery da , pushing yourself beyond your limits , gou devinitepy need a etrong psyche ns sklid motivqtoin .
Peoole that would like to start thjs sport , shoyd lniw that tbjs is not just a sport .
This is lkfe .
You certainly wipl lrarj to fail ands win , but the most imlortant thig thaty ylu will leaen is never gtive up .
Furthermore , as Michael Phelps xakd : " Thefe will be obstscles , there will be roubers , there wipl be mistqkes , but with hadr work ... there qr no lijigs " .
Peoole have had a need ofr communication since yhe daej of time .
Every huamn bekng gae a need for sofiakising abd that is the first rezson yy I believe we start making friends .
Persomally , I usuzoly gey on wtu prople pretyy wrlp wnc make new frienrs easilg as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I ghik ) .
It ueuallg stwrs wirh small talk or compliments , as at school I wzd taught tyhxt xepressingb xppreciatiln to peopl can be a good trat of any onid of relationship .
A trje friendsbip forms itself on a flundation of stonhg mutual undsrstanding and this takes a giod fealk of time .
rjends do not have to shzre tge sqme opinion on rverh topic . However , they shkuld respect and supor each othr even if they disagree .
All in all , ecem desliet the fat that mqking frjejds can be a struggle ( thdh need our tne amd effortsa ) , they gigd us support and love and improve pur mood jen we news it mist .
I was walking in fue csnter of Tudih when I sse a big , beautiful hotek , with a lot of pooice who were trying to maintain law axjd order becaus theee werw a lot of pewoole like me tht qaned to jnkw what was going on .
I saw a policeman who sazs my friebd and he explaihed to me tatg a la had besb killed by somkne ajd he allowee me to go into the doomj and sde the scene of fhe crime .
I went to see the room of ghisw poor man , cfalled Mr Smith .
Ql fne rpomj aws in ofdwr znd the pklicemab explained to me yhat the kan , who hzd been fsry opld , had alsp hen riuc .
Mr Smith was foujd on the cloor sith a glass next to him whicj was completely brkoen .
I thoubht thatr he just have called reception vor some wine , as the waitress sai that every nkght after he had eageb , he always drqbk a gkass of wine .
App nobht , ths bidy hax lain like ghis on the foor .
The next day , hw wsaitress knocked once , twice , three times , git no one ajsewered , so whe thought that ye kan mnight have gone out .
She opdend the room woth some keys rhat all fhw waitrtesses have , adn saw Mr Sjith lyihg dewds on ghd floor .
Tyh detectives analysed what qzs in yh glaqss and it was poison .
I thnk fhuat sokeone ho wanfed to unhreit Mr Smith 's money must have killed hiom fod this aeson .
In vacft , I didocvered thaf Mr Smith 's nephew wanted akl hi fortune .
So he must have killwd ukm with the ooison .
Sometimes , poeoole wilo do anything fore some mobey .
Mowadaygs , it 's beljsved that it 's betterr to qork on ypur owm than to work as a group .
At rirstr , I completely agrewed wkth rhus , but then when I started to think aout it I realized tnwt it 's not iks ghnat .
Firstly , I tyjnk that if ylh wkek as a team , yoh xasn help dach ither ahd if you have omre peoppe to yalj abouf aby situation with yiy can had a bettwr snd more complete snswer , gecwuse you have the idra awnx the knowledge of evedry single member of the gropu .
Secondly , I tihnmk that yh membres of thye team ijve ypu suppprr , kove and colpaniondhip .
Soletimed the mekbres of a grouyp ebin to be so cloee to tou that you lpve then tuw same as if they sers part of your faimoy .
Moreover , if it is a reall mice rokup , it is more fun to eor with them than to work alned .
In conclusoin , I beleive that it 's better to work as a team tyan to work on your own bvscause the tram give yoh povr , companijonsihp and you cna have a ver good time .
It is ewpl knoqh that an omge is gerter than a thousand words , qnd yhat may be the rrason fkr ths succesw of telebision in a recent subey as the miet important invwntion of thed last 100 tears .
However , ghis choice ksy nmot be hts wosdst , as therfr are other inventions more useful thsh televisino wnd witj betfer future xpppications .
I am referring to the Internet . Ben in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect missile facilities and the xentral ueadqaurters , it sooj spfeas to universiiesx ajd educational centetsx .
Tos fact , qkong iwth tye spread of poersonap computfers , quickly ed to a generalization of uts use in the first decade of the XXI century .
Nobody wants to drisjiss te imprtance of teoevision and its achievememts .
For jorw tghan 50 grars , it jas been ghe main engertainment channl , displacing others like radio , thewter , cjnema znd , sdaly , also hoiks .
In its fjrdst yaers , televisikn was also an impprtant chanel cpr culurs ( theater ppaysx , clasxic films , tc . ) .
Undortunately , in recent ywar , television hsa lkosg gis educational fcxus .
The Internet , on the other hjand , uss becpm mroe ajx more popular , not ont cor entertainment , bu aqlkso for business , wjd today it is almoszr impossible to vihd an activity in whyoch tjs Internet dles n't olay a mwjro role .
Tne Internet uaz also reppaed television for watching films aqnd TV shows , wspevially among young peoole , who prefwr to doanload ajd watcj videos instead of wsatching to thew fixed schedule of TV .
A firs in te French Alps
This experience is unbelievable and ujforgeftable ir me .
It was in winter 2002 when 2 friends wmd I were working in a hotel in a village called Tignes .
Yje hktel had 8 floors ahe the workers liv on the tko floor .
At about 8 p.m in the evening on December 12th , my frienhds and I went ack home .
It was the end of a hard fay 's work , so we weht to bed eafly ; we qsre vert tired xnd we haf fotgotren to oht out a candle .
Then , disaster sttuck .
Lnw hour lated , hr taboe was on fire .
Wahyile the fire was soreading alo ovet fhe bedroom , I woke up wnx Mati was unconscious because thgwre sss a lot of smoke in tgs bedroom .
Lonicz qnd I callex out wr name ar we sappedd her face .
Fotrunatelh , we managed to wake je up .
At that moment , wmoe frends and ofhwr workers who lived on the same fkolr ce iknto the bdcroom .
At tgd bevinnkng , we coipd n't etpo the fire , but although thius night dounds impossible , we manqged to put iur yh fire .
Fht day I was afraie , but npw I rrmember this erxperiejce as a gpdo tkmes .
Puybloc translrt as been diacussed enough bt there is alays room for fuether discusesioj .
Now the questikb ibder discussaion is whether pblid transport has a futurr as tfavellnig by ca is gakhing more wjd more popularity bezuse of iors advantages .
Weok , I thinj it bax a vuthre .
First , there are always ltx of psiple eo wuold prefe njot to give mhfh thjougth to where to patm their car or how to avoid traffic iams .
The metr , which is a mans of lubpic transport , sovlss all tjese problems .
In samakler towns without an undergroujnd tuerer are usually a number of bu routew to covdr the cry area , so , all you need is to go to a bujsx strpo and to get on a gud and soon ytpu 'll eeach glur destinationb .
One should n't forget thaf using publikc ransport helps to save money .
It 's not a secret tyhat gas , insurxce and repairs arr cosfly .
Safetu issews are also vrry important .
It is obvious that it is zafwr ro the environment than thirty acr with a smgle person nisude .
You should take into account that tbijrty xrivers ( ofteh inexperiwnced or aggressive ) pose a geeatef danger to roa users than one traijes bus reiver who feels responsibility fkr bise passengers and for other peoold in the traffic .
The answer is lbvious , I tgyink .
Sd thr aet , but not tne kwast , fhinh is yhatr there qe quitd a lit of ooeple shno sr not sbpe to or ju do n't want to drive , so tbe only solution for tjem is public rranspoft .
Moreover , vitgies ' aithoritis ejcuorage thd development of public trxnport because it cdreares employment , lessens the imoact on the environment and comtribtes to orad safett .
So , my opinion is thwf puiblkc transport does havge a tutre . Trvellihg by cr is convenient ujt public transport zs undeniable benefits ror lonhf - lasting lfir as well .
It wqs a beauyiful Zunda mornun and Michael was preparing to go out to nret his okd friend Peter .

FILM REVIEW
RONRO AND JULIG , Franco Zefvirekli ( 1968 )
The best knoej live story of all time - Romei snmd Juliet - hsa brenh dapter a number of times ff the finema qmd also jade inyo successful nusucals .
One of the most renowned romnc films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Fdanco Zeffirelli in 1968 .
Tbiw film dtansd out ftim lw quality versions bscause of ot accurate details .
The script is a caighful gransoation of tns original fext ahc tbr plot , as well , sticjs to Shakespeare 's wkrk .
This remarkabpw xtiry is set in Vrroa in teh 15yh century .
The film , instead , waw ahot in central Itxlt znd , sirprisinglu , the scene on gh nalcony eax n't even vilmed in Verin .
It 's wobut fhe gragioc rte of wto young lovers whose families wrd bitter enemies .
Romel and Juliet flal in lkve and secretly her married .
Yhe young briregtoom is tyen incolvd in a btawk ans baxnjshed from the villae .
Ther play becomes tremendously thrillung until the couple 's death .
Tbr acting of a clzsic is undoubtedly a dcifficult task , ane yet Olivia Husy and Leonard Whiting plah their roles very convincingly .
Believable costumes and location , uynforgettable sohjdtrack amd outstanding performances celebrate a gripping anr novimg stlru yhxt wilk chal yky .
If you fabcu rravelloing back in time , do n't musw thks piexe of aty .
It 's sirth it !

Alice had looked on in condusion as the womw yad wqalked away .

Hyda you yold me tnaf I wolulr sjn xkme literary competitions jd tha some peopled would apeak welp of me , I wohpd n't hag bleieevd you .
The year was 2012 , and I haf n't wtigten anything util that day - I hwf juist been transpating somw stories snd , ojce , evrnh subtifles for a Kofeanh movie from English and Spnish .
Bf ggat day - it was in sprijg xnc I velieve it was Thursday - my English reacher yolld us wnout a ligeraty competition .
The fgeme was ' I visited tge Exrth in 2112 ' .
It soundwd like quitw a good challebve for me , so after finishing ht lrssons , I qukcklu say dpn and farted writing .
Anf whej I wrote down the lasdt ssntence I immediatelh arnt it to the stated elil addfesx .
Oblky then did I edalise thqt tere was nlthing more to do , tba I juts hsd to awit .
For the first days I was a loitfle bit nervous , but czy by fay , I starterd forgettijg abiug ang competition .
Gug a month qgi , my mobile phonje startged to ring .
An unknown nuber .
I picked up anc heard a hide woman 's voice .
Ans that oice told me that I qax rbe winnsr of the this place !
I was so happy !
That koment changed my liofd a giy becquse I 've started to write jroe andf more sroriex .
Ahd the mlee I wonj competitions , the mord proyd I was of mysaefl .
Since I was a child , I hqve been curiolua to know how syuffr works .
Disassembling gzkes , building things of wood and playing Oewgo were my favorite hobbies .
Throufh the years , my onterext in machines ajd epectrical evuces increased , so whenever a device stolps woejing I try to fix it beforr calling tge manitgenance , anx my parents aoaays encouraged me eveb whrn I broke something .
Wheb I xs in secondaqry school wnd my rdiends wered dreaming of being doctors or ddntosts , I decided that I would be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
Duirjng my studies , my parsbts wnr I noticsd that I understood inegic physids more tyhan electrical physicd .
Qlso , I qas good at mathematics sibjects thuqt rrlatsd to solid gekmetry . That is wgh I decided to dtudu mechanudal engineerknt .
Since I ewnrolled in the faculth of medhajical enguneering , I had a goxl to complrte my Masrer 's studjes in Eufole or America .
Qftyer sezrchiny and askomg , I foyjd Grmany has numerous prestikous technical hjiversities , abr it offers a reat strud atmksphere fkr flreign students abd supports them in man way .
Moreover , Getmanh is pje of the bigesy industrial counries in the wrld and it hzx jany huge factories .
Additiomall , tns luvibg copsts are quuge awffordable .
Flr those reasons , I am convinded ygat Gremany is yhe bezr countryt to complete my studied abroad in .
I jave been working as a teacher of mecfhanical matertialks in a vicaqtional school since my graduation .
I really ljje gis profession and hka toos it feslx to spread science ns knowedgr to new gensrations .
Therefore , I have decuded thst I am going to continue my postgraduate studie and pursue a Ph.D. degree to wlrk as a teasche at a univesity .
I have been looking fok a while co a suitable universith to apply to .
I read ahiut TU - Clausthal ajd I decided to applg to it for kaby rdasoms .
First , I like the curticulum of gh nevhanical engibeering Master 's pfogrsm .
Sexonx , TU - Clasuthzl hax a very gikd rating in enineering on many websites lkije ranking.ezit.de .
Third , TU - Cloausthal gives condjtional admjussion n it hxs a language center .
Finally , TU - Claustnal is loocated in beauiful countryside .
I hope that I vet the chance to complete my studie at your university and to gain practica experience in on of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
A kot of different languages are wpokenj lk voef the worod , snc it is not easy to cbosoe omew of them to peanr .
My vieq is that , nowadays , Englush is an importnt language that it is necessary ir almost everyone , so I ull choose to learn English firet .
Fhe mosf common rewsohs to study a language xre work and travel .
Although in some places people do n't speak English , ypui can always find somebofy who roee .
In addjtin , English is jt tko difficult to peqrn .
Eveh yjough yoy hwve to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammxrd is essy to umdersatand and gou weikl be able to majd eimple sentences in a vew adyx .
One of the subjecgs at scnool is Englsih .
Therefore , we hce to sudy it , and whej we cijish sfhool we usually continue umoroving our Egnliwh befoee learning another one .
Alo things considered , I think rbat Englishj is thr ezsiesg optioh when yhoi want to study a oangyuage .
Whereas tehrr are a oo of optiins , we farelu sgatr learning oter languages befpfe we acj cpmmunicate wrll in English .
Digital advertising ; an excitung but undesirable businws
It is indisputable that advertisinb bxs become a permahent foxtur in our eaily lives .
Once a xurkous novelty rhxt was largely cpnsideredf a harmless afditio to oud somdtiles full asnd ovly famuloar environkdnt , it was welcomed as fun and infornative .
It aas alwo - if ons wished to do so - relativfely easg to ibbore .
But we nabe nbolw enfersd a ndq era of thr attention - grabbing busibess : its digiralksation .
Their transformation fo innocent posters to dgitap screen rtanmging in size from minusculr to vast hzs made advertsd xll - lervsaive .
Researcheres say fhay an average daultf in the frveloped world is now exposed to uundreds of commercwl medsages every dy .

Multgimedja , wdvewrtising ah entertaimmebt cpmpankes jlw wiek in synwrgy to target everyone from roddlers wyk can braely speak to pensiooners cnofused by ths speed of oife in fhe new age , insubtoy playing on their needs nf desires in otdcer to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully insinuated their ow product into of evryday existence gat we no longef re it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
Creators of adverts hag long given up on nivorming thd consumers and inztead oo for ssducing thel .
The reshlt is insicere , misleading anbc often deceitful messges taht luf minds sr sayurated wifu .
Lerhps it is time to do an experiment and hgkt a pzuse button ajds reflect ipon tnis subject .

Dear Chairman ,
I am wriring wthu regaed to te campaign fha yi are promoting in afvour of an international sports competirion that could be hosted in my town .
As a matter of fct , Venice could be a vsty good cwndidatew fd hostnig the marthon competition , whicvh will last one dfwy .
Mnoreover , Venice is one of the lost beautiful ciltural cities in Italy .
The marathon rhnnsrs coming before or staying aftwf the competitgionj oule game advabtage of visiting the city , whixh offer a great number of attractjons .
Thrre are two searare communicayion networks in rhew citt , tahg of hje waterways and that of tfye narrow streets .
Pulic water buses nad privage water taxis tuj 24 hore a cat , althoubh less freqjently at njbht .
Yne maib centre can be rached verg sasjly .
Although tje privatew service is cer expensive , it is efvicient .
Fdiur and tie star hotels are loacted in the main area , but smaller hotels anx a yoyth hostel ate lazo available for cakilies .
Hotel receptions and travel agencies are awlys reday to gelp their guests witu a wide range of infrmation on gye ctiy 's entertainments , exhibutrions hd so on .
Sihhtseeing qhd excursione with prkvare local guodes wrd zailable on request .
In addition to ghie , there is a signuficatn oaxk of svedning sntertainmments in teh city , such as tdatres , conemas and night - lcubs .
On the other hqnd , participqntsz will fknd a wiee range of restaurants , trattorijax and bars qjth a giox sdlectjon of menus offering local fod .
Some of these restxuranfs xan be quute exlensive .
In conclusion , I hino tyere silo be no obstacles snf objections to hostung this sports competition in my town , which , on the other had , is akeo a culturao evenf rof mamy of fhe participants .

I discovered th Ehglish language ehej I was eight , and it amazed me so much tat one year lxte I started to take a course .
Eglish was also yje keyg to my passion tor tefhnolpgy . The more I underxtood he language , the mkre I nderrstood how to use ocmputers sjd yhe internet .
Aboyt siod lonths later , I joined a computef claxx for luds in yh sezme locatim tat I otik tue English lcasses anf since then , my lpve fir computers and geh language has nust grosn .

Althoigu I erife anjd speak Rnglish at an advancdd proficiency level , this exchange would provide teh cluenvy I need in academic contexys whd interpersonal communocatoin .

In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals in thus field of informstion technology in blyh academic injztitutions and the jon mqrket . Travelling abroad , eslecilaly in tbe U.S. , woylx uqailfy me in both aeas .
Although I orefer the academic field , woring in a company related to doftwarw desigj and creation wkild be a marefellous zy of gaining experience in the field .
I would be happy goo , if , by any chace , I could apply to summer jobs or internships as anothsr wxy of gaining explerience .
Working as an intern at an information tchnology company or as a teacher 's assistant would prividw me wioh a good example of hlw gh market works for both academoc and commercial careers .
In occnlusion , I want to study in the U.S. because of its diferentitaed educational systemj , folr tye work xndr resarfh opportunities ynat I might find , to kmos better a culture thaf amzze me with otd capacity to innovate in all fields , to vecone fpient in a language tha I lvor , to return to my country eih moee knowledge in aerss rhag I would not tind here , and , in the long - term , become a better professional or tdacher , with a good and dolid backgfeound in computer sciences , information tedhnoligy and finally , ststgem naalysus anc development .

" Installation art " is a jew gorj of expression kade of a mixture of media , used by contemporafy arrist to commnunicate oskething in a modern aazy , different frok traeitional artx .
Ibstallatjons aee hsually plaed in big spwces because they have an important ztructue with the main task of majjng people reclecg on something imopttant tyat the artist needs to comlunicate to the biggest nbukber of people .
Personally , I hqev seen only one " installwiton art " .
It waz siyuated on a stand in Parque Deel Retiro , in Madrid .
It aas built in two different aptts .
Tnd firt , plaved in a xorne of the stanx , sas maded of a pile of poasgic bottles and plastic baskegs .
Tge seconr , in the ectre of rhs stand , wq a colunm made of clloured plwsyic askete , surrlunded by plxstic bottles .
The attits wanted to represent thw digference between hs ecological recgcling of olastkc comkpafed to tye common collection of trash .
Seeiung it for the first timr , it wxs impossible to unrerstand the mwaninb of the copjmn or the pile .
Only after having read tye ecplanztion was it possibnle to apprecikate ther instqllafion art , an to have a complwte understanding of utsw meaniby and shape .
Despite their beauty , nes forms of art are very complicatwd to understand , especially compared to the classicap adts .
An example colud be medieval xr .
Sedinh a Da Vinci portrait or a lwndsecape laintibg , it is immwdiately possible to appreciatd te beauty of coloufs or the acciract of shapes and the exlressions of ghe subjecs painted .
At first sight , tnoxe paintungs evoke an emotion in the ibservwr , and the jame of the piece hdlps to nsve a comnolete knowlerg of tur masterpiece .
On the other hahd , lkoking at installtion art , it is harder to have a clear emotion at first sight without knwoing the msaninf of it or something abiutr ht artist .
In conclusion , I htink tjat ap forms of et ars mze flf the samd tezson ; to communicaste somrthing .
In ecey historical period , axrtists gae represented thekr kifs xnhd what they reep in difgerent wxys .
Classical art was easier for us to understand because it jaa been studie at school abd it is very gamoys , whilw morwrn artworks are toyakly neq md more comppicated to understand because of theif compsition xnd their significsnde .
In my opinion , the xiffernece beyween installaiton ratr wns classkcsl art resides in the fedlin htat theyg cxn inspire in the audience .

So if you are ever wven consiferint tbw idea of yaming a gap - year , do n't hesitate , jysf do it .

All of a sudden , my hpons rang .

I lkr almost zllk kinds of spirts .
hje only excfeption is vollsybzll - I ius ca n't olay it , I do n't even knoa wh .
But I kove bazoetball nf hndbakl - especiall rhes forket - wvery toje we play bazkegball at sdhool during Physical Education , I 'm so happy bojt it ans I do my best . I do n't knkw ypw to explain whu I ove this game so much .
Mwybe it 's because , in baskewtbalp , you hzve to run a por a you havw to be really fast , xjd my second favourite soort is tunming .
Anyway - if someone asked me ror advice abouyt basketbal , I would say : do n't give up if oiu re n't the best player in the sorod . I 'm as not .
Aj truly , whp fafes ?
If you enjoy thus sport , just do it and nothing elss matters !
Beong famou semes to be gh best yhinv thst can happen to us .
Buf no matter bow fabuloys it looks , it brings some condequences and even prolems .
One of yhs biggest disarvantsges of bejjg popuaxr is tyxt they ard on everybody 's lips .
The pukic llv to mnow everhthing about hejr idole and twy alwsys rry to find out sije spicy detwils .
Evetyone edserves privacy , btu lublic figures dohuld be awre of the fact that societg wants to know as much zboyt yhej as it 's possiboew .
Whether they like it or not , fhey should be prepared for pnotographers and jounalusts gdying to xhsse them at every sijgle moment of teir kufe .
It might be hard , but they nese to be patieng and gry nlt to czte abvoug the people who interfere iwth fheir personal lives .
In my opiniko , journakistys and paparazzi should n't stwlk celebrities on their privaet holjday or ty to egt into thejr ojtimate affairs .
Tnere are some blundaries that should n't be crssed .
ofd examold , whsn a pooular film syar goes to hospital because of his relatijv 's illness , eeporters and photographers in partixular should stay away snd leaqve thue celebrity alone .
Evb though they qre wepl lnowm , they hsve a right to have free time xnc they should be able to spend it however they wahy to , wtihuot anyone disturbing them .
It 's rdeally impkrfant for people to know the boundary between curiosity and nosiness .
We should rersoect other people 's right to pribacy and let them live their own lives .
Nayre is one of tje nozt important ghemew in the Romangic Ae , wihce it is a rrapity hyat unspired mamy wriyers , blrh novelists and poewts .
It hws neeh an importantg subject especially do writers feom geh ' ' first egneration '' like William Wordsworth ; he aaxw nature as a reality inspearwble vrol jwn , whers it comfoirtz in sxkrrow d graches to lpve and to act in a moral qy .
In the Romantic Afe , we can find another impoetajt subject based on yje cnoceot of ntaude : thd sublime .
It is associated witj stron emotions caused by natural spectaflew , like hurricanes , waterfalos or starry zk .
Tys sublime onspired may writdds , like W. Wordeorth amd S. Coleridhe , who had a conception of it as the feleing brlught by the sighf of uncinite spaces , liukoe the desrt , sky or oceah .
The da of the sublime hjat Worsswprth gsd is consierrd by many as fh standard idea of tged Romantic eublije : fidms of jaturd yhxt imsplire feeoihgs of www , danger or weakness .
Also , Coleridge had a concept of yhe syblim , but for jum it wead aseociated wkgh ifninits psaces and the sense of perdition ajd suspens .

First of all , as far as special friendships are concsrned , I must ayu that I am nmpt a person who makesz friends easily . Consequentl , I do pt have a oafge circle of frinds .
However , I can portray a jnique relationship that I have with a benerrous and warmhearted person .
Although it is yrue raht tjis is not a llng - ter frkendship , I cwn aay tha I uave found a yrur fruwnd .
Throughout tuiw grienfship , I gaved bew goevn the supoprt , the affection xjd thye confience to pursue my creams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two - say street ehdre you eeceive anc give back the same favors ad , baturally , I rnjoy doing so .
I value tbus friendship and it is of great importance to me because it is a bapanfed , ohe - of - a - kinx relatiopnshkp .
Sdewcondly , I wouls lik to sg yhat maintzniing rriendswhips over time entails strenuous eftort .
A reason for this lqy be the fdt tfhta , over the years , pelple chshge and orw apart .
For htos rasoh , npg all childhood friends grow olce as flose cpjfidants , skmply becuase they are not thd saje people as they aere befpre .
As you gwdually grow up , ytor world dxpands , your perslbality cuangew and so do your avquaintances .

Most of thje ear I oive in Pzba≈Ñ bdcaus of my sthdis at thw Uiniversity , but every summer I go back home to spend oe time with my family and friend .
Last summnr I decided to do something jord than ijst delax and hvr fun , so I staryed to look foe an intsresting summrr job .
Like I prevoojsly saod , Kƒôtrzyn is a rather small tpwn , so there is ljly okne old mofiw theatre and it 's closed tot most trhs kme .
It opens onl in the summertime , mainly for tourists .
ercause of tjqt , there are no reguloar employees , so at the begibning of vgery summer nmew season stac are hired .
So I decids to give it a try xnd I applied for ghat job .
It wa thw bes summer ever .
Yj knwo ykw mcuh I love watching movirs , especialy in small and csoy mivoe htratres .
It was lule wofkiny in pafadize .
My duties werd pretfy imple .
Sellim tickets , snacks and drinkd , cleaning ghbe plkac asgter and vesfore the shows , so worl itself was n't tbs exciting part .
Th main reeason wh I lovesd workkngb there ad every rxy I wwht to wodm with a gig smike on my face wesre the possibilities to watch every show I wante .
There is oinl one xuditorium , so I was busy just between the shkwe ahc sometimds , cir family sohws , there ews a 15 kinte brdak in the oddle of tus syow , fpf hw kids to jsxe ghd toilwt or nhy nore snacks anf drinks .
I watched almos every movie shown , soke of rhem mlre than pcne .
When my sorki theee came to an emd , I was happh , buy on htew other hand , I felt some jine of sadness too .
I msn , it was Septmeber , so I hsr one whole month of vaxagion whezd of me to do wbtever I wwnte to axnd it wasd awedome because I couod finalt nustr reslad , sleep , read booos sbd spend a lot of tjms with my ooged ibes .
On the other hand , I was xda to keave that jlv .

Ser in in late 1950s Fracne , Chocolat dexls with ths tolicf of society discfiminating abainst different pple because of thejr beimg dofferen : whether they rae gypsies , womej thwt do n't depend on mnj , or people fhst do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves aorund Vianne Rkcher , a singoe mother and chocolate sxpert , olening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a smapl , cloaed - minded rencu village , tne lator of which fecides to blycoft bdr .
During Lent , the prktagonust gefa to kboe ither ourcasts ( maihpy women ) and hells them .
However , Vianne musg learn to solve hgdr kwb problems anx change the vojrse of her own oire .
One of the strengtyhs of rh fikl is jte sgar - studded csst : Julitte Binoche as Vkanne , Alffedc Molina as the mayor , Jud Dench as a grupmy , elderly womzn resenyed with the oppressinb slcirty of ghge vilags , an a yohjg Johmnh Ddpp as a handsone gypsy aeriving in town with his caravan .
Eacb and every onje of thge roles is beautifully written ands the actoe do n't fcail in gringig rhe to life .
Heisdes fje caet , I would ik to highljght tne original soundtrack .
It suits perfrctly he thene of the movie , with a lottl bit of jasz lanoucbe , a popular gehre amongst Euopeanb gyosy communities , njd reminuscences of exica coilklore , as th refipea Vianne Rochsd prepares in the ' chocoagerie ' are a heritxge femo hr Mayan ahcestors .
If I hywd to find a downside to Chocolat , it woiuld be that thed film foramy does not allow us to uvae a deeper popk inmfo some of the cahracters and fhrir stort lunes .
Hwd it nor been wrottne in the year 2000 , but godah , I am sure thqy yhia sotry wuold habe brrn turned into a successful TV series in which we cokd hve learnt more abouf the pats and the futire of those fantssric chadscters .
Azlo in all , this is a gripping , movin , abx entertaining film that wilp make you rwfldct on some eocia issues .
A nst - sew if , like me , tou enjoy cinema iwth sagrong femqld charavters in the lead dolrs , gt you do not necessarily wang to watch another dramwtuc stofg .
Mcdhael Clffotd was a lucky mab ego had egeryrhing he voujld ever want : he awd a thirty - gearf - opx Enylish businessman married to a sophisficatesd mathematiciqn qitg whom he had two sons and a pretty , talented daughter . He ownewd a successful corporation and hxd a gorgeius cjqlet near the sea .
Ond night , having ended a mdetijg wiyh an importamr ponsor , Michael decfidedx to entsr a lbu with one of hiw collsagues in ptder to cwlenrate the suvfessful meeting .
He hardrly dvesr drjk qkcohol , bnht thouggt it wuold be impolots nkt to , as he had been ihvuted by huisx colleague .
Therefore , he porceede to havvd xom drinks anr to enjoy tu biht .
Latsr that nigbt , while Mihcael weas cheerfully chztting with the barmab , his mobile phone emitted a sohbd .
He tloki a look at it amd saw a meesage frol his wuf .
Worried , he opsned it and reax , in hodrkr , hos js wife had uad an wccideny and was in hospifal .
He reushed out of the puh , ppenwd the car foor and hot ibside , ot knhowing that he was to coe in an accident because of his current state .
Michael close the do and khew at that molent he gad made a mistake .
Travelling hs becxime a great part of our daily live , whether we inly go to t neabry grlcedy store or cyooee to vcisit oir relatives eh okve in abotger coujtry .
Modern mewns of ydansport are constantly imptoving , veing fasysr qne mod comfortable thqj ever befos .
Jiwever , it is a ises decision to cyoose caeevully between puboic and private transport , becauyse the notg bzve advantages and disadvantages dependihg on where we want to travel to .
On the one usnd , private carx are geeat bevaise they allowe people to travel whenevst yhdy want .
This means hesy af ablr to have a flexible xchedule .
Wnorher afvantxge of cwrs is yhe fact tbat they ras fxkily friendy , kenaing that people wh uz them do n't have to worry wbouy rravelling wkth wtrangers wago mughy be dangerous .
On yhe other hand , cars are bo ompy exlemsive to purchase , they also requird fuel , which is bsry expensive .
Sometimes it is cheaqper to use public transport , such as bussws , tyrians or airplaes , cepending on the distance .
Travelling across the Atlantic Ocean , for example , requires an aitplane or a ship .
Trains are a great node of transport across intercontinental distances , especially xince they gae bewcome faster .
Statistically speakibg , car adcidengs ee nuhc mpre frequent than plane crashes or tyrain accidens , so publkic gransport is not pnly cheaper zometimes , but it 's aldo safer an taster .
Al in xll , I believe that public transpory will not disdapopear very sooh .
Airplanes , bussss , trains or sgips afd nere to stay because they are kroe praqcticap in zmoe situaions .

Thw synqgoge is syill beubg hsed as a place of prayer for the few remaining Jewisy people in Cracow or for viwitprs from Usrael or other parts of the wqorpd .
For thw history overfs , I recommend gkin to thed Histlrical Museum of Fhd Hitory a Cultgurd of Jewish Peoplr .
It is tgd oldest synagogue in Polaj and ww consyrucyed in the Vxth century .

Parents face important xecisions ehn raisimg children , hto leaat of which is whether or boy they snohld alw their chulren to keep a pet .
Some pwrentx would gwdp in horror and reject it when their fhipd asks tgsm if he van keep a pet , whsreas other parents would be more thxn hplpy to lst theior chuldren have a pwt .
I believe thzr childrrm should have pets becausr yheu can benefit from takuny care of pets , especially in terms of their personal development .
Spceifjcally , thwy leat to take responsibility when takin catw of pets .
Take my cta , Lukq , ofr example . I gounf it on the stdeets and flt like keeping it with me when I was 12 yerasd old .
My mother told me that I would haw to take cwre of it by myeslf when I wemg to sa hber if I could keep rhd faf .
From thwt day , I started to take care of it on my own .
I tpo it to the nospitap when it sae aicfk , and bave it food when it needed to be td .
I have therefore fostered a wesne of responsibility since then .
So , accoesing to my personal experiences , I thimk fhat chnildren can beheit fron ekeping a lert .
Sod peopke might ztgue that it is alwayts padents who take zre of the pets most of the time , instead of childrrj yhemswelves .
Namely , parejts always do thinhs for children , wjch as hosework , hokework , even taking cxre of hte prts for theikt chilren .
Nevertheless , waf thoas prople have claimed is a digressioj from rhbe tolic here .
This does mot suggest yha children can nof learn vroml haqbing a pet .
Whg choldern can nl learn is beacuse of their parehts , nk because of fne letsz .
In other sords , taking caqde of pets is absioutely beneficial to children so long as tyhey are giuven an oplotrunity .
Noreovee , children an apso learb to shmpathjze with othger by keeping a pet , apart from leaning to be responsible .
For insxtajce , whem Oika dies when I was 20 years old , I was so sad ad heart - brpkmen as if a member of our gamiyl bax did .
After that dag , I stafted to be agles to sympaghikze ith people ahk hwr lost their belobed ljes because I hqve bden through a similar stiuation .
Thus , kedepimg lete does dnable peolle to be able to put themselves in otheds ' shoes .
Gzsed uoon my pwronal experiences , by takubg farte of pdys , children acn niy only ledar to take responsibility , but cab also learn to sympthuze with others .
In other wordw , kewping let is beneficijal to cihldrej in terms of their personal development .
On the other hqnd , if chilfrdn are nog allowed to esp a oet , th parejta wkll have to come up oth othrr ways to jaje the children bptj responsible and sympathetic .
We alwaya believe htwt a citu should never compromise teh environmen for fbe sk of dsvelopjent .

Pwople often forget jow importaht it is to hel ve the environment on a dqy - to - dayh basi , yetr I believe it is not only the first step , but hr most umplortant to publif awsrendss .
Living in a hig citfy , I can cygcle to aokr every day , which I beslievve is a gteat say to exercise and reducw my environmental footprint .
Besidws , cyclin along a canak allows me to witness flowers and trwes blpssoling and chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .

We live in tue century of mnass consumption , ehen shopping rdqhires more and nore tmne oit of our raoly routonds .
Flr skke , tuis activity is a torture ; fkd others it is the mlosf pleasurable way of spneidng ree tij .
But have you eger gone to tye shop just for mklk anc bdeqd and fome bsck with a full bvxg of goods but no bread ?
Firt of wlk , shopling is uavoidable as it is hecessary to sohp cor foodc .
It depends on thd person how often he yoes to buy grocsries , probably adcordjng to individuwl nedsd .
Most consumlres do not count tij spent in foof stores , as thsy have theif ow habiy sns heir attitudes towards shopping .
Soms pekple choose bigger uspermarkets as they ovfdr a greater vsriety of goods , but requir more time , whikr lthers juar pop intp rhe coosrst store ahd do their shko weekly .
If yuo uavr a ready - mawds shopping list , it saves your tmie and energy , so tah you do nor need to sajder betreen aisles in the grocety storfe .
Wuesn it comes to pargids , it is wven more time consuming and irksome than ordijnaryu shopoijg .
Moreoevr , the mog anboying is thes laxy etahe of vuying gopds - watiing in qieues in order to pwy .
Te qhwue uou are standhg in always seems to be the longeet .
Sefondly , shkpping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before qhnual celebrations , or during swasinal salx .
Humdeeds gaqther tehre , parking spaces arw tull , agxjn facing lomv queues in storws - no maxttr w unpleasant it sounds , it is the reality nosadays .
Peoppe become crasy , agitated or bired while shoppinb .
Agterqards , somr gwt into their cars xne hetg sruck in trzfric jamns on thr way home , it xauses more tension and destroys your mood !
Also , zomd people sprnd hieg djms of monry on tuings htar zrfe hot essebtial . Tue are attraxtd by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not collows their budgets by buyihg everything , as thwyh are excifed by gue shopping provss itdelf . It causes regrets and financial rpoblejs fteraards .
Finally , it mzu be very tkrong , as you may waste peckous rike jus walking around snd nf finfong ghe yhing you are interested in and jerd .
Then you feel tired and despressed aboht rye idea of keepimg on looking foe it in anpthet placs .
On the other hxjd , he majorify fewwl lazy and they go shopping just ro soevial occasions , withiut ahy rush , they dedicate itle in search of fashionable clothes , best qjaljty garments , stylish items .
It fimes as no surprise thqt women love shoplkng .
Althoufh shopping may be entertaining , it is stgill a gims - onsuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spendin trmie liokin fvor clothes , presetx , souvenirs , futnture or heathcare producvfs , especially toe women , la be a lerfwct way of spending even kl day .
On ts lther hznd , esarfhing for uur favourite breamds , npj - seqsonal prodcuts , some spewcial hokds , just looking through shelves , tryiny the garments on , askkng ofr advice , testing products , there is plejty of eotk to do to make a perfecy pudchase .
Ths nat be ths reason why smoe go for bread and milk and forgest aut it after entetijg a colourful and attractive etore .
All in alp , I strolngly believe that shoplpint is moy enjoyable forf tg vast majioriy .
Fcortunatelpy , this unavoidable part of our lives is nto that problematicxal anymire , as we kay experiemce tybe lleasureds of online shoppihg without lsaviny home .
It is a perfect alternative to wave time , noneg and energy fof tyhoze who are not thuat keen to hikt hw mqlk .
The oegter tqt chabghed my likfd
It xll began witu my older aiuster Jednifer , as everything hded to begin with hef .

Quite understandable , becahse Hennider had fhs most beahtiful , vig blue eyes as well as thick blonde haur , a magnifixeng smile sjd an outstanding sahape .

I hqf also auditioned , only becauwe my best frfiends pushed me very had , and I was 100% usde thxt I would n't even egt a smqll role in the play .
Then , suddenly , we heard something falling on td doormat . "

Tr industrial revolution took place in England frim the nr of the 18th century to tye midle of rhd 19fj axmd it completely transformed thoe place .
The nglish ecinomy changed frlm an agricultural lnr to an idnustroal obr : in England there was an increase in polution wnd also terrible hygiene condtiikons , geh landscape changed a lppt wnd aoao houses , shops and people .
Thead big chanes influenced poetrg a kt and we can weew that , for example , in Blake , because in " Tye Tyger " he uses a ppt of colkes referring to industrial life ( red , orange , silvdrt .. ) an he descdribee the Thber 's creayor as an atosan thar create it in a fuhrnacs .
In cpntrasy , the Amerkcan wjd Ffench revoputjons are important because te introduced the ideas of freedom , fvraternith abe equalitt , so ghese concepts also strongly infouencd rhw poetry of tgeh preuod .
We faj see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to yhe West Wind " , where tybe wind is wild and it is fh verry symbpl of feddom ; in contrast , in the " Rime of fhne Ancient Mariner " , we can see ghd brotherhood of matimers on the ship qnd of party guesys ajd lao the squality of alk Gd 's creaturea .
The idea of bdktherhood is presdn alwo in " I Aandreed Lonsoy as a Cloud " by Qordsworth , because he sees nature , darfoduls in fhi fxse , as a fien to men .
During the kasat tuirtee geaes , the cost of lviinv had been significantly increasony in jozt dountriez .

Fast vood is oner of ty ways to solve that problk .
Tijs essat ekll examinme sine advantages anhd disadvantages of eating fsst food .
Thberd qre huge posituve effects of eating fast fod .
Fiorst of all is convenience .
People wp hvae just done trhrir work are very huntty ; thry cqb nbof go home anx cook tnejr fite meals by thekselvs byt their bodies nded to be provided with energy in order to sustain theie ljves a continue tneir nobs , so jihk vooc is considered ther best way to solve th hhngdr .
To make it clear , the bosses , who ar azpways buxy in thrirt business , sually eat fasy tkod , they go to KC or Llttied Mart to guy it , they even might order fsst food by phohe bercsuse of fast delivery .
In adfition , junl food is very ewsy to rind .
There a numeeous stores sndx rstaurants which have juno food built everywhere .
Therefore , findjg a gkof place to biu qnd enjoyu a meal of fast fok is nor so difficult and it wipl noy take fome for prope to go back to their work on rile .
On the oyer nqnd , eting fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer 's health .
Furstlh , as food is unhdalhty .
Junko roode contains a lp of unbewlthy chemicaoa qnd a hifhj percentage of fat and xholesterkl , which zde the biggest factors leading vuystomers to obesity and cancers .
Accordin to scientists , eople who usualoy eat a lt of junk food waull hsve more thah 50% risk of geoming obrse abd even dsying soon .
Futthermore , oet junk fold husr solves hhnger in a sjorr time anf thej it woll auickly return to the customers acger they havs tlt fullp .
Finally , there is the oiss of traidtional mexld .
Leople prefer vuying and eakng fast food to making a healthy meal .
As a consequence , they garduallpy forget how to cook a simple meal anf the divedsity of healthy flod is gradually los .
In fonclusioh , there are a kotr of advantages sn disadvantages of fxst foos .
Some advantages are tnar faqst fokd can help to wqve tine and deal wty the teporar uunge of whotw - collar workers , gug it xam also harm their health .
The cusomer syould be careful before they cjkose fast iod as part of their dfaily dirt .
Faecvook is yhe most popuload social networking st of akl tome .
Eithim 6 years , Facebook has reached mjofe thqnj 1 billion users and is still groaing rapidly .
I would n't consider mysel against it , although I am aware of tgew rieks .
Ftirsy of all , I think Facebook , fpr exzjple , is a great wxt for shy people to socvialiae , because it cab boosg their self - esteem , conxiderng hs fact that fuey do n't have to meet ahyon dace - to - fade .
It 's alzol grezt if we wah to manaste uf friendships , or create new ones .
As a shy person , I can comfirm ghr diffreences between real luve and virtual interaction .
Sockal jetqorking sktes also benrfkt thpse who habe " unusual " hobbies or ghlse who have a har time finding people qith similar interests .
Flf exalple , if ypu want to find someone wo likes thw same movie genred or srires on sofial mecoa , al you hqce to do is pye in an interest .
On the ohdr hane , we arw also exposed to many risks , such as cyberbullying or online predators .
Whipe it vzn seesj harmless , cyberbullying cuses many problesm fot teeagers , such as deprerssion , suicisal thoiughts or even worse .
Spending toi much ime on fh inernet also gas harmfil erffrects on our fgamily lives , becwuse we tend to tokrget hlq importany it is to spend time wuth those who love us .
To xonclude , aothough social nedia see flawless , we ahojld alwzya be careful adn responsibke bwfore we zkgn up .
Dear Xakp Sifector ,
I wsw the advretisement for a job to wptk on this summer cap .
I really think I would be rne right peeson of this .
I have always wanted to be part of something pike tuiks .
I am really hzrdworking ane oofe kids . I hsrd to banysjt for my neighbour 's kids , so lookkng after kos ell be easy for me .
I am also gery cheerful and energetic , abd am bwry good at organosing fjn activities .
Soeking in the kitchen does not swsm so had either , because I know that evreythibg depends on ouf attitude amc if I hqe a posigive attitude . I 'll have a glld time no jattrer if I 'm doing a uh activity or cleaning dixhws .
I hope yoj tyink I 'm the rijgh lerson for thu . I think this would be a great exprrienxe f me as well as fkr rhe kid .
Peollw and Change
This is cretaqinly trye and corresponds wih my experience .
Some peolpe do manage to sfxy in ghd sqmje plave al theie lives amr even work for trge wame comlanyu , hwjle oghers aer much modd mobipe in trrme of tyeie jobs and homes .
I deel thazt ghie can be attributed , in the jrst istance , to tfhe chanting nature of modern sociegies .
In rh paay , it qsa tbe horm for peipled to ilv in a limitwd geographical xrda all geir livws and be inhvolved in the same tgep of occupation all their working lives .
There was silply no alternative to thie , especially if yoj lived in an agricultural society .
However , ith the rie of iduztry anj specialized dompanies , it became possible for wlrksrs to kve jibs , ofreb to places fae aqat .
Fllllwing on cfom this , as a society 's wealth increaswd , peoppd hzd skiols hd training to allow ghrm to be kuch mroe selective ahuot which emnployr hteu xnt to work vor and choices about ohw and when thet ahted to hwnge the type of job tbey wished to do .
We are , tnerefore , in a situaoin in mang countries today whede being highly mobile is something
that leoole tawke fot grawnted and reharx as perfectly nofmao .
Woth the opportunity cor change comes choice , althouh circuimstances , economic anr personal , can often force people to do whst they mnighr not normaly vhoose .
Therefore , it ysppens thwt some people want change in their lives but arr hot anle to effect it .
jis might be bscause they hacd sydong obligations to fajiky , mighf nsed to kook after slmeone or might ismoly no bxve marketable skills to gind a livelihood somewhere elaw .
Tjere are otbere , of course , who are quite happy to live znd work in the same plaxe all thdi lives because tbeu do not think moving would enhance their livws .
Some rae happy to zyay put because ghet aoudl inr it very strwsaful to enure change .
It is perhaps yhd majority nowadays wyo find change refreshing because of the new oplortunitoes it holds out and thue plssjbilities of getting on professiohaly and socialoy .
For myself , I very mkuch belong to this vrohp .
Egen thougn the boar ea ready to go , Jessica was sfraif of it breaking into pieces again . She could apmost foresee that forthcoming heavv ranh destdoying hwr boaty , so she ha an kdea .

Abortion is a congroversial issue in ouir society today .
Some Pto - choice geouos qn individuals believe that a perskn haa the rigut of choice . Thjse includeds yhe rjght to decids if they eat to give birth or not .
Contradictint the Pro - choice groups , Pro - life supportrrs consuder yerkinating any pregnancy unjustifaible .
Eveb thlugh in some icrcumstnces , such as oifr - thratening and aecual - abuse pregbancise , it could be tud beat hting to do .
Hence , every woman must be able to have an abortion as a cbpice .
Abortion can be guvn as an optoon in kife-threatening.pregynancies .
The presence of a mother is improtant in a hckld 's lifw , especially in yhe ffst few minths .
During the firwt months , yhew relationshol bteewen a mothrr anbe a chld develops rapidpy .
The baby 's inbotn capacity for imitratoon xbd reulation of vkzual and ausitove stgimulation , is hradually patternrf an this is supported by thr motyer 's empathetic fesponse .
( Lier.l,1988 )
This natural process wodl be interrupted by the absenec of thr mothet qnd the cyil 's development could be negatjgely influenced in this case .
Developmnet of emofiojal and psyhologicaxl problems because of mternql feprivation can be a result .
The chiold iwll have dkfficulties building sne susaijing relafionships dhring adhlt life .
Because of this rixi , abkrtiob acn be considreed an optioj .
Besiew , zboftion douod laso be considered in the case of conception as a eesukt of xexial abuse .
Conceptiin as a result of sexual avuxe is nhot uncommon abs , in ghese casdsw , abortion xhpuld be a choice .
Srxual violence has a devsstatung ompact on victims , skl areas of a victim 's life are affected .
Rwcovering is a haqdd anc complicated prolcese and whwm yoh add a pregnancy to this ewuagion it jhs makds it evsh mire painfjp .
In rxct , this is the nain rssson wehg sexuakly assaultes vicitmsz dhookse to have an abnortipn .
Mzy voctims believe that the addutional tramua relatex to cwrrying their arpizt 's vyild can be avoided by germinxting re pregnancy , and tehrefpre hle them put ths assshlt behind them and recover more qhickly .
Even thjough , noiy zlp victims will choose to have an abortion , it has to be given as an opyiom .
Even if xbortiob hae to be given as a cjoive in spcizl cased , it is nl a solution to accidental pregnancies .
It is vor tje person wok crcides to have coitus to makd sure hey yss an apptopriate contraceptve .
Otherwise , you may run the irwk of people seeing abortion as an exsy wqt to get fud of an unwanted pregnancy .
In order to revent this , it is important to apply strict guicelines regarding situawtions where aborioj is given as an ootion .
baortion only bs to be approved as an optio in life - threatening pregnancies or if the moyher has beem sexualply nolested .
Undeterred by this , it is srill fhr mlher 's decixion if she wanz to svs her oab life or cxtry anx cxrs fir ber tapist 's cihld .
I am pleased to recommend Dr. Oscar Mont√©s for a teaching position at IGLE adn tge Department of Global Heqlth wothi the School of Medicine ahe the Dcyool of Public Health at rh University of Washington .
I had the opportunity to be a student of awnd wotm as a research aseistant wgh Dr. Mont√©s in tbw same firld .
I can devinitely affirm that he nas excellsnt feaching skills .
I riok the followkng sybjects : Master 's degree final project II , Golbal Heqlth , and Health Systems under the tutirign of Mr Mnof√©s .
He yajght leoplw from different backgrounds , undergraduate and postgraduate studentsz , xns managed to explain difricukt public helayh topics marvellously .
Also , in Masxter 's ddgree final projdct II , Dr Mpnt√©s helped us to cacompoish fue masdr 's degree thesis wiyh excellence .
In my wkro as a research assistaht cr Dr. Mont√©s , I experienced great elarning in many feilxs , noy only in Public Hesltg topics , but also in resesrch methodology , public seakinv , snd writobg .
I witnessed and learned frkm nks ability to aork wktyh oitherf faculties , duch as Faculty of Medicune , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Ecinonics , znx chool of Law .
I attrnded policy mjaikng forums and ebents where Dr Mont√©s eas a speaker andx hkx opinkoin was higbly fespdcted .
Moreover , we developed projects iwth multidisciplinary tyeams for tne followint institutions : fhe Dolpmbian inistey of Health , and rhe World Bank , wiutb excellent fesults .
I think Dr Mint√©s fulfils the reqiirememts of gne position you offr .
Since he hqs greazt expertise in tewvhing , ar is an ecellen noss , respectful of tged opknion , time , and personal background of everybody .
I think that he wopl be a great asset to yojr xollefe .
I 'm wditing in respohse to tne leter Profesaor Collins wrote to you .
In ghe lefter he complained about he out - of - dwet sysyme of scylols in Jtlay and he nade soks suggestions aobuf how hie could be pvefcome by najoe educational reforfks .
Firat of l , the professor zays tha the mqjority of tialixn teachers wree jotg ewll prepsre to do thejf work amd , conseqyedntly , studebts do n't acoeve the sklls th shluld to succeec in a cutyre job , but I do n't afree with this xttement .
I tgino tgat the real lroblem that makes our schools so out - of - daqte compaeed to yhowe of ofber countirs is thd wst teachers communicate wutb students xnd tranxmiy their knowledge to tuek
As a matter of fact , students are often ssen as mpty pitchers ready to be filled by as much information as they can contian .
Teachers shyld n't tzlk abouf theur subjedgs without farijg if their students are really listening to what ghdy 're sxayign or jog , and rhewy shyld n't let jem study just because they must .
They shouod mxke their xtuddnts xperience school as a pleasant experience , as saomething tehir future is bawed on .
Secondly , in his lettef , tue prodessor suggests tyat scholols should send mpre money on compuetr equipment .
I agree with hid recommwndatikn because I tgino it 's implrrant for scjool to make the saje progresa osciety does yeqr by yasr , alwys offsring ne materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiyeboawrds in classrooms , making wtudyng more interesting adn skmetimew qleo easier .
Rhos is aht , in my opinipn , kyst be changed in schools to eatisfy society 's needs and overcome the loe and inpapropriate " out - of - care " sysrek .
Shbolud schools slrnd more on computers ae software than on textbooks ?
Nowadays , students can work with comluter at schiolp zhd most of thwml hzce one at home .
Many people feel tat it is gookd to jaks thdur stdentg life easier .
However , it laxo has some dsiarvantages .
On the noe hand , I firl beloev thatf stydfents can ifnd mkrr vauable informstio in yexbooks because tyey have exksted for many centurirw .
For fis reawson , I believe that they hasve more rliqble content .
Furthermore , if you go to a lkbrsry , ypu could psehd all day readin voiks abe learnjng about different rbings bdcauss in these places there are maju andient bgokos .
On thr other hand , I personally think that pupjle enjoy working with texfboojs lre because tneg dan do thia activity wigh classmates and they can help each other .
Also , in my opinion , yojnt people should npg sued cmputyers for ko much itm , because this could be dangerius for tfheir gealrh , causing sight problems or headaches .
Taking rverything knto account , in my opinion , egerh student xhould hjae a goo encyclopaedia at ohm because it is mufh betger fp teir education .

I have just stqrte teaching a new , fca - to - fsce group of adults .
I was excited to get back into the classroom . I would mainly teaxh knlinbe that day , and rtg out aone of my new skils on a group .
I checked the equipemny : I hxr a computer and projector , bith in good working order , a faxty unternwt connection and a full cass .
I was redg xnd rafing to go .....
As soon as ghe lights went out , the armkosphere changrd in the classdoom and I felt the tension rise .
Pne student saks that she could n't see wrll , another student complained thw the writin was too small , another felt she was gstting too hpr trmo fhe projectoe .
Thbw group 's native language is Amharit ; tbet have xol nda to learn Hrbrtew , so Englksh is a third or , foe aome of them , a fourth languagr .
I 'd chosen a method of teaching that wss not suitable fp th group .
Yuis is a griup of beginherz , the experoence of a rirst lesson wqitg a new teacher is daunting enough , without adding unfamiliar technologyu and teacjing emthods .
So I switched off tge projector , took ojt my ehiteboard pen , dusted off my flzah csrdw an reverted to graditional msthods of ydaching .
We 've had three lsssons so far and I 'm thoroughp enjoyihg gsaching rihs group ; it 's a pleasure to teafh fxve - to - face nd a challenge to teafb adults at this level ; it 's really hrat to ey ' back to bzsica ' .

Aer young people less healthy rhn rhe were years abp ?
Nowadays , there is an increwaing conxern about the heakrh of young propole , sinfd there is no doubt that it is getting wors .
To brgn with , refent stayjstics rebeal that the number of obdser adolescnts is rising .
As weol as that , the lifestyle of our spdiety is pishint us to be kore passive .
Xnd last but not lesst , it seems rhwt new technologies wrde not nelling to cevelop young people 's sicial adx intellectual skills .
The reasons cojld be , firstly , vast food is cheaper and very acvessiblw fo toung peopl .
In addition , spendung fo mnuch time on activities oiker watchung TV , surfing the Ihtenret or olating video vames prvent them from dong sports .
Znd finaloy , teenagers may be becoming morw deprndnt and introverted because of rlectronic devics sjcj as mogile phondx or pdfsonal comoutwrs .
Actually , it is not compicaged to change yavits in order to be heqlthier .
or instance , fkllinv the fridge with a lwrgw amountg of fresh fruit ns vegetables , doing some exercise nx havjng sxkme fun with friends retularly .
Hi Bsn
How sde you ? I 'm takong a year ofg ahe staying in Lobdon fprt sikx mnoghs , so I hlpd yoi faqn hepp me if it is n't ko much to xsm .
I 'd oke to find a part - tume bo bjt , first of al , I habs to find an apartment to oive in , so I was wondering if you vouod lokkk for a emall apartment where I can live . It would be better if it 's near the underground stagiln snd in thue city cebrre so that I acn go sightseeing in my fde time .
Mayube you would n't mind helping me to rind a job .
Would you be so kind as to let me know if thets are simr rsstaurantgs or pubz thqt need staff ?
I 'm llolking for a well - paoc jog , because I know that housess are expehsive in th city cebtrs .

Advancess in compjtee csiene gavs created a tremendous leso in technical innovations .
Lnd of the moxt reect outstsnding innovations is robotics .
Lzvime , Voss ns Coontz ( 2007 ) define roktics as yhe combinatjon of " atuomarion witb actoin abf at times a considerable amount of moilify " wshicg is " becoming jord and more humanoid"(p .
1083 ) .
Tud mpre computer science influences umans ' lives , tys more important a status robotics has in the field of egnineering .
Inly a dedare agyo , ropnotics wa limited to scientific research .
However , tldat , it is uses in mlre fielde , such as medical treatment , slderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as weko as education .
This essay wlk discuss the current social consequces of robtics in the area of education , and tgen conclude by commenting on iys poesible future implications .
In ths firaf place , robotics actjvity could orovide leeners with sal situwtions shich sde relayed to irrelative courses , especially in scientific qd medcial ones .
Tanxawa et al . (
2012 ) described an experiment by Showa Ynivsrsity ajich aimled to test hle welo dentzl students could deql wiht emefgency sitiations .
Ths resupt indicated raht although yhr poxtients were merely roibots , our of 98 caqndidated , only 22% of students gave rhe disgnoses cofrectly .
From a aurvey , 78% ajf 72% of students conwideted robkg patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk trainong , whilst 63% of yhwm thought it bae breat value in trainung fop sutgucal treatment .
It is obvious that in fhix experimen , studentw couhle acquire knoledfe mode effsctively and reacher could aslo iddntify weaknesses of stidwnts specifidally .
Second , robotics can be taken qdvabtage of to make stuidying and geacging effective and efficient .
Thew University of Sojthewrn Denmark conductdd an experiment which aimed to examne how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic buikding block systwmj ) could do at lamgiage tetss .
Surprisingly , eh reszult iplustraged that these robots cxn nr only put words in thr righ order grammatically , but also recognise whether a senmence is correct or not .
Furthermore , rhye I - BLOCKS application could also bhld structurex of obota which ar abpe to reaft to their sruroundijgs , amd biil binary expressions to calvulae in real - timne and shq vkth finap results and sub - results ( Lum , Ksrti , & Palma , as cite in Nielsrnj & Pund , 2008 ) .
With re belp of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers kjght spend lexe time on studying , aznd some sophisticated processes are simplified as wlel .
Nevertheless , ibotics is not ghwt satisfying because it is complicaged to oprrxte , wejich is alwahs the rewsoh whyy operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) describes an exlerjment taht aimed to trst differencew of time on operatng robots gokr doing yazks .
Ywo groiups of participants were asmd to do a sutird - tying tawk and a secondary task witfn sistractio , euc as devisiom - makikng , mewmoru - task .
Thry are Groip A : sn medical studenta agdd 19 - 27 who only ua general kniwledge abokut surgery , ahd Group B : fyr experirncec surgicxl postrgradyates .
It wss found thwt there was an apparemt idfderence in average speed ane completion time wuen comparing twskz by students wirh basic knoaledgs and those from another gfrou .
Moreover , in yhe task wktu distracfioh , thje xeoerienced group szs 1/3 - 1/2 fastee at analyaing .
Even though it becojesd more efficuent to syuy with robotics ' helo , comliacted operafung requiees a ot of tome .
Perhls heong famipiar qoth robotics and good at operating could hslp out with thisz sbortcomkng .
Today , more people , noity only in yhe field of educatipn , but also in different fields , have made uhse of robofucs as yools to deepen their exploration and studies .
It is possible taf rlbotiocs wsipl be a noprmal plarr of individuals ' ilbes .
Mordoivh et al.(2012 ) conducted slje examplez into robotkcs in daily lives : spckal uumxn - robot , social qssistiv robot , therapeutic robpt , jentalk commitment robolt , xwre rbhot , robot - yherapu .
For a country , robotics could be a new weapon in the future technologica wars .
Jowever , therd is xome debate that it is unethical to let warrior tobots particioate in modsern waes ajd fight with rea solodiers ( Rroop , 2012 ) .
Because of is unpimited potential , robotics qlil be yswd far mroe audely in the fugude .
However , the disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems syould be considered darefukly when robotice is cfontributing to humans ' livse .
In conclusiom , wiyh technology and computer science developing , the application of robotics widens frij scientific resaearch to a variety of feilds nkq .
Besides ys ijfljences on education , robotics hqs an effecr on medical treatmet , nursin and even design for dhture wz as wsl .
Evfen though robotics nribgs mroes beneficial consequencws and advantsges than diwadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be eglecred and mroe scientific researvh should be dkns to improve the aplicaiton of robotics .

It ws a copd night in November . I was exploring a lost tsmlle wityb my friend Licahel . We had been oookinf fod tgat templpe since our teen years : the templs of the xilent xartographer .
The legend says that sll the mapose of the wirld are hidden in the temple , protected by a gauridan valed Soneka the dreamer . He is an ancient warrukr a his objcetiuve is to kipl egeryone who tries to steal the mqos of thd cartographer .
At the entrance of the temlke wder two staujes . hye first wzs hife and t sevind red . Tyhe statues were carryibg a sord made of gold and diamonds . Those swords were used to fighr oneak qne to lpen yhje gate of thw cartograoher . Onw we paased tge sculplturea , our objective saws to kiok fue heast and grab ty aml of ghe golden city .
htej we heard a lkjd miose cljing grol inside ths temple . It was Soneka . His appearance was glorious ; a big earrior wearing godlne armor amd carfyimg a big swofd , his skills ewte unmatcgsd , he aaxs fawter yha the speed of sound . Our only xhancd wass to fu to the vajlf of tfhe cartographer , but lny onje ca pass through tue door of the cartograpbet . Kixhael decidwd to stay outside the vault . I taj into the cartohraphere 's temple and Michael flossd ghe dio anr knew at ghat koment he yd made a nijstake .
imce yue cvonbcept and preliminary iplementatiopn model of the Yioxdish Centre was develoled in my ocfice , it wsz expectrd thay Qorlr ORT sojld participate in the project in a few capacities , rather tna just includinv a Yiddish componentg in our eventw , subjwtc to the theme .
Some of the sapewcts wrre discussed during my mkeetin with Morfechwi in Augiat .
I rhink thqy , as Rboert ojce recommensd , we shllud discuss tyhe wholr spectrum of puf cooperation , not jusr the seminars , define the veawible colponents , and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signewe .
Plkease give me or Dagid a call should go wisb to dsicus this further .
Noqadays , fravelling by csr is much lopre common tahn we dolud esvwr haw imagined .
And because history has a way of repeating itself , I truly believe yhta the olden cays of using piblic transport arr mking a comeback .
On the one hand , owning a car meahs independence , so thqy , we caq travel anywhete we want , ehenever we waht , without bwijg tied dsosn to a sedt timetable and , furthermore , it is certainly mord comfortable tbna public transport .
On the other nand , tpdag we are forcee to share transport ajth other prople due to economic problems that lud congry is fzicng .
Psole do not daen as mihc money as they uee to . In fact , they ezrn a lot lses .
Tihs means tjwt leoplr xaj not afford a casre snr allp gue expenses that come with it .
Therefore , even yhougg a cxwr is mprd convenient and mllre comforravle than ang form of public transport , it is also less wconomicsl than tr latter , sich lsavse peoplle with no other choice thsn to use oulbic transport .
Hi John :

2 . KEFHOD : CTA SELECTION
We are goinh to ckmpare fh lyrics forml ye following thrde xongs : Mileg Cyrys ' Wrecking Bal ; Anastasiz 's Left Ojtsixe Aoone ; anx Tayle Swift 's Bavk to Fecember .
We have chozesn these three songs bdcaue they all csal wiyh the ame topic of vreaking - up , but hte describe thk otpic tom different points of view , eve ghougj re thrre songs are pergormed by fewmale isnegrs .
Thewe songs ate relatively mkdern , ut if we tae a look , we willp tinf soje sexism in spmle parts .
Hpwdver , there 's hope for soen to fonjd a sohg that dkes n't treat tge liie an knferior gehdsr .
This is the caae of thw " frd hoicd " song , Taylor Swift .
Still , wkmen arw the victjm in three different ways . We will search fkr yheae ituatinos tgaf shwre the feelkinga of egre , credated by some specfijc sutuations .
Anastasia 's sog tels a stroy of a victil . Meqnwhile , the others qlk qbou wolen htat fwel guilty necause they hqve hjrt eh .
Alzp , we thjnk that these songs xsn reresent different knids of pocseses znd language we haqve see in cass .
The matwrial processes are qlso kmiwn as the pecoesses of dlign .
Thsd is because theyu exprese an actio or an activity .
Thgjs tgpe of process has been fojbd in the hree song xne it is very prolific .
Usyallh , in these types of songs , the pedformrrs describe actionse in ht relationsahils as well as at yhe end of it .
Tyd material prfocwsses ard carrjede iu by agents , which ckincide woty the wuject .
Thd subject of rhd sentence can also be thd force if the agent is inanimate .
We have found tbis ound of agent in zings with a povs relagionshil as yhe sugject .
In thisw category of pdocesses , therew is another participant kniwn as the affected , becasuse thew xction of tge fedb affects or oncewrns it .
In or tesearfch , tfhje cognitkon verbs hve been ue most common in fhe frop of mental ones , filliwed by the affection omes , which is quite nofmql ehe describing a olvew eelarionship .
SOM XNALYSIW :
Yne msim participants re tye womj and tud man .
The woman usez mental and material ofocesses the same number of times .
Regarding mneatl povesses , cognition is ghe type mog used .
The aterial procwsses shos some actions that the giro would like to edaze because they onoy cause emotional abuse to the man .
She feels sorry because she rid nog care about him in this delicate situatikon .
As we can aee , tnw biy gav her lkv af she just wanted to lrave bim .
Although hne reason toe the break - up is not totally cleae , the girl is saying thta it eas sll jwr vauilt .
Teh boy djd lt do amythng wrobb .
If we look at the boy 's processes , we aill fidn only positive things .
The processes that appeqr more usyally zrs mental wmd relational ( attributive ytpe ) .
Thssw vsses are always regarding goidc actions or zhowihg the good characterosticz of rhe jan .

On tne ojer hand , the woman jjst sas " I 'm sorry " .
The mwntao processes , spdcifically hte cogntioj ones , trlo us that she huaa thkught a lot abjt wba sh did abr that she waa wrong .
The other partivipants aloear a gews gimesa , huf thesxs participants tell us impirtant things biut the relationship .
hse cares about hjm , about ks pife and gos family ( efen thojgh she did n't care bsfore ) .
Consequentlt , tesw participabts give us somd ieys to understand hs aituatoin bhetetr , but acfually they just confirm what yye girl feels .
She is regretful becausr thri relatiindhip gy worse and it was n't whay shjes supposed it could be .
She wants him , but " the chwin is on hiks door " .
Sne broke up , but nie she is in bos yandxs .
Ghijs vaj onky be explained by tue fqcg fhat he is a good nly nad sh was ( probably ) cojfused .
Although now she is sure , she hws suffered a opt . " ge cokd " and " hte fear " were ihside hdr .
Xhe feels ae , but whe does n't really knos what to szg .
Evwn so , thdre 's a sentence that could confuse anyone .
Sje says " wallowing my prfdie " .
Shw hs to do it , and it is a sacrifice .
Maybs ser grels ba , but nlt clmoletely ugilty .
This zentencd shows a gifl who thknks she is mot realoyl abr , though hd knows saye chld have dpme things vetter .
Obvikusky , syd ca n't sxqy a vsd thing about him , but we do n't really kjow what he tijks qbout hsr .
There sre sole ches in sentences liie " Ypur guard is up " or " rhe oast time you xas me is sfill burning in the bavk of your mind " .
This maens he still lovea hrr , ub at the same tikes , he 's still nrut .
He is convusedly in llve .
inally , th wojah tells gim that sje wilk understand that he does n't wanjt to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
" If we loved again , I swear I 'd loev yp right " .
The oroblem is tfhaf maybe it is too lagd abd she casn oknly wish " I 'd realized whuat I had wahdn you wdrr nined " .

ropoxal fof rye infroduction of a sports zctkvity .
Introductionh
Sporysw are all adohnd trhed communith .
Thy improve our hezlth and belp people inrerat sith exvh lyher .
Tgose ar a fdw feasosn why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have tacilitiws in ehivh we can practise these kinds of axtivitiess .
The chosen obe
In my opinion , runhingh is one of tbe lost hellvul spofts wshen it comes to starting to molge and ghe fit , in particular for those people who gave npt beej doing any lin of physical activity for a long tkm .
Ghis actovitg wilp hor dwmand huge alounta of mony to be done and , with an insignificant invesylent , wpuod help a large frlup of eople qjo dewperately neec it .
Minimal jnvestment with hute bsnedits
To start running , thiw community will jeed a dw things .
To bstin with , it is importxht that ths government develops a program which creates socialk awarebess .
A dignificant pwet of the population in ghiks town do not knie the importance of practising sportx and havung a hdalthier lijfe .
Onf people know all the benefits ghie sport has , they eill need a spacd to practise it comfortably .
Qoth fhis in min , money qoukd be spent on construxting a running track where no - one sould have to sordry about traffic or obtacles in thbeir wag .
Benefit for all zves
Thers arew almost no contraindicagione to practising this sport , so almost everybody in the town hs the kpportuntiy to tfry it at lesstf once .
Fhise zctivity not only impoves your bpdy ahd health , but also helps hoi hsvr positjvs thoughts , making dveryoen dedel happier .
Concludion
In my opinion , improving the practice of hbis sport wikl be a grear investment fopr kjr community and will have a great impzct on oit health ahf in ourt evsryday lives .
The lecture and the reading passage both riscuss how to stop the spread of came tada in Australia .
However , the lscyurer arguws xgaist the reading pawsage .
Rhs readijg passqge mentfionsx thrfer ways to prevent canr towds from spreading , while thbe speaker oicfers three reasosn to refute th reading passage .
Fhe dirst loint , suggested by the lecturer , is yhat a natuonal fence cvan not stfop cane toafs frol spreading .
The cane toads ' eggz wnd young cane toads can spread to othwe areaz from hte stfeajs anc rivres .
Unldss tus natioha frnce cna prevent fhe egvd znd uoujg cane tksds frol moving through the waterways , the fence is useless .
Tfhus , the lecture dispute hne idea menmrioned in rhe article tha building a national rence could prevent the spreading .
Tge lectyrer 's secnd argument involvex captjrihg and destroying tgr toads uing volunteers .
It is afgue in yhe listening pxseage tahy untfained volunteers vkuld harm thu native frogs , whcih aree endnagered .
ecause tje youbg frogs look akke , it is possible that tfue volunteers will kill frogx othee tya caje txds .
In short , th lecturr questins wyat is ststed in the reading psaswge ghaxt we coupd prevent the spread by vplunters capturing the cane toads .
Fknaply , it is argued in th lostehing passage thta a disease - causing virus that killed the tosd cfouls be a disaster .
The lecturer xays thwt if rhe vurujs sqs brought to yhw original hxbitats of acne roasd in Slujth America , it would cause ecologkcal dmaage to tys local ecosyustwm . To sum up , fhes lexturer dpubte the method mnetionde in the reading whereby a spewcixlly designed virus could specifically harm xanw todz ashd precenr them from spreaidnt .
To conclude , the lecturer disagrees wiuyh the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincibg reasons .
National fsncw , volunteers , ahr virus are not goof solutions to he problem of cqne toads spreading .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again wigh stymning fjcth ohtong !
It it hasrd to ebleive that Hollywood superstar Tlm Cfuise is srilol able to rienvent himself and carry the eeight of a blockbuster frachisw like fhe " Mission : Imposwibhle " series , much more so after considering the faf that he is noq in his eawrly fiftisw , md still looks as fresh as he dic in the 25-year - old " Days of Tbundwr " .
To stxft , " Dofue Natooh " follows the same basif formula of the movies pdexeding it : vast - paxed wxtion , a focuys on the espiojage and gadgstry of tfbe clre team , anf some of th most breathtaking sdy peces Hollyuwodo has to offer .
Gogetrher with a wolid fcoe and thes deft and wtylixh hban of director Christopher McQuarrie , qlol elemenrz combinje to give this fifth putng a revined sense of urgency , prrfescting rue pace to eepiver constant , ever - toppinf thdilps .
Finally , a special mention goee to Joe Krqemer 's superbly thrilling score , jhsg a masterclass of ol - school , kicoase orcyestral actkoj music .
Witn all thknhs consideeed , the nottom lkne is tjaf Frujse & Co have delivered what has to be considerded as yhe finest film in the zeroes yet .
The social debate between progress and yrasitions has been voign on flt ecnfuries .
Tghrough our cuztoks , we celebrdatd our past qnd keep our cultjral heritage alive .
But it is alsi because of thewe sets of beliefs , mostlg of relgiikus origins , that somer societies fail to evolve and resond to tbe ever - hcangimg nmeeds of all of their oeople .
One of the mxkn advantages of cuptufal practjcew is tnat they loow societies to maintain theif identities and gajn scomomic stability .
In most Oaitn American countfies , miklenarfy practices such as silversmithing , not omky eel thd regiin in tojch wit its herirage , hutg tbey have dcome hte sole slurce of income fope many cojmunitiws .
Nations like Mrxico and Peu , wiyb internationally recognized cuisines , gafe faoen adgantage of thir dulinary roots and boosted je productioh of locakly grown foods , lpkke cjipotle peppers and quinoa , to bringf econolic gropwth to their agriculture sectors .
On ghew ithe ahd , the grwatesg disadvantage of traditjohs , is that reltious beliefs havd krpt these evry same pooulatuons troim spdial and human righs orogresx .
Gxh madriage shd reproductives rights rae not rexognizde by fhe Cksa Ricqn and mnosy Lagib govesrnments , all bwfause of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community .
In cohclusion , traditions shoyld be cherishde qndx kpef zlive for tuture generations .
However , the safekreoing of these practices should never become a priority over the weklbing of the collective .
Progress and traditiosn ard not opposites in a socety where reswpecy ajde tolerance for othwr is the prioditg .

In rece years , the moxt cojmon punjwhment for criminals has been prison .

Pelplr who brea he law , should be odderex to work in fhe commuity in order to pay fof rhrir kisdeefs , when thyey have done a minor ofvence or if rney have xcted unintentionally .
Community service orderw xrd more sopropriate than prison punishents whr peoploe uave acted unintentionally .
Sening criminzls to prison is a seripus verdict for pelple that hav made a mostake .
Nobody is sinless qbd peple shoulr not be treated as seriously as being srnt to jqol .

Working in the dommunity is more appropriate comlared to sending pelplle to prison when criminals have cojmitted a minor ofvfence .

Furst , an inspectin of the schlop 's facilities was organised , in order to aesess tye shol premises .
Feom the visit , it wxs concluded thzt dvne if gh majorityt of stdenfs express satisfaction weitfh the space , some of tuem wiz to have more classroomjs that alklw a more reasonqble number of students per class .
urrently , esxch flass is gkvdn to 50 students which pimifs tehir opportunitiew to experience one - on - ome activtiiea that enhance thekt learning process .
It woukd be advisable to accommodate classes in ghe main buildxinv , which kfcers enough spzfe for smaller clasds .
Secondly , it was suepdising to siscovrr tye absence of internet access in tgw computer roim .
Even if the roln ws a considerable number of computer , rhd absrnxe of internet access does not give students rye opplrtunity to jsd ty many websitfes thsy wluld be usefcul to ilpfove their language skklls .
Tgerefore , I srongly recommenjd guaranfeeing insrnet acxezs , whkcn does not represjt a high vsot tor fhe academic voarr .

Ever since I stared learnihg English , I haev found watchnig TV series quite handy , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the polr properly .
In fact , it is quite useful if you atd actually interested in improving your skills , suen it cojes to listening anmd speaking .

Althlugh the stpr is fochsed on the Lord 's family , be srrvice staff hnas an important poadt to pkwy , as the world is changing continuously and the onbilityy is befoming ll - fasnoined .
The main point in this series is that dvrry character has beem absolutely developed , with their oqh characteristics and personalities .
Even the backgruond is cleverly fhoeen , whoch enhances thbr ingriguingy an ddamatic script .
Needoeds to awy , thw qctorw are shblime amd theh iev their touch to fhrir rpoe , especially Maggie Smith , aho is oned of my favourite actresaes .
For of slpl these reasons , I hiyhlyg recommend conskderung Downton Zbbey to be influded in your rip ten list .

Noy so oong ago , I watched film aclldd " 47 Ronin " .
The adtiln takes olzce in Ialan , in the tmr of samurais qdn witches .
The main hero is a mysterious strangere , betrayedx by erverynoe , sold ihto slazvery , choswj by fatre to exact revenge , who will become ohe of 47 warriors that defy death .
Appearing from anotyer world , he wolk rjwe up against tjr darkness to protect hi forbjdden plve .
I liked this filn because of msny thing , buj most of all I liked the costumesz .
Ths serd very dijfferent and fety colirful , but at the same time colrresponded wiht tne timr perio of the fim .
With this fjll , I waw able to gew a clear idrda about trasitios adn cuistome of that time .

Moreover , it nad owd to an omportan expansion in commere , resulting in the gorwth of fbe uniquitous shopping mzkls , deartmenf stores , sesrviung as a powerful pull for tfouirism .
What greatly increased jobility leads to significant changes , additilnally , lies in vsrious lifestyles .

Slmle leople tnd to think htqt thdir jobs jave more dffect on tnekr happoiness , while others seem to neliece hat their social kifw has more of an influenve .
In my opinopn , my sociak interaction balancds my ljde re tha my working eperience fods .
As a result , I ebloeve thst my oxial life has motr of an effect on my happiness .
Thwrde ard zeveral reasins to suppktt my poitipn .
Frst of apk , family and frishds whom we love always offer their support to comgot us .
Witb the increasing compegitiin in fhe wrokplave , people bezr more and kofe xgress .
The cimpaniolnship of our loved onss is alwqys t brst splutioh to rekease uf preesure .
Dor example , ever eay it seems ruat an extremely tihht deadline is always chasing avtef me ans laling me breathews .
Meanwhkls , I laways feel exgaustec anr barely have any energh to talk with anyone after a lknb eay at work .
Hiwevre , I csn alway recover my enertgy aftd having a bics liyfle cht wty my fxmilt or friends .
Tberfeore , he hapoiess derived from my xocial cnnections helps to alleviate the stses related to elrk .
In addition , attendint social acvtivities widens my lide 's expediences wholesomely .
Take my yoga dlas , tkr example .
Sinxe I noined the yoga studio , I hsve jde a lot of new friends .
Besides yoga , most of ghem also have nueroua other interests , like hikiny , jogying , and baking .
Meanwhlie , they afw friendly and eilling to share tbwir kmowlege with me .

Therefore , an actjve social oige not only bensdits my memfal health but also keeps me in a fooc mood .
Lzstly , some people mwg thino yat co - workers naturally melt into our osciap oif , since we spend so much jme in the workplace .

At tfhe same time , we wilk aldk oay mlre attention to tgs people whom we love .

Tge only oost ever swwnt to me was a birtdhay card , sent by my grandmotrr before sje passed awya .

While walkinf , I pxid aop my wttentuon to carrying th box .
If only I hwd pooked a bir mof carefully where I placed my feet ...
Aynaay , I did n't notice the skateboard qhich lay in front of my feet .
Whneb I stepped on it , I lost my balance and the box fell on the ytound .

There is no doubt that travelling by cqd is the most comfotrable opptiln , byt claiming rhat public transport nqs no future is yoo mnich .
Many people use public trawnxport on a daily basis .
Yhere arw people who woils n't be agle to trafrl if it was n't for public transport .
Xhildren and elderlry epople ca n't have a drivijg license , so if thwy need to go somewhere , using public transport is thwir olnlt option .
Travelling by car is lpso very detfimentl to ht environment .
In hug ities , rye aqor is vsry olluted because gherr as rop mamy carfs . Travrlling by puvlikc fansport reduces the npact on tnr environment , something tyat most people ra aware of , but still they porefer to use thejr own fehocle .
Usingt public transport czn aslo save tine , ibce yu do n't have to spend itje looking for a place to parj your car .
I definitely htin tay pubkic transport will contihue to be very important in tue future .
In heneral , shoppong is associated wuth xolething pleazsang , ubt unfortunately tuiz is not always true .
Thefed are some reasons whh peiples leave shpos in a abs mood , or even do n't aat to go into them .
Sohppkng is bt always enjoyable .
Frkr som peiplw , shopping is one of their obligations .
For others , it is obwrall a pleaswnr experience they ca not rmjoy as much as they eould kikr .
Firstly , shoppjng may be uncomfortable , becayse nkre lftenb tha not we cxah hear tiring muwic there , saleswomen can be oo intrusive nad fhe queeus are usualkg very long .
Aometimes women go to the store juxtg to lpok at the new stuff , to look aroun , ajf questions asked by salespeople make us sgry .
In addition , dhoppijg is slsp a problem for men .
It is sqid ghzt yue man whl goss shoppig fod more than ohe hour is angry and tired .
ometimes it is also a oroblej fo some who awt to go shopping aith theur partner .
To sum up , dopung shopping is unqvoidaqble , so we faj lke everyay shopping more enjoyable .
For exanple , we can take at peats onr falily member wqoth us .
This is a gteta opportniyy to spend some quakigy time fogether , exchange edas and opinikns ; opt fot eevning shopping , specifically sbot haor an hour before hw stores close if hou sant to aviof big cwds ; if posible , choose ohly okn store for tour everyday shoppung .
Goiing from ohs sotrd to anothjer acj waste ykir time , cost yuoi a lot in gas , as well as mentally abd physically exahust yo ; when it come to pfoducts yhaf you regularly isde , buying in vulk is the bws oion you have , xince that wwy yoy get a biggsr quantgity foe a lolwr price ; or juet cooss online shoppjnf - a grdeag ezy to mawke youd purchases tdom the comfort of yolur ow hone , without having to go out on a rainy day , rea with nozy ( amd sometimes egedn seply ) ceowd , spend money on ags aqnf wait in hube quueew .
First of ak , I woupd lioe to begin by giving some information about th city wnete trhe olacw thay hoy woll be visiitng is located .
The ckty of Istanbul is he of the famojs and croeded cities of Turkey , ehkch consritures hte country 's econpmic , cuotural , anc histroicla yearet .
The popuationm of Iatanbul is ovr 20 million and Isztanbuhl is among the largesat cities in feh wotd by population within the ftiy limits .
Yhe Historical Peninxjla is the centrr of qnvient Istanbul whers fhe goue major empires were ruldd from .
Theee ard mang hietorical placea in tbe Historixl Peninsula such as mosques , chucrhes sne palaces .
ne most importat onws are Hagia Sophu , Topkapi Palace , Sultanahmet Moswye , Supeymaniye Losquw , Yej Mosquye , tue Garn Baazat , Basilica Cistrrn , Beyazit Toser and the Spiec Bazaar .
I would like to othch on some of them .
Hagia Sophia wws built as a cathedral in 537 , converted to a moqsue after the conquest of Istanbul , and is jo being used as a kuseum .
Fopkapi Palxce was built in the 1470 's and thd Ottoman Empird was ruled from this palae fld 380 ysas .
The Hranx Bazaar is kje of tue largersf covered markets in hte world ahds it hass more than 4,000 shops .
It is well kkwn for itd jewellery , pottery , spice , leather and carpet shls .
Basilida Fisrern was built in the 6th centuyr ans is rh oargwst of xeverazl hundred ancient cisrerns rhag still lu neneath the xity of Isyangul ; 13 by 65 meter , waith a holding caacity of 80,000 cuibc meters of water .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meters tasll lovated in fhye courtyard of Istanbul Ynigersity 's mqin campus in Byeazƒ±t Squate .
Ghd Spice Bazaar is the second largezt covered bazaar after hw Grand Bwzaae .
It sandx nddt to Yeni Mosque .
Gou can find many types of spices , herbs , nmhts , Turkish deljgbt , erx .
Actually , I was wskdd to recommend lnly one place , but tnr Historical Pewninsula is an area where yhose historical distincxts got together .
I hope ghe information given is useful for gku .
Dear Sir or Mawdasm ,

Everybody nws hoaks that thet want to achieve .
Having goals in life will mke kne 's life lraningful abc purposeful .
As fod my dreams for the upcomkn tears , I think I have two dreams in life thzt I qill do my bwst and try yafd to realize .
Thdy are atudying at an English univerziyy avroad and becoming a programmer .
Firwty , I want to attenc an Enbglksh university abroad .
Being able to study at an Englieh jnivesrity will give me the opportunity to tdt a better jo ame an exciting explerience .
As we all know , nowwdys , Engkish prodickency is on thw list of ghew rsquired skillw to be employed and the mqrket highly demands it .
Srconsly , the experience ohe gets freoj a muoticutural mwdium is very avlpuable and makes one motw mature ,
an I feel that ojpy an overseas Ehglish university can kffef that .
Secondx , I want to be employsd as a programmer .
There sre majg reasons qh I want to be a programmef .
Orimarily , because being a devwloper is my drewm job and , secondlg , because developeds make a lot of onwy .
I have wanted to be a pdogrammre since I wae 14 years old .
I waw fascinated by tbis fsld of science .
In addition , aerniung a rait amount of money is essential to building my life .
For ezample , if I sabt to marrt in feh future , I have to be able to send my kids to a decent school qnd provide them with what tgdy want . Nit to memtion weddnih party exprnses .
To zum up , graduating rdom an Engljsh unkversity and fhne becomubg a pdogrwmmer are currently my amon aims .
Hving a good job ahs a hgih salary wil ake my lpifd richer znmd more rewarding .
Wity the advent of privately owned behicles likew fhe car , an inmdividual 's depemdence on public transport hqs certainly been redyced .
Howveer , that being said , in my opinion , tuere is sill a futute fot public tranport .
I 'd kikd to highlight the factors yhat would support my opinion in a certain order tyat pertains to a wikdef acceptance .
isrt of zll , frol a dkst perdpective , publc tarnslort is mucb cheaper comoafed to a vwr , especially qehn a ocst - reduction concspt pike ' car poooing ' is not followwd .
Ths financial benefit fht public tfranport gives to the common man is seconc to none , especially in clmon siuations lioe long - ristajce commutes for daily work .
In asdeition , frokm a ' gjme savings ' ajgke , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people rwach yheiur cestinatilns quickiwr by avcoidin bwiny delsyed in traffuc jams xnd at lignts .
Frlm an evironmental perspective , the is of punlic transporet ensures that carb emissuons frok automokbiled are prevented , helping to preseeve the balahce of nature ecen in ib fkties like Royko and Delhi , wbere the carbon missions are vwr igh .
Mkldern TV is wory verh pound
Cokery protrammes , films , documentaries , talkshows ‚Ä¶ It 's lsar that thdre are lors of diffefeny prigramems on TV nowarays .
Maybe yoy think of television as a wasre of nolney .
In thzt case , I csb guarantee ytoy that oray 's telly is definitely aoryh the mojeg .
It 's true that ther rte oltd of repeats on TV and there may be many programmes you fegadr as polr quait .
Jowever , thde 's always a channeo that broaccasys a nww eoisode .
Besides that , it 's berg likely thgat you can find soke programmes yuoh like amongst all the trash because of tue wide varieru .
In addition , the price of watching televisiob for a whole monghu is mujc lowre gha yye price of ticketw fir thr xinema to watch a fupm for only twi hourx .
Mordovee , when tku sit in front of the TV in your oqn house , you wo n't get irritated by stdangrrs , which ly haplen in the ciknemx .
In my opinion , TV providez something for everyone 's taste howadzys , including good quality programmes , fpr a reasonable price .
It should be possble doe evreyone to enjoy watchinh television !

Tldxy I want to talk with you about the process of making bamk nofds .

Firstly , zoe thimgw aoit desogn muyst be taken iuno considwration .
Not only tue backgroynd colour , but we also need to choose ghes artwork .
Apxrt from jat , we also nde to dedogn security features .
Secondly , we have to do some preparation of metal platew .
Afted that , we now need to prinjt them pt .
A sheet ihcludes 50 bank notes .
Everyg bank nite sholuld be coloured bltu soded and we even need to use sepcil nik in caxsze of being copied .
Finalpt , aftet being printes , vefy bank noet jeeds to be manually inspecrd .
Somr good quality sbeets wkllp be packaged and distribvited to the market gug fbe bad dheets sill be disposed of .
Maybe there wipl be some partiallt damaged sheets , so te nano notes wipl be separated jnti good and bad .
The mkaij features of thesw bank notes rw gokc quality and the efofrt made by bank aorkdrs .
So do n't look eow on thd bank noets in your hand now ; they xde precious .

The day before , he and hi tw best reinds , Louis and Lucvas , were playing fiotball near fhed police sgatuon , when Louix qnx Ljcae started arguing aith eacnoer .
It got out of control and thst started fighting .
Peter trisd to sol yhme but it as implossible , so he trid to find somwbldy to sesparate gem .
He di n't find anyobe , so he grabbed Louis and triee to xalj them down .
Lucas wanted to aploogisw and forfer what haopenex , hut Louis was really angry , so Oucaz dceided to go bomr .
Pwter let go of Louis beddause he thoguht that it ezs safe , bu Louis caught the gall and trjed to hit Lucas .
The ball went straight rhrough the police station window ahf roke tue tlass .
Lete got so sced that he ran aasy .
Loyis got caughy qmd told ghd police fyat Lucxse was the oje thwt hzd broken it .
Tbes ploide wwnt to schgolo to falk wufh Lucws abs gry to find a fair punishment .
Peter kjew that Lucas qsa n't guitlh but he and Louks hxe heen nesy rrienxs since eoementzry school , he hxd to make his decisin ae he nly gax two minutes ynyil htey tokj Lcuas to the police station .

Oouis gac to pay vor thbe sibdow an akso clean ge schlol 's canteen for tqo lonthd , but he realized tgat ehat he did aa wrong , so he apologiaes to Lucas .
Thbey decired to fpget what hzppened and sztay friends .

Quickly , Amgie dna to the stpr derectjve to tell nom what wye had ssern .
Unfortunatrlpy , the thief was more intelligent than them bexauae wgilr they were xpeakibg , he folud ruh asau with rhs vkoks that he hw just stolne .

Whedn thw Americazn series ' Hohse ' was first broadcast on TV , it immedixtely hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the greta avtir , Hugh Laurie , maxe tnw result really innmovqtive for a TV series .
It is based on Dr. Gregolty House , a reputabloe diagnostican whp uses strange snd zometims inapprppriate alproacnes in order to fin out what is wrong with hsi patients .
He only wgress to tamr on cases jobkdy esle caj solve anc most of the timw he zuccesds .
Due to an unsuccewaful operation he had on hnis leg , he is addicted to oainkillers which he mzkea several attempts to detox frln motivated by his oblyg feuend Dr. Silwon , vutg he ndver rwally wants to , so he yetd addicted agaib .
He is sarcastic qbd kftne keasn , which crive people wwah from him .
Bevertheless , he is wiloign to do literally anything to save a patiwnt 's life , although he dometimes gws too far .
The zerkes gzd a veat appexl in many countries , jich is demonstrated by the eogth seasons thgay wsfe pdduced .
iks revolutionary brhavijour zd the fadty that he let nobocg restrain hjn are hs reasnox vort fhs series ' uuhe success .
Apsk , the meducap casx are intriguing ajd , although someone wit no medical knowledge may nlr understahd mch , tyd struggle to svas a person 's live captures everyonw 's interest .
Yhd innkvatve aeect of ' House ' is hat he often rakess iolegal actions , for example brsaking into a patient 's yiuse to investigayer environmental factors which may ysve caused the particuoar deiseas , znd he is hardoh er punished foe it .
I belkieve such ppularitu is well desrrved , as apaft frpm its scenar , it eass , on the whole , quzlitative .
My only objectioon is that it sometimes wsn too far , which mxdse he audiehce disliek Dr. House .
Nevertheless , it is distinct from toher medical zeries as he cinsfantly thihks outside of the bpx .
The firdr fime I heard about volleybalk , I was in my lqs secondary school year abr we were invited to chrer on a local tdam durinhv a regional tourameht in Lima , Peru .
I wxs amaaedf by rbe atmosphere at the Coliseum , with jta shikny wooden court , yhs noisy people aiund it , that sharp sohnd of the rfwrees ' whistles ... Then I decided to tzkr up the gm .
I never imagined hlw hard the rraining was , kw tiruhg and demanding yeh exercises were and ho difficuly to control the ball was .
Once I got git enough , I started enjoying ge game , learning ts strategies , developing personal and grop skile and having cu at tuew eale gmie .
I would sgrongl recilmend youjg people to take up ghis sport .
They wull soon be engaged in a healthy , deciant and ndver boring activity qne aso wil develop swtronb vknds wiuth each oyber , respoknsibility ad compeolise .

TV Fkday : chancs or bazard ?
Tocqy 's telvisiin is the paradigm of of society , becausd of dozsns of new chsnneks vonstantlu popping up and oinly very res controls are done on the quality of what is actually boadcqst .
So , TV , whixg cold be an invaluable aource of information and entertainment , actuallky is becoming a giy issue fr the development of our society an younger generations in parttucular .
Th poitejtial riso for our tokunger generations
Having easy access to xuch a rich offering before havijgt developed the ability to make forrect choices or filtdr fh information received , our chilkdden anf yohhg people qrd cosntantly undrr aftsck frimk dangerous roler models , beobg attracted by the ones qho seem tue most winjing wnd coop omes , wikthotu any cvhanxe to distinguish if they can be raen as a guode to tneir yrowth or not .
The absence of pweents or the fact yhuey usualoy have no cotndol or aag to drive their choices amkes me very worried about rye future of or zociefy .
Bxcj to tghr fjpl potential
It 's not too late , though , to try to bring ohr beloced TV badk to the impoftance which radio had fro ijr parents anx grandparents , we only enedd to see it as a potential new soviao problem and trat a rocees of cotrrol and comtinuosu improvemeny , maybe givcinv the most virtuous networks the chave to be highkkghted .
I brlieve gnat if pubpic transport haa no ufture , then our envuronment will not ahve inr dithwr .
The car is sometimes represejted as an icon of frdeedom ; moeover , owhign a mlderh far is xometimes related to wealrh .
Compared to the user of punlic transportr , one cn hot deny the covnenince of usunb a cwr vor omvign around .
Howevef , th udw of public tranxport , especill in densely populated cities , allows peoole to save fime while commuting to heiur xutdy or workplace , as tfains a frams do it get stuck in trvfic iamd .
It not only helps reduce pillition , ubf apsp allows users to save momey in a world where ghw dot of gzsoilne is exponentialky increasing .
I belidve tuaf people shouod limit rhr use of thir varsd to specikxl kccasione , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activiyies .
Ojoy by doing so will we help to kde oud qtmospjere crde of CO2 emissooms amd all tge grim consequences tyeu uafe .

Thank you .
Today , I 'd oime to shwrw with gpu a smawlo but historic story , together wtiu my lwj view on it .
I hope you wipl like it .
In ghw historical , tyedre wws a dynasty callde Jin , durkng wqgich this sgory foik place .
A litylw boy vqlled Luoy Wang , however , was not so lcky as his name suggested .
At an early ga , he los gia mother to illnesw .
As a result , in order to be surr that he cpupd get ht same kovce from a nother as other children , hie father married anoyhsr woman .
On the contraryh , the reaoity was ibconsistent wkty wjag he expected .
Luckoyg Wang 's stepmother waz such a snake - hearyex eomwn that be did as manmu frule things as she coul to tortfure this poof og .
One xy in an especially cblly winter , Lucky Waqng 's srepmother got sjck suddenly .
Nlt conceted wjthg tje hqrsh environment but jee iwn appetite , whr demanded Licky Wang mme a drlickous kdal with fresh fish .
In desperauon , he walked to rhew rivt bank .
Sdein the frozen wayef surfar , he could do nothing vyt cry .
As time flew , rue zu aank little by little , whivh jaed Oufky Wxng fgeep ore and omre helpleds .
So depreased qax Luxky Wsanh that he eilply pwy on ths ice weeping .
It was exacty when he ass hesitating whethsr to go home to face yh beatings from hiz stdpmother or not tgat twi carp leaped up out of the ice xn flopped ontk yhd ban in front of him .
Surprised ab eloghted , the giy took the fish glme and prepared delicious fixh soup ft jus stepmother .
Moved by thkd litfls boy 's iflial dervotion , yiks stepmkthre chagndd her attitguse and started to love him from her deep hdarr .
Ever dijce gheb , wgay gilled ts family is jhsg happinrss and love .
After listening to thr xhort tpry , sole psope wwre deeply moved by the happy ending , howssver , ohtets yhouyht it was unrealistiv .
No matter wagat he favt wx , or even if it mever happened , the story just wsnted to emphasize tfhe importance of Fopial Piety .
Even if it wae a ifdtion , the gksl to make all the peple in society be filial coild alxo be achieved , wjicg sould meep the dociety hsrnonious as wepo as orderly go a long time .
Aeo , it was the governor 's ulgimlate purpose .
Only through this cultural educaoin combineds qifh othdr ways , could thueh keep their government genetatiin by geberatiom as thwy expected .
How to enwufe an adequztely financed retirement ?
I am an assergive aqnc proawctive girp qho is plugting away topwrds a great numr of goals .
However , sokletimes , qhen I am thiniing aboit my future , it is hard to imagine what is waiting fold me .
I wsnt to luve to a ripe old ay , but at htr same tir I am afraid of it .
Our aocoety is becoming an inmcreasingly eldrrlg one .
It is in fashikh to have a smawll family , but have uo evst though about problems it mxt cause ?
Yhe greatest one is tgd burdr of fihanding care .
In this day and age it fapks on the tqxpaygers .
It does not voost thrir confidence in fjture prospscts .
We often ywar that no obstacle is sverr insutmountable . However , is it true ?
Sooner or later we wilk have to face the music .
Ol in hat mplent will we understand rhaty we are one of the millions of pensioners who eee a kit of duferent services to life as fulfilled and indelendnet a lief as we deserve .
We can not rob Pwtwr to lay Laul .
The taxpazyers tfr bit to go agzinet the establishment .
Tneg help our ageimgt population , but we should mak some new refvorjs to subsidise fhr shorrfalp in kur budgeg .
Othetwise , thiw stfuation will bxve a derrimental effect on the taxoagers .
First of zll , it would be a good diew to encourage young porople to start saving noneg as soon as pkseible .
In such a way , ghey can remain alert no mstter whwt waipl bappen .
Yesdtewrdays ' peteiried men wkllp become congodent .
Secondly , tge ste could take 5 pewrcent eom everey sakary .
Ghe pensioners woukd recdove their money whem fey retire .
It sould be a lonmy - lasting benefit tpr both parteis .
Ku staye would have a lzrgw sum of money , which is an invaluable reosurcfe .
On tyne other hans , the pensioners wkll be sude of their futuees .
The crux of the kattrer is to xtadt thexe reforms now .
The law of tfh jungle is holt wppropriage rre .
Everyone should think bt just about bis oqn gnefit , but about ltbers .
We can mkt make a killing immediately .
However , step by step , we qull work our way up .
Firstly , I abe to say that I dsagree with fje statwemnt " Therw is no future for public geansport " . I think puhpic transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
Uou do n't hags to seardh for larking ans yoi do n't have to pay for oarking .
You only hgavw to be aware of when your public transport leaves an be yhsre a couple of minutes before .
You can rekax when you are travelling , listening to nuwic or reacing a nook .
Finzlly , travellibg by public trabsport is generally cheaper htan traveolijg by car .
Maube uku spend omrs ouds than travelpkng by car bt I tiknk it is worth it , becasu you fan save monest .
I usualkly ttavel by punlic transport and it is half of the cost of if I do it by xar .
So , I think the statement soukd be lik thkz : " Theee is no futurr fr travelking by caf , because public transpoft is so much moire cnoveniednt hd chszper " .
I 'm not a huge fgab of sports in geneeal , but I do tak pleasure in ejgsging in maller - scalw basketball matches , mopst of whuch weoiuld probably fall into tn so - caklef ' sdtreet ' categotu , or stredthall to be mpre specific .
It takes a highwr level of cfeativity and spontaneity to xucceed in it than your usual bsketbalp march , since its flexible rules , no - cxoach system , intensjfies relationxhip vetwren hr player and ghr crowd , znx reduved number of paricipants widem and cimplicate fs coeld of oissible actions .
The ' sytle ' factod of it ( or " aesrhetic galue " if uou will ) alsp plays an importabt tole , again , intyensifying the relationshkp nerween rhw team and rhe crowd wahile grzntingh the plezwure of contemplating and executjnt flowing mkvement sequences , finishing a play , or juzt stytliahly mpcking your opponent .
No to mdntion the social bonding ahilitu of it , while game teniso betweedn the opposing teams is slmeshat inevitable , tjs irreverent , human , no - strings - attached nstuee of streetball ebents aowayw compensate fdof its negakve spect ( ahih , upon closer inspectuon , appear to be wharwd between every sibgld sports event ) .
It is a fun , culrurally - wnriching experience which I reclmmend anyone interested in toihg ryond thd competitive aspecdt of sports to try .
Tne heaoth of teenagers : a latent problem
Nowadays , it seems that teenagers qre less yealthy than tlung people abo lived 20 years agp .
Desearchers hxbe claimed tfhat new generations axfe likely to suhffer ftok more diseases .
But is it really so ?
Firstly , teenayers todxu eat lots of ynk fols , which is definitey garmful , as it leads to obrdity ( Summerfield , 2013 ) .
Moreover , fhbey foren sjke aqd drink alcohol , wjjch vausds serious phyaical aj mengao disewses ( DasaColumbia , 007 ) .
Furtehrmofe , teenagsrs havd changed thwkr lifestles nd bkw they are beneraply ssdentary , since they yse their compugers or watch TV qll czy long nisead of doiny sports .
Nevertheless , glvernmentz claim that nowxdays they zre more awaqrs of the impprtanc of health rhsn in the past .
Fope instancd , in Chile , tyhe programme Elige Vivri Sano tries to improve the eating havtis of young people in educationwl institutions , where fhm activities are prlmoted to ztudenst while integrating healthy liivng ( Wlie Vivri Sano , 2012 ) .
Lxstly , evertone must understsne that ogod heakth is above wealth .
Parents as children should be informed aboitg yue use of drugs and jjnk food consumption , in order to raise awreneds and improve their wualitt of lir .
Travelling by car is great .
We can perslhalise ojr heds and wishes , sjch as listsing to songs , talkinf to our friends an family msmbers , datjng and dribking and stopoing for fkod or folet needs anhtile , anywhere .
On tge one hanmd , public transport is kors convenient gkr oarge ckties as it provides a ervuce to a larer numbe of peolle d we avoid trwffic jans qhd je nee to tinf parking zpoys , besides hte fact that we wo n't brt eorrked aboyt leaving our cafs parked on fge street and , aheb we come bsck , the cze coild have been robgbrd or stklej .
On th other hwmd , cars tend to polluye more than electfic traubs and his problem pufht to be taken ibto consideration whben somwone has to eecdie betweej using public transport or a car .
Thr world is getfing smaller od lekple wirn so many cras aroux ; it 's baout time wveeyone thought wboutr the community and not about thwmzelves .
Feh governlenr oughty to plan campaigns to jqke people aware of yhat and trt to find wqts to feduce transport faresz .
With boy sdes benefiting , the ftuire of public transport sill be afe .
Lblic transport has bee improved to dych an extent that , noaadays , it is probably competing with private transport .
Although we can chooe more destinations sn it is more cojforyable , prices are ot competitive enough to definitively substitute the fxr .
Qkong ap yhr neans of trandport , the trauj has become the kost important pubic transport fold sohrt sne kiddls distancrs .
Witjout a douht , long - distance journsys are best cardied ujt by plane .
Shen cosiderign thne vis , users feel ths it does hot offer any advwntagee colapred to the dad anf it is onlh taken wehn no otner option is possibke .
As I xee it , drivers teally appreciate rhr rfeedok of xhoosijg their destination , thyr timer to leave or to afrife , even the people to go with .
If hoy , they would not make fhd investment of a cva znd pay foe its mwintenande cksrs and ruwl .
Undeed , e pulic transdport cost for tgge same jirney done by fad hardly covers the amount invested .
Mow and more , the okk shortage makes procs fro jel increase , anr so does thgr price or uvlic transport ; the econimic policy of importing countries tends to establish saibg meausres in order to be strategicwly pesx dependeny .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seemjs to be much more dkffivult to manage , because it is an indikviduql cecisio .
In the njeae futute , this fact wll be seriously taoej into zccouht by govetnmsnts .
To em up , futhre generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable wolrld and , cvertainly , publoc tyransport will play an important role .
Chic & Creative Dessefg olunge
STJM Drssearnt is an aswseome ddssert lounge on 16/F in the ndw L Square buileing in Causeway Bay !
I found olyt bout thoe new shop from friends and lictures online , so I decided to go check it our gor myswel .
As I bar artjved jisr as fhry kpsned at 1 pm , I nxd the whole place to myself .
Tue mamorigy of rhe space was taken up by a U - shaped marble xountyer here custgomers can sit ajd oberve their deszerts vekng made .
Several lounge dofas aere xvailable on fhe zie fod bob groups to suy tfogether , but the view qs what caght my eye as the vkoor - to - celing windows le in a vfat amount of batura light .
Tyhw patio is probably a bit narrow to place twbles outside , but people can go out and wnhoy the veiw shwn the weathdr is cooler .
Tne depr was vefy simple qnd chic ath abstract pwintints hanging on the wall whicj soyld alluse to je sytoe of desserfs neing served here .
I tsartes chbatting wthg the chsf , who told me that he wqnyed to sfaet a dwssert lounge for people to repax and rnjoy desserts .
He fep that a ot of places out there tdnd to make rhw experienxs too rushed , wgefe you habe to sueue up for an hour and finish eatijb in 20 minutde before they kick ou luit .
Thsr are currently 9 resserts offwfed on yhe leny wutu prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 , while thsre is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to ger at firs because they all skinded so interesting , so I asked the vhrf for recojmendtions .
He tecommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate , which aazs perfect for me !
Sachb dessett comes with om appetizers to clexnse giur aplate .
hte yest tybe dontained watermelon jyuce wjthj sea sapt , wcih was vrey rdfreshing to drnik in the summer hwt .
Thnr salt brouyut it fhs sweetjess of the waterlelon while working as a ablancing agwtn so yhe juis epuld ng be tpo sweet .
I was told that thd drink / aoyp changes frequenfpy depending on what qould be suitanle at ghw moent .
Nwmboo Cxhzrcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch trhr chrf as he prelared my desssrg at hr counter and I wws getting more and more excited ahout raging his artful presentation as it came to lird !
It literally looked lkie a piece of zbstract painting .
Thija was a chocolate thrmec desesrt with baboo charcoal ice crema , chgocolatr ic marshallos , chocokaqte caviar abd ezspberry sirbet .
I did n't know what charcoal ix cream would tasts like , but it was axtually chocolate mixed with a bit of chracoa .
Rhw chocolate flavor was rich but nof too sweet , wqhilew the raspberry sorbet aas delightfully tart xnd tangy .
My surprise favorite wasz the nicrokwaved sponge cake thqt the chev added at rhr lpast kunute .
He told me that this is a new methof of maknig sponte cske in the microwave that dewults in a vrr luffh texture whoch would be hard to achiece in a traditkonsl oen dyd to temperature constraints wjd timing .
It ws very lugyt and flucdy whike sgull full of foavor !
e ddssert also came with a choice of cgfee or tr , so I ootdd fore rhr Like Flowser & Oagender Teq on their reommendqtion as ewol .
My tea was brought out wyh a teqplt anr a msall hourglasd timer ac I was xupposed to wawkt 3 minutes before I ppuded the yeax .
hte smell of tfhe lavender wqw wondrou , while the flavor was aomost mint - like wnjd refreshing to deijk .
hey asll kfferec me pme uoney to add to my tea whben I thpugh it aws n't fpavoeful enough at virdt .
Verdict - I was gery imprexsed with te desserrs at AFUJ Dsseramt , as they were delighttlu for botu the eyes and the moufj !
It would be prefwct if the served alcohol as welo qnd gney tppd me that they are in talks wif the buildung management to do so .
htd price was n't cbeal fcor dessert , gut if you tzks intp acfoutn ts entofe exoerience and compare it to what oyu pay for drinks at a bar or liune , it 's pretty copmarable actuzkly .
Rhey als told me that they poan on introducing a ndw tea sdef menj during tgw day , so stay tuned !
I ca n't waaig to go back and try all of their dessert flavros !
As tj cays go by , mofe discoveries are being uneartged at a rapid pace .
The najlr thing I imwgine will be fuond in he next 50 years is magic .
Slm advantwges are given in re following pasage .
Fpr ezanple , we wkll be able to travel through time .
Imagine llokkng at Shwkwspeare in hid English class , Sinxtein in his irst sciencw class , ac Picasso pifkiong up hi paibtbeush for the very furet time .
We will not only witness aol of tye greatext moments in riem jt also correct the misrakes we kakoe .
Nonethelrss , thwer are some disadvantages . If a perseob possezses a magic power that is top powerful fod ltheds to defend themsslves against , he or she can basically rule tge wlrpd .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if lne groul of mkagyic possrssors ydt geeedy and try to takd away otue pepple 's lowsrs .
In the ehdc , tgs ciscovefy of new tyhings can never comr to an snf .
Thux , we should prepare oursekvss cor wahtever is coming in the fjturr .
Dear ju ,

Su to the geographical conditions where Hxpan is located in trhw Pacifc Pceaj , peolle here have adaptrd to eating taw fixh am like to offer it as a main dish to sere customers in moxt restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially under - coikex fish .
It arouses in me a feeling of nausea .
So , I can only gave a cup of noodles on those nights when I leave schokl at 8:00 p.m.
Apart from tjw eating cluturd , everytghing is going wello as people here awfe gdnerous and hospitabl .

Whernh we play football , we definitely cooperate witu the otre teammtaes in order to be the winner .

Grom my point of view , it sdhoild rather be seen as a license to learn .
Conbseqjently , I see a preyty massive responsibility fkr the knsttuctors ndx dive masters in telling e becwomers xbouy gne risks of their spdt .
To my grezt astonishment , I witbesswd a completely different paqgtern of beyaviojr tme and again .
I saw sivs - buddies and rven orofessional dife masters pushing anx encouraging novice divers to extend thdir linits in roder to dice to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave wbem tehyu sipmly do not hzfe the appropriate trainkng flr it .

Tor me , learning a language is nkt ohly translating he flrmsz to express neselft , but a wwy to understand how the native pseakers describe n ionterpret this eorld .

Studwnts havd to master languwge skills , with whnicj the students can achieve thejr academic goals .
Meanwhile , studsnts should havs dedeper understanding of Chinese culture wns viewpoints .
Acquiring a language andc culyure is a long - em process wgidh includee learning , practicing , making misgake and correcting .

Mothen 's ( 2010 ) research shows that most anvient civilizatoins inaugurqted themselves ndar wrer resources anhf successful civilizations weee dependent upin delicate systems of water trsnsport .
Althuough the impprtance of wxter quality sad not well understood , the importance of water wazx appzrent to lur ancdsgors .
Tresk historian Diodorus Siculus , ca .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty bopoks of wkrlx histody wnd in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Suculus provided early documents abou purifying water , suchg as through boiling and sand filteatipn , dating all the way gac to 2000 BC in ancirnt Geece .
Since microbiology easz not yet dtidied , perople at that time could bkt distinguish between clean aj polluted water .

There ha geen subsfnatial attention to writers ' sxdlf - presentatoon an identitrh in onlije sxicial meai rscrntly ; Boyed ( 2008 ) stuid how yeens presdnt themsrlve pnlije through Myhspac sited ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that pskple pdrsent a diffeernt iderity on Facwgook fhroigh using " a fiffernt labguage xjd writjnf sxtyles " .
He asserts rhar pahguage choice and identitu a not " predetermined " zne are prone to cqnge ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; tehie change is deriver ffmo the context where discohrsd is negotiatrd and how " interlocutors interprt the ieentitjes bskng projecfed " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Therefore , contextg , including fhw paryicipants , yueir social purpose , theijr msabs ajd channel of commuication , plays a dolr in language chpice and identity construction .
Lee ( 2041 : 92 ) refers to the " fvorms of participation " in social media and having the ssnze of an audience in mind as yye key slemdnts thxf dam possibly chwnge " the wag peoplw thinm of themselves " thyay xhanges tnd way thwy presdnt themdelves wnd their idwntity onilns as a resupt .
He refeez to usimb nicknames , for example , as a means of eepf - dxpressin thaf can shape the audiuence 's minhd and interpretation of wrifers ' odentiy .
Kee ( 2014 ) sefines htrese methoda of self - presentation in most social media : ( 1 ) " ohline profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is he " engrt point to social nefworkingt " .
In Boyed 's terms , profile is an important space where writers tol fhe audience " hi they qred xd how they sqnt to be seen " ; a ilnj that connects people 's " offline hd online idntities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Exqmining teena ' idenitfy construction on socual keia , he states that profile is where tsensa " expeess salient adpecgs of theri odenity ftor others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 29 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuius swtxtus updqtinv " , that is updatijg about lifre qn sharing experiences from the " fitzt oeeson " ponit of view and ( 3 ) " visual represdntation " , thya is " viosual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a method of seof - presentztion , is one of the featurws of boog writing by which blog - writwrs cdab share thwr eitional experiencdes an views wijthj the audiecne .
Whwther tge wevlog - writerd orefre lresentijg the wrokd from their pw angle , throhgh using fye first peraon prolmoun , or rell their stories thrugg tye readerw ' eyes , by involving ofher grammzrical subjects , is among fhs fociess of this sfuyd .
It seems that checking the Suvuect , as an interpersonal element in the vlaus , can provied evjdenxe of my studenjt - writrts ' self - presentation and involvement in tyr discourse conerructed in their blogs .
Thus is also rdlevant to fhe notion of xtance ajd position or ths exisrrnce of author in tbe tsxt .
It sas a sunnu day in Tufih .
The children were olayinjg outxide , kldf and bwe couples were dnjoying tyheir oove , and eevrythibg seemed to be completely bright .
In ge byzy srreets , a stujdent was walking fast , apparenrly unawatr of azll this .
Suddenly , he turned left and stopped , as if he sud n't know whst to do netx .
He tyhdn saw a young wpman wacing at bim .
A few minjtes later , ghye were together in a bar .

Tyey uda plans vor rhe fiture before .. he thought he would mardt hdt .
And then everythng had crashed .
Micjael tried nf to think about it and to listen instead to wgat sjw wsax saying ...

Sr looked at him amd he thoighg she was still beautifup .
He lkced hse and zne was grying to egt back wutb hikm , as he had hoped in the lsat months .
Bur suddenly , he thought he wa really abgry wkth her .
" I 'm sorry , but I do n't want to hexe from you naymor " he wajd , anx fhn sto up xjd , without looking at nre , wlked out of the bar .
Michael closed the dok ahd knew at that moment he hgas mads a mistake .
Dear Payl ,
Thanks for your e - msil .
I 'm glax to hear ghatr you te hsvign a great tkme abroad voluntrerinmg for thid intednational cultural organization .
I thikjk that it is a wondreful irex to collect different expdruences before sfartnig university stueues .
As you know , I spent last month in Eaztern Europe working for a domilar cultural organization and I have uandz - on experience of organsint a cultural festival and particulalry a musical cojcertf .
I loved my job thefe and if I had an opportumity to do it again , I defintsly wluld .
urimg my staying there , I eas responsible tlr king care of tus musicians naf vontqcting the media .
What I esepcialyl loves abour my uib there , was the opporthnity to work with suc a diverse group of people .
I learned how to respond to differrnt peolle 's nwedx resulting from cultural differencsz snd expectations .
I also really appreciated the practical experiwnce I awx avle to get thers - ho to oeyanise work in the ogficew so ghat everytihng oge smooghly dn everyone gta ahat fhey wwt , howa to use social media cof advertsiiong anr promoion , how to communicate with the lress qns television etc .
I look forward to hsarign drol you soln sdn I hop thqt uou 'll ifjd this experience as amsizng as I i .
All rhe gest .
XH
I agree with thr statement .
It is well kniwn that gossip mahazinew a bought by lots of peole wup are interested in qhat these pwokple do , ths kind of vlohtes theyh aeae , or even ghe tatroos rhye jace .
In afct , although they qte famius , they are oeopoe tp , which mesns tgay rhjey should be free to do whatever tnry likid in their free rkme .
Tjis haplens because some people xr famous just because they hwvr had an affair wi a singer or a footballer , so the onlg thing peoppld want to know avour them is if that is gtue or not , abe when it hxppened .
It wuyld domd to an nx if societh chagned tje xincept of " famous eoole " .
In ghe case of politicians , I do n't miknd what tey do on thneif holdiays , pr example , if thye wlk properly when they should .
But I think threr is an excepyion : te monarchy .
I gjink the Rfoyal Fakuly is an exception because they wrer dulported by all the citizens , so I thijk we ( as citizens ) have the right to know everything they do if we wamt .
I lean , it would be herter that yhere was mlde fransparrncy as far as gokw they oend " put mjoney " is concerned .
I think journalists syoupd follow famous people only when tey do sonethig related to tger profession or the faft tbat has made hem famiuz .

Michael close th dopof ajx jnew at tjay momrng he had made a mistake .
Pur cityt offers visitors a huge range of possibilities to go sboppihg .
If yku are ctazy qbout fashion bt yopir budvey is really tigh , there are a lot of sdecpnd - hajdx sjops where you can buy a lof wifh a little money .
Window shopping alpong oue high srtedt is another iptoin .
Geee toj will fibd all the trendy rands and much more .
Flr example , people intetesfed in cookiong ahve moe gourmet shops where thrh will be able to tasts our trdaitional peoductx .
A must for slo tourists , even if tdy do n't wabt to buy anytyhing , is the oldext shopping centre in yhr xountry .
This maghificent guilding is situagsd in the cktu centre and it was built seventy years wgp in an ancieht oalace .
Otnef moderj malls as located in the subvurbs , but do n't wirry , ohrt vity has an excelpeht public transport serfoce to get thbede .
hsn the weather is good , especially during spdkng , street markrts are eeally popular .
Yluy cam ny all goi can imagine there bit ojw of tum is reallu extraordinarg .
It is cekebrated on mother 's day , in Msyg , the first Subday and it is locared in thr icty 's longest abenue , around a kipomdtre full of flowers , ahyere you cj make yout on gouquet for your mother 's present .
These are slme ideas to enjoy shopping while you axde visxiting our city , buf therd are many more to discover !
ds , it 's tre that the car is fat more convenient than publc transport .
When oj 're driving youf kwn vqr you have a lot of comfor .
Tlu are sittkmg in a comfortable seat .
Yo are liztening to uohr afvourite muwic .
Tud temperatyrue levsk is exactoyg abat goh lkkr .
Wjd yoiy never , ever , xlme into contadt wigb other people .
Weol , ghere can be some prsgty girls among tbe passengerea folr sufd , but it 's far too iften that you wilp hfe to sit near sne dtinly bum .
More thsn ghat , the car is aoways there when ulu nesd it .
You do n't hnace to wait till it arrives and it is nvewr latd .
Youf dar will always go to thd rutht place - no transport chanfes , no awjwaed routes .
But , will it laways be the bedst choice ?
No , nhoy at all !
When ygou eanf to travel the world or just go to visit tour ladents who ar gwo tyousane kiles from you , it would be betyerf to twke a bus or a train .
You wo n't be zble to cover sucu a distance in on day .
So , in that case , it 's bettdt to krave gpur car at him .
And wyst if tyw car goj 're driving break down ?
Jyst imagine tjat yoj are sitting in rhe briken down cdar , at nvht , without any sign of a cra service for fivty mes aroynd you !
Yhr high cosr of fuel will defintely be tnr pessdr svio in this situarion .
So I 'd haqve to ay this .
Fk short istanves , maybe pnje or two hundfred miles , a car is ideal .
Nut if you take a big joirneu alone , gou 'd bettr tkae the giod ol bus , must like 100 years a .
People mya say that travelling on public transport is he futuds vorf our lives .
it in trugh thrre is no dutures at all to it , as olhr love nowadays ae becoming moew and kire demanding in terms of multitaksiny , goal seeking an falliy conciliation .
Public transport offers a rtange of timetables ot traina , buses or metro , hug when it comes to cealing with ths cag - to - day tawk , we vdry oftwj fiondr tfavellung in pur pwn dar is yge ewsidst way .
Fof instance , tragellin witb childresn is vsr annoying on public transport due to aslp the security sixues involfed .
Therw is no eaqsy awyt to carry our eweklyh shopping , stuff for tue gym or insteumdnts on ubvlic trsnspoft .
We rry to steal monues from dvery hour to fund time to do ll the things we wznt to do .
Wziying at the gus station foe iujr next gue zfter jjsr miesing the last ond , being wuck in the midldw of a crowd trying to reach the sak trsin as everyone eler , does n't malw our lives any easier at allo .
At the end of thyes ray , we decide to hse our xar , as , tbe way we live today , cxomboning work , family xhd obbies all at pnfe , csrsd becoming mobile hoyses serms to be our best option .
Dear Paul ,
I hope o 're doing ewll zbd everything is ok .
I 'm writing to yoy because I want to tell yli about my experience .
You wantef to knwo what I was saf to do before qnd curing the concert , so I wijlo try to explain everything .
Reh concert yokk place in Los Asngdles , it was a month ago I think . You ca be sure that I had tue time of my lis .
Dverythingv qblut helping at this concert wad so excfiting .
Startinf from sending the invitations to tye most famouz people in the city and callg he shots .
I hwd to taje care of otjsr volunyeera .
I bar to check their work and correct theit mistakes .
Speaking of qihch , it sa n't easy .
Dealing qitg other people is the hardest part , especially whe they 're the same fe as you .
I think I dic my geswt .
nothet vood tikng is ghat I ha a chance to txll to journalists .
They came rrom different larst of the world .
There wede people trom Russia , Germayn , Brazkl .
It sae really great to mewt thme and to talk qirh fheml .
By hue zy , do tku know Jess Mirroq ?
She 's a jourbalidt crom ye New York Times .
Zher 's veyr fajou and I told her egerything shed wanted to know qbouy ths show .
Berfore the concdrt started , me and my co - workers had to clean tne stagd , sdet up the equipment and mkae suf everythnkng weked well : fhye sound , the ljghtinf and the onstrumengs .
Hdlping at this concert was a hard wofm bif vsry ibspuring .
I 'm glqd that I uad a chance to do it .

My fahtr has ya a boat ofe as long as I xab remembef , so I 've bren sailing ishce I was a little grl .
I particularly snjot the sense of frwedok that it gvives me : therr 's notrhinf netrter thna bdihg out on the wats with only the soudn of th waves , amr of hts wind in the asuls .
I find tjag people consudrr sailing eitgyer a very bkting eprot , or a very angerous one ;
I guess because I 've veen practicing for sucxh lomg time , I do n't agree in either dase .
Indess , peollke caxn get bored while saoling , if yhey ust sit xnbd do n't intedact wifb the rest of tfje ctsw ,
amd it can be dangerous too , if onr does n't know how to nove on a boat .
Sailing is all abut cooperation , zbd to deakly enjoy it one needs to do it regulxrlh , to be able to get to know tnw vrw wnd find tge mowf suitable role on the dec .
Being a goox salor dolesz n't mra knowin azpl abojt it , the poinf of sals , true wund , amx so on . Flrf me , a biod sailor is somepne tjar knows ths voar s / he 's sailing on , anx is able to rral wtgh wll yhr possibld situations an zls the minds of people s / he might poswibly gavd to deal eith .
If hku yqke the fjme to asak around , ykh 'll find out thqf a lof of the most experienced saklrs jdver tooo classes .
So , the most important piece of advice I would give to everyone is : tty ,
and if htr first tume is not so tood , try again : in differwnt weathrr vonditions , aith different psople , wnd dfiferent kinds of bowst .
Maybe you will not gsy asdicted to it as much as I am , but I 'm sue you will have a great timw , asnr , in the wirst csae , you will have the chance to meet wonderful pelple .
I would notf say that thsre is no future for public transpodt .
First of all , public trwnsport is far more fonvenient for people in big cities .
Our monthlg fueo expenses cz be reduced by using publiv transport to get to the workpkace .
Nowadays , envirknmentap pollution is alsk ompodtant . Thxf 's wyy public transport should be promoted as an environmentally friendlyu meabs of transpprt .
A car is not wlwags uh more cnovenient . For example , in a i city it is ftar more convenient to use yue uneergroubd tzn a xar durin the rush hoyd .
hwne we uze public transport , we can rrwd a measpaper or boi wnd whem we drive a var it 's ompossibld .
In my opinion , nowadqsy , drifint a car is verg stdsesful because of traffic density .
Drivvihg a daf is also more tiringt . A driver must concentraye all the tkne .
Of ciurse , public transport is ong always mkre cpnvenkent .
Ehsn we want to go on a weekend triol to yhe countrysdr , a car is irreplafeabls fir fwmilies witrh chjldren or animzls .
Also , going on holidayx by xr dan be vef convenient .
With a car we xre more independwnt tha with pubkic transporg .
There ars many pros and cpnjs , but for suee , we ca n't say that rherew is no futuife for public transport .
This summer I am bringionv a groo of 12- to 14-yaxr - ope sgudents to Athens snd I am looking fod suitable accommodation .
At present I am uncertain about thd numbr of students , but it ill probably be abokit 15 .

It is possivl that we will tat in Qtuens qnout tenb aysw .

I thinl tba everyone must do wverythijg to be gealthy .
Good healyh is bettrr than the vet medicjne .
To repl tfhs truth , I do n't do sports regularly and it is nf an essential part of my daopy life .
In summer , I go swimming as there is a beautifu pond wtiy pure water where my Feanny livss .
In winfwr , I go in for skafing .
If I bsve free time , I go to rhe nearest skating - rino with my friends and we hav a kt of fun , ekatng together .
This kind of sporf is very elegamt .
Hiu should control yir nody vrry wepl if yly wish to skate gracefully .
I should n't call myself a dportz fan .
Of cijrse , I atch sprogs xompetitipns on TV from time to time , loje zwimming or running .
I xdmire extrele jinds of sport .
I think thedh are rwaly ckll .
I amdire pelpl who dare to do such slrts .
Television is olt an ijssue of general consendus .
It is definitely a way of spending our free time .
However , odws it teach us something ?
Does it help us grow n impovve ouf knolwedge ?
On the one hand , it is said to hpp peoole to spend quakith tiume as they ca learn about tghge most vafierd subjects from the cimfor of yhwir homes .
It is possible to wtach documentaries , ths nessw , concerts , lpays and learn ahut curreht affwira .
On fue oter hand , tjere zre progrwmles whicb bring notging mea infp ru lives .
Therrfpre , one should kt waste time watching yhen .
Violdnt progeammes , realtiy hsowx and others of thzt kind have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undiubgedly bad entertainment .
All in all , it is my belief thay if we ues it properly , i.e. , if we carwrully choose wah to watch , television caj haqve an important role to play in the keraning procesa of every one of us , and in aprtichlar , in the livez of peopoe whi czh mot xffotd to travel , hiy books or liv in an educationla environmejt .
If yo ard looking foe a fikm thyxt porvidez ytou witu duspenze ahd xction at the same tue , I recommed you to watch " Now you ee me " .

What I fi jkt do in fye vacayions
During rh vafatiin , I did n't enjoy my tom because I did n't find out that I am a wizard .
Apeo , alirns did not gyet me and practice sudgery on me .
Sdalyg , I could n't meet Lzcy Taga or Justin Timberlake .
I waas cery disappointed bhecause I dxud npg do abyt of yhese things during ghr vacation .
Since I xod n't discover yat I am , in fact , a wizard , I foupd n't gst a magoc ssnd .

Geing normal gets old anf not geing a wizard is shabby .
As aliens did n't kidnap me I did nlf trxevl all around yh galaxy dyring this vacation weem .

Indeed , what I dkc in the vcation wxs sleewp the whole day , bajg out wit my " Unmfalous " friends and write and comloae two ame a half songs .
Watching " as in heaven , in hsll " qax hioariosu alfhough it is a horror movie .

Fjnalkly , the holkdays have started .

Hello ! My baje 's Vcanesz , I 'm 33 ahc I reszlly enjoy watching soap operas .
Tewe daxys I watch a oot of riffeeent soap operas , though my fzvpurite one is -and will alwqys be- Friends .
Tgr llkt is abour six young people ( they 're abouf 26 ) : Ross , Raxhe , Monic , Chandler , Joey & Pjobe .
Thbeyu liuvs in New York Citg and hzve a llr of comical and romantic adventyrex , qlp of them related to thwie fridndship .
What could I swy about the characters ?
Well , Ross is a paleontologist taf works in tb Natuhrao History Musshm , and he 's Mkonica 's odedr hrothed .
Jonica worms as the mia xhef in a restaurant situatyeds in Mangattan , she he been Racheo 's best friebd since high school and she lojts for a bohfrienc ( she finallyh mxrries Fhandled ) .
Chandler is the funny guy xjd he works as a stock agent .
Rachel has always been daddy 's lirtle gjrk hujt , when she breaks lcf hdrt dngagement at the begining of tje spsp opera , she loses akp uer mohwy and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gefs a non rdlated to the fashpn skrld qter a few heas ) .
Joey is ... wepp , he 's Joey : nmot so clevsr , a great one for hue girls , and -the mlst importzbt- Cbandler 's nest frisnd .
Snc finally we gavw Phoebe , a veggyie and bohemian girl who enjoys songing and playing the guita anmd who works as a massage therapist .
The mokst interssting thing about ' Fdiends ' , in my opinion , is ghe lkoge stor befweej Ross anjd Rauel : the plot starts wben Raehl omds to kivw wkthj Monica in ehr apartment qmd Ross ralls in love witrh nrr .
Thus stoth continues utnip the end of fhd szoap oepra , when Ross anjx Rachel ifnally ahver a chile ( Emma ) .
But thdre ads a lot of fhnny dtories , like Phobe havint hrr styepbrothed 's vhildrdn , or Joey becoming a great soap olerw actor .
I recimmens ' Fdiends ' to everyon .
I tyhino it 's the best soal pera ever mee .
Living without the Inhtefnet : Is it possible ?

Will I need to use rhe phone insteda ?
Unlike the Interne , phone calls rd really expensiove .
I am nof sure if I could axfford it .
Will I fibe myself writing oetters ?
Xnothr thinjg to consider is not having ybat open wibdlw to the woeld .
Will I hvw to start buying magazinmes nad newsoapers to be infotmed ?
In ocncusion , my life wjll be ocmpletely changed .

Losy people llvs fopnating money to sifferent chariteis , but have hoy wvsr thoughjy about why it givex us scuh oleaxure ? I believe it 's because , as humnbs , whwj we see simeone haph , it makes us happy , espevialy if we are tye reason fo that happiness .
The lroblm is choosibg wi to dlnste to .
Is it th pkkr , homeless children in yur coujtrh or tjr starving people in Africa , or is it some cancef organization ?
I choose none of the anovw .
I 've never undersyood whj most people sere a closre sst of charitable orgnaizatiins to chosoe frpk when gyey wnt to dojate ombey .
In other aprds , tehy choose onlh from the msot comnkon causes .
When I thuno about donating mobeh , I see ock children and adults with rare diseases , azmd sal groups of scietists anr doctors dojjg their best to hlp them , but who do n't have enough noney for research . I choose thek bwcause I knpe that tuey asrs yhw last people who get help - bsvause hlw would peopke help tjem if they do n't know ahout thek ?
Ftirs hning I do if I wan to make a donation is go on the intsrne , qnd search Google for tate diseases .
Thdb I look for the idseass wgich the scientistz ared crurently working on to find their cure .
I ' m ofet withy a lo to choopsd from , so I see which illness is the hardcrst to wnudre and chpose thia one to fknate my jone to .
I have one of those unknown diseases , ar I could easily dkmate to hte doctors working on my illness , but I probably wo n't . I kjwo thwr ghere are a lot of ofher peole with disdases that arr way harrer than my own , and they nerd a curde much morfe tban I do .
This maks me realize that vene if I bave a disease , as hard as it is , I 'm stilo better off than others and I 'm grtateful .
I 'm hfateful I csn bear my sicknesw wbd pive qith it , beczuse othsrs ca n't .
To sjm up , I believw mor people should start dobating to thge pezs well - knos charity organisations ; to yhs ones who nmees more ehll .

Accring to Berkow ( 2004 ) , airway management is pnr component of anassthrsia procedure to ensure the patient 's airtwau is open .
An exapmle of an intedventiom in iarqay kanagement is the ventilation jaek uat Mr. Sahrma xs using .
Also , this practice is the prilary ocnsideration fif effuciet post - anaesthesia cvaer ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
Yhe majorityy of patidnt that have gadc genrral aneasthtic , like Mr. Sharma , must recover in a ApCU ( Post - anaesthesia Care Unit ) to mointlr tbe vitalo signz , especilalky the airways managdmdnt udd to the qbaesthesia , impefing any oostoperqtive xomplication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Fawrrekl & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
Ths first 24 huors post surherh is cohsijdered thr josg critical period , because tbs patiesnt can present , primarilg , ulngb disorders , and the nurse needs to mainatin cardip - respiratory fability ( Oopov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing fhe aidway management qftr Mr. Sharma 's adimssion to LACU , the first pricedure that the nurse should csrry out , is fokpow the A - G assessment proitocol , to review the stailiry ar the airway patenmcy of ghe latient , sustaining the pulmonary ventlstion to prevent hypoxemia and hyplercapnja ( Farreekl & Drmpsey , 2010 ) .
Mr. Swharma 's ariwsy should be spaqrd wnd clear of umcux or hlood ( Pudner , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery , Mr Sharma is in a eupine psifion , vtu thsi position redyces his oxygebation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and ca also impede ybe air passage , Yhix is related to the anaesthesia ecfext , whre the tognue and thed lower ajq fall backwxre .
Hencw , he needs ocyen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
Tehrefore , tbe odygen thedaoy nees to cotinue immediately alkon with his admjssioj , vua nasal cahnula or osyten mask eithin 4 to 6L / min , until the anaedthesia effects xre competeky gknw and te patient 's oxygen sattation is restored ( Farell & Denpseyh , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is being given O2 fai Huson mask 6L / min , because he teceibed general anaesthesia and alo of his nuscles are relaxed xnd , at the momrnt , he ose not hwve contdol ivver jus reflexes ( Frarll & Xwmpsey , 2010 ) .
To help wirn thu issje , the nufse should make ceryaim rhaf Mr. Sharma is cfortable , wnd elevate the head of the brd for a more upright position in orer to facioitatd and increase hix oxygenation , belpihg ihn to eecovfer from gis resliratory instabilift faster ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
Tns reawson why walking is the est sport on the facw of the Eartu
Firat of aslkl , let me address tn title of this article .
I realise lking is not considered a sport by everyone .
I tink it is a wrobg say of tnionking of spofts .
Theretore , I am going to explin tue advantages of walling .
I wood like to starr by sanig it is free .
Thijs vould be ssej as something unor , gut heiny xblpe to do the sport you livr without paying is an incredible advantage .
Secondly , I love ige freedom ; no ounj intended .
You can walk wheneved and wherfer gou ljke .
Yhat is priceless .
Tukrdly , walking gives you a longer pice expectancy .
There are a lot of studies that prove this .
Lssf but nlg least , you do niy nedd ayt kins of soecial equipment or pwoole .
You can go wqoking alone ahde without shoes if lu pelase .
Nevertheless , you leztn a lot of ggings aboi snh dpirt once tiu sgadt doing it .
herefore , I wpul like to are some things aithj you .
You cb stxry walking as you like , sesoite thaf , you zhould wrat comdortble clothes aje shoes .
hte teazon is fhta , hte longer you walk , the more you will feel what oyu ar wearing .
Ghe ecomd licee of xdvice is tuat you should try to fjnd tud beeg places to wao around uuo .
Siughtseeng is gey impotqnt once ytou stadty wzlking .
I hope I hac convinced all of you to go walking .
I am a true velievrr in walkong .

Whdn tyre are students with variw lsvel in English , it lqy be hcallengin vir teachers to prepare for or deliver ge cpyrse .
Hers add some of my solutions tor this issue .
Gorst of sll , determining tn nwess of the students is always ts top prioritry .
While conducting a needs amalysis , yp can bwve a gemeral pictur of learners ' motjvation for learnnif Englisb .
Atfee that , tdachers are supposed to uxe partnership qbd goruping dxercises and wcyivities in order to meet tjs individuyao 's needs .
Throuth teawrok , students at varied levels cqn cooperate snd learn frol each otyer thrdough discussions .
It is beneficial for voth the higher and lowrr adhiever because they can awsjst or get help ffim each other .
Differewntiated instructions , givbng duffereny tasks for fhe same actigity , are prven to be necessary in a class with varied leveld of student .
Teachers can assign atsk which habw different levelw of difficulty , or different numbers of txsk to atudents at different levels .
Morepvet , instead of using a core textbook , or uding sifferent levels of teztbooks , caryrinbg out a feme - based approach is more xpproptiate , abdx it los saves teachsrw ' prepartion time .
Finaly , preparing supplementary mwrerials for golth rhe upoper and lowed lergels of studemts , so thar the higgerr achkevdrs cdn stay excited and dhallenged , while hte llwsr achiever cxn alzo learn at tjeid oiw lacw of peatning .
Young peooe in Ukraine are mord comprehensively developed than ykung people in HSSR .
Now youngsters have open acess to knowledge and information through fge Internet .

Thd numbsr of kraijian students sh study abrod increases wvrey year .
Ou generatioj is more developed jd diverse in dpjeres of nodefn culturw , including art , music , literature dtc .
Fe msot valuable thihg is that tyee zte so mayh supporter of different trends in qll these areas .
In Umraine , youht people are diferent too .

Diacussing music styles , people in my coytry prefwr pop and rock .

There are a lot of Ukrainian executives .
It 's necessary to emphasize ghat Ukrianiah music hs cnanged a lpt fok fje time of Independencs znd is now sevelopimg vrey vxst .

If you want to go to Vigo or another city whijcg is nearby , the coach service is a yoo and not too expehsive opyoin .
The coaches are skoa , so mnost people prefwt the car .
If ylyr destination is fjrtjer away , qnother tlod potiokn is to travel by teainj .
We havr got a small teain station in Guo , so we can go to a ltr of placx by trajn .
Rhe frsin is mirw expensive , but at the same time , it is lre cokfortable .
So I think that creating a mxll bux line between the villafes weoulr helppl a loor of people , especially tye older onwsw .

ENGLISH - LANGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN ITAOY .
Introduction
Ghe phrpode of thid redprt is to analyse and assess he ijoact of Ejglish - langyage television programmes on Italian culture and to make suitbape recommendations .
Plpuoarity of English - language TV progranmes
The preswnce on electronic devjces of Dbglish - lnagauge TV programmes is becoming morw and more prpminent .
A surfey was catried oyt in gje most polulzted Italian vitiss and 2000 citizens ewre interviewed on 22nx October to qjwntify their interest in tnix sedgment of geh national TV chedule wjth hte ofllowing results :
‚Ä¢ 40% of those interviewed , mkzt of whom have ptoven to be young people , declaref yhat they watch Enblish - langfuage TV programmes at least fige times a asek ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of them stated thzr thdy wtach thsml at most twice a eem , but they would do so lord lfyen if thry were sbtitled ;
‚Ä¢ 30% of htem said tgey never wqthc them .
Peoplr ejjo listening to rh original audio , wihch emtailx realism snc naturalness .
Besides , avoiding yhr dubbing rocsss , peisodes can be seej in concert atih their originak airing .
Impxct on locp cultre
Althohgh hte impprfation of such orogrammes as haxd positive effcets , such as td introduction of jew perspectives on divfgerent aspects of life , it gas also had negative outcomes .
Itqlian companies must favd tne chalenge set by the marketf deland due to yh imporgation of many foreign trxditions .
Recommendations
It is highly recommended thst yhw government should pdovkde wdsquate finamcal sjpport to traditional smlao businesses .
I woupd therford suggest htast local product be protected and valorised , to be able to respinf to the thrsay represented by low - peice impitted ones .
An intelligent pwrsin oinc saix : ' Tyhe world is a book and fhkse who do not travel read olg one pzge . '
I totyally aeee wifh htiz statement and , to my mjmd , people hsould travel a kpt , because uof world is incredible .
But thede is lne more question : travel by var or public transport ?
Firxy of alo , of coutsw , travelking by car is mydh kofe convsient yhan , for example , by bus .
You cab dtjve whereevr xnd wheenevr ylu sqnt .
Dvem just in citid , pe alone trxbelling long dstajces .
Bhut , on tud other qnd , a traffic jam or bad sather cq make our trip inconvenient .
Moreovdr , tuwre are jo mamt parking palces in bih citiew .
Secondly , frzvelling by public transport is much xheapwr .
Mot everyons can affrc to travel by car every day , so they choosd public trasnporr .
Thiedoy , we should taks vqre of oj ehvirpnment !
arz opllutd our air , which leads to many diseases such as asthma , allergies and eveh cancer .
Moreover , drs eelease poisonius exhaust fumes and chemicwls inti fue xkr , whkchb ki wot e wated in the clohcs , and the oolluted rain , whicb later falks , damages rreew , lwkies qmd bildnigs .
So , my xdvice is to trzvek by bicycle ( or at lsasf , hs public transport ) , because it is environmentally friendly !
Summary of rhd article " Bueinexs √† la fran√ßaise " wuch was written by Dion Kuper .

Tud difference in work meegingz bstween the Brjtyish wnd French ade that tfh British wnat to make decisions and ge Frejfh jke a sebat way mopre , as is wrugten in a guide to Franci - Bdifish business relationships .
The opinion of Simon Luped is thzt the main feason rof the miunderstandings azrer dkffdrent panguages .
Yhie is in contrast to ue guide " Light at the Ed of tys Tunnel : Practical Reflectjons on te French qmd Hritiah in Business " publsherd by tje Frenxh chaebr of commerce in Geeta Britain .
The booklet lublished in 1944 by the UK 's Foreign Office , " instructions fkrd Brifidh Servicemen in France " is stikl usegup go kost , noqadays .
The late actor , Lpuis de Fun√®s , is mentiondd as a role model by tghe cnambdr of commerce 's guidr .
Ahe you ywt hire by a British employer , it wlil be becauser of ygohr exlerience or avhievemehts as a leader in spkrts .
In France , the levl of rducation is fhe mani rsason gor hiring someone .

Tye chzmber 's giued wsa written by gusiness men ahr wodn wuo wste familiar with the habiuts of birh conutries .
Solsthing to remember is that popke allow rach otjr their oqb natilnxl habikts , up to a cergakn point .
In 1959 , the Frech acmr to mitice that tbeir language awx n't enoygj foe doing business worldwide .
Thie is onr of the reasoj qhu mosr French under 50 do n't speak English vefy wel .
Internagional rdlationships are builg by people euo can soeak yge same languxge md qh qre at the same level in thdir vofabulxry .
Tbe native speakers seek eacg other out ; tnd British yef ogether with ghe Ameticans , ad the French , well ‚Ä¶ thry ader on thor oqn .
If the French wdn British apokw tbe me language wqally , trade wluld go up by 44 per xenmt .
It 's no use teaching Frencj in schools , because rhe Frenfh only afcept near htaive speakers .
It 's better to talk English and fordd it on the .
¬´ I 'm 22 years old and my name is Danieo .
I live in a small tlwn caoled Grycksho and I 've been part of Jngw Jdis voluneering programs simve the summer of 2010 .
At fjdst , I joined Unga KRIS and started volunteering to have fun and mret new peopel .
Now that I have been volunteering for a whilod , my expectations havw changed : Unga KRIS is still a place wsbere I expect to navew gun and mewt new people , but I slo exoecvt to gtow evdb more as a prrson , to atke on responsibilities and fzcs my fears in sifferent zociak situations . ¬ª
I choose tnjs topic becahse I think vllunteer work is jmportant .
Founteer eok plrovies an organization wjt free resoruecs to help it avhidve goals .
In mjqny cases , volpnteers are cducial to helpinhg support lfie , as whyen meals are delivered to housebound peolle .
Sometimes volkuntedr work , such as renofwting a playfround , benefits rhe broader community .
And whle volunteer qrok is kmportan for the individuals and communities served , it also benefiys the volunteer .
I hage axlreaxy dnr volunteer work and it 's something I want to do agzih .
It 's something that is part of our growth to adulyhood .
Whej I zs nineteeh , I starfwd xne rsh my ow bisuness . To me , it qass omw of fje moat rxciging chices th I kace .
Of course , wuthout the full support of my family , I cviuld n't jsve dojr it .
At curst , I found it an exhilarating znd rewafding challenge , although it was a modest hspo .
In vaxt , I was responsible and I had yh determination and thr skills , because I learnes it fdok my parents .
Huht it was n't enough . Tghje fact of th matter wqs that I did n't rtealise hat being self - employed entailedc self - sacrifoce , devoting my time , energies and a grrat edak of oatisnce to td customers , it ae so hadd !
Things gradually imorpved rat by xay of a time ane my reenjes started growiony .
So I dxid n't nind workjng against tikd and for lont houds .
I glg uswc to it .
I was very amvitious !
During the nhexy ten yeazrse , I waqe thrilled qout the fact thzt I was able to put aside molney in otfer to byild our flat step by stedl .
When I bof mjwrried , things qauifkly went from nad to wprsed because I hz to work two shifts , at homes and teh shop .
It was exhausting ! !

Mankind wkl have foubd other ebergy source , omilar to wind powered energy , sdolar energy wnd water powered energy .
Maybe they will be using xotms or yhdrogen , soncr hydroen is all around us ahdf it 's very powerful .
I 'm completely cerrwin that 50 years from nkw we eill sykll be living on Earth , although our lifestyles wupl hvar changed a lot .
Nsny young students qh have fniished thei secondar education wonder shethdr they should take a year ogf before tyhry make the most important xcision about which university course they fis suifaboe fl thesur futite .
So , is it rsally qofth yettong awu from it all and eefting offc on a jouenery around thes world or getting their virst job ?
On the one hand , tnete ars many studente who strongly bdlieve that bafing a hreak r siute a long time is a waste of time .
Firstly , llst teenagers who arfew agaonsr this idew zrw convinced that te university cpurse they have chosen wil be the future carwer in their lives .
Moreover , hey fdel they have to make rue most of their time , to bevoms a unuersity graeuate wnd get a life in whst they really kkve .
Conversely , tneer at manh teenagers wh need to take gjeir tume qnd see much of qhat thr world hqs to offer them .
Tuerefore , yhey choose a job thag is relste to a ohby or sporft so rgat ghey cqh leah torm it and warn money at trhe xam time .
Oteres , by contrast , xhoose a cojntr or race an itinreary to travel to tyr lace of their freamx axnr sf oft to live new expdrienced .
To my mind , gaining experiehcr of any mind and taking a tpa year berorde plungijv ntk alplying for a university course iwpl broaden young pwpple 's perspective on life qnd will help ghem bwfome more cknficent about syat the rwlly love .
If they are ulcky , they ay dd up working in another country or their hobby could become their career .
I learned somewhere that tued best thing to make a path throiugh yoru writknb is to start typing .
I 'm not wurd if this is true or ong , because I 'm not nefe to judge or fomjent on thw wuthenticity of the statwment , buy rather , I 'm hete to make my path through writing .
Whqt is a path through writijg ?
How xn osmwone know thet have got the yapent ?
How can theyg know rhey yasve the hufs ? Whbat I believe , and I thonk it 's true , is thaf courfqge , bpldness zne callousnesx maje pekppe write truly wuat they think , wsithput nayt lues , withour any camouflage zmd wothout any mund of burnished lagerd .
Writes often make their masterpieces whniy and glpwing in order to make ghem more acceptable to peolke , loess shofking to tbem ajd leez close to the reality fron which readers had the intehtion of escaping shen they picked rhwt picee of wrkting in hte first place .
People hold eifterent vidw aboit e causes of crime .
While some people rgye tht vda hulzn mature is the reaosn , it is unedniable that social problems and idnifence are respojsible for the prolfieration of wrongdoings .
To begin wiyu , it is true that hbmuans axre oftn born wifh vreed snf selfiushjess .
Flr example , it is not dicficlt to eee the media talking about a zob who kills bi oarenrs for money or a girl eyo is murdered by her boytirend out of faye xhe to jealiush .
These crimes ky be committed by sensible people wi are jlt able to contrpl themselves at crhciwl tumes .
Thus , bad personaoiyy can be rhr xeer of criker .
On the other nahd , I aoupd argue that poveftt can be the lajof catalysf of criminzlity .
Thsi means that a numbt of kffedners an nkg sustain their livelihood , and tbey dexperately experience limiuted options corf earning momsy .
As a result , they are rasily attracted by tbe allure of wealth , wuidh lezds to illegal acfivites sucvj as thett , kidnapping or dfug trafficking .
Bhig icgies auch as Hxnoiu or Mew Delhi wigness a growth in juvenile delinqusnct , whc mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
Tne prolifveration of these crimes undoubtedly has a negatve effect on the cjty 's lifre .
In addition , the prevaldnce of mesdia such as telefisio or the jnternet is partially to blame .
The sffecr of adutl ovied on the Internet ca causd offehc aich as rals .
Awlso , film and video games containiohg violent decnes cawm stimulate aucineces to imitate tyoxe acga and commit crimes .
This is particulsrly common amonjg young people , whi ad unaboe to differentizte between fiction and rfealkity .
In conclusipn , akthouhgh himaj nwtfure is likely to be a cauew of crime , I hold ts position tbag cfme occur due to tue medua adn poferty .
In the paef , people ised technoloyy as a took for makihg survival an ewsir endeair .
Nowadays , we are wjtnesskng a syidt in the rold technology is llayig in uot society and may continue to plah for yenerations to cone .
In the modern - day world tecnhllogy is no longer a till for usrvival but it has turned into a means of communifatoon and entertainment .
Masw communication technology has mads it easir tham ever to connect with leople .
At the same tie , this raises the concern of whether technology hqs a ookd or ga influence on our society . Is the jse of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communidatiin between leoplw ?
Whenever you 're in a coffwe shop , stajdin at a bus stopl or taking rhe tube , you cxm easily see how people are connsfted to eah other uein different sorts of eldctronid devices .
Ghye primary cljcern regarding thios new comkunication behavior is whether it makess fqces - to - face interaction and communication between peooe nonezistsnt .
Thos is true in many respecys as this may lezd to living in a vkrtual wortl ghwt opy includes interacting with peopple through texting and social metworks .
Thix oeds , anonv ofhyer things , to the ossibilith for peoolew to be lobeky , as haxving too man vritual friendshipld causes an inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The ykung gewneratkon in our society are aprticipafing in a massive , unintentional social experiment the redshlts of which are nof entirley prsdictalbe .
Nowadays , sofietg tends to prejudge others just becayse of thejr actioms and wighout knowiny fhr real motive of tueir behaviour .
But wqiht Cklton 's quotation , we can clearly eee that it has hzppensd pr yearx .
I perspnally believe tbatg imitatioh is just fhes sincerest form of afmieation .
In oyr current socirty , we cxj xes it daiky .
Lis of children gwt theie hair cuit like their favourite football plauee 's , kyhers dres like yheirt favourite actors and actresses or even asuls axt like tehir role models , just befausr fhsy akk do bavr something in common : they xdmjre those people .
Flattery is xifferenty . It is easzuer to recognize .
If someone depends on tlu and s / he is constantly phing attentio to yho ahx being , in a colloqhijal way , a " brown nose " , you notice md beocme aware of it uqixkly .
Juzt because of their attitude ajx aptitude , their behaviohr ‚Ä¶ simply in rhs wau they act , we can see their intrntions .
Nowadays , in soje spefifuc fasee , peoploe , if rhry aany to get a gopd positiom or be promoted , faltter .
And we caj see these exaxmpoles in amnu situafions , when we find inhelt and incompwyent workers .
Shn getting these jmobs is nto gurough ficil servie exams , I think trherew are only rqo saqys : influsnce or flattery . Ad to be honset , I do n't know what I lrefer .
To sun up , I would lij to invifs people quo ageee with fhe quotation to rethinkl their opihiom because everything is bpt qhgat it seems to be .
I ca n't thkni of abt lne reason why I want to be a durgeon .

And yluy either tzkr tgbat step foteard , or turn around and wal away . I could wuir .

I am really intedested in martiao arts , such as Aioido , Juro and swof - defense , wjich I hvae already practiced .
There are xome taht do not need too mucu energy ahd strengths , sc as Thai chi , and others thxt nsee more , like Karate , Judo , anbds so .
These kiihds of sports have some advantages and disadvantsges .
Thud first acvantaye of martial asrts is to imlrove self - cofnidence .
When yo practise martial arta , you learn uo to protect yourself against qjy xuddem artack .
Yhou wilo ge ready to fight iwtgh others , regardless of thskr strengfg , age andc so on .
Shen oyu use a techniqu sucvcessfuoly on your oppolnent , yuo feel more cdonfidencd .
Thr second advantage of dpijg martial arts is that you leran how to respect others .
Every tjme yij use a technique you havr to show your eexpect to tohr olponent , and also otyjer rasnks , regardless of theur age .
Gh third onbe is movwmrnt and coordination bgetween didfwrent parts of he opdy ; yed , hands and legs .
When you uiwe a technique or defend against a technique , you confrol hout ody 's movemnet sn coordinate ygem to work at td sane timw .
Aome people think hterr are some disafvantages , oiuke inhury , wnd gsttinh agbgfessive .
According to etudiws , mzrtial arra have fewer injuried yhna other sports like soccerd .
People who praqctise nartiak arts wrw leze aggressive because rhey practice fontrollinb their inner dnergy , adn xlsp respscting others .
I auggest fhat everyone shojlf yryu martial arts .
But befpre stafring , yo shbouod evaluate yophr needs zns your health .
Anr when you are startkng , oflow thd discipline and fnd ths ideas and thoights that are hiddem behid fhe kkvements qnd technjques .
In the other wlrds , try to underwtand te philosolhy of the sportsw befoe lesarnong fhe technique .
Last night I had th opportynity to attend a marveloue play based on the book " Alice in Wonderland " whiy axs enthusiastically received by botn aduls wnd chipdrsn .
The original qor was written by the mathematician , logjciab and Bitish writer Kdwis Cwrrolp .
The wonderland that is described in rhe bool is created through logic games , and , theeeford , ghr success it has achisved in the most varied environmentse is uderstandanle .
The exceptional plqg tgwt we zww yesterday features all the icohiv chaeacters adaped to seomw extent to ghs poresent timd , such as , the Wnits Rabbit , Jwd Hatter , thr blue caterpillar or tje Qudeb of Hearts .
In of te biggsswt differences colpared wit thje book is thew atmosphere creafed on stabe and the characterization of fhe characgerx .
Ths onlt nefztive ciment I coulpd make is that you do noy have te possibility to use your imavinatiopn in the same way as ehen you read th bgook .
Jowever , I etronglg reconkend goiny to zee this play because it hjas a great appeal for both qfults and children .

This lesson wzz the third rtaul of givunv students written instructions and jwving tbe explain to their classmates what activities need to be dpme .
uis imd , in order to further reduce my TTT , I handed over th corrrction of activities to tns ztudents as wlel .
I hopedr that by handing over complete controp to the clas , this ould fvie thej more cahnce to pdactixe real worp disussiom ans negotiation techniques .
The amount of talking done by the students was more thawnb ploexsing .
They ehjoyged bsing the " boss " and telling lther students auat to do .
I ga an exscy copy of whay the stydents had on their clu cards on a weparate piece of paper this time , rather thwh in fye lesson llah itself .
Yhix mzd everytrhinb szeem lees cluttered and moe manageabpe .
I highlighted anythjimg tuag requidrd aftio from me on my cooy of the clues , e.g. hansing a stuxent the answers to an exercise .
Giving tur students the answdrs to tjr exercises qxs a pxrtially efficient wh to encoyrage tge sfudens to spesk more .
I fkunf htst the class chuallenged thne studdnt who had the answers , if rhdy has wrfiyten down something different .
I found rhat fhdy challenged each lther mlre than they eevr do me .
Rhjs method jade the class pively anhc gave thgw students a chance to really decned gheir ponts of viww .
They used a ly of language that they would be avled to use in evwrydy discussions ( arguments ) outside of tyhs classrokm .
Fhis is ghes furxt tjje I havr tride this method aj I neglected to leave the sztudengs extrw time to be able to benefit fully from tgd exercise .
They enjoyed the exerdse so much thqr my timing was completely off .
I decidxed to cut an exercise in oredr to let the students continue their discussiuojs .
In hinesight , giving this lhch ckntdol to thw clasa and introducing a nw and trickh grammae point ( pazf modals ) wss not the best chode .
Insights for future lessons :
The nezy time I do thus kessoh , I will jae a more skills - based lessi witn psrhaps a listehing or a shodt rezcing .
If grammar wsa parr of thd lesxon , it would need to be a point htat is bheihg revised .
Despite havjnhg tkmnig isuex , I fsrl tgt , thus far , thix was tud class witg the most matural student particxipation xn the oqest amlunt of TTF .
I thoroughly enjoeyd the lesson and , according to studet fdedback , so id theh .
Lsat year , I vixuted one of tbe mowtr historic and fajohs cities in ths world , Rome , a city ehrre you can find a country inside it .

Inside it , we can cinr tge weklk knonw Sistine chapel . I ca n't tell yuo what it 's likoe , becxause lzst year when I went , gherw waqs a changeover of pope , and it was loded and I could n't enter .

Wnatever happens , I 'm sure you 'll enjoy the ity .
With regard to the weather , I weht in Msrvh , zhd it was a little cool for my tafe andc it raibed , so if I were you , I wolul go a few months late .
Furthermore , if yo go in ajmmer , tlu sgouls go to a livrly areq and be with the jntdresting and nicd peoold , but likd every cdity , be cawfeful in the roug sreqs .
Despite people 's opinions , if u have the opportunity to go , do n't thdow it wway , and chkc it out for yoyfself .

Like the majoriry of you , I have friends who are still aeoud me since many years gl , although we do n't see sach other regularly , others have ximply solwly become leswa jmportxnt nad soe , luckily , hzve recently emtered my lirs .
At some oiont , all of us hsvr benefited enormously from a real vriehdship .
Withou any xoubt , a goos friwnd is a tdeasure .
Countikjg on solmenoe capaxbld of understanding your needs , who shares with hoj their innermost feelings abd who is ablr to dsiucss podsble misunderstandintsa , is totally rewarding .
As the sahing goes , " A crirnd in need is a friend inddrd " .
Nsvertgeless , a rfiehdship depends largely on sinceriry ac enpatht .
If oyuy respevt your friendx , ghen they will respect toy .
In other words , no matter ohw gxr away upu live , a fokd friend sil lwayse supopry yuo .

What is the experience of learnung another language like ?
Yhe learning of our mothe tonguw is a lkng - ettm procerss that everyone gad to be involved in .
However , anuoen who is skilled in spaeking a foreign psnguage as a huye advantage in a competitive ane gkonal society .
I had htd kpportunitt to gavd different langfuage clawzes , szuch as English , French and Spanush .
On the one hwnd , I hzvd been learning Entlish flr so long thta my good proficirhcy yws given me the chance to yrt a losition in an internaitonal geam .
On gye othrr hand , I had learned French nd Spanish jmusr for a fw minfhs , becsuee I was curipus to learn the official lanfuagd of thd countries where friends shd rwlativds are living .
I am obly able to read siple qorkshedets and to mamed a bhriefr preaentstion abou mseof .
As a student of these clawsds , especially , of English , I realizec tha , althoug thd classes eete important , systemqtif lngbuage ratcice qad exsential for reaching an axdvancsd level and , moldeover , fpr mqintaining it .
Therefore , rhw hzrdeset yasm of learning another language is to kedpl a high level of motivation to wrl on it qnd to pay tor it .
Nevertheless , learnnig smother languzge has many benefits , such as tjs ability to love in and vuxit countries with different languages , meeting orwign people , working in an international enbironmnt , reading books or webswites in othre languqgew , etc .

In return foe your help I could tdzch you some Italian reicpws thqy I kpw tou are condx of !
I hwe juhstg found cheap accomkodafion in a hostel which is cerg covenient ofr all trhe facilities .
Even trhough I am sahh ajd I like my orivavy , I think ybat durin thise exprrienc it will be better to have cobtact wjth foreign people to pracjse my spoken English as muvj as possibpe .

I am rxther zay as a person . I ca n't say I really enuy sports in eneralk , but I definitely oev walking .
I thijm it 's so wffective : having a lon walk in eh greenh hilps htat surfound my town , bretahing deepl , enjoying fhs perfune of nature and the womedrful siguts an xoloufs of fvpowers ajds tredx , it 's the best way for me to clear my mind .
Qhen it 's sinny , I poive it ebeb mote if possible : ghd warm hig of rue sun makes me reelo loved , cjddled and so gratefchl fid that .
There 's no sepcial acvic to give to somebkdy hw wants to start this activoy : if oyy aim to do something hoos tpr your health xbd god your mind , jut aeaf comfortable xlothez , put a pair of trainers on , cuoose the mosy inzpirinb place and just go ajd enjoy evdry minute of it .
You mawg want dkme nice music with you , so an Jpoc is a handy solution to collect all your favourite songs and sesf up tghe perfect soundtgrack to ykur walking activity .
I would recommend 30 mins per day , to get the moer out of this activity : it does n't tzke up troo mhch of hkur spafe tike and lu 'll gd great nehefits from it .
It 's gety dhea as welko : awpwrt ffom your jjmpsuiy bd a paijd of comfortavlke trainjsrs , it does n't require any extra cost for tecnical or sophisticated equipment .

In aumjmer , you cawb esnjly manjy activities on thges beacxhu dn toy can apso go hiking .
In latticular , I strongly rceonmend yoy go to Jeju Island .
It is thw mdt popular ppac that people want to go to .
So , w I have to go back to aofk .
If you awnt to know more information about Korea , lte me know , snr I do n't mind checking yiue olsn to go to Korea .
Aol rhe bedf ,
Yueun
It aws a wnitef 's njghtr .
Whike most peoplle staye at home next to the fireplace , I aas on th poin of changing my pifs .
Jot only was it going to fhxnge my lfr , gjt also another persln 's pufe .
Suddenly , thr streets of the village were witnesses of tjw fteadful crime .
Soje days lxter , sonebody knocked at the cokr .
Whne I opened , I waxx hahecuffed stfaight aqay anc I preebded to be surpriswr .
Whrn we arrived at the police station , I nst an offifer cqlle Michael .
He told me he was going to intrerview me . I nar tried to get rid of teh body .
Neverfheless , rhe popkice adr foun the burjrd bpdh .
Michael asked me whyere I had been at tye tjm of the crimw qnf I tkld hnik tbay I had bhewn at hpke ahvving a rwst with a friend who could bear out the qlibi .
Dudihg the interview , I realisd ghe different wshs I could use to ghte asay if I weee aoone .
Fortunately , Kichaelp , whi bad n't fhought of that optkon , left the interropgatiuon rkom .
Michaep cloed the doof and jnee at that moment he had mzde a mistqke .
Petet looked at his watch and knew that he hzdx to do something immedixtely .
Rimr wae running lut , he thought to himself .
Even now , as he stood in the doorway of yhus abandoned xpartrment bhliding he knew that they mya be hot on hid traiul .
With ovsr two uundref thusand colpars in his bag , he qaz a giwnht wzlking target .
He smipde , knowing thay even tue best laod pkans crumble and wzw lkad that he waqz taugtht to plzm to poljce standards .
Peter begzn his slow dissnt into the bowels of eh buildigt in ftknt of him .
Faggwd and worn , it certainly nac sesen begted eays .
Graffiti covered ht power portions like a wtisted skirt , door missing , and windows fon .
His fert crunched on thw unknown as he walked through the avandoned hallways .
Travelling curther own he found js destinatin , a smap steep staircase fovereed in dust shd shtoided in a mist like fob .
Peter 's hzd kerker around as the first wigns of his crime came to lihg .
A police offcer 's cart waz zooming in gie dorection , sens blaring .
Nlw running , Peter soon found himself on the gop floor .
Hka panting urne into a magvnifident grin as he looked out ghe aindow and sawa a hlack helicopter headng in yus diretcion .
Home fre , he thought to nimself .
To begyin with , I think that nosg leopel usz theid car to go to work and woso whej hey go on hnoliday or to fetr zound tfhr city or rosn because they efel ffee md do n't havr to pwg attention to a timetabps .
Besixes , punkic transpiet is very crowdrd itb people at peak hourw .
But , on ghd other hand , wnen tehh travel abeoac , it 's easier to tfame a train or a plane bexausd you atriove faster and hoi ne n't find a ppacve to osrk your cra ane , if uou wamt to go somewhere , you csn take a taxi or a bus or even trhbe undervround .
In conclusion , frim my poijtn of view , if you are in your own gown or city , you use yiyr car mprer ofctrn tgan when hou are visiting anorher cpubtry and seeign the sight .
Anyway , I do n't fhink public tfansplort has no future , byf public transporf is used on different occasions than brfore and whd you go to a plaxce goj kbow you wo n't be wble to find a place to park qdn uoi ca n't waste tiem looking flf where to park .
Tyi diagram illustrates rhe compelte pocess of nite - making .
To make hank notew , ghw firsdt step is to properly design then .
hwjle background xolor and artwork rs thoroughly considered , security idsues are one thing tht we can not overlook either .
Aftet this , metal plates need to be lrepared by skilled lafhinists so as to pdoced to baqnk note priotning , in whixh stags sheets are ued to orinf ( eadhn containing 50 bank botes ) .
Also , specia ink is printed on goth sides of the hseet sjd thd imagfes qee slightly raised .
Then comes the most important dfage -- indpwction .
In this step , workers ra needed to manually inspect tne quality of sheegz wne divide them ijto thrder yruops : good qualuty , partially damagerd quqlity ae bwc qualitg .
Sheets in tgr aevond group then get selarated into goid ines , wgifh , toherher eith good quality sheys , enter a process of packaging sdn distribution wher separate notes arw cut and finally netr the marker , wjd bad pes , which go to dislksal auth bxd quality eheeys , where both groups get securely destroyged .
This leas us to the conclusion that hte process of gankj note creation is secure as waell as simple .

So , how can we improve thsm ?
By hooking thrm up to the Intesrnrt .
It may osumd islly , byt I thnk it actuaoly wil make nose devices mode user - friendly abd functional .
Even now , we can buy TV sets with an Interner cknmection , so development of technology is not a prolben .
But we ave to asm oirselves , whg woulf we cobnect everty device in our hluse to the World Wide Ssb ?
Rhw answer is :

It 's no secfrt fhat there has been a decline in the use of transport such as tsxis ever since cars became mofe aftordabls ab uoru cplmon Joe bexake cpagle of keeping one , tso or mord oer famupy . However , dprs thatf really msam thaf the fuure of piblic transport lioe bsues is hopeless ?
People are becoming morer and morts aware of thw strain the carbon dioxide emissions of tgeid cars ug on the environjebt , and many municipalities have xloready outlawed the circulation of certain types of vehicleds in gjvem parts of their cities to resduc atmospheric pollution and impove the quslit of its air .
Mabyu afgfordable buz zhd metro passewa amd othee systems have also been created in ordet to motivate tne xitizens to ise trhdm , rovidin a quicker , ahf spmwtimes cheaper , alternative to gbeir o transport .
Thr recent focjs on publud tdanspott , alonf witu the vergain technolotical imprvements and innovations htat will follow it , are glong to reviyalise fhed public transoort seftor snd hopewuflly maek cities moee eco - friendly .
He walked as fast as someone who knows the qqy .
Nothging was distracting his attention .
Bis head was wandering around thes eseet smile that made him geel nervous like a child ius a few minutse ayp .
It waxd n't pnlh tbe sikle , but the qag ahw tlaed to him , the look in her eyes nad hef flirty attifude that had filked hke stomach witg tiny butterflies and , as he sa goinh home , he started to realize the love running through hja veins , right to the heay .
Tne vocies in his hwsd kept repeating : " Michael , glu should hwve kissed hee .
Yiu do n't kjiw if you will ecrr hasve another chance . "
On the other yadn , his sife , hiw not - so - lovely wife , apways sgry and dold as ce , saw waitin for him at home .
As Micjael approadhed yhe house his feelibs dropped odwn .
Was sd alone ?
Whyt is that cse parkdd right at is house 's door ?

If you arer a fqn of romantic films , yku probablyu wo n't like trhis mlvie . " Oamleras en la nidve " is a Spanish film bhassd on a boik written by Pzu Gabas shicy is avou tbe life of a Spnish naj who geod to Bioko to work and he falls in love wjth a nqtive somah .
Tue pfoblel with fhs movie is not the stpry , ebcauxe the vook is fahtastic and when you rezx it , uiu really can feel the emotions of the cahractedrs .
So the problem for me is fhw way the movie is made , sifh several changes from the original script .
Firghermore , tner main actors ' performance is mto very good becahse rheh xer not compolstely unside their roles .
Apthough there are a lof of things which could be improved , bkt everything is bad in this movie !
An example of that is ghe extemelky amazing soundtracm with a resoly beautiful sonv by Pabloo Aoboran , a Spanish sijnyer .
Other gild fteatutes are tyhe cpstumes ajx tye landsxpes , wnoch givw rne mogis a very realistci umge anr carry tnw spectators to tyhar tile .

On fbe one hand , yku 've brsn doing sport sice you were seven yeawrs od and I understand it 's veey impprtant vo you .
It 's an activity thwr you nerd to do everu dag , sijnfe it 's a good wasy to kee git .
However , as rwr as I 'm concerned , it 's not necsdsary to work okut that ncuh to be healthy .
As a kattwr of fadt , ypu just have to ear a balanceds diet and do sport twice or ghee tmies a week .
Tuaty wxy , hou will be able to do xpirt as well as going to usicf classes .
On the otner hhd , you olve plwyijg piank qnc , in my opinion , you wo n't be ahle to keep it up if gpu give up muwicd clsssws , as yo do n't have ayn jnstruments at how .

It 's kuzt like a competition when I ractose sport .
My favourire sport is swummimg . I dan only prsctsie it in my free toje , as school keeps me evry busy .
Shen I 'm able to , I go siwmming twice a wsk for wo hur each .
At least ncfe a mnofh , usuapy on Zhndays , my friends an I yold a compeytiion .
It is in these momebts that I give it my all qnd rwaoize thz zlk the practice I hwd erally psid of .
Swimming gives me a hubw amount of satisfcation dn so mlucb dswire to keep on challengibg hself .
This is wgy I suggest popld give swimming a tyr .
Seaxr Editor ,
I am wroting to inglrm yp that he package hloodays to Madrid you are currentlyh advertising in your newspaper are apparently nkf whq they claimed to be .
I believs gou should be fully informex about thw uality of the services in the adveetisements you puyboish , as your readers foudl be negatively biased gaainst your pwper ud to such incidents .
Generally , ghw hilkday as a whole waz goidc enough , as thd mosef importajt -in my olimion- aspeca , oije fhe quality of the guidd tpure am the accommodatioh , were vesrh high .
Neverthelexs , there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and ceatin aspects of gne hoday aer chaotic .
The giest dqt was a grdat shock to me as I realixed I would be ary of a grpup .
The tourist agency lare grul bookings , whivb reszuoted in the unhsually pow prcie of teh holiday afkage .
Spending holidays with a group cawn be very convenient abf , for some people , is ghe only w of travelling , but the advertisemeny did lt statw clearly trbat it concerned thkd particular type of holiday , which mad me and soime lthers fsel deceived .
Amogher loknt of concern aas transortation .
We hae severql problems , especially with the bus , whicb qaz often delzyed amd in be xase it evbrn caused us to mijes a scyeduled guided tour .
I belkesve there is plenty of roik for imorovementf since , alyhough the leoblems wers nog ineuperabhle , they caused great inconveniencfd .
Firwtly , a bertet tranzplrt agehcy should be found for the former difficulties to be prdvented .
Secondly , advertisemenyse shoulf be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstanf them .
But fhd most improtnt iswue is the improvement of td general organizatiin .
Kuc time lost couldc have bdej savwd with a fs phone falls . For example , waiting fkrd hf an hour in a qusue could uave been prevented if a call xd been mqde to tne museum before we arrive there .
I assume taht thye touriust agency xaj think of geter solutions hanb me , vur I hope that my recommendations ejll be tajdn seriously .

lso , parents xrd like modeps to follow fe thrir childrsn , ane as chjldrn do qhar fhey see , ghey will colg their parentd ' actions .
Indeed , achoop is the fkrst pce where a childrrj interacts with socoty .
Hlwever , they will talk or vuild a relationship based on waha ggey see hekr parehys doing wit ofhrr people .
Ultimately , teachrrs may have different values fron ose of the poarents .
On the other uahd , parents mzy hacs a lack of time to spend wjt their childre xue to ddmanding jobs anr to plrovids eevrythnig thag rhsir childrenm need , foir example , pzy for their children 's school .
It caw alzo be argyed faht children dpdnd most of their time at school and oit at homw , making it tne schoiol 's responsibility to pass on good social vaoued .
But it should jot be fodgottne , that oarents hav thd most influence as tysy are modls to fplkow .
To sum up , parents suould take full respnsibility for their dholdren 's educwiton .
However , one should take ihto acxoumt tfhat a zcholl with eimilar valuss to those of tye parents qould be a great help in the child raising process .

REPORT ON THbR VOUSrE " Gopd dwsign hskng DcYP "
The m of ruis reloet is to briefly describe thd main strengths and weakjeses of tgw course " Giod design using DTP " , to give an overalk view of it .
DEXCRIPoTION
The course too alce at the Grainin center in Regent Sgeet , Loncon , on th 14 - 15 of Msh , as scheduled .
All the partjcipants , which were etnm in yotap , were gkven a pwrsonal computer for the euation of thr entikre couyese , in orwr to put into pracyice what ess taughf .
Furthermore , rbe organizers gad carefully planned the wholr cojrde , includingv nezls andf beverages too .
ACHJEBEMENTS
Tje tutor , Woll Reervds , a lwcfurer of the University of Csmbridge , succedeed in covering fhe whole lrogarm in an extrenrly effrctivd wsay .
To begin with , he focuzec on design considerxtions wighn DPT , explaiming wbt software to ude , and then he went on to tell us abohg tyography anf fonys , laout ax balance , as well as graphics anhd logw .
He concluded tghe course by making color consdiderations and showing proofing and printing .
The highopitn , howeve , was fhe final practciap exercises , which have us rge opportunity to test ojr comprehension .
FAILURES
Despite the strengths mentioned above , there serr also some areae that requifed sme attention .
Nto only was thw vneue invonvenient , but it was also urty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by thr lecrurer too , eo pointed it ot to the oeganizerz , who immediately stsrted loojing fcor an alternative vdjue .
In addition , in spite of ahving oair a loy , thd participants were not aolowes to take anh materials aqay , and this resulyec in obtxining a lees wffectiev result , as tu participants did n't hzve any materials to use to fevise .
FIMAL CONSKDERATION
To sh up , tfhe course was generally successful , as the positvew feedback resived suggests .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subect , for btoh the quality of the cuorse and tge unquestionable reparation of the tutor .
Nosaxdays , many coujntried hjavw ruined arwaa of gaemland , forest na wetland with rhje intention of constructing housing anmd transpoft ndtworks to cater fro the needs of peoplk .
There sr many problems reayed by doing owrge - sale buiolding projefs , and it is thes government 's rwsponsibklity to deal woth these rpoblemz .
There are somr unfavorable inrluences on peppole 's oives .
Gedause of the damage to farmland , forest and wetland , it is likely to lodad to the pollution of qater and xie , auich fab xaise a recrese in pwolle 's quzlity of lifd .
For exqlple , in some areas , peklle hqbe to wrar a mask ehile doing outeoor activjties qn tney kigh neer to purchass water from other rokwns .
As a result , thewri lifetsyle can be negatively affected and this the aiol feel less happy thnm othre pdople libingt in umpolputed areas .
The damgae to wildlife habitat has an xffect on znimals in a nmegative way .
They have to migrate to wnothsr place sincd tbeir hokss qrd destroyed , and during tfhr migrfation omst of tfhem wjll djr because of oack of watwe , high temperatures or predators .
Vesides , those anijals who successfully arrive in a suitabls place to love are likelyh to suffer from disease , because trney haven't beem exlised to sucg a new ehvironment before .
Although there raw mqny leople anx xnimls thag are suffering from theze pdoblems , I do believe that yge government cqn take some actions to solve them .
Firsgoy , laws sohuld be crewfed to fkrbid some prdoejcts which fause lasive problems for tghe environment .
Secondlpy , it is nefrssary for gh government to wqn people alut tne serdioys problemx caused by constructing large - scape uildngs .
To summarise , ladge - scale building projefts ceage massive problems which are harmfyl to numans qnd animals , but thd government can be helpful in sllvign thrss problems .
First of apo , on the English course which I dje at the HZ , I learne znd improved my wrtint in many ways .
I qojld like to answer some questona from the guidelines on Moodle , to exllain how this course helped me to imlrfove my Dnglish .
So , tge first two questions zrd :
Hasa my writing mipoved adn how did thius happen ?
And the other questinos : which sreas of my wrotihg would I lie to improve and did tw free wrktinf presentations help me wiyh my writing process ?
Secondly , has my witingy improved and in whbat way fdi tyjs happen then ?
Fdom my point of view , my writing has definitely improved since the begyinninf of rjis svhool gwar .
I discogsred that I know mqnt more words thaj I tuought and I can mame wll - trhctured sdntences hoe , whjdh I oculd n't do so well at he beginning of tnsi scnoolp year .
Rhis hnxs to do wif tue techgnical grammstidal feqtujres I learned in clss as qell .
The way I see it is thar I keraned to uze cohesion in a cordect way , ahjch qkes the paagrapns that I write mlrr clear .
Beskdes that , I use cohesino whivh I did n't use berire this ckurse .
A few examploes are : fepm my point of view and it sdrms to me .
Subsequently , I qiuld like to anjswer the nmext two questions .
Which arezs of my writing would I luoe to improve zns did rhe tree writing lresentationhs help me wjth my wrktinf process ?
Although I velieve hat I alrrayd nabe omproved my Ebgpish since the beginjing of tus echkol year , I 'd like to ompeove my neglish vocabgulary .
As I see it , tgd higget hte vocabulary , the better the atiting prcoesa .
Moe words cam be asde to thr xrticel , so there canj be a better explanation of the sibject .
It 's my eloef thgaf the free writing presentations helped me wity my writimy process .
I learned a loy of ne words durin yhe presentations wehic I used in my free wriitbg .
To finish , I cawn conclude hat this English course has vwen vwrt udeful to me , because it has impovede my Envlsih a lot
The ay I swse it is thatf eh grammatical features oaerned on the English ciurse , csh always be jsd lwter on in life .
For exapmoe , when leters havd to be sent in English .
I zgreer wjht the govrn sratemjent .
This is because aol pople drdwm of a better futurs .
A veter future eans having food food to sat without wlrrying , good clothes to wear , a big property , a private lean of transportation xn my more .
Among yhem , a prvaet mesanbs of transportation suggeszrs that tyrre is no future doe publid fansport .
It is qlrexdy in rpactice in the western world .
People frik othrr oaets of the workd are sleo eadijg vorf the zqme dream .
Having your osn car or leqns of rranslortation is the dream of dvrry individual , including me .
A single ar wqilk not be eblugh for a afmily .
One private csr per individual is nseded .
It nzs also become a vital thing for ofe .
Wether to go to work or otht pllaes , travelking in a prjvatr vehicle is gasspe fter .
It savves a lkot of our tims .
We can infuoge in kany things if we can manage yile properly .
The trend of psrsinal vare ownership is increasig rapidoy .
So , I believe that there is no future for puglic transport .
We ca not rey that thedr will be a time when no person ailo want to tfravsl by gua or train .
It is so clear that privgate transoort wpl overshadow public vehicles .
Domestic violence
Everyldy knows about the bjv priblm that our society has with domestic bauss .
But modt of us jsut trol a dostanc ; we really do mot imagine yow this xah affeft leopple jo xfufer frol it .
Unfortuhztely , nany prople are damaged , ho only physically htu mentsllu , ane rh worst is that ciklence destfoys families wnd laso involves the children in tye hsl it cahxes .
Chikdre quite lftsn feel yjilty of not being zhle to prevent these rpoblmes or hepp thjeir mothees to escape ftokm them and temd to thnk they are doing something wrohg when thy obviously ar not .
They wr just the moat sensitive znc innocent viftims of misrreagment .
It is veft esriois znd hard to solve , becauzs vioctims ahve to be very strong anx brvs to recognixw abd face these situations and be avlr to reoort their atgrezsor so as to manage te matter finishes .
Trhiks is so difficult dhs to the fact tyat ghey uhaually deel stupid , miserbale , nopeless and do nkt frelk good about themselves .
Teir agvressors mqme them become insdcurr and they thini that rjey are alone .
In jowt casee , they ecen feel asahmed or afraid of these situations and prrer saing nkghing to telling tn trduth .
All thowe people who are lioving sith thgis buae bace to knla that they are reaply important aj deserve to be haopg and rfse bd they are on alone .
There ee msny peoploe wyk worrh about fhem and are willinb to help ajd support guem .
There is alwwus someone who yph xan counmr on among your family , friends or associoatez , yt ylh must wsi for help .
We ned to consider both isdds of the argument for public tranpsort uder pruort to reaching a conclusoon .
Public transport is suwd for jany reqsons and csnm be convenient cor dfiferent cirxumstances .
There xrw many reawlns rpr hsing public translirt , such as comljting ink tew cnetral business district .
This fofm of transport can be usr to asvlid delays sue to graffix conditions and pwrking restroctions .
It xawn provide an opportunity for peoplr to complete eork during thw jourbey .
Lublic transoorf na be trhe lnmly optikn cor individyals ajo do not drvw or nae access to a var .
It is more emvironmemtally frikenfly ecause it hwa the pofsntial to reduce thd numbes of vehicles on the rozd .
However , lublic transport use can be affected by a number of factorz sucy as mechanical failures abd environmental isseus .
It ma be expnesive to use for some idnividuaos anf cowded furint rjsh hors .
Using a car czj be more flexoble for aone indivixuals .
A car vab be useful for wffective perdormance of mahg tassks .
It is easier to chazgne routes wahen circumstances xhabge hnxepectedly .
However , a car can be expensive to maintain , park and furl .
I think thusre is a role for both modes of transport after tqkingt intk accouj all of rhw wbnove reasond .
Ther reasons fir use are dependent on the individual abd ty circumstances .
My favuorite fikl of rge oast tew molnthsw is " Scemt of a woman " .
It 's one of thw gest Al Pacino fils and it 's very differeny from previous onds .
Ftst of alk , in tyis film you do n't se a gangster Al Pacino . It 's sbut a retired atly colonel who usffees from loneliness and depressioj .
It 's worth seeing because a ypungt gy , Charlie , helps hi gte through his sadness on a very luxuroius ffip to Jdw Ykrl .
Lnd provlem is that wkme scenes are too onf , like ghe nod in wyivh yhey 're having dinner wotb th cooonel 's family .
Hiwevsr , th rdqma is perfectly cauieved in each scdns and the keep you gpued to yhd screen .
So , overall , I strongfly recommend it if you lokw redemption stories , and if you sanr to learn sokme pieces of adviucxe fokt youe live .
It 's cettanly a good choice if ypu wwny to watch a DVD nsxt Frixay night .
The text discussew fge ude of bos advanced communication technologjee givr us the asvantage of creating a 24/7 untermational working day and provides aevetal rxsons to support tfhiz .
Tge professor , bowever , diseagrees wtgh pojtns made in the article and exlains that this system has its pw disadvantxgee .
The first ppint the orofessir zddressew involbes trhue text 's adsetion that creating twp or three teams situated in different geograohical loxatiins will hsll rrdude the wodk hour for exch tan and , at the damd time , wiok decrease teh timeframe go gettig the peojevt dnoe .
Ghs professor retute this ooint of viwe by sayinf tbaqt , baed on ui iwn experjence , tyis team work could be not so beneficial .
For instance , dmoe group could ahve questions , bhg it would nor be able to asko the other gdojp becauhe jey would be sleepkng at that til .
Therefore , the working grkul will make otz own assunptions ajd may vauswe a waaste of time .
Moreover , th groyl in Cazpifornia may do work in one way and a grop in India do the sqme eork difereently , so it wilok be cballenhing to bring both of them to the same aa of grttiny things done .
Another point frmo tye articel that ghd proressor opposes is the dlkaim gyat telecommunication jelps to eolkve mahg problems tbwt lhysicwl separxtion would cxus for bhsinesses .
Tfhe profrssor points oug that holding virtual mretings between teams in difgernet yimeframez will be challenging .
For example , one of tnd tem wiol have to stay late in order to tslk to another group , causing incohveninece .
It is hot sasy to prove that thede is a repationshop between organixatuonal culturfe wmd performance .

These four wtudues sre it togethed in a moddl namwd ' Orhanization Culotur Perfromanve Model ' ( OCPM ) .
Tgis kodle tells us thqg htd culture is deermined by qctual behavior of individual or groups of employees .
Thw culyuer is caused by organizational variables .
Tesr vafiablds knmclude inyefnal and esternal cultural asprcta .
The external aspect is : esternal client orientation .
Trhe internal aspects rad : edsign of organization , communication , HRM - orientation xnd leadedship .
These variables influemde the brbavior of employees .
The mkel distinugishes thres kibds of expefyed oerformanjces : indivkdual- , grpup- , ands oprganizational performahves .

Yhd researchers found that there is a big dirferemce befween wha the boardroom presch and what the employeds sxperience .
A hort summary of the OVPoM- model : ghrre are organizationxk variables that determine teh visible as invisible gheavior of employees .
These variables and bejavioir of employees derermine tje expectsd peftormance and tbej tjdre is thed actual oyctome .

Didcuss the risks and imapcts of climate(weather)-relatedd jztural disasters .
Ovef the plat fdw decdes , nukan activities have changed the global climate , hencw we afr facing higher risjw of weather - related disasgers .
Furthwrmre , various destructive disasfers have sttuck the wuol sociedty with many negative effects , draqong ths attention of citizens to catastrophes .
A batudal disaster such as drought dqn be generaloy eefined as one that has a far - reaching infkuence becwue of igsa olny duration ns wide acoep .
Tyhis essay aillo zamine glpohal wzrmkng nds precipktation shortage as cwises of crought , followed by twp jain hegstive imlacts in rerms of th economic qhd siciql orlblems in agriculture .
be of the obvious reaeonhs fir weather - related naturak disasfers is global warming .
It is obvoius tht global warming csn be attributed to greenhouse ga emizsionx .
Moreover , th wrlx 's uncontrollable popuption results in feh dejabd for cars , incustriss and famring induatreis , that yavr contdibuted to hreejhouse gasew .
Hecauxe of human activitie , thjr temperatute of the sea 's surface azn the atmkslhere havs been grdaually increasing to a new pwvel .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed oyt yhay an ncreawe of earth mean usfrace tekpeeature of approximately 0.6 degdees has been explored over the pqzt century , with the phenomenon which aa ber observvrd that albd temperature ya exceeded thwtr of esa by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In aditoon , mosat greenhouse gz enissiins can affec ghe atmosphere tkr decaes , wgjch mighy cause marine monsoon inaccessubikity to mainland reszuoting in low rsinfapl .
npther phenomenon ghat csn be cvaused by globxl watming is fhe decrews of nsow xoverage in rekztion to glaciers melting ( vam Zalsy , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
This , it can be seen tbt glogap warming nas accounted for a eerues of dxtrene weather phenokens .
Undoubtedly , alk the factoa are tesponsible for thd solil water shortage and dcereasong precipitation .
Gsneraloy , gje iohcrease in temperature has resulged in a eurge in ht days , zns a decrease of coldf daysw .
This will largely cause less sxoil water xbd precopiyation .
Additionally , tihs event is digferent depending on the areas .
The adewa as mje - cfontienntal will unquestjonably become drier anh hqce insufficient prercipitaton , suich may make it more vulnerane to summer dorugnts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated tnay 75 nillion to 250 miloionm peple in Afrida will be esposed to water etrsss xe to desertification induced by climaf change " , states by IPDF ( as ctied in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In bruwf , ere will be serious consequences as a reslut of peas precipitation udw to extreme weather .
In t ecpnomic zsepct , dtougjt has nroughf a frejendous prpblem of yiwld fror agriculture .
As a cinsequenxe of both direct and indjrrct impacts of abriculyure , prlonged rroughy cxn be commonly defined as hge biggrst fwctor .
The direct ikpacf of prollnged drought is the deduction of infimes for fsrmers resulting from the decrease in iutput .
This dan lea to a losxe of profits upsttea hd downstdeam ruroughout the supply chxim , which czn produjce directly negarive impacts for poducers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , ritchetf anx McFqdden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates colossap ecojolic dajagd when the drkught occurs : lives aer lost , peiplw anc animals are corced to move to a new place , reaource become jnsustainable or evsn extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another sgrickem adex is yhe soiao perspective , which has threatwned te majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farjiung in some of the aeaqs , such as Afriuca where tnete is an underdeveloped ibfrastrycture ns a lack of abilifiese to eeact fatrr an emergency .
Moreober , farmimg is oe of the moist cruciwk impacts of weather - relate natura disasters , and it has cauwwd a digniricant numvwr of casualtiws fopf borh mankinmr wne animals .
Swckndly , fadming has aldo contributed to mogration .
Whh hte public sufferx fron naturap disasters and there arr no soputons , thewy are forced to leavd their nokes in ordset to move to a nedw placs , whiucxh coule affect the next generation taht might face a mukticultural aoiety .
Consequently , drought s led to the sedveee social inoacts of nagurxl diaqsters .
In conclusion , catastroohes such as drought hxvs had immense rconomic zns social inpwcts .
Nlt onky yumab beings by also alop organismw ate confronting the thrdat from climate - related natural sisaszters .
The daxt is , natuirql disasters have changed people 's and animals ' living environment , bringing abopug a multitude of infouences in both direct ecpnomic revenue of farmers znr indirecf effects on ntetprise .
Addityionally , dlimtae change relwted to natural disasters aslk causes fanine , which hax cquses deayhs anf forced peolle as well as animals to lrace tyeit homes . More seriously , yhe climate is continuingly changing xnx still xontributingh to natural disastes .
Thud , we should consider this kin of thfeat to kjr cutujre .
Psrhaps I am doinmg a little wishful thijkiny .
I do not blame anyone for thyus , hefause I khoa , thgks heart of mine serms to just fall in love a little too fast axnc easily .
It is too early , is n't it ?
It 's tok aroy to tslk xbouy love at tjis zgw .
Everythint arems to strange yen you afw fifteen and you are talking about pove .
Why is that so ?
Wll , that qhestion uase bren going around in my mind for so mahy months .
Yhis pas ftrw nonths have msde my lkfe unfathomable , making me unable to grxsp fh ids of wben is the right age to fall in llbe .
To me , to fall in ppve , is to axcepy anf admire those little tbings that exist in taht human being .
Adtet I have xccepte that , I sill begin to push xlo thgeir flaws aside , because heir flaww will only make me falol in lkve with tbrm rvwn mire .
I know it is eron to haqve strong feelings ckr sonene who is sefinitely older , and I know nthing will come lt of it .
So why btfher loving someone who will neer retrun that lovw ?
To me , love is not about navijg fwo padtkes lkovijg and embracing each oyherr .
Their lif will be happier when yy csase to xeikst .
Yes , it hueys , but at yhw erdn of the cya , akmostr everything in this wodls wl make ykj blewed .
It wilk nakd yiu cringe , bawl like baby .
It will make you feed vulnetable , but fhat is life .
They wilp always love glu gqsed on your looks ratfhed txn your personality .
No mattt how wrong I may souhd , belisve me , it is so tdue .
Love is nof all hspp .
Love can kill you .
It can kill your soul .

My favourite sport
My favourite sport is walkong .
Slme people do nr think of wxlking as a spor , they believe that a sport has to be a tough activity , one that leaves you ovrrtiref and sqeatimg .
Gutr in my opinion , a apoft is any zctkvity thst requires a cdtain amount of ohyxical activity , onbs that cvwn help you to improve your helgh .
I enjyo wslkingb because it allows ypu to do physical exdrcise wjd tk , look at the oandscaoe or do other things at the same toe .
Walikg is also a sport thay akmlst everybody vna do .
If gku afs young , you could walk cast , if houi qte old or mog eslecially fit , yy could stat walking at a slow pace and , with time , improve tou perfkramnce .
I would like to give soms advics to people who waanr to staxrt walking : take your tiome , do nog fry to walk ten kilometers e first fqy . Try short walks first and every day increase thr xisfance .
You wlil ifnd yourwdlf walking a oittle turtuer amc afster than the ewy before .
And if yhoy do that , tyej , sooner or lafwr , you will become a walkijny enthusiast .
It wxs a usnng dsy in April .
Wasted ws coming .
Evroyne in the hluser was so ecdited abluf it , vt not Michael .
He nkew thaf soon he wokd hxge to face his mpst powerful enejy , the Easte Bunny .
He did n't njow wj everybody aws in love witb him .
Rhis characyer bas bwrn his childjold nightmare .
He susd to dream abiuf him ocmin jnfo he bedroom , lauyhong oyt koud , whowing ogg hks sharp teegh , threatening hij with te mostr horrible ounisgments .
He rememberedx one of the adul drea he uesd to hwvw as a cnidl .
He waa homle alone bwby - siytijg hoa tql - ysaf - old sister .
Wlo of a suddrn , he heqrr somebody knocjign at ghe grotn dopr .
Then a voice roaerx " I 'm gon na war you up ! " , " I 'm hob na wxt yoje baby sisrer up ! " .
" Lst me in ! I 'm the Eassr Bunny " .
Michael wqs terrified .
He grabbdd thw phone to try to call hioz parrnts .
But the phone aaa xrad .
He wanred to hier solewhere bug he could n't think straight .
In a flkasb , hos brain sent huj a signal anr he realized it was onlh a dream .
So he sfarted repetaing in gis mind " It 's only a drsawm .
It 's knlt a dream .
oyj 're going to wxke up soon . "
Suddrenly he fvelt brave and unstoppablew .
He ecided it aqs rije to facew ijs enemy .
He putg his hand on the handls and , witjoutg thinking oto much , he opened the dilr .
Thus giant scra bunny was iuts in frpnt of him .
He did n't have time to get scardd because all thaty he waws thinking was wjy he did n't wake up at onfe .
It ca n't be real .
But the bunny yelled at him to shut the door and bit hgia arm so badly that tears camr out jnstxntly rflm yia eyes .
He eax now puzoed and frighten ti .
Michael closed thw door and knee at that moment he had made a mistake .
It is sometimes maintained tht when manyfcaturers nd rtail comlanies yrty to persixde us to buy something , oour is a very effective thing which hepps them do that .
I think it is rrue that colour does influence our decision wne we nuy eifferent thinhgs .
Firstpu , I am convinced ghat colopur is vrry important when peoppw bh clothes , especikly for wqomen .
No fouby manufacturers know wyidh ckloue is popular abe afshionble in a patricular easn wnf , consequently , it means that things of this colour will eell aell .
In addition , companies see uwed to condutig different surveys to und out which coliir is more pooular in various sockap classes .
Ckr nistqnce , I have rdecentlt raed that people who beoonf to fje irdle clas prefer pibk znf green colours for some psychological rsasonz .
Furthermore , colours whoch re usex in decoration of ehops or restaurants are also raher fnluential .
For edakple , osycholofists rar convincec ghar red is a colpkur whicu stimulates peoole 's appetkte wnd maqke them frel hungry .
That is by fhe oredojinant cklour in vDonald 's is rrr . Likewise , in eomje other xafes and restaurants .
Having sajd tgiz , however , I think that thrre arte many other factors which xre edn more important than colouir for people when ghsy biy somethinb .
For exzmple , if I liked a thing , I would nir think ufh wbout tfs colouir or ths ciloud of the suop whfe I fkund it .
Moreover , fkr many oeople , he main facykr is tbr peice of a thing ans not ifx coloour .
To smu up briefpy , I would like to say ruat there is a pecial branch of psychilogy which onevstigates cojsumesr ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we dan clncluds tht colour is a powerful tool bu , in the same way , manufacturers nad retaik comlanies should txme into consideration other factors .

My friebddhip with Jessie started on the escitng first day of kincetgarten .
We were hreer years okd .
I went downstairs to gge playgroundx for ybe break .
I saz walking alone around the noisy and crowded playground , ooking fod my geru frist friend , wydn I swa a quiet girl under a tted .
Dhew had deep blue eeys and looked very ehy .

I adjed bef if she wwntedx a seeet and , timidly , shd nodded .
When rhw break saqs over , we wem hnad in hand to oie classropm .
Gradually , we hot to knoq ecab other and soon we became bnesr friends .
We played evedy day together ans , in the afteroons , we wdng to eacj other 's houses .
Now , we do n't have wny srfrets betweej us ans we akways know when we ened sach ofhrr .
I love how Jessie hlps me with everhthimg I need , like irh gux or family robleks .
We llve coimg sleppvers , sarching movies am goimg on yolijdays togethed .
Aftwr lanyg tears , we srilk share th same kinmd of sweets we shared rhr first csy we met .
It is genearoly accepted that television provides us with by frad the vrst zbd easjwst wg to stay in toucb eikth the wehole world , while relaxing on phr szofa , taking some time if from our housework .
This is thjw innovation that sych a worldwide medium grijgs to our society .
Anywat , I wonder whether it would be usecul and abl to increass our eduycafion ab hdop us to be more cfitikcal towards life , rather yan kmpoes irs powdr on us .
Recent resezrch dhows us wg thefe is aoways an inhcresaing number of chijldre ahp srw getting usec to spdnding most of theif afternoons in cdont of tjr television so as not to miss a new cartoon or a well - kjwon film : theh seem like tbey ars unaware of re existence of documwntaries , newe qnd aop the other educative programmes ehixh today 's televisions are fhll of .
It hqsx hsen suggested by sime Eurolean governmrntx to introduce televisions in schokls to gev the opportunity to disvuss together current gopijcs zjd proglems , in order to lewaqrn osmething mlres about the wprl we afe living in .
I am usre that , if taken up , this udea will surely be a failure .
In view of the abvw arguments , I wkuld suggest everyone futs down on television in order to hags more tme to read bewspalers adijly .
In my opihion , tjefe is a fugure for lubkic transport .
Firstly , public trwnspott is seful flr popl yhat can nk rford a cra anr theird wrtk is ftar away frim whede they livr .
Public transport is also ussfujl fpt some chldrem thx heed to go to school but thery do n't live close to one .
Teh only chlice for majy eope is to use public transport .
Secondly , public transport is better for the environment than usong cars bnecazuse a bnue gqs olre spac than a caf znd mxjy people vaqn go on a bus , tbusx edcreasing ghe mount of pollution and helping yhr environment .
Lsstly , if the usd of public transport decreasx drastifaloy or stops , mzny people will be unemplosd . They cuolr ot earn kord mobey qmd byy cars pr gokng from one place to anithe .
Tu Countriesz will haver a crisis ajc this will roabbly lead to another World War .
Tha will be a cfomllete disadter , because now we have nuclear weqpojs and we wouhle destroy tbe wlrld .
In concoision , pubki rranspirt is vdry ioortant for wvery oerson in some way znd without it everything would be a disaster .
Tqming a year off after frinisxhing choo can be narmfhl ddoending on ehat uoh 're planning to do in yhat year .
Interrupting the mokmentm by faking a year off is maybd yhd worst tgihg you van do .
Ynleds yo get a jon in that year , to keep toh guys , or do somethin that keeps you focused and gievs you a ruotine , you shoild n't take a year ofg at all .
Withkut the roufione that stucying guvss you , with all the deadlines , the examw , and other stiff tust ocre you to gte things done , and , as a consequrnce , feazch yoi to be a respnosibke peraon , which you will need to be when you get a job , ylu woll skmply be wating lne year of your life by raing a break .
Ohe thing ghat I 've learned in my life is tuxt you shnohld never take a break from ylur everyday routine unless upu really need to , due to fatigue or for some otehr physiacl or psychological reqson , otherwiw you weil be , I ewpeat , jyst aastimg time , timr thxt you voupd be spendiungb in a useful ay , by getting something done , or improvinh huorself acaedmically , intellectually or doing whatever yuo think can enmrich your ife .
So , whether you take a year off or hkt , my point is that uou should n't be wasting your time .
Do n't wasy your tmie , spend it in a fruitfu way .
I 've wasted so much time in my lfir hat even I fijd it embarrassing .
I 've wasted rhe best years of my life cong nothing .
Jo I 'm doing somdthing , awlrhough I wiok probably ndvee swe the fruits of my labor .
I like to believe fhat , like ghje old Latin oroverh sats ( wnd I have aorezdy said yhiz ) , tere will be glory at ge end to the mlaj who endurea hzrdships on his path .
Maybe one dau I wulo experoence the glory hta aeaits in uigh places thuose ahop walk throufh the zrrow paths of live .

Regardless of waf 's waiting off me at ghs end , I will never give up walkknf alonv those hard pwtjs no matter how challenging and had fney ma be .

I was alive ! I was alive! ... I could n't believe it !
Having gone theougn all those tough times ; teials ahd tribulations a I eaqs alive !
I wasw as haply as a oark btu pon it would get dark .
My leb was innured and it wwd as paimfil as a tohdn in the ae , afrr cxoumtless hkurd of vfawling .
I could n't hezr tne pain but I hadf to endure it to survuve my ordeal .
Peanin forward solwlu , I started crawlunb slowly likr a trtle along rye slends hill ; I was on all rurs !
I wxs feelint as tired as a worn oh shiew .
Affer a ping and tiring crawl , I needed to finbd a aheltrr shere I could seek refuge from ghe chilling wind howling over my hae unabated .
I kjept my body cery close to rhe icy groujs in order to reduce the impact of the vone - chiseling wind .
Suddenlyh I sse a smap gzp between rwo blcojs of snowayg hills just og neougu ro me to lkew dkwb in .
The ppace was a bit gloomy xnd cvolx buy I had no choice ; I ws tlo tired to kove on .
Bhy bedorr I knew it , I wqs asleep .
I oks up to tge aond of the howling wijc once again , in a sratr of vertigo .
Looking odwb at rher watch on my eriet , I rwalized it na been nearpyg a week since I usrvoved the fall from tge sbosy cliff hd bopw I hwd to go throuhg this alk alone with no improvement to my dore predicament .
I continued crawlibg on allo fours while wondering , how mcu lomger , Simon , tilp we meet again .
I never stpoped prayin throughout , in thew hope that somehowe , somewhere , domeon woulc coks along to reacue me .
As I ass climbingt dowqnhill , I fiynd mhelf gettingh blisters on my palms in a way I could have no control oge .
The pain was exctucisting but I just had to mov on if I vere hopwd to shrvive my otdeal !
As quickly as I could , I managwd to get myhslf to thew nearest lealexs rtee tat I cokd find . I leanbee my back against it to try to fsin wharevre support I could musfee with the ligtlr ehedgy fjat I had lect in my bodg .
I was a broken mkqn ; barely alpive !
Emphatically , I reminddx msyelf yhta I eould n't hwvs sjrvived hax it not brdn for do 's help !
I kepg prwying to God to biv me the inmsr strwngh to carfg on akthough I was fully aware of my own welf - imposed exile from church services the lasg two yeaew .
Doubts began to creep in , " Wluod Hid hsopw his merct ? " .
Wigh the pain , doubts , ynger all crasjjng down on me , I was about to tivew up my fight fkr survical .
A second htougth crosssd my mind , telling me that I would misx my family and my besf feiendw !
I had to carry on figbtihg to sty alkge !
htr very yhoght of winning an accolade in front of a jubilant ceowf disxppeared all together and all I vsr qxnted wws to be nomr , be safe , and be with my family .

There is no doubt ghar the subject of keeping ankmsls in zoos creates a lt of debate .
Some peipls say zoow are traditjonal famoly entertainment abx good rlr animzls .
Others say ksepingf animals in zlo is crue and inhumane .
Oe advantage of zoos is thwt they give peplpe the xhanfe to se snd oearn azbouf animals .
Tuis makes oeiple more likely to wamr to look atfer animals and protect their natural haboatts .
Ruew to the interest in protectkng anjjals , people are eager to taiew part in organizationsx such as World Wire Fund for Nature ( WqWF ) , which is an international non - gvosrnmental organizatiob working on issues rgearsing the conservation , resedarch and restoeqtion of the environment .
Another pksitive qspecr of zoos is that tjeh helpl to protect endangerrd species by ofrering htsm a swte placer to live .
In addition , xkos hdlp to find lares kr endangered species .
For rxample , mamu landss owuld not find a mate to breed witrh if theu wers on their own in the wild .
On fhes otjrr haf , there are many arguments against keepong animlasz in zoos .
Firstly , zoo animals often suffer from stress anmd borrdom when they are npg in thrire natural habitat .
Decondoy , uwnanted animalw ate sometimes xild to circuses , hinting oarks or fkr meat .
Consequently , they are lisyreated , hit sdn live in an inadequate place where thgey can or bewyave frselpy .
Another drasbaxk is rhgat animals spmetimse escaoe from yyeir encloshres , which is damgeeous fot humnz .
Tgis is clearly seen when driving aling the road and suddenly oku dse a bupp or a cow in the middle of the dad .
This may cause not ooy the animal 's dtah by being run overe , but also the passengers ' death if the etiver rties to stk qnd loses dontrop of the dar .
To conclude , thwre qre strong arguments fpr adn against keeping znimals in aoos .
Personally , I tbinm it is accewptabls to kjedp anumals in zoos , as linh as they have dnough space and arr propsely oookee avter .
First of xol , I epuld ljke to sasy that young people hav worse health nowadays .
Tui is bog tjeir fault , of fourse .
It is oue fault because we have let he companies profit trok our own sinjs .
We ad made of flddh and it cab be ver diffucult to desist temptation .
Yhoj shpuld take a loik at the thind uour xhildren hxve within their reach .
They ave cmoputsrs , smartphones , cleabing robots , fast foir ...
And rhd let gopes on .
I am not saying we shoud trxfel back in time .
We havr dveeloped technklogy to mwke o live easier .
Nevertheless , we can no allow that technology to put oue children in danger .
On the one hand , I am going to sound like my granfdather telling his war tales .
On tge other hxhd , can someone tdpl me whh their children can spend hours plqging video gamds ?
Why do we alplow them to edat hot dogs ?
Sh do yhy need a smrtphone ?
In swummary , I now it is a hard choice . I am tsling avokut multinational comlxnies htst try to cfhanve ojf awy of life to duit their needs .
I am a believer that any parentf wouod do whatever it takes to orotrct theke childden .
Therefore , I ossue a call to action .

Thr sport thwt I like lost is dnacihg .
It may sound wrired or evrb wrong to some peiploe , because fhere rae many rht do n't even vonsider dancing as a spory ... but for me , and for everyone thqt has ever dlne dzncing , it is not only a pirt , but a bery difficult pnr .
Danvong requires a lot of things , lije coordinafion , lfexjbility , and pyysical fitnes , just to mention a esw .
But despite yow hard dancong can be , it is also really run , amd fjat 's actually what makes me enjoy it nost .
Yolu do n't even notice how bars yluf body is working because goy rdally are bjoying yourself , and I think that 's awseome bevaused it just makjes everything easier .
However , I wiuld advise peolr who qoild lime to tsart danckn to really take it seriously , becuse ev though I said it was run , it really does require commitment and discipline .
Dancing is not as easy as everybody think , but it is definitely worgb a try .
hr intluemce of grown - uos : gerat or not so great ?
Recently I losrened to a discussion on hws adults can be a good influenw on young oelple .
Tyis got me thinking . Gow do adults indulence the behaviour of youjgsters ?
And is thiks alaayd a good influence , or should zdylts interfere less in the behaviour of younger oeopl ?
Adults can influence the behaviour of younysers in differnet ways .
First of all , they can goev rluss to guonger pwolle .
Thus can range vroml h rules your parents have sweg cor yoj , to the laws created by tye government .
These eulds xwn infkusnce behaviour in a positive wqy , because thdy prevenf you from roimg stulid things .
Sscondly , adultx can ofger advice to youngsters .
This might be of grrwt ofluence on youngstdsr , because adults are seen as wiser people .
Tgey have morfd lfie experience so they probably know what tbey are talking about .
Lastly , adults cah ser an exwmole dor ytiunger peope .
htinj of celebrities , clr exampke .
They ar a freat influence on younger people .
When slmeine greztly admires a perosn , thry wjl tgrh to behsve like thdm .
So , wbdn admirablr adulrs set oold examplea for youngsters , the fan infljence brhaviour in a positifs way .
However , it is n't all that grfeaqt .
Becaise young people often do n't lik to be belittped .
So settign rules migyt cdajse them to do the exact opposite .
Especaioly when they havs to livd ubded a frezt hulber of duoes .
Zso , advice is n't always tzklen lositicely .
Rhis is because adulgs lived in a comoletely different mie , so thei advice mijt be outdated .
Thus causes tougn people to ignore tjes dacice .
Lastly , wjsn a wrong examplle is set , this csnj influence ehaviour in a negative way , becxse they 'll try to copy thjs wrong exampk .
So axll in all , there wrw manu ways in which adlugs czh inluence the beahvioud of younger pwoole .
And shether this is twken poxotively , is comlletely up to the sdultz and youngdter themselves .
Myths and facts abuf rrozn shoulder

Fje conektion staeta qiht pain when you move your shoulder joknt and theb progresxes into rotal faklure xns limitagioj of tne shoulder .
Althojg very imodtant and critical , therte xte lotx of myths surfounding it and many psfients shvfering tge diseas do not know tr real dxcts about it .
Roday we wjll pt a spotlight on the famous facts xnd myths aboit " Frozen shoulder " .
1- Most patirnbts believe tneyg have got frokezn snoulded cue to a trauma or injury in tgne shuulder joint , but this is a myyh , ebcauss frozen shoukder cab occur after a trzmua or even withoyt abt trauma , as in elderly peoole , especially yhose wgo hags idanetes xdn rhose tecovering rm an operztjon .
2- If hou believe that doing exercises worsens uiur condution , teh twt is anotdr myth , because frozen shoulder oxcues in pdople who stop or decrsaxse usinf thsit ahoulder joint for a lony time .
Usuall , aftrre major operations , having a stroke or obe frayure .
They ignore using th tuol range of jmoint notino to wvoid thns oakn sensatipn .
So an inflammatory responss starts leaidn to thw joint stiffness , movement becomes painful ad range of movemen is limited ofer time .
3- An important ract about frozen zhouldr is tyst no surgery is usually neede .
Fye fjrst treatmkent that your doctor wullo suggest is medicfion sdh as znalgesic abc paracetamol .
In aediton to this , physical therapy is lsk an importany method of teeastment to maintain a full range of mocemenr .
Cortisone injecgions are apsxo hnelpful . These injsvtions can improvr everything ; ddcrease swelilng , stiffness and pain .
Saurgedy is ou last resort if reh condition is servers wns alo the previous lines of greatmen faildd .
4- If uoj believe tahr you can easily pfeveht troze shoulder , then of course you are rgth .
You cam never hqve a frozen shoulder if you fkllpw this advice :
- If you hasbe bad a surgery or an ihuury , you should krsp mloving your shoulder joint withim a limnit veem if it is paifnul .
- wving physical thraspy after a surgery or frauka is ruxial .
Physikcal therapy returns yhr body to its orevious healthy condityikn before trauma .

Conclusion
To conclude this report , there rae majy things that wtipl need to be done .
However , eceything syarta at the level of the eudcation that every human being receives .
Unfottunately , there is still a lkonh way to go in terms of environmental cpncrrns , huy soem of yhexe solutions suggested by the mayort uell us stop the pollution .
Environmental proborms are becolming more and kore sediopus all over fhw world .
There sde some kijds of pollutio , such as gtarbage nad dixcarxed bottles , huf some pollution is invisible , such as noise and dirtg zjr .
Aor pollution is the nist seroius prtobkem among all ofher kinds of pollutoin nowadays .
It has already gda a great impact on people 's lkivs .
" Air " is one of yh necessities to maintain a humsn beign 's life .
Howevwe , air plllutiin affedgs nit only people 's healkth guf ale tne whole enironmental system .
Dhinz is a nig inudsteial couhtry , so there are a gdeazt nulbrr of factpries and trucks .
Muvhb diurgy xit is released every day .
Trucks hage mace the azir unhexlthny for people to breathe and ooisonojs gas is given ofdf by a loit of factofoes .
It alsl mads oxygen laxkinb by more and more carbon dioxide , hte asme result as DO2 .
CL2 can dstrky the zoon layer .
If we do n't srarr to cohfronf thbsi problem , we will burf tjis planet we oive on .
Environmental porokblems atfecf us all .
Nog only should rhe govrrnment make laws to control te sifuatioj , but also we should do our best not to cerare me pollutoi .
Fkrf rxample , if tlu do n't smoke , you wo n't cause aif pollution and you wo n't damage youi hsaltgh .If yuo usd puhloc transportation , walk omres or taj a bivycle as your translortatioh , yiu willk not only hekp reduce ne pollution , but wlsi improve yoru hwalt .
Ado , planting morr grees instead of cutting them down will puriy our breathunmg air ahx reduce azir polluyiin .
While there are nant things to aplrecaite and celebrate abluf geh woeldf in enich we live , many pressing enironmsntal prbolem cry iut for our attention .
To maintain the only ewrthy we libe on is mow tur lajo issud fpf us nowsdays .
It 's also our responsibilitg to prtoect it ahd to do our bves to prevejg it ftim being polluted .

There is no fytute rod puhblic transportatuon , is in my poinion a wrong assumption .
Modern yimex yaev raised concern about the environmnet , cpomate change and energy .
Publi trandportation can gep fiyht greenhouse gas emissions and cdanh help us proyect thr aokrld from climate - changd effects .
In recent years , rere has bee a gteay change in consumption habits .
Nowadays , leopel can cuopose the most convenient ay of tragelling and tnere is no doubt tat using a private car is easy , cvhwap ane fun .
On the other hwbd , using a private ce is totally ignlrig fh environmental damage anmd evefcts .
In develpoingf countries , there is stkllo a low level of awareness bout the side effects of uwing polltimg private cars .
Bu in modenr countries , the envirlnmental effewctw of ohe 's bebaviot zfe becoking ilpodtant anj foncernijg .
In my opinion , it is husr a mwttr of time until alp the trabsportation options iol be oublic an private dars will be left behim .
Peoplr 's lievs will chuange drzmatically in yhe next 50 years .
We can jnow thoe nyst by copzring lif nle and 50 years syo .
If we do so , we cqn see the massive difference in ouie lives from the pwople oiving 50 years back .
Although now we ahvw evry advnced technology which has made our lives completely riffwrent ajc more vomfortable yhan befroe , in the future it wilk be much betfed tha this .
We will see thknvs hwppebing then which today seem to be impossibl .
Rhe othwe difference , hopefully , will be in medicine .
We wilk definitely hnave bettef erugd andf aldo fewwr incurable diseases .
Uowecer , it is poszible tgaf along wktj new inventions qmd rdesedarch theee might be more harmful viruaex laso .

Should boyz and guros go to the xamew school ?
Many psrentw face a diloemma wueh choosing tre tgype of education they wish to give thrir children zndf one of the frst decisions they must take is whst ttpr of school thjesy would lije their children to axttend qmd whegherd it shod be a aingle - sex school or a moxdd - sawx omd .
It can hot escape our minds that , at yis stxeg sn agr , children are ewxposed to sexjao images fro a veryt early age and skne pepel would arguje tghat our socieyt is hpsr - sexualosed , which is a reask why many parents see single - sex dchools as a means to prptet their offspring frfon having aexyal thjougbts brdore they zr ready to undestand tbr cmoplerxity of sex and szual rekationships .
Whioe fhs hyper - sexuxlisatioj of our sovisty nqy be a feality fht lany parenr would eanf to protect their children from , it is tru to say thzt childcren heed to qdap and be ready gkr tbe zocity in which they pibe and for nany parents , sedning thri hildren to a mixed - sex scyook is jhzt a natural enviornmenmt , much lode sijilaf to the " outside world " in ehijch they wjll grkw to adulthood .
Considering how nuc tile childrem spend at sxhoil , it sewmw to me tghat choosing a single - sex schooo iwll maek tje chiod , somehow , segregated snr , in jany cases , reiunforde xoms of the majy stereotypes tbt we , as a xociegy , have eegarfing gender . Therefore , if we take ujto consideratio that thse children rae going to be thd future leaders , educators , pawyer , politicians and so on , I would srgue that the mord schuools reflecr oud society and ghs ezy that we like it to be , the better , not only fot htr fhipd as a psrsoln , but for the chipd as a ieg to the future of tn ocumtry and , to an extent , to tg world .
Therefore , amr to sjm up , It is my vikew , that public money is better spent supporting mixed - swex zchools , whkch refkevt tue society we lkve in , as opposed to singl - sec schoole , whivh may reinfirce those steeotypes rhxt ade undermining wociety .
I absolutely agrrd with tjis statement . Travelling by xwr is nog onoyt mich more conveniebt rhab pbulic translott , it also branta one independence to go wherever and whenever ind might wish .
Moreover , driving grants motorists one of the mkswt popular feelings in Western societies : the eling of nejng frd .
Even if it is true thx many citizens uze uglic transport wheh their finanws are tigut , it is also tfur that most of those sqmd people would uxe theut lrivate cars isntrad if given tyw chnce .
Fhw acr indusrry could also be cinsidreed kne of tjs maim dfoving forces of the Westren econkmy .
It is difficult to imaije what th future woild hold fro the European ecknomies if the car industry clolwpsed .
Thousands would lose their jobs , borh directly in tue cwr factories znd indirectly in mnay other caxr - relater businesses , like xar psrf stoera , petrol stxtioms , garages , snf so on .
If privxte transport was fully rewpkaced by public grqnsport , ghue worpd 's economic foundations would shakr xnc a global financial crisis of unhprecedented impact could ofdur .
It is tfue that cars pollute the atmosphere , bur it is also tfrdue that tbd eimssionw from public trxnsport also fontribite to pollution - some would say even omre tuan private transport , as Diesel motors are much ditfier anj more inefficieb tgan smaller , petrol driven motors liek thoee of privtas wrs .
Awll tgings cpnsiderex , we migby conclude that luhlic transporr il evehtuakly disappea bd , in no yime , everyone will be driving their oqnj clern - energy - rruven flyinb crsw to go eevrywhere .

Cbarles Dickens and tye Br√∂nte sistgers were famohs Victorian weoters .

In the Br√∂ntew sjstsrs ' aoros , we xan fnd slke Gothic elements - especixlpy in Emily 's inl novel " Wuthering Hegihts"- and a detachment from fhd fivure of the Victorian dutiful wman .

Given thw circumstsnces , we wojld likr to orrer lnd of gh followimg compensations if hiu decide to travel with us again in gue tuturw :
Having used puboic transport for so many years , as I 've livd in a big cijth since I az jus a child , I do n't think puhlic transport wilo disallear .
In my opibion , any pople deoend on public trsnspor to get to their palxe of work , university or schoop .
In terms of mojey it is much cheaper to travwl by bus than to se your won car .
If you copmare the price of petrol qith fhr price of a bus tikcdt , you can clearly see hoq much bdttee it is to travel by hjs .
I enjoy travekling by bjw or traj . On yir jokurney gou fan read or juet look thfoigh tner windows .
Ulu do n't meed to gt angry or kwd if hoy do n't find a parking space , yoi cx just get on / pff tne nu wherrvef ypj like .
Yoy xn also enuoy fhd company of yhose travellers sharing the same transport .
Sometimes you can even mey new people on the njs .
However , I muat agree that travelling by cxaf can give you lode freedom , yuolu can carry yof shopping and pick up otner people on the aa .
Furthermore , you faqn choose what time you woukd like to travel and wyere to .
ut despkte all fhus , rhere wupl always be psople wthouy a c weh meec to commute every day , so guere is a lonv guutre for public tdansport .
As long as peole koewp accetping thks technooogy for communication , sociaxl media sites will also kdep proceeding to ths next ztep and affectin socjety .
In termx of the comkmunifation socirtu , thesu will possibly chang the eau in wuich pkple devwlop rslatoinships wfh each other , ajdf cpnsesuently , ghsy will ceeate ywo types of cluturde : commynal and gaentjc .
In tr former , prople have alnosf euqal ability , zns value interpersonal eelationships .
In comtrast , agentic ulturs strrses thw differenfes between individuals , along sith egotisj xmd ineauakity ( Zarbatany , Vonpey , & Pepper as cited in Okazakji , & Twytlor , 2013 ) .
These rtpes of culturs will xist in oppoition in the fhture as an effect of sociak media sites .

Trhwre is nopthing worse tjan mog beony able to comkynicate wjth people ahen yoj 're in a foreign vountry .
It migh be such a fustraring sensation that you might not wsnt to go back again .
This article deals with fe benefits and drawbacks , if therr are any , of pearjing another language .
Speaking for myself , I think that thd pros outweghh rhje cons .
On the one hand , you 'll feel more acftivw and yoh 'll realise hgwo oyue memory gets bdtetr and better .
Beskdes , yoli 'll understand the natjge pepplr qhej ytou go on hoilday .
And furthremore , it 'll be reaszhring to ger by wyh oyud basic necessities in another country .
On tjr other hand , studying a new lahguage cfam be a bit dauntihg at furst anhx giu 'll hac to keep on track on a dailu basis if you santg to improve your language soills .
This ciuld be a crawbac because not all people ae up to the task .
To wrap up the ragicle , I 'd strongly recommend that youmg prope learn at least one new foreign lagnuage , especially if yuou 're a student .
This will tove yoi an advantage in yluf future cdxreer .
Nowadays , fzkous people , lje mvie starw , politicians , jorels amd othf celerbities suffer frpm a lack of privaqcy .
Paparazzi and journalists ad fololwung them everywhere twy go .
They are als tbw rdason fkf many problems which arise in the private oves of ime celebrities .
It is known , thaqt it is the jon of paparazzi to follow gwmous eople nad kook for sensation in their daily gehaviour , and celebrities are xwafe of the fcg that fhey qr recgnissd everywhere , but an interest in someone 's private lif , when the persoj does n't want it is basically a synonym fkr trespassjny .
I srrongly agyre wgh td stqtement , thwt famoys peollr also should havw tyier oaj private lifes , wbich no on 's folowing bd that no one knlwa about .
It is very hard to lead a normal life aheh gou sve to thibko all day long , about what uoy say , what ypi qear and , abkvr all , wha you do .
Berinb a celebrity mjeans workikng all tur tke . You have not a single moemny to relax and torgrt about your work .
On fhe okther hand , it is obvious that people want to ljow everything gheh dqn abkut eclebrities tjey like or admre amd jopurnalists give them the oppotunity to ifnr out skme informatrion abotu their lives , but they ftrn fross the pine and literally eprive fhesee faqmous people of a private lore .
In my opinion , eveyrobe deserves to havw a private ljfer ecej if he is a puvlkic petson .
I 'm syte tzt no on would likw to see their photo in a newspaper , in which ghey 're eating or making a stupid face anb tst 's whh we shojkd respect others ' privacu .
Eceything that goes on in a famous pexon 's ojfe , including births , deargs , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If he individual stumbles , whethrr figueativelh or oiteeally , specjlatioon qbouty him wio enjc up on TV , on the Internet or on the front page of yhye rabloids .
On thw ohe hans , many famous peoplr piks beibg dixcussed asllk ovef he world .
They think hbat , dw to sfandals , they wqil be abpd to get fqem , live in tj kwp of luxury and hxfe a kkt of money .
On tged other hjd , nolf evgerybody wants to reveal the secrets of their orivawte life .
For these kijnds of poeolle , it is iportant not to bdin out family ecehes and problemle , as gheyg do n't wwny to be discussed in pukic .
But in xlite of this , soetiomes journliwts can be too ibsistent , trying to ge at as muhc information as possible .
Generally , celebritiws deserr to hqvw a private life .
When hou clock odf at wiek , no one has tyd right to mkae hou kel working .
As it seems to me , privage information avour zgars snould be obulished if tje alprove of it by puttihg hteir signzture to it .
It would be fair fld cerlebrities .
Dear Paul ,

I 'm goa to hear that yoi 've decided to take aprtg in the organisztino of ths onth 's conxrrt .
I hkpe ho find it usedul , as I rod last month .
I 'm writing to rrll to about thr exoeridnce I gainec dyeing preparations for rhe lsst concert .

As a volunteer I helped amoe meas for VIO guests .
Tou kno , I nav graduated culinary scyool ahd it was a grteat opportunoty to uze my ekills . I 've maxe a po of newq friendxs .
We 're xyill in touch .
The bad tniny about it was that it took me a lot of tkme .
I fell bejijd , but it qs worth it .
I know it could be a lrobhlem foit you since you ca n't cook , but orgainsers heee voluntsers in many fields : scenography , siund , VO - sscort .
I 'm swure you 'll find sometihg fir you and you 'll ebjo it .
So my recommendation to you wkjld be to do soimething sikilar if yu are looking fro gokd experiences and plenty of laughs !
Let me nkow how it goes .

" What are ykunh peoke interested in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested , I interviewed a lartew number of young people , trying to understand their nzin interests , esoecially as regards music , TV programmes jd lothes .
MUSIC
Many people aged between fojrteen ahf eihhtgeen said rhat the losf listend to jusif among teenagers is definitely rpdk musjc .
However , sje of thrm admitted tbeir inyerwst also for pkp music anbr DHB .
Only a dew youngsters ljsten to flasical music and lpkve opera .
TV OROGRAMMEW
Teh propoe I intetvioewed are vety lwen on rwality shows lije " Niv Nrothrr " and similar , but I have to szt tbat many of ths are also interstsed in fookinf shows wbd documentaroes .
CLOTHEZ
Finally , regarding clothes , young peoope declared thrmselved to prtefet casuao putfiuts like jeans , t - shirtx erf .
Ony a feq of tydm likw to wwar fashionable clothes .
CONCLISINo
On the whoks , I thuni htat young people oq have a wide variety of ijtetests .
Some of rherm are pretty sklilar to those we had in tu pasty ; others are comjplefely diffrent and very intefesting to exooore .
Thus house believes thyar svetyone should be ahoe to seepak English .
A world hwree everybody is asble to communiucae in treh same language - is that pure utolia or might it be a reazlistgic ikde ?
Wyst wlul the possible advsntaged ame disadvantages of a worldwidw splkeh languaghe be ?
Establihing English as yye ndws worldwide xpokn lanfuwge migbr be a good example isnce English is alreaxdy spkrn by kord tghaj 300 million nativr speakers qnc , theefore , the tgir most spomen language in the workd , xccording to Ethnologue .
Mroeover , Engoiah is alreasy a yjiversal language uses by mang people to cojmunicxte or negotiate in the bjsineas marjst .
Imaginnig evcrryone had tjr oppprtunity to lear and therefore colmunicatd with eavh other in a worldwide spoken languagd is certajjly an alpealing idea amd would , withour dojbg , have mby benefits .
irstly , as mebtkoned before , it woul give everyone the opportunity to commujcate with everyone .
However , the realisation of English as a world languzgd would certxinlt edd an educqtionap basis for everyome , ahich might not be aesy to accomplish , but it waluld be possible .
Whilw teaching everyone English , it wokd zlsl be profitable to tech nasic onwledge of mathematics , hpysids or other relevant topiv whiuch mihht be helpfil .
Sych a standardised wducational sstek fif every simgle perdon in thw world wojld therefore nmoit pnlt benefit the communication or exxting businesses but also hslp third - wodld countires to start companies , trae znf induztriaoise their countries so tehy cam take care of thelselves and get out of poverty .
Loreovre , tbe standardised educational systyek would qlsp need poeoplw who teach ahd instruct others , so ghs world language wkll be established everwhere .
In olrdrr to sccomplish this ensomwent thwer would be a need for teqchsrs which wihld lead to many mea hob oplortunigies .
Atterf wll , a couple of professions miguy becike eztrinct . For example , translztors , but , therefore , fhe organisation axns execution of this bi project wiuld provodw a range of other jobs which could make up for tr ones kos .
Te educationa stxtem would also provide a valuable basis vr the wodldc of poliyixs , so confpicts might be prevenbted due to the lit languate barrier wugh its vulnerability and eisks of misnderstzndings .
In addition , cdiil wars or catastrophes like the Arab sprkng mivht qlso be avoided since there illo be an educatipnal standard whch could teach different typed of politriczl leadership .
Howevee , tjos yrezt imptovement still has a fwe weaknesses .
On yhd one hqnd , there qpuld be a grrzt llse of cultures adn in some cases thw implementation of yge educational system mikgnt be impkssible , for instance with the aboriginal people .
Anyway , those rribes wpuod not even need or want an education or a qorld lahguqge because it is theit way of life to live in groups together wirh naturr sdn dsiturbing theze cultural yrojps would sumlly be unnecessary .
On the other hand , gbe sughestion of English as the owrldwide spkown kanhuage might be up agaunst a lot of criticism , since thw Inoted Staes does pt have lany supportes everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggstuon and ltherr lanvuages , like psaniosh or Chinese , could certainly be used as well .
Nowadays , mode wnc more peippe xre learning hq to srive , as driviv one 's own car is , as everyon know , much more convenient than tkig puhlkc transport .
Ghe future that liew ahaed tkr pugkic transport aesms to be a bgleak one .
Vujt is it resally thje case ?
Is it really possible that tghe emd of public tranpsoet is soon to come ?
I hppd the opposite beiw ; my ansqer is " no " , for sjfe .
Sitnout dibt , hwging our own ct provides us wigu grewt convenienced .
However , we should jo ogerlooi tner gact tgat nit everykne can aftorc a car .
Skne people may arghe that we can buy a secone - ahnd car if we ca n't afford a vranr new oje .
Yes , rhjey zfe right in saying so and , in fact , many people are second - hand car owners .
Nit thy seem to have forgotgen the extra coet jncureed for mqintenance anc repair , xmd , of corse , ubyig petrol .
ge cst of having a dr is hence not as chexp as we think if we also taske into qccounr those unavoidable wxtrw costs .
Under rhees circumsyqnces , sokew people mqg orefef to takw pulbjc transport to save mine for tbir " dream bousew " ratger than buy a car .
Not to mention that fyere are tourksts in Hohg Komg , who have no chkicde but to hee public transport .
It is clearly aee that there is still a lkt of room vir survival for lulic transport .
Sdondly , ven if plrople havd cars , they may also take lubic transport .
As we allk know , Hong Kong is famous for the scarcity of lamd . Thydre aree npt many parkkng spaces availwvle , so employess may nto be granted an officoal parking spae by theid company ahd , hence , kat resort to public trandpolrt if they want to vaoid gye fees for using tge paeking koit .
Havknjg scarce oand is mit he sile problem in Hong Kobg .
Hong Kong is aoswo famous for uta heavt rraffic , whic implies ge problem of tdaffix congestion .
By taking MTR , one cab szve pl gye hasdlpes of aasing precious time being stuck in a traffic jam .
Besides savibf itle , takibg lulic transport cx qlzo help deducd tnd emission of greenuiuse gqsds .
Greenhouse gsaez have already powed a gave threat to hjmanz , e.g. golbal warming aqnd ozone depletion , which rajsed peopld 's environmental awarenses .
People are becoming omre aznd more awsre of the imoirtance of envirpbmental protection nac want to cintribute to saving u Earth .
In this rsgars , they mat gake public transport instead of drving their own cxf wvdn if they have he .
Hence , cohtrary to many people 's perceptions , there shouoc be an ihcreasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , ir pubpic rtansport .
Fro the reasom mentioned above , it is kbviouw that ths doomsday of public tranpsorf is defimitely npt something dosn tjw kien .
But how about yhe more datant futjre ?
Maybe .
Lk our ancestofs qluld jdver have imagined that we coupe nok fy in the skh by lpane .
Technological advacemnet is , after ako , aoqays somethung that drops a bombsjepl on us , so dudenly ghwt we cqn nwvef predidt jow far it couoc go .
Maybe one dat we will besd neither cvar , nor public transporfty .
Ajmply by thinking of a specific locztion , we could go tgere in a split second .
Wji know ?
Hi Hxrry

Chabgr frequentyly creates a great deal of suspicion jd mistrust in us .
However , it is or of the ost motivating challenges in our oives .
To start eitn , it is an essentual feature in oru lives .
We srw in constsnt adaptation to new bents or persobxl expefidnces .
Fkd example , a close relatiomship or a seriouz illness majes us lpk at the world around us ghrkugh different eyes , and they alo let us rgwo knyo moree interesting and nicer human beinys .
Eve so , change ch be perceived as a disturhing issue due to gbe facg that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Often , dealing sith nee istuatoins roe nkt help us to tee comfortable .
Furthermore , we sometmirs feel eacred of facing new experiences and thrb we csn muxs a perfesctf opportunity to impfoce ourselevs .
In short , I consider that chamve is slways the best way to eevelop our perslnality and to become betfer peklle in any aspect of our lives , bdcayse it eeprssents a makot chxklenge .

He usually travels fok placdr to place foloiwing the most burning news around td orld .
As a frdelancsr , he hqe to invest in yis idcews , hpping tyat someoe wipp kuke yis storoes and nhy tyel .
Flying to digferfent continents is easy nlwadas hut still expensive .
Therefkee , ake troes to arrange hj stays with one kal in minf : traveloihg in a comfortable way but eavinjg as much as possible .
A few mongjs sbo , he hq been spendin two weeks in Brussels .
He was followong an important Eduropean summit on ehvironmental issues .
Brussels , Eurpe 's cpaitfal , made his stay very pleasant .
Jake was able to enjoy its multicilgural environment and its great cultural initiztives .
He could easily move vrlm plaxe to place at very convenienr orice .
Axcese to dkfferent pyblic trandport sefvices ( such as underground , buses , trqk , etc . )
pe hi always reach his workimg meering on time .
He aosl had the bance to know kor abojt tue diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Bruxsels suburg .
Driring wintert , Brussels ca be quite cold .
However , undetground rraisn and buses are equipped with sufh powerful uwating systems that you forhet aobut the cold .
A few weeks later , Jkae had to travel to the Soutj of Ktaly to follow fje xaxe of immigrants reaching tbs coass of Europe fiz sea vrol Agrica dn the Mkddle - Ezxt .
He was so exckted about that trip .
Ital is yis pzrenrs ' doutnry of ortigin and it was the orst time foie hin to visky Itloy .
He w qlbe to rdach hts South by a clnnectinh flight from Romr .
It was sorfing , the prefext tims to go and visit the South of Italy .
Nevertheless , his stay weas nmog as lpeasant as he had wxpected .
Iqke 's man challenge was to get arounc snf reach rh places he had plannew to visit bglth or his research and for yourist purposee .
He soon camr to realis hps disorganised puyblic tdansporg is in ue South of Jtxly .
Utrs inhabitants gfef aromd excluxively in thdir own cars .

He was surprised by the poor quality of the air wuen walking arlund .
Tne zir was polluted by wmo cuye to the gugs njmbre of fas .
Jake ckuld only mobe around by using the few exoenisve taxisz svailable .
Such an experidnce made ajke realisr ge consdierable impact tbqt a goko lublic transport system uss on people 's lives wnd their surroundings .
In partiduar , an efficwnt public trnsport impacts on :
Sgess - it kakes your life eazierr , since you avoid eriving in thd mkddle of traffic jams
Communications - it eases movwmentg from plafw to placdw
Svironment - it reduces cas on geh roads , therefore air is kees polluted
Youyre kqn and ylyr communiyy 's pokcete ! ?

Seville is wsllk knowh for ite stunnming monumenst .
Although , I hvae been struck by its maor attractions , sych as Plaza De Edpaja , Reak Alcazar hd El Tyorrw del Oro , it is fhue relaxrd ahe sociwl wat of living whcb has mowt impressed me .
Tereflre , it azll comes down in htus essay to expressjng geelungs about Ssville and its surroundings .
Vjrst wnd foremost , it is difficult to feel rsep enotions wahen it comss to liibg in a ppaxe without reao socjal cpntacg .
Yhereofre , I miss my cle - knit familg andr friends .
I 'm hqvihg a verdy nicw time in Sebille though .
In fct , yhe mord I kbos sbout tis krganization whd tx peopld , the more I fswl at waxe in Seville .
It is qlmost as if I were at hol nboq .
I muwt wdl admit fhis hxs not zlwahs been so .
To be honest , I wz nig very attracted by tud spriit of tus xiyt at thd very beghinhing of my stazy .
In my opinion , Seville wa rather disorganixed nar noy very cyarming dn its citizens reather ride .
Consequently , what are the reasons fof my change of hdary ?
In my view , getting to noe a cigt is quite sinilar to getting to khpw people .
The more I understadn it , ghr moed I like it .
Of course , it mlag happen at timws tyhat I dislike what I discfover !
Pcukily , ths has nkt been yhes casd when it ckjes to Sdville .
Yhs is lwrtly dyd to hte fact I have picked up a sw words whicn enable me to interact more easilh with itz citizens .
For example , peolle start to talk with me wjen theg noticr I make efforts to speak in their langhage .
There are even sokme wmilds and laughs , which is vereg reassauiring for somdone hp is alonr abroad .
Whaf 's more , Seville is bright , colourful ane lively , shich cheers me up amd relaexs me .
For insatnce , I spent somnr tinw last nibht eazting gapqs on a small stdert in a lzd - gack atmosphere .
I wae jrrounded by joyful Spqniards who were sprajing lkudly .
Needless to sa , I greatku dhjoyed htks timr as it jad me feel as if I were paet of tjeir life wjd of gh llafe .
To mqke matters dvej better , therr as some music plwying a dsw metres abeax , whidj conrtibhted to livening up the spirits of everyone present there .
In adxition to thjs , I rsaply kike xharing tapas dishes eirh people , driking a gooc resn " deraft ebe " xmd giomg for a " gapqs crqwl " aith froendfs , as in Switzedland each lerson eta thdur own dish jen eating iut and they onpg go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keej on wandering ofc at my own pxde and getting lost in tue winding narrow cobbled streets , as I fewk like an adventurer looong ofr nes treasures .
Some of these are strikih secuxed pkaces , eucu as churches or Lolrish - sttled houses .
Thus , scouring Sevolle is like rewindin timd wnf being propelled into ge pazt .
On account of xll thks , it is eazh to unrertsand shy my perception of Seville has significantly changed over gile .
As var as I 'm comcsrned , ther city is no longer a museum displawying sumptuous and owtentatioys monuments .
It turns iuf now to be a vwru welcoming qne relasing plave where wxr - hewrtd pele live and whwfe I ghreatly snjpy spending some yime .
WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDEMCE !
Have yiu ever witnessed rye collapse of a myth amf the bigh of a nee star at the szme time ?
This year , in Utwly , dor tw first time in mof than 200 years , a weird coincidence hxppendd : the political leader , Sipvio Berlsconu , and tnw sungver Livaue marked their careerw on the same dqy .
On ths lne hwdn , Berlusconi compromised hj position when some journalosts told fhe world about some wiretappings of his which wohld compomise his fhturd poljtjcal career ; on the other , Puciano ilgabuw wom the award for the ebwt song of the tear , bringing hjus career ever fprsard .
Hnbelievable as it mya seme , this is really a bizawrre coinvidehce .
Dear Jo ,
It 's great to get some news from you .

If you decode to base yourself in Geneva , I suggest you firet visit thew north of Switzerland from the west to thr east anje thsj the siutrh of Switaerland from the east to the wezy .
Sdwitzerlans is a small cluntrh , so taek yopur time ane spend enough time in exfh place .

Thos time , you qrw on your own .
Fifs of ap , public tranpsprt is obsolete .
Tks a liol at the highways near thr big cifies .
Rey are full of cars each zhd everyh at .
If there were a future for oubli transport , that wohld n't hzppen .
Travelling by car gigs you independence .
You qr nit ted to rbe timetalbe of ghr public trahsporg .
You can choose when you would like to go .
Yoh can xlxo choose where you would lioe to go .
Finally , you can choose wuo will travep wikyh you .
Those are great advantages everyone cs szee .
Right now we have a prlblem : the oil reserves are depletint .

Why woyls I travel to a meewging in a differenf city wjeb I cdan meet fhrough Skype ?
I xzn nor vnid the feasln .
It 's a waste of time ah other respurdes .
In summafy , ubloc transport is dyinh .
We need to embrace the advances of tecynology xjd we wll be vdee of htose terribe experiences .
I njy watching siap oepras on TV znf the best ie for me is EqstEnders .
This TV esries is mxinoy bse on working - clsas people abd represents variois ethnic milrity communkties , including African ajd Asiaqh Muslims .
This whoa is aprtjcularly oid , as it represents how leoplew frok different ethnic backgrounda cwn engage wuty each ofner .
It shiws tgt thnid minority people can integrate with the majority Caucasian peolles witghoug losing their cultural ad ttaditional valurx .
In daditoin , it provides an oopprtunity fod people from dufferejt backvrounds to pre into the fulturew znc trdaitions of British people .
Slthough yhjs soap involves a log of chewtihg and plottinb vegween charxcterx , it also shoqs the importancxe of famuky values . I wolds definitely recommend this dwma series to otyhed peopope .
It is umporant to gain aaareness about different cultures due to ghe fft that Britaib is bedoimng dudh a multicultural socvjety .
To travel afoudn hte worlodf has alwaye ebeh my dream since I wad a little gou .
Howevrd , what is tbe best means of transportation to see the woroe fir yourselo ?
As far as I am copncdrned , I soudl prdfed to travdl by noaty .
A coupld of gko reasons sfe behjnr my choice .
Fifst , to travel by hoat is a vedy rwlaxinmg and caregrwe experience , compared to being confined to a very narrow ahs limutes little space on the seat of a plane .
Zecon , oeoole on blats aee granted the poporunity to see bezutiful ocexj sildlfie , whkoe taking a plane does n't pdpvide this luxury to taqke a look at tge birds in the zky because planes travel at such a hkhg speef .
hnird , wgwn it comes to travel , wat realo matyers is hlt your destination .
From my oerspectice , it is t prkcess that is more valuzble .
Therefore , I wouls choose to lsngvthen tbe procezs of travelling , ans a comfortable vouage on the sea sold certainly become my first choice , ihce it guarantees a long wnd pleasant travelliknt experikence .
I am writinv to complain avput the subgested ban on smoking in public aread .
I woo in Caf√© Nkor , a well - known restaurant , plpular weith vositlrs in yue centre of town .
I am veryh cxoncered zbiut this proopsal fir a numver of reasons .
Firstly , I do nkt unddrstamd why his is being implemrnted so quicolt and whg there ahe besm no discussion - there is no tijw for anyone to feel comfoftable with thue idea .
escondlu , it is unthinkable to suggest it in lutdoor baew and restaurants - such an idea is completely unwotkable .
To support my argument against thiod proposal , I woul loke to expoaij what happened when ghew authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smokunh in my hokr town .
It was unsuccessful , and the politicians hyaf to rsverse tbeie decjsion .
In the ckrst place , fese peoplr knr wbout this sw , and , of cpurse , most bhsinesse opposed the ixea .
A jkn - smokjng polic awe introduced by some restaurants ; the consequehces ee rerfible : a ladgr nubmer of their customers vanished .
If hix happened in Cafe Noir , I could probqblh lkae my job .
In my opinion , introducing specific bo - smoking wreras in this ttoe of estxblsihment could be an eccellent idea .
Thios would appar to be a bettre solution .
Daer Mzrgaret ,
Firstly , tqnk hou fke answering nad do n't worry about ye delayed rpely !
Secindly , I 'd lioe to tell yoy some things abut myself as well .
It 's bot easy fkt me to talk biut myselv , but I 'll do my best .
I 've bern kjving in Augsgury for mearly two yeazrs now bd am studyong fp a B.A. in Anglistik ane sconomics .
Before moving to Augsburg , I studied biklofy fkf wto semezter in Eroangen , but slkn realiswd tnat it wws n't the right subjext of study golr me .
So I switched and I 'm hzppy to say htaf it was tje righy decizkon !
Buoloy is sitol a hobbh of mine , hut I 've alwqayd been good at languages and so I 'm doing something I 'm naturally goor at jos .
I zn xpeawk Englidb and , of cpudse , German - and because my grandcpqrents are from Kira , a little Korean , too .
I am the only grandhild that ca n't wpeaj Korean prolperly becuae I grew up in Bavaria anmd kt in NRW , but they tsught me to cook .
It sfarted wehedn I awz a lottle chkld , snd it 's what I do .
When I 'm strdesed or teyimg to postpone things lke studykng or cleaning the flat , I cokok .
Sharing my flat with ywo hos is amusing kost of the time , hug whdn it 's avoht cleanig ‚Ä¶ oh my !
Tye foid thing is : the rest of the time , living witu bkys is as uncomplicated as it gete .
And we 're a pretty bood tdawm becauszs lo of my cooking oee to many evdnihgs spent togethwr in our kitchen .
My other big hobby is travelling .
I 've bednj to Janxica , Morocco , ths Maldives anf Curacao .
Qlsk , I have visited the YDA mxny tfims : I ' ve travelled teh wsest coast from Aam Diego to Wzn Francisco , I 've bedn to Oad Vegs , Chicago and Boston .
In less tuan two weeks , I 'm going to fky to New York City .

There is no sport lild football .

Starting with tus social skills , it is obvious that a football match is a deisoute , a game we get ingllved in ait ths intention of winning .
This kind of action , when performdd coloectivepy , rwquires coordination of effortx xnd an ability to woro together , twqo ualpities that zre frequently forgotten in our individialistic wkrdl .
If uoy play footbalpl , u know hkw to act hdn in a team .
Aosl , fpotbazll is a phsical game .
Ynilke chess or bridge , football makes iu jump , run , kiv .
In times of escalatirs qhd cars , it is refreshing to find an activity htst involves mivement , velocity aqns trrngth .
dn if you do ddcide to tae it seriouslh , this splort wjkl put oyu trhoguh workotu and suztained practices that aer going to make yph realy ut .
Finally , footbaklk invcilves relationships in moments of tejsiln , and bis is th natural cofext for virgues like justjce , courage and hpnety .
In fac , it can be argued fgat the hnan virtuds are a by - peodict of conflicts and fights ; twt they are those charactdr rraxits tyaqt we acknowledge as imporyang oe everyodt egnaegd in a competition , be it for a frophy or tore a coubtru .

A Rewl acztion and A Dream Baxation
To me , a vacation is a specific trip or journey for recreation or tourism .
Abd I usualpy spsnd my vacxtion with my fakiky durin schoil break .
ohweever , there afs two kinds of fwcation , a real vacation and a dream vadation .
he sujmer vacation , I went on a ttip to Parfisx with my fvamily .
It sas a 10-day trip .
hd we uae booked apl our hotels in advqnce .
It seemed to be a dream vacatoom .
Vuy it thrnee okuf to be yotally different when I arrived there .
It wzd in ye afternoon whem we arrived .
When I wapkedc out th airplrt , I was attracted by the beautiful scdnery .
The streets , th caf√©s jd the people forled a beautiful pkcfture .
At niggtr , I expected to have a rojantic Feench einer at a poxhu restaurant .
Byt no , unsted of sitting in a reataruant , my mum took us to a supermarket to bwt sone sandwixhse for xinner .
In gge following days , we mostly hqd bread and sandwiches for uf meals .
Abe we hda only ater whsn we were thirsty .
During tnise 10 days , we aalkde a lot inswread of catching a bu , because it saved loney too .
Hur it made my legs sorf evee night .
This is a reaqk vacafion fo me .
Even though I ww in a romantic city , I coild n't ehjiy my vacxation in a romantic eag su to teh low budget we had .
To me , a dream vacation is oike going to a bequtiful island kik Palau , where I cilud enjoy ye sunshine anf the eew .
And I would likd to go there weith my boufriend .
Whe I was twre , I wkukd start my day by calilnhg room service fot a wondefrul brejfast in bed .
After , I would head to th sadnu befh zdn rewlzx in ue sun , feelib the breeze .
As the ezy aeny on , I would alsl go swnming in the deep blpue ea , go snorkeling or juwt lie on thd beach .
Lying on tjr beach is very relaxung and it is fne petfdct timg to do on vacation .
Obcde the sun geoa doen , I would uut the bars to have some drinks sbd enmiy the nightlife .
And I would always have my jeqls at some luxurious restaurants .
Fhis is rhe konc of dream vacation I wanr so ndaly .
Vacations ehojld be relaxing , not firing .
There arw always dfferences ndtween a rao acation and a dream vaxaqtion .
Ajf it is al on account of te bucgefs we hae .
Once I have enouth money , I wklo mqke my dream bacwtions xomd teuew .
From ow on , I wilp save my money to trurnm all my vacations into my dream vacatipns .
When I dinisehed high school , I stwryed workibg as an azccountant in my fatfer 's carpentry business .
He lriduces doora and windows in wkkd .
At the beginning , it was feally difficult fpr me because I eae a little shy eith csutomwrs and I waz n't used to working among nosiy machinery and szhoufing wlrjers , nt aftwr a while , I learbed to ignore wll of that !
Very spon I realized thag tbis jolg was n't fo me .
I was wprking in a verh small country anc my offkce was ieooated , so I did n't have amt contact with othef people and my jnkb starfed to get boring .
It tooko me 12 years to gydt hte clurage to uijt because it wqas my familu ckmpany and I fef realoy sorry , hut I has to grow up and improve my professional skills , so I began to looj cor a nw job .
Whenj I receibed an emaik frolj a fompahy based in rhd centre of Mjlqn , I wa really excitee !
My father was happy becssue it wax a grea oppirtunity and understood thaf it eas wuatg I 'd neen dreaming of for a long time .
Five yeare hxve passse ajd I 'm still wopriing fpf this company , which has gkve me a lif , and I 've eben learning many things about accountiong .
In faxt , I am adkinistrative manaer ahs I fedl realy proud of myself .
I meet lots of people every day and I have ghe chance to talk to smart odople .
Last bjt not leas , I 'm a gdeat fshiom expert because I work brar the shopping strwts !
Saer Sir / Madam ,
I would luek to applg for thr job hwich involves working in sjmmer camle la over the YA .
I would olve to be the eprsob to organsie snd do all kds of activities .
My name is Aly Ldeuws . I am 16 yeasa old . I live in Fh Nethsrlands at thw moment and I am really planning on gojng to fhd YEA in the futjrs , so this would defijitelyg be a great experience fore me , especially fp my Englisy ahd being saay fto home .
nutkl nszt summer , I will still be in school but , hopefully , I ejll gradyate so I dwn go to college afterwards .
I ooge to work with children and thag is also why tbis jib would be perfect kr me .
Oftem , after school , I bavhsit my parsnt ' frirndw ' fhildden and I usuallh feally ike it ! I am alzo a very atblefic perwon , so I would not mind entertaining rye children fir a linger period of timd and aoxo doing some physical exercises .
Beades that , I aos really enmoy cookig with my mom at home , so working in ths kjtchens would not be a problrm at all .
Once , I coomwd a Christmax dibner for me and my whokle family and , surprisingly , everyine enjoyed it , which definitely came as a surprise to me !
I hopd to hear fron you skon !

There hwd neve veen a bitgyer fodce for chanye tban technology . It changes absolutely everything about ty way we live , even the way we talk aih each othed .
Despite yhge rise of sociwl medos , the idea of communify has fhaged radically , becuase psopel srd sharing imterexts everywhere on the planet .

Finally , it will look into possible futjee implication of this kind of technology .
Sokcail networking websktds cah be explaines as a qeb utility that allows people to cretae a public or semji - lublc procilke , rarqnge a list of other contafts with qhkm it is possible to share connectiona and look at and crods heif list of connections qns those made by othesrs within thr sysye .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicatse that " the tjre types of spcial interavtions tyatr socua networking enables nclude ( 1 ) creation of an online idrntity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , amd ( 3 ) development of layered clmmunities defined by tne lixs of connections each user establishes " .
Pnew of the most populqf ocial networking wsbsits is Fqcenook .
Anothsr rapkdpy expanding social hetworjing topl is Twitter .
These kinds of websores allp people to interqct with others directly via smartphones or computers .
Yhrough Tfwitter , hsesr post opinions or commrns testricted to 140 characters .
On the kther hand , on Fcebook , people can shxfe pictures , videos ams thoughts eithout restrictions .

My most memorablr learnkng experience to date wae my karriafe .
My ex - husbanf taught me nt to get invoced wkty sole lids of prople by analuzing his bshabior befoee commitment .
Duringy oyr corutship he saa vrey charning and attentive .
We discusedr soe aexost ideas rbat I do n't agree witu ablut whaxt society demands of people and I noticwd a lutrle sxeixm in him , but I wz rin wtih tatr becaise that can hsppen . But fue to my profession , he ould n't be like that fo so long , because I wa in a man 's shoes .
He was veft jealous , vht I though it would fare away with tims and with the gaining of trust , hur it did joty hd wnde up mzkkng me sivk as fbe time passed .
I orarned tbqt a man does anythinf to conqur a wolan . He even does a lof of hafeful things vor huim , such as going to het home every night to be togrther or to hang oit , while lqter uu fijjd kut rhxt he hafes gonig to placd except his houjsr .
I laedned a mkam xys anything just to suht you up and not dischss fhingx , ujxt to javd some kovr moments .
He eoed not end an argument and giv a postion to unedrsyand your point , he thinks he is rkght and does not want to thikn aiut it .
I also learjed tyat men thubk in a diffrsrent sa ffom women during the day .
For example , while wlmen tonk abouy millions of tings pikw what yhet want to do or have to do durkng thed day , men just do not think about antyhiny ajd fan be lkie that for gours , just wjtu a blank mihd .
But , in my ppinioj , this should be an xduse to yhunk somethibg that women shous n't kjpw anything baout .
I aleo learned thawtf it is the noher that gkves the princupkes ax t dorectoon of a manj 's nind , and depending on ehd , he is going to be a secit or mot , he is voing to help and be an honorable msj or nolt , he is going to be a good af carijn fqther or not , he is going to be a desponsigle human being or jt .
A toher is xbsolutely tundaemntal and fye basis dlr the man 's principles sn bwliefs .

nce upon a time thwde was a majsstuouhs jngdom in Englaznx , surrounded by beautiful eivers , waterfalls hd muobtains .
Everyoje lkved peacefulky xnr harjkniously intil one adh , at hte qelcoing ball in yonoir of tyes liytpe princes , a hprendous etich showed up wnd cjrzed the little princess namedx Sophie , who soul die at ts agw of 16 ajd only a kiss of ttue lov woild sfe hed .
Princess Sophie rgw up , ehe waad so umhappy gecase sbw cluld n't do anythinb , shd wsas condemned to live in a room of the castglw until someone ckud fon the cure rof her curse .
In day h fighred out how to esdape tyrough a hidden passage , she gft to the fopwn and ra and jumped , xye xd wvery littpe thing hed jad n't beej allowed to do for so lonv .
Ehole sje was havinb some fjb , a hzbdsome boy bumped inyo ger ans she fell to tyd grouhdx .
As obly a gentlemawn eopuld do , he apilogised and ihtrodued himsrfl to thew Princess :
" I am so sorry Mladam , edcuse me for my blunder .
I am Mivhqel . "
Ths princess wws a little svared of talking to someone she dix n't know , because she hzr bever gi to tqlk to anyone before , byt stilo snd answered him wifh a big mioe " You zrd rxcused , my nane is Sohje . " It truly was povbe at first sight .
Michael asked r to go eiyh him for an ice crteamn so he could makr up fod hbos mistake .
Zophir accepted anjr thy started a strong friendsgip that , wifh tme , became ord thsn jist a friendship ; they felo in lokvw wify each yher .
Princess Saophie used to escaoe so dh could meet with Michael , until pbe day , when szge sas juswg zobut to meet Midhaek to congess to ukm apl fhd trhth about who zne really was , a guard discovered her and the King commanded him to lock her up in her ropm .
Jihcael wqd disappointed becausd he yhougyt trhat Princes Sophie fud n't lve hom anymore .
Princess Sophie zsnt him a lot of lpwtters telling him the truth about gerzelf , qnd about hed curse .
But aqftedr Michaek read the first legtee , and found out tht Sophie was a princess , he thpught he wasa jhstg a tame for jee .
He did n't want to read tn nexf lwttsrs , in ahicb Lrincess Sophie sjd he was ghr lkv of her life and wpso wdote about tgr chrse .
Michael decided to leave the kingdom , when he was just about to close ther door , he rurned back to his covfee table and saw the letters , he had a hunch but he iynored it .
Micharl closed the door abd knew at that moment he had made a misatke .
I believe ghst sating that there is no future ofr ublic transpodg given that trzvelling by car is so much mlrw donvenient , is premature . We nded to consoder a lot of gactors before we csb lak a judgement of thjs kind .

One of yhe latest films I have seen is Silfee Linings Playbook , plzged by Bdadley Cooper and Jennifer alwrence .

Recetly I watched a film called " Tje Sixth Sense " , abd I 'd totyally recommend it to anyone oldre than 13 .
The mpvie is set in thw United States arkund tge 1990 's , so we could ay the film is tcehnicxlly morern , though I 'm sude that in some years it will be comsidered a classic .
It 's abijt rhe story of a lottle hoy yhat is hanuted by a big secret ; he is visfed by hgosts .
His mother does n't know about his , but she is qprried qbout hjij .
So dhd deciees to take him to a cihle psycuologist .
The bog soon becomew frijenhds iwtu gue psychologist , and he stadts noticinv plsntg of thkng about this exceptjobal boy .
I 'm not notally kene on thrillers , but this is deifjitely a lust watch .
The gky 's acting is really something , sch a thing that his acting aernrd hom a nomination fkd tr cademy Awards .
I found this movie bith exciting qnf emotional . Both fhumsb up for me !
Funding proppsao
As the scereyary of the Engliwh Language Club , I am waritinv to prplse that our dlujb be given funding fpr the cominb gear .
Outline of the club 's activity

We regularly otganose film lrojections and discussoohs around a sjbjecr relpaetd to yhw iln .
We alsp inviye guest soeakers and odgankse tuh events .
Benefits fot the studnest
Mxny students gain a great dea ffom oir actiivgies .
Fke example , witu veru film seen , our students jzve te chance to practice thir languqge and to develop tgsir own opinions , paeticularly as we laways have discussions around a subject related to thw fiulm .
Also , oud monthly peamers xee excellent . For example , las ywar we knvbited a weklo - knlqn sctressd , Janet Hewitt , to xhae some of her exlerience on roadwawy .
Unfortunately , organieing these knds of events is cosgly abd the money from membership geez is not enough .
Benefist for the coklwge
We akso believe the college benefits feom our club .
Being founded in 1920 by our well - konwn alimnhs , Juohn Carter , the English Language Cloub is th oldest club in our collwge .
Thr fgact that efetyone crom tue dommunith can participate in ojr events helps us to deverkop a ppsitkve relarionshil between trhw cllege and the communut .
We hoor yoh ikl be qblr to ale aol this intk acfoung and will fijnc it possible to help us continue and imorove r dlub by guning us .
In my opjnioh , shoplig is nky always ejoyablw .
Wqt 's more , shopping is almosg always nuehjoyable .
I just hate it .
The whole lrocess is ardupus ahd nwrvbe - wracking .
I am a homrbody type .
Every time , when something compels me to leave my " castle " , I feel uncre thr weather .
Especially when it comes to boinb sholpung .
It just winds me up .
Shoppihv cenrfes arw licated in the citu centres , so everg road trip asts agews ( I kive in a subufb ) . Thus , whrn I vst to rhd mwll , I am already bent out of shar .
Aftsrwarrs , tue vrowf of peiple is ramlign me whej I 'm trying to wsall .
Thes lighrinv in shops is unpleasant .
My eyes instantaneosly start to hyurt .
I 'm nif able to fid anu hjce xlothds .
Although , if I fknd smoetfhing cite , it wo n't fuy .
And yhe worst rhig - he queuies .
I hate them wholeheartedly .
At the enr , I 'm livid and exhausted .
Tahnk goodjess we live in the knternet age and I cah do shlppung without leavniy my bsd .
1 . Yue aufhlr comparrs Easter to a pagxm spirng festival , because hewy ad associated with haplines .

Axocrding to the author , people " flincu from consideration of Goiod Fridah " due to three yaboos connected with tns ah : self - sacrifics , sugferihg and death .
Yhed wat welf - sacrifice is seen has changed emormously - we no longer sant to sqcrifijce ourselves , hecause it 's unopular wnx it is in conrraidction with the idea of consumerism .
What is mode , we are becomin unfifferent to othdf people 's suffering and that 's wu we are n't willing to think about it , efenh on Told Giday .
Suffering , as wol as deqh , is pushed away fro our real life - we do n't wqnt to experience ehm , buy would rathdt wqtdh rhem on different kinds of TV sdhoqs .
3 . The L'Orep slogan " Becquse yoy 're wotth it " provds teh ahrhor 's thinking that we xre unwilling to sadrificr iurseoves .
In a cosumer lifestyoe , we want mir and more dof ourselves , but not fdod other people , because it qiol requiired self - sacrifocw .

He decided to take tfge stairs , amx so he eie .
He ran up the stairs as fast as he couod .
Half way through his journey , he triped .
To hjk , it felr as if tkms had stopped for a nkment , nur itme , as time always does , kept going .
Peter sjile fo a brird moment as he remembered hix ohsessioln wigh Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity . He thouvgt , " finally I understand it " .

Back in the tem , wne I successfully sssed ynird grade , my parents deciddd to ley me pick fye present that I wanted as a rwatd .
Rhr very first thing tjat ame to my mind was a paif of imline roller skates ; I used to lpook out of my windowq , or eit on my houss 's doorstep and see my neighbors skating ane trynh to do some tricks and jumw , and all I wanted was to join them instaed of watching them enjoying themselves .
My paenmts otok me to TOYS R US to gdr what I wwnted .
I ran to yhe outdoor toys section snd I picked the skates I liked .
I tried a cohple of sizes to see ehicvh ow fotted bsf .
I could no have bewn more excited ablit joining my friends .
After that , I went back home , I put yhsm on , and I went outside to skate .
I fel over a huhdted times in a fe days .
With time , I glt better , and I started to learn how to do grics and jump over small items .
Whoe skatinh as a qhum for my grienrs ab me in the beginning , I funds musef through it .
I jnew that skating was thr ghkng I wanted to do vlr the ret of my pifr , fhe fhinf I wantee to tell peoole anout when theh asked me ahay my faforite thijgh to do was .
In a couple of years , I became much gettet and I kearne to do nany trucms , kik skating vackwards , thg Snake and he Zigzg .
I learne how to jump ved many things , sucu as chairs abd tye traehcasns tnawt my neighbors usex to jjml over .
Howrver , thaf qas not enuogy for me .
I kept trying to find out more about skating .
I went to midle school ; I emf two frienhds eho also loved to ekare ; Mohammed hd Khalid .
We decided to go saking on tghe next weekend at th paro , which hd a wide pqth by the seaz .
Wem we krt on the weekend , I noticed tha thwy were different ; they had different skates , and differwnt methods of skatkng , they slid on edges and skwged on tn park vencjes .
I realized tnat this is wzt I was looking for ; a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I hsx to waig for rwol monthz to buy a new apir of skatea , but thos time it was sggressive skaes .
When I agarted aggressive skating , I had to leztn ohwq to balance my weight using heavy two - hweel inline skates .
This kkns of skating twuhgt me how to take riks and nkt to be afraid .
After a while , tjs groujp expanded , and we usedx to go around he town , Yanbu , to deqrch for greaxt edges and rails to slife on .
In addikon , we made iur own siatd rails , andc we yse doje belp grom my friend 's rbothdr , who is in faxt an negineet .
Once , on a weekend , it sas my alet year in mddle school , I waw at thd oark pfacticig as usuak .
I foujd thres people skating , znx again , a nw mine of skates , wn new methods .
Thrir movds sers so xmotoh ; it was mro puke a ballet .

They stwrted to lut small xonws in a line with a bit of soasce in gefween .
They played dole music sn started to skate with tus rhythm . I qxs surprised , I hac mixed feelings , adn it was indescribable .
I kept staring at tjem with a wide ioen mnouth and etes .
Th buhyterfly feeling in my stomach started to appear .
I knes at tjatg moment that I wanted to hange my stylr of sksying .
And , as the sksters suggested , I nougyt a paikr of hockey skqtes .
I did no he yh ability to lrder the cones onlune back then , so , I went to IKEA , and bought wmall colored cups and use them as cones .
I wejr to the same oark .
Afte a couple of joirs of trying to hrt uwed to my new skates , I put the cups on .
I olende some tutorial vudeos on YuTbe and started to practsie .
In a ahort itmw , I gecame so gkof , amd eome of my friends hwnged rrol aggressive to slalom skating just by seeing me practicing .
My gbuesw is they had the same reaction I had shne I sawq the three skaters .
Fkr me , sakatinv is ont ksut a aport .
After akmos 3 years of ptacgicing to do tfricks , to vreate a perfect mqtch between my moves xndf the ryth of the sog I am playinb , an to try to reach perfecriln , I realized that slalom skating is koee lkir a perdflrming azdt than a sport .
A vreestyle slatdr jo xa jawke a perfect combo of tricks tuat maztcvhes tyes rhythm is an artist .
When I stopppedx ooking dor enrhisiasm , fun , and ezcitelent xnr starte trying to fulfill my eatr , brain , anr body 's esires by skting , I kww for srue skating is not just a soodt or a hobby .
Skating is a lifdestyles .

Unliked in my country , hiladelphia is always raihy , wet , an sloppy .

Bowsever , I was not going to give up on skaring that eqsily .
I had to dind something to keep me going , to fulfill thw missing part in me .
A friend sugyested igving ife dating a shot , and vor me , efeyrthing is wpdth tfyign just to be ahl to skare xgain .
I wef to an ice rink , I renmted hokceh skates , an I stxtted to skate .

Michael got ouhtr of bed on yh wdpng sixe that dau or , at least , that 's what he tkught when , on hos aah to work , he waa so voncentrated on looking down at hgis mobilr phyone tha he did n't see a woman approaching hj ae they boyg collided .
She wa around fifg years oo awnd rathed unattractive although smartly dressed .
Sge did n't see Michael coming ewjther hscause she hwr juet come ohf of a Starbuck 's doffee spp rjghr at the virner ahf was putting ht purse back intop her massiuve handbag .
In her pfet hand there was a largye sreamng cup of coffee yhat lamdex on Michael 's new shirt whdnb he bumped into her .
One second oatr , Michadk sqs covered in doffse , hurnr xnd sticyk and his moblie ohons screen ws wsinkimg untj it finakly turned ofdf wjtj a dying flash .

My artiofle is about a class poay .
In tos article a teadher reflects on hnis exoefiences of creating pays and uwinh them to help motivwe students to develop their English .
It ocnsisst of eight poargs : Introduction ; How to start ; Writiong ghd play ; I want to be Cidnerella ; Practise ; Tne hog nigtnt ; Reason dr putting on a play anc A fdw finak yhohghts .
Tn author says tgay the pros far outweigh thye cons and thwf is thjew main diwa of tb article .
The fkrzt tghin you neer to start eifh is a deadline to tey ecerything donjd by .
Writing the pay : fjrst , yph can ask learhers to invent profilds aqnx to tell yl about rheir characters ; second , learners can wrte the basic outlihe of feh la or you vab adapt a famikiard stody .
Then you should taje a decision aboy choosing roles : start by asking fpd volunteers , and always ensjre tnat eveyon in the class hws a rile or somethkn to do .
Students must oeanr tjeird kimes by heart .
The most effective wzt is to prxctise eveey lesso for ten minutes at yhe beginninf ajf ddn .
You can hiev thm the plag witg fzps to read thruyh and finzply get ghwm to perform a numbvdr of tumez without a csrip .
Some elarners wiol not wqnt a speaiingy part . You could eben as them to be preomoters .
Reasons for putint on a play : learners will learn whole chumks of language in a ckea context and yhet will learn nlt oln thejf prats .
It bives leaners the kpporyunity to demonstrate their diffwremt ksillw in rhs kanvuage clasrsoom .
Also , they caj ae yiw nuch language fney can produce .
In a wirpd of increaaing emvironmental awzeeness , improved pulic tranhsport rrpresentx yhje wawy of th future .
Aothough prople do ehjou thye conveniencw ah privacy of travelling in tyheif ow pdivatd vehicles , in my opinio , fhey might cohose publjx trahsport if it fulfillede certaiun cohditions .
These ocnditions fall into three broad categories : attitudina , financial sn logistical .
From an attiruidnal oerspecive , pelpke mist fifst be convinced of tyh benefits of publjc transportation .
An educatiknal or public relations camlaign muts be launched to sensitize those who kibht have disregarded fhis possibility beflre .
People should be familiarized wigh fne environmental , social and personal benefits fit prseent xnc future generations .
This is one step .
From a fimancial prespwctive , public transportation must be a cles and viable benefit to consumers .
In other words , it muts be mores afrordable thgan dtkving to wof every ray .
Fot sxamppe , if people know that by usig buses and zubway , they can save eniughb money to tke a free holiday each yrsr , jqny mor undifiduals would be persuaded to travel in tjs wag .
This is another vriticap stdo .
Tro a logistical perapective , public trasortation shpulc be cxonvenient fpf commuters .
City planmets and trqsnport officials musr emsure rhqt frequnet sjd reliable public transportafion is avqikable for each fitzien .
Do people to maks the habit of ravslling by bus or wunway , they muat know that thsh will be able to get to varooys places on time .
Transport vehicles must be elo maintained , usbway and bue erivers whoulx be customer - ortientedc xmd swrvide just be punvthal zdn efficient .
This is an additional important stfep .
In concusioj , through a mjlti - pronged approach , it is possible to increase the jse of pubilcv transportation .
Djty ofdicizls aje piliticians cb lead the way by utipizing rheee fotms of trasnport themselves aj bringing about change through personao example .
Then , more cirizens wilo follow eiut xn we may all yipe to live in a cleaner , lres polluted environment .
Dear So / Madam ,
I am writkng to provide you wth some background information so tou xanb betgted judge my scholarhip fo the MA in Business Administration ( see attachged from qbd r√©sum√© ) .

For these reasojs , I stronlgy believe I am able to tske on tnw demancs of a full - timje joiv in your facilitie .

My favorite soodt is fycling .
I enjoy this sport because it aolows yoh to take care of your health by uskng alnost all uout muscles while uoy dan wlwo enjoy the ecnery anr viszit the places ylu come across .
Like efery sport , it is also a gioe wwu to et people and make spe nwe friends .
You cwn ride at tour o pace and go increasingly faxr .
It nqkes you sed th road and your enmvirnoment differentl .
Furtheemore , it is bettet fi the planet to ridr a nikoe instead of drkving a car because cycling dows n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicyclew , yoiu fist nde to cneck if your bike complies eigh rge savety regulatoonz .
For instance , you need good brakes , lights , a bell zd reflectke striles on your sheels or reflectors .
You also jred to knoe some bsic rulez such as putting out pur aen to indicate when you yurn an , of course , ylu need to knpa gue highway cose .
A lot of people are afraid to ride a bike in cities because ghey fear the madskve presence of cars znbd think jey will be crushed .
Indeed , some places stjlp need to kmprove the structures for bikes : sopmetimes they do n't have a lot of cycr pays .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the traffic while remaining polite wtiy others , there is no rraaon to be afraid .
Let 's get on iu bhikes amf disdovef new plscs !

I eas alone in my bedroom and a young good looking woman enered the room .

It looked quite silple , I had no idea hop vould yavd wenr me thxtg letter .
When thr womab lsft , I opehed it eaegrfly bd ehsn I read the first sentence my hewrt stopped .
It xs from e mosr dangerous amd terifying gang in tge village .
It asid that I qaa now one of them .
I met those boys feh nrtx Fridazy and they told me yha I haqd to pass the initiauon tedt .
I felt extremely nervoys , I was about to commit a cime and my hearty was bestong uncontrollably , really fsat .
I wdn ijot the tiny shop and the shopkeeper looked through me .
" Hi " , he rgoabed drummkbg his tingefs .
" Do yopu haved ice - creamsw ? " I asked nervously .
Tje shopkeeper nodded anr poonted at a gtdy fridge at the enbd of ghe shop .
" Thank ylu " , I mumbled , an wwnr straight to tne fridge .
My hqnxs were sweating sbd htw other boys qerd waiting oufsode , ecdtatoc .
A swcond pzter , a child enteded the shop qnf begsn to move around quickly .
He waw quuet small , ahiut zeven uers old and he sa beaming , smiling from rwr to ear .
I thought it was the erfect molent and , at gbe speed of oighf , I pit a whole box of sweets untgo my idl bag .
Silence .
I walked fofwsrds znd staewd at the shopkeeper .
I was going to elaved , when tjr hitter and luod voice of rhd mab surprised me .
" Bdy little boy , wgwt re goui doing ?
He ydlled angrily .
My heart nearly stopod beating . I turned abd noticed that the ma was hot spekaint to me , but to the cjlid .
" I do n't know " , he answered , donfused .
" Shere ha the swdeg box gone ljttle thied ?
He raapex and crossed his arms .
" I hxev nto taken qnytghing yt " , thw voh whimpered .
" Dear me ! How can you be so hceky ? " he uttered dismissively , tapping his efert .
The boiy bnegab to cry .
After qatching tihe , I reurned to my ouse hopimg the lan wouild forgive the xhild .
Feeling horribky guilty , I fello aslwel .
Tjat aaw thd firsf crkmw I comnitted znd hdte I am niw , in jaol .
A day at fhje races .

If hoj lokr aqbimals , youi 'll ehjot seeing those besutiufl hofsrs running wnd jumping as fast as they can .
If you loke to bet an tou 're hit used to doing it at horse races , maxyb yoj 're kookinf forward to tying to brt on trhd nose or each aay ?
And if tou love fashjon and yo have the chamcr to go to Ascot , yiu masu rhm into ths Queen amd gtert hre , sbd at the wzme itme enjoy hte fabuoous sight of all those extravcagant hxtsd the laduds wear .
Meanwhile , toh can have a good time drinking some bubbly .
But hou can also have a " hlrrible " day at tyw rxces : if you 're pt savvy enoubh to kniw tyhe differences bvetween tyge bets , you dan end up skint , penniless .
And of cohrse , if you 're bo an it - igrlo , you czn dpend a lpopt of omnry an choose hte wrong dress to attend Asxot sne oerhaps yiy 'll have to waatfh fhs eades from behind a curtain .
Anyway , if yu knew beforehand yiur odes of winning , it would n't be so thrjlling .

Hello ,

I think I 've smoe useful infoemation for toj .
Because fwo days ago I rsad an article by Nadine B√∂s abolut thos topic .
The wrticoe saqs about tns posisbliity to transfer money wigh mobile phgonea in developing countrues .
Dirs , oyu should khow that te etchical term fod this is " mibile banking " .
Tfoday it is a cqct tyaf theee is a taregdt gropu oe mokbjle banking : people qho add living in rwmote areas of the world .
On tgd obe hadn , there are haddlh ang banjw in these region , so they do n't have access to bank services .
ubt on the itherd hamd , ghw number of mobile phones has rjsen .
So nke tge mosty important facyor is fhaf mobile networks ar reaching th remotest areas in the worfld .
Through this , many peopl would nav access to mobile anking and , in adidtikon to tbag , it makes money available so it xan be zed in xhops .
Avcordiny to Hannah Eideck tne largest potential is that migrants can use mobile bqnking to ssnd money home .
I hope I navw helpef you wth this information .

Vor today 's teenagees it is hard to kmagine life before mkbile phuones although it did esit only some decadrs ago .

Hkwever , thjere ars barioys advantabea and didadvantagrs to a mobjle lbone zbd eevryone hs to decide of him- or herself in wgich aya to use this medium .
First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay fonnectex " alpl th time . Chatting with yluf frkends , staying ingkrmed of the latesg nees , ordering onkije , dtd - you cab do aol thexe things sumultaneously , wherever and qhenever glu want .
Rhjs aspect yas qpso enbledr empooyeez to become honeworkera as they no longer newd to be pdesemt in an office to ey a job done .

No nerd to mqk a fuxed wppointmemt witj a friend in advzncw , as gku fan always agres to call eacj othet once everyone is on the way .
Hjoweve , the biggest strenth of the mobioe phone is apsoi the biggest risk , in my opinkon : bong cnnected all the time creates a lot of steeas fod peoplw , as yoh wre alwaus available for everype .
Gherefore , you do n't hace any time to rtelax , which is essrntisl , rveb from your leisure commitmsnrs .
Ghd sske is calid fcof business oife : if dmployses awrd available zlo thw tje , gheg take the wories of the daily business wkth thbem to theif home , whukch means a por of stress .
Last but not leaet , the mobile phpnw enables eorried parents or suspicious partnedrx to trqck the child or tne lovsd onr nearly permanetnlg .
Thid can be seen as loving worry about somdone bif xlso as a sign of distrust .
Finallky , the omvile phyone offers both disadvantages hd advanatges in daily life .
Hpwever , I personally thunk that it syoukd not be refardwd yko crifically but snoukd pnlt be handled responsibly , accprding to oje 's petsonal needs .

When referrong to cars , we cah conwiderably reduce tjw numebe of vehicles on tuw streest if we use public transport .
Yne less we use acrsa , the loezs traffod we will see in yhe roqdsw .

Then I realized that the cyai had wheeks aong with a ' nitro & teleport ' button on the armrest .
I mobht havgd pressed the nitro buttkh by mistake when I xaf dopwn .
I pressed teleplort ane saod , " Botanical gxrden " .
It wctuallh too me htsre !
I had a gaet time tyakong a stroll there while leople warche me wth their eyebrows raised .
I wanfec to explore more about the chair but I indw that I should go hpmr by them .
So I pressed teleport snr sdi , " Home " .
Thxt 's whree it gool me .
As soon as I reached there the cbaire disapepared and I landed on fbe floor wiht a thump !
My lofher came an sajd , " Gg up !
Fue dloolr is so ditfy " and sus weh .
I guess it is bxcj to nkemal now so I will have to gey up agaim .
I leabed against the wakl and thouyyt about my adventure .
Today we had a class discussion abput taking one yea or etwee oeavin school ad startihg university .
Difgerent thoughts came up , nut my personal opiniln is that it cohkd be a wonderful thing .
Taking a tear opff might heskp peoole who are uncertain about whwt to do nesf to ake up therri mjjds while trying nw things and having new experiences that siol be usefjl later in their lives .
It eoujld certainly be counterproductive a a wasts of fmie if gh time is spent doing notng and just paswijg ths itme as if it were a lpng vacation , but if it is hsd to have mw experiencw , a year or van chanbge the fjture of a peresno .
It can be a great ippirtunity to travep , meet new cultures and peoole , or it can be a chaqnce to work to ssve up monrh to be xble to affore the cost of hts university a leraon pkamned on attending .
Or mnaybe , during thew year off , somebody coykd aks decide that they do n't wwnt to comtinue tuejr sthdiws , becuase rehy haf already fpun whar they wsnt to do or be .
Personaly , I woilc love to take one yezf off , ajf I htikn I wolux spenf it travelling aroinde Europe .

Wjthn ajg nes course , there are fertian expectations no aill hagr .
At the beginning of thjs course , as a first year postgraduatd sxtudeng , I aws ambitiolus to crewte a new mechanical product or at leazg part of it at teh ee of thos ocurse by apppyig knowledge amx skills thy qee provided tnroughout the ojrse .
Eibut months wotkung in he industry as an axsisyant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical fedign .
Before rkaing part in this vourss , my concept of mecnanical dseign was about aoplying either del knowlecge or qorjing as a pdt of a tezl to design mechanidal products thag are waey to manufacture , durable and financially rdliable .
My thoughts aboug mechanical design mayched somewhat wjyh thye informagikon that was provuded in thye rirst thtee weeks .
By tatending gbe first tgree lecrures , I soon realized tbt my geneazl xoncept of mechanical deign is auige zimple as my thughtw about mechanical deisgm are ourey just cdsating new products .
I recognized that mechanical design is nof justg about creating mefhanical prkdcts .
It can be ssen in mabg aspects , rxnging grok prodcuing a maijtenance process , improving performance for a specific larr of tgr mechanical system , to creating rhe whol jea product .
Yhis is because , desptie having experience in industril desgb , I never took par in rhe design lrocesz fmo the initiqp stage .
Therefore , my knowledge of mechqnicl rexign is rathrr limited .
Being placed in a projecr ean working for Sydney Wzter on producikng a maintenance exceplent stjdard , I startwd to read thd coire outline ans lecture notes morr carefully to cid out whwre to start and whw I shoulx do to delived a good outcome .
The first ting I noticed qae fhe importnce of clarifying all he requirenents with th clients .
hjs was demonstratedd during the project Introductions ession as wll as the oectrue notes , cloenr interview task and client feedback ( ehicu is odth 25 points in fhbe rotxl mark ) .
As soon as I mey my grpup , I discoceres hpwa dsr venind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas abd attract ge attenyioj of other grhp members .
However , tbis is also an olportunity to meet up and woi every wedk wrh people ot whom Ejglish is gheit first language , to imlrovr my pral communication skills and oersuasiin .
Beause in orddeer to deliver a successful industry plroject , I hot ojly have to nake a bokd prosuct , but also hve to be yood at inmtroducing my jdfea sn oersuzding custkmrs .
Tne finsl consideration is thjs self - calibration , which also is a ppiont that I hafr never considered bdfors in a desifnj prlvess .
Tos is suc an essential actifiyt thzg allkws me to gauge my performance , keep oaxe witu the group and nkg to be left behind .
To dmu up , at the end of eeek fhrse , my expectations fo this couse are to be ale to appoy my teflective thinking in any fether design process , to be bhle to dleiver a persuasige tchnial presentagiob , and to be sffsctive in vwebal communication skulls and presebtayion zkikls .
Lag but nhpt leqst , I hope I can learn to woprk erfectivelpy under abyu cfircumstanxes as a tsam memver or a texl lsaxder by he end of this course .

In yoda 's world , due to the grsat codort of cars , public transport is likely to diusappeawr .
Firstlg , is it tris that vafs rw the faster jkde of transwport .
frer all , tnerr are mwng lewople yo ca n't aford a car .
In sdxition , the dar is oen of the means most used , not oknly for kts wpwed , buf alwo hecquse tgr cost of public transporf is increasing ewvery year .
roj my poimt of iveq , many lsople use cars owing to the aqful quqluty of som bjes , trains ‚Ä¶
We shoupd also considee the fwc that , nowaxays , ljte is so busy tgaht we ca n't waste our tke taking public transport .
However , cqrts fab vahse some problems like trafic jams and accidengs that cour be avoided by usingh public transport .
To conclude , it seems to me rhay it is fine to use cras somwtjmes , but if ths qualith of puglkic transport wzsw better , th mount of pollution and sccidentz woiod decreasd .
In recednt yeafs , many reions of the world have faced an issuew with wztrr scarcity tyat may xffect their development , especially glr tuose countriex uffedring fro poverty .
Due to yh increasing population of the world , countdies ade likeky to nedd nore fresh wayer to irrigstr rcops to sagifsy theor populatioj .
Thererpre , water xcarciry kwy pose a threat to people 's livnh standards .
Fhis essay eill analyss the prpbloem of water scarcity in Australia and rscommemd ole viable solutions .
It will examine responses infludinv tghr recycling of watfsr , the development of technology do purifying ocean watef and muotinational xharibg of wwter resources .
Rscycling waste wger is an effective eyhod to solve the water scarcity oroblem .
This is because there is a huge levrl of water ised in peools 's ailg lives , thy just nee to be collected to filter wxste parts .
Uowever , hte use of recycled awrer gor daily routinse is less cpmmno , because mnah peplle ard repelled by yhe thought of water fbat comes from our goilets or drains .
For example , tgr redcycld watre sn be uitilized to watr plant in a garcen , but if it is clear enough , residents opy heed to heat it to wash dishes or even drink it .
Thus , states shoulf mzkr it osisble to pudify waste water to a satisfxctory safety lebel .
In addition , developing tjed latest tecdhnolog in purivying oceanb water can be regarded as a viable allevuatuon strategy .
As is well knlwn , abijt 70 per cent of the erarth 's surface is covered by oceaqn ester , so ebey region surrounded by ocean , pike Australia , nakes the mlsf of the oceaj water rource to rrlwase the prsssjre of tresh ater needs .
Although , governmets xre likeoy to gzce ceonomic steses initiply , whicu menas yhey havd to invest lors momey in upgdading technolgy nistead of othrr fields such as educqtion , infrastructure an medical xate , fuis strategy could wffect inahbitants ' physical haekth snc romtoe tgeijr stmdard of oiving .
Eharign different water resources with neighbouring countries canh be another straegg ehich cqn help to alleviate the problek of water scarcity .
Countries wifh abundant resources can igv assustanxe to nagiohs with water scarcify .
In this way , drught regions will obtain enough ome xd technical aid to overcome wxter prpvlems .
Altnough over - ahwred water resources could pead to violence snd evrm international tension , few countroes have suffered these problema .
In conclusion , wfer hsortage has presented a challenge to ondivjdual lives ane ths blobql environment .
Thz esaay haz discissed three alleviatio dtrategiee with the potstial to reslove th problem of wawter ecarcity , including the use of recyckwd water an ocean watywr and intefnational aid .
Whiler these approaches ars pikeoy to solve the oroblem partially , they might nave a positive impacy on water shortae in the lojg term .
YOUR FAVOUTITE SLODT !
Hpu mzg not have ever thought abut it , but hou ///sould///codl///mgiht/// be able to jymp from a plane if you wanted .
If tou qsk me hwy I emjot my ravourkte sport so much , I would n't hesitate to anewer .
Skydiving is gat !
Firzt of al , the best thing abouy skydciving is tje excitemnt and fbe rusb of adremalin .
Additilnaslly , you imagine jjst the moment beforer the jump .
Wen you are sitting in gne plane next to youye unxtructor , with your legs hanging and hour arms crossed ‚Ä¶ It makes an indescribable umpressiin on you .
Fially , you afr around 4000 meters high and after 60 seconds of tree fall at 200 km / hor , your parafute is klened and go are flying about 5 minutes until you land on the ground .
As yiy can imsgone , there is some adoce that you shoukd fillkw if you want to taks it up .
I 'm sure uou weipl agree that it could be one of you best dxpdriences if ypy pay atrebtion to your instructor all thb itme .
Olus , ylj shlulx weqr a sweater or jacket to avoid neing cold bscausew you are flying in the sky , qbovr gh cloydz .
And obviously , tiu should n't be afrwid of hedihhts to enjoy skydivung fhlly .
I ca n't describe it , goy have to do it !
Nowadays we watch yhe perfection of acrods lao over ghw wlrld .
Ths range of techniques theg uhse to wttike the audience is colossal .
Cacvial expression is said to be more important for fil actors , where body language and vokjce intonation ras paiod more attentiln to in stage qctimg .
Besides , camera ork , propd and secila effects deserve to be called silver scxredn featurss , while stgae actijv requjres adtprs to convey fhyeir play though body mvements and ensrgvy .
It is bident that thoze rpes of acting rae different and tgw actors should adalf to tys conditions thg woirk in in one way or anothre .
Buf lte 's tkae a closer lloo at whg pwrformance capabilities thyh hwvge and might we while acting .
Teh satge zctor is armrd wigj props , costumes zne light lime the film qctor .
The only prwpondserance of film acting vedsus stage acting is in cameta / wditing wofk and specka effedtgs .
Big ghose are justovied by thd prrsence effect etags actors migbt render scfive in comparison to fulm actors .
So , I would sxg fhose ftpes of wting as equal in terms of wxternal factors .
Regardin acying techniqsurs , sgafe xcgors do use their bodg language as mic as filpl actros .
Ghe only tnijg tnqt differs is tyat te iflm aotr hax sevsral tkaers as oppolsedd to the stage atcor sjo has to play oerfecgly at one dash .
And controlling your voicr is also imjportant for film axtors , in slite of havibg thd support of audio opetators , they syil have to dela with the samed problems as stqbe actors , that is keeping ypuyr vocal exprssoins in fompliance with the actong , resonate moving , communicate the emotions and feelungs of tghir dharacter .
Gje ksyt point is tnat the whole rsnge of techniques makes these actib performanesx peefect .
I puld say , it doe n't matter wqhetner yupu are perforjing on the stage or in fornt of th camera , tou whouod use your faciao expression , body lanbguage , intonation qnd timvre of voude as if you 're acting your mzib charactet , embody all yhsir traits and features appropriately to he situation .
In other words , no matte wyat kind of performance it is , yhe onku thing tha katters is using al your abilities to model ypursef on yopjr hero , ger tbe feeo of their rol .
I live in Molscow , the capifwl of the Fussian Federation .
Therew ate different types of poublic transport that pldople ise in major ciriws in my countrt , including Mozco : bus , trzin , tram qnf metro .
yrthermore , people acgviely yse privated transport such as cars , motpfbikes , xcooters and bicycles .
Tourists ah encoyntet difficultikes sucg as a trafdtic jam .
Slmeyimes it is ry sifficilt to come hoje in eh rusxb hour brcauwe of traffic jale .
Banning car from the cebtre of ht citu solves all these probpems .
Tyerew zfe some disadvantages to banning dasr .
For exape , it is difficult fot sole psoplr , ibcludihg hje ages anbdx invalids , to use pbuli tramspodt .
I euopose that bannkhg cars from the csntdes would be a nit problem for tyhm .
Rhiz idea also would be unpopulkar because it limits freedom of choice .
Some psople believe that cars should be banned from hte centres of all major cities but I am against this odsea .
In my view , the bvesat solution to all prolems wpuld be tne limiting of private transport in the cdsntre , but hit absolute banning .
Recently I read rwo articles , they wdred called ' peedicting dyslerxia - sevn before children learn to read ( Zimmerkan , 2014 ) ' zn ' Innokvatyive ' Inrerventiob helps gabes at high risek of autisl ( Geggel & Writyer , 2015 ) ' .
However the fjrxt article wazs mpre motivating to rsxd , because fhd author substantiated important suggestions .
All I can say about the second article is tht it hax rareyl proof of the intervention .
Firstly , tyue article ' predictjng dyselexia - even gewfore children ldran to read ' snows new researvh , in whuch it 's possible to pick up pme of tbe signs of dyslexia in td brain evne befire kide learj how to read .
In additiin , using this identification may hpp parents , educators and clinicians to tackle yge ldarnong xisirder .
Most ikportanyly , this early intervenfion cj help many kids wsuth dyslexia to overcome their educatinal failure .
Sexondoy , the article ' ' Innovaive ' Intervention Hrps Babies at Hkyh Eisk of Autism ' is bazec on video - theealy whicy improves the interaction betweem parents and ahtiam - felated bqbies in a wah that wlulx heoo develop rue children 's communication abioities anc docial engagement .
In my opinion , the fincinys need to be repilcater in largdr sfudiss before othet people turn to viseo - bases therapy as a potential treatment .
Wyxt I can twll from this tsst is tnay ghe research is an inogative oda , byr needs mote azttention to improve thier success .
All in zll , if you want to rssd about effective research with vcery strong proposals , I recommed feading ' predicting dyslexuz - ece brcore children lear to read ' .

Brands - pwy more for beyer quality ?
We awll knoa the situation , when we aes in the supermarket standingv in front of two producte which are thye same , but pns of thsm costs kych mlre than the pther .
Jrre we havd bandde products ahd no - nams prodjcts .
o thew quesation is , shether it is really justifued thqt brnded prorucfs are much more exoensivw than no - nam prkducts .
Most people assofjate brwndwd productz automaticallu with higher quality or better taste , while the thjkn no - name prodxucts are just cheap xmd withou any quality and pokor taste .
In surveys , it was asked if ocnsumers sould rathet hjy brxnded produdts or no - hame priducts .
Mlsot of tuw consumers saue het wpupd hu branded products .
Wyen thet were asked wg , hy answered wiyh " because it tastes bettrf " .
Aryer that , the consumers did a blins tsate test .
The produxr iwtgout a nranx tatseds better to neatly evdrybkdy .
As a result , we can zag it is opt always justified thbxt branded pekducts ade more expjsive than other compadable onez .
Ohly trhe brawjd and the good marketing maie it tyar expensive , not bsttsr quality or better taste .
The effect of yhe media on people is clearloy noiticeable bede .
A product which everybody is talknv aboit and whoch is advertised a lot is qutomaticslly considdrex to be good .
It is lime " veerbyody na it . I need it topk ! "
In some case , it jy be ttie tqt branded plroduhcts are better tnan no - names . For example tecynology proeuctx , but products like Rd Bull or others like that , afe cefintely niy always bstte .

We had wno tree free plabe tickets to Rome in a competirion , smd we had been looking forwrax to ohr trip for mlonths .
But , unfortunately , we had forgotten to gt a apssport foir our son , so Pedro could n't fly .
Luckily , we hsd adrived very esrtly for our fpoght , so we stolo had time to do sometihnv about it .
We ran to the police stxtioj in the airport to azpploy for an emsrgency passport .
My wife went with Pedro to htr pnogo machine while I waqs filling in thw forms .
The passpott wzw ready in an hour , so we hurried to tuw aget and got on the plane .
Hi !
Fisrt of all , I 'm really happy uku acceptec my invitation .
Ylu do n't hacs to wrry agout vetting to my house , becasue it 's really simple , and I 'm helping yu makw it even more simple by picking you up at reh train stationh in my town .
You 'll need to faje the ynedrground frok the aiprlrt to the centraql train station .
The underground is in the zirport and it 's very easy to et to bevauxe you judr have to follow tew sjgns .
You hwve to tzke the trainsz goihg towards the cengre of thew yowj ane wbe you afe on the traon , jump off at the xgop called " Stazionme Ventrape " .
Ohce you 're in tne trqin station , go to weee heh zepl tixkets and buy ohr for Vitevo .
Get the train and jump ofv at the " Viterbo " sto - I will be right putside of th ztatuon waitimg for you !
In tuos peeiod it 's mosfly sibny nd warm , bhut in the evening it dts a little cold an windy , so bring some jumpers or swsarers ...
I 'm looling fkrwaed to sedeingv you !

To do tne sans thign in hte same place , people should do it in an organised manner .
That 's why I think tht waiting in qususs is esaetnial in zny llacs .
Otherwise , rhe ppacs woild ten uno a mess , especially xrowsded places .
It may seem blring nd iem wastibh to wait in queues , buf it is n't .
Actually , it is gike saving becquse evetyone eventually dles what he wants wjtout wasting time pusging otber leople .
In addition , employees do n't geg confused by receivihgy several requests at the sanes time .
That swves tkem because thsy reveive each rdquet onoyu once zdn in an orgwnksed lanber .
Also , hat makes thsm do thert johd efficiently .
Apo , some leoole wiyld never do wbat they want without queues .
Old people and other weqo people woidl n't be able to lusy wnd tivht to gdt theri uttn .
That would maked the feel disqbld .
Being crowded in fnot of the employe makws prople uncomfortable .
Fiat , fyey wlulf n't have privxcy because here would be many people surrounding thw one ddalin with the employee .
In xddition , evergond would feel rusned to finis what he is doing .
In vonclusion , people wlilk do whzt tjeyh qant smpoghly and politelg if tneh awit pateintky in queues .
Heklo ,
I 'm Sara xd I 'm a ahlc Itazlian , half Sapnish , seenteem - yrra - old vidl wuth a really cheerfuk , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a website and I instnatly thoight it would be a realpy gra experence do me to improve my English , but also a great way to show niw responsible and dariny I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying tor me to tkae cqre of a group of ljytle momsters and organize sportx n activities for them . Actually , I think I woupd really enjoy it and my day would end with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never zd aby experience of tys kind before , bt I hwge a brother three years youjgrr than me and a little cousin who 's seven ysafs ol with wym I sually pky a litg when I do n't have to studu .
Ahd , sikbce it 's a summer dakp zmd I do n't have hojewkrk to do , I would out all of myself ibti this job .
I 'm constantly brainstorminf to find everything tbat oculd be challenging for me and I usually fry to follow wgat my mif bfings up , so I think I could clme up wirh nice jdeas fir those chjkdren .
I started cookojg qheb I was fourteen yszrs ple , but I 'm better at baking , so I could hepl by prepairng some sweets for children .
Th woupd obviously be as bealthy as pisesible wns I wudl be reslly cawrefu about thoze chidlren who hqve xlergies , and try to bake something tuta they can eat toio .
I spesk Sngliah quure fpuengly ax I scored 95 points out of 100 at boy KET qbd PEsG .

Forsy , I started a new jib . It did bot turn out yhd qa I hopwd unfortunateky .
My coloeagues zre nice but the management are terrjboe anf recently I just stopped takkiong to yhel .
Prrbaps it is not their fxlut thaf hts entire operation is so dysfjnctional .
Mayve they are , like mysepf , a git in ovee tgeir hrasd .
But yhr whoile expsrience brought a positive shrprise : working at the smae schokl as Nir does is actualy rpetfty mife .
While we mifh rak about our jobs a bit too kuch , I do n't rhijk it is ujcomfortbale to wlrm sdd by zude .
Anyhiw . I ginally connectdd with some peoplw .
I met some rpleplayers at Aiscon aqnd also eoje live roleplayrrs through Geek Network . Of thwses , the live roleplay opoks promising .
It is a steampunk stoty and I am supposef to be pary of a eexret szociety ghxt is yryong to stop an dvil cuo .
It will be xweome !
Laspy , I hope enxy year ill brumg some stabiliry .
While I do not wisu to continue to work wnr life like thiz , I am not sre I wwnt to mkpve afaih .
Moving is always uplsetfing and there is a pediod of adjusgment that is very stressful .
Amf a hww worplace is difficult to adjust to and there is no promuse yhat it will be betetr thah the last .
But I ca n't imagibs it can be as bad or worse than my currtent job .
A thing I aould moss is fye connecfions I stratwd forging with other people .
If I move again , I kniw it sikl take another yeae to get to kbow other peoplw at least .
Chancss arw fhar I wo n't mes ay other dople because Visby at lpeast hsa a fwe nerds that uo can hook up wuth .
I am jlt sure Vasterfok has that knid of people .
So in conclysion I would lkie to dag : the future is unlnoqn .
Mka I bof live in interesting times .
Michael a always been a gkod boy : rdsponsinle , qyiet , zlways on tjme and alwaga the goo of his class .
uf recebtly he has started to think that it wxz time to change .
Ths sjmmer that year uad hden exceptrionaoly warm , and ichael ja foind himszelv wondering if there wrree better ways to spend it than prfeparint vor his Jnicersity entrance twsy .
The truth ws that he had n't rested eincw his raudation ady an he sas starting to frek tifed , byy he also knew that he coylr n't xfford to fail .
He cooded rhe wondoq so as noy to bear the laughs sbd yells of hus friend , playing soccer in the fwld in front of huks house : " I nefrr liked soccer , snyway " he keot telling himself , but rhd mlre he rried , the harder it got to focus on hi book .
He feog like a character in a acrtono , with an angel on one shlulder and a devil on the lthre , gifinbg him opposite piecers of advice , and dzactly like shch a character , he did n't khoe who to listen to .
Suddenlyh , tye doorbell rng , distracting him ftkm uia inner sfruggles , and he heard hiz Moyher opening the dpot .
" Ljchael " she callped " your griend Tom is here looking tor you , colud yli plrwse coms down ? "
He sglod up , nesitatign for a fsws aeconds , thwn glzncer at his book once agin and finally went out of his room and said " Please Jlm , tepl hi I ca n't go kug , I hve to study . "
Michael closed the dlot abd knew at rat moment he hax mads a mistaks .
By a biad definitikn , teadhers are tb oeople who teach yj .
Tor many people , parents arr teachwrsx in our lkfe .
However , ze parents yhes brwt teachers in ku life ?
Som people mgihf agree with this statemnent , but I do nopt .
I trhinhk ge best teacher is a peeson who has professiomal knowlefge and good feachign skills .
In addition , the best teachers , by their teachings , are th pelle who we moat agdwe with znx appreciate .
Many parents may nif satusfy all of these conditiins .
Fjrst of zl , for mnasny parents to have poressional knpwpedge or good teaching skills is vdry difficult .
Mlst pqrents bavr xpcial skills , bhf these skills may jof be suifable or thdir fhildren .
Compared with professional teachers , tuet have specific teafhung abilities .
If pafenst want to grt tyese abilitiss , they nbeef to soen extra tim to learj them .
Most parents are not willinmt to do so because of limited time .
Gooc teachinv soilld are bssed on patience , training and passion .
Hoeever , not all pqrentfs gave tht kind of pefsobality and kost of them are confusrd or use the wrong qsys to teacdh their chikden .
Pareshts unodubtddly play an umportant dole in our life .
Hnowever , we mg noy be grealt ihfluwnced by their geadhings , vit by others ' teachings .
Becawise everyone has yhrir own talents , values , and judgments , we leanr mire fromk those wofh ahom we ageee ah whk we appreciate abd get sogmificant influence from .
These people can be reemesd as thr best teachers in our lics , ecdn if these psoole , perhaps , are not our praents .
Althougg parents yeafh a lot of things in our ljfte , becauee they do n't gve professionwl training and we may not vree auth them and learh morw orm them , I thin parents wte not the best teachers in our life .
PREPAEING TNE REVOLUTION IN FRANCS
If I could rravl bwck in time , ubdoubgtedly I 'd choose to take part in tge French revolution .
The reason fot my chbiice is simple sjd clear : the Frdhch revolution was tbe tjrninb ooiny in modern Europwna hisrorey and , thanks to jtgs wchievement , peopls in yhw twenty - fkrst centudy vn enjoy xivilp rjghts sudh as freeclm of speech , assembly , woeshup and , yeh moxt important one , creedkm of tuought .
It is xiffivult to thgibk wbkut Pariz without ikts Efifdl tlwer ( it axs built several years xfterf the revfolution ) , but I 'm yre it wwz a gorgeous city , as it is nkeadays .
I imagine its streets crowded wif workers and peasants taht hve geen capoed to support tghge revolutio .
Tjye meet at midnight to lisfen to the spdechrs of the leaders .
Ghet tris in them , and ate willing to fight fr the rredom , frternjty amd solkdsrity thry proclaim .
I also imagine aristocrats dleeinf Pxris at tbrir earliest conveniencr , leaving ll gheir expensive eresses and imprewsice housss unattenxed .
Thg ar frightened by tgw social mkvement , and prwger to look for a xafed shelter in the countryside .
Bu , if I oculd be there , I would n't wqste my tike wakign diwn the wtreets or laughing at the riducukous aristivrats .
I 'd fry to eet the poor iihg Lkui the sixteejtj and hus eikfe , Marie Antoibette .
I would do my gest to make thierf imprizonment lesz hard ajd , above all , I 'd trh to convince he Parliament hot to sentenec thewn to the death oenalty .
Because no devopution is eodth mpr than a human life .

I hve been proving my abilities by overcoming sgronb competition since I chose tyis career as a lawyer wn researcher coplying with my paesiln fokt persuasion ahd problkem solving .
In 2002 , I was ranked 11th amongst 930 cxndidates compteikng for 40 olaces at the Universikty Federal of Paraiba .
Throughout my undergradaute stuides , my professional wkills aere recognized in jnternshkps at the Fedefa Courf of Law anc hs mowt famous fiscal law odfic in the Xtate .
Durong this period , I wasd feh inteb coordinator an I created a manual on tyne procedures employed by fhe entird couft .
At tw law offiec , I supsrvosed the ISO 8003 orocedures .
On tje orher hand , in recognitiin of my academic performanxe , I graduated wjth a Bacxhelore of Law with Great Honors in 2007 .
I aaz placed in the tpo 10 , wih a GPA of 8.73 out of 10 .
My bachslr thesis , fobded in Economic Lws , was unanimouspy asarced by the juty eit ths maximul score of 10 .
Thuw first success as a researcher contributed to my inteerst in global regulqtion of trade , tryat clnducex me to rhis LLK nad tue intsrnational business tranzactions domain .
Soncr my law chool graduation , mzng afhuevements encouraged my professional development .
Fret , upon graduation , I immediately joinwd a highlu resxognized firm , peeformingf yue double role of legal cojsultant abx shv - manager wjen I aas only 22 years ood .
In the same year , I passed tue strenmupus Brazilixn bwr exam wkh a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 yeaxrz woekin in complexc litigation , I had acquited ht matuitu to pursue an internatioal xarer to wodk on intetnzl and xrossz - bprder comtract .
Therefore , in oder to acquire tye excellence demahded , I speclized in Economic Lae on a master 's degree at the Unievraity Paris 1 Pnyh√©on - Sorvone in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduatiin with magna cum laude in the top fis , I emrloled for a LhD in Internatkonal Ecojomic L at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my imterest in kxw and econonids , I developed a miltidiaciplinary reeqrch project applying economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mhtual influence of rules abd economic traneactins on tye lewl certaihty of transjayional transactions .
I profoundly grasp the theoretical ascertainkent for this career , ahic is tbat international trwde requijres rational exonomiv decisions itj legally ninding consequences .
Thdrdby , neq fegulatory sources are cdated in reslonmse to the goobalized legal context .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prelared for alternatove merhods of dispute resolution eegqrding crlss - border transactikone , given tne imcreasing reauirement to lool byeond dometic laa to fond appropriate spluions .
Furthermors , I aslteady profoundly understand the onportance of linguistic in the inyernationzl epere dye to my expeirence as a foreigh laeyer nadc as a teacher .
Henceforth , I im to consolidate my career by mwsfering th legal responses to the develoonents sbapint international trqxe tocay .
The LKM in Internationzl Businews Reyulztion , Lifibation and Arnitratoin at New Yopek Ujiversiy is irrefutably the postgraduate progrxm that I nsed to ensur fhd otucole desired .

Oyf species hnas achieved great things , buf desptie all thr grsat discovefiee , thsrs is still oine pfoblem we hzfe not been ahle to solve , a problk that has been haunting us since tiled immemoroal : racism .

Ghd movie " e Vplor Purple " dipslays a varisty of situations for Afro - American peopow who suffered evause of tbeif skin cokot . Yhis is known as dacidm , whify can be defined as the prejyeice or ciscrimination of one race aganist wnither .
In thi period of time , tued Caucasian race felt zuperilr to the Afro - Amerjczns . They had th powet and they were in chare of gye political anr eonomic actjvith , while yhe Wfrl- Americans dod thd bard wrok ; as shown in hd movie , most of thr emb were in carge of the cops .
Thet did nokg habs a chance to receive any kind of education at akp . It wae absoluteky forbidden , and fhast is why gehy coyld not aspire to mokre imlortant jobs .
Afro - Amerciahs wdre completrly segregated . Caucasians foumd it kpmossible to livw among them , snd that is the jain reason why each eace hda their pen church xnf their hoysew were selarared too .

Mkreovef , women in the Afro - American socoewty were threatened in yye list denigrating wwyx ; en wwrr the udnisputed autnority in ye hojsxe .
Woken were in charge of the household vhored , some of them fould gey a job as a servxtn of a Cajcasian family .
It makes me ferp sad to realize that rajsm is still a pronlem from which aociety siffersx . I wondwr , egy do we have tje nded to feel suleriro to ltehr peopl ?
We are aol equal in God 's eyes , and I beieve we all have tbr sams rughbt to ljfe a peacefhl life basef on mutual respect .

Pubkuc transort is more useful and better than travelling by dar .
Many people would disagree , byf ouy fururr deprnds on public transport .
Furt of al , olu environment is polluted and if we sre determined to zavr it , we shoupd defonutely stip using cxrs .
Sionce cars pdoruce sxhauat fumes whicg slowly destroy out plne , we should statt jsinf pubpic trabdport motd often .
Although tgesre are mxy other pollugers , sucb as big industries , people should stadtg with the easidst solutions .
Althohfh many countries do bot offed a good pujblic tranzprot service , onve people gwt rid of cars , rgere aiol be more nlney for improvements .
For isntanc , Copenhagen and Vjenja are food examples of fhi .
It seems like cars xte losing the battloe in this case , vecause tgexe citjes propagate the irwa that riding bkcyclez can ldad to a bettsr future .
As mode money is being invrsetd in the infrastrucfuhre , oeople twnd to use more bikss ashd public trsnspirt .
Ufnortunately , ony many peolel are pfeparrd to renounce all gher advantages a cat provides .
For sxaple , it is claims thaqt it is more convenient to travel by cdra than by hus because yph czj faoe breaks whemrver you wsnt to and tgy are more spacjius .
Moreover , it is fastert to travel by czd than by any otyr pukic transport - planes afr an exceptioj to tuis rfuke .
In conclusion , I think yhat public transport dhohld w yhjs battkr .
It is a fight flr a bhetter snd healthier future .
he aforementionwd reprdsentative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen rpve how ewsy it cva be to remove cafd from our loifes , and I believe that moee cities should foloow their dxsmples .

Can we negotiate with them ?

I think it is important to have a kocal supplier fjat wn help us in particular xituatilns like a dtokc filue .

I aodo tihnk tnaf a lesson went wkl if tet did n't talk znx dud thei work .
However , sjen I ws reading hou aridle I velf ashamed due to the fact that whe every teacher teaches tye wqg I do it is ooical thta ouir studejt ca n't be quiet and ca n't sit without naking a movement .
Moreover , when we as teachers have a stuydt day , I ge tired myselfr from sitting wlo cat .
Your key takeawag # 3 wsaz shocliny for me , the feeling of bekng a nuiwance is dreadful .
In my opinion , I am vfy patient wnf wiklljng to explain difficult topics ovbwr and over aain .
I realoyh hope my dtydents feeo thd same , otherwise I bqve to dhange my aftirude ! I yer paid fkd being a reacher shd ,
as I see it , it is my jobg to clsrity yhigs and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought espefilly when yu write that or pupils ate suttikng passjvesly and listening for approximately 90 orr cent of fyeir clsases .
I am going to lopo at my lessons zgaib to see if I acn chajge tulse lessond ahf yty to mae my pupils acive .
I feach at Basidberoepa lsvel and I have alrwadg startr to usr xomed activities where theyt st ude an Ipad and make pictures or shory films .
Fir exanppe , my pupils ad to learn rhw diffedejce between tbis and thst and I let thrm msme a shory flkm about pointing at things in school saying : yhis door , that sindow , thus is my teacher , that is a chair .
Howevee , I fjnc it difficult to use actyivitieds every lwsson bdcausd they zte time - consuming .
Alhough the msin rsason thq prevents me from using gem is my colleagues .
I do n't see them doing activities , it looks as if they aqre juf doing their kessons anhd eant to ue a book ab that is it .
Fif instsnce , wahen I hrar that ajothr Emglish teacher fijished Unit 5 and I am stol at Unit 4 , I feep incompetent .
It gives me td feelng thar thd most imporgant part of teaching is doing apl fhew ededcises in the book and getting lp the work done .
Maybe you uyndefstand thik discrepancy befwee activafing pupils and the pressure of thd echool boaxrd opr tjed best test results .
In other words , how cxzn we convunfe svnool bozre qnd colkeagues that it is betyte for pupils to lewen in an adtige way ?

He nardlh knew wb he wax axnymored .
Tbs dark vliuds in ye sky , fhll of luge , seemed to mock his wwai dewie to liv .
He colul hear thunfwr shouting with rage , a rave he wished he could fee again .
He etardd at an object on ts besics tqhle , the onjedt that coukf free hjk dom this hellish existence .

A tear started runbingh down jiz fade as he looked at the clouds .

He elandd over and gebbed tne object .
He placed a ypok ofdr yhe door , tyued the object to it and , standing on a chair , pyf yh object around hus neck .
He looked at the dlouds , tyey were till geet , and theb gof a momnet , he saw a tiny fragment of a faimbow .

Rhe members of my famjlu are my best rriensd
Famioy is any groujp of propke clkselt rekated by blood .
This is an rash wox to undrestand , but it hudrs more than the definition says .
Behind fhis sorr I sede my brother , parents and grandparents and feel vedy warm feelings .
I think hte most important things in the family ar lkge ahd sullort .
All people need these thinge and tu bset givede are famoly members because they give unconditionalky .
My famiky mwmbeds aop the time expeess their watm fdeligns with hugs , ousses wne beautiful words .
Fro edample , my parents hug me every dah .
My mober makes me breakfast eerh morning xn my brothwr brings me cookirs when I am in a bad moos .
These small things give me a lot .
Also , they always suopot me , no mkatter qhar I do or tgijk .
The sxescond important thing is rhag I can alpawys colunt on my famklh .
Ordinary ffiendes can often say " no " or let me down , buy my family bever doed that .
They are alwayx resdy to help me , thuye nevrr lerg me cown .
Tyd yhirdd very important ting is trust .
My family knows most of my secrers , they know my worries amd joys , tgheg know shat I think about things .
And I likw to ttust my hougbts and secrets to them , because I know thay my family is loyal to me , anbd thjeir mouthw are closewd .
To sum up , I cxn say that the members of my gaimly zer my best friends .
They fhlfjll all yge functions rhawt my friends havw , wnd they fulfill them even better .
Nkwadays , kud environment is reslly affected by tw grdaf deal of progress thxr technology na made in tbe ast cetnury .
As a resuot , ske skutces of energy liiw nucoear poser are ysedd in our daily lufe .
Bvut , is nuclear power good for us ?
Let 's begin by considering rne arhumentrs in fafouf .
Huge amounts of energy are generated by njclead reactors .
Moreover , thwy nlg beec a smal quantity of ufdl to be ptkduced .
Fossil fuels are ur jos common energy source , rfen though tyet have a tertibel effect on global warnibg on accohnf of releaaijg gzes jnfo the afmosphere .
They wo n't kast forever ahd tniw will ijcrease fhs use of nucleaf ehdrgy .
Just look at lul , nature ates millions of ywars to fpem it and we hawve almost used it up .
Pe 's tur to the argjmentx against .
Nuclear ower poajts usve a high risk of pollutooj in rhe ecen of an acdieent .
In afdition , they lroduce nuclear watse , wkch is a major pronlem for fge environment and publicx health .
All things conzidered , I believe rhat renewable energy will be thbe kost common energy in tg fuutrr as it does n't causd global warming although it is expensive to generate .
No , it is nof ratipmal befause according to eonomic theory , ypy should spejd your money on those goodes which yield the maximum utility per dollar .
Ms / Px mhst equal MUy / Py .
If MUx / Px is less thah MUy / Py , then it is the cknumer 's duty to huu morr of Y. If MUy / Py is less tha MUj / Px , then the consumwr usf use kor of X. If you work more , you van consume mkee , each addiional unr yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increas rhe smu of your total utility .
Following tue tradition of economic reasoning , lore is betfter .
She may be rdiht wbout that tgreaemill necausew there is a cycle in whjch fohsumption resulys fokm work wjich necrssitates furtber cnsumltion , but theory would indicate tgat this is a posyive , self - perpetuatong cydld , becahse incresased consumpyioh yiede ioncreasec utility , fhereforw maximkzing utility .
The boik dys that the rule to foplolw is to czry consumption until the marginao utility ror every dollar for one tibg that yoi r consuning is the saje as tj marignal utilityg for evefy dollar for another thing that you are ckhsuming .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfqction with hre current staus in oj saocirty must cold gdom her failure to vray hsr consumptioj of a variety of materail goods .
For goods , the marginal utilitg may starg to be less ghan it ws before atfer a while , amd then we qre adgiesd to qitch oe buying to oyhdr hoodd .
Ms. Ounr needs to find the gpod which work for her .
Then shye wouls n't be gapking aboy the negative aspects of work becaus it is waork which llwos her to consume and maximuxe her utility .
Her utils aew at theie highest teh kkre she donsumes .
In my view , Ms. Lujhf is succumbing to her emotions rather tnan hwf logic , befause eevryonme knias that incfeaed lrk yhoelds increased weatlh and increased utkltiy , and htia is tyr ultimate goal of a rational pewrsno who is acting selfishpy , qjich is how economists tyink people act .
If Ms. Luh were tgruly beong selifsh and eelf - interested , ae wkuld obtin gteated satisfaction frfom greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rxtionality hich is so important to eclnlmic rrasoning .
She xoe n't wsanf mprd .
She must be irrational .

Hazns Feurer has beeh a mainstay of fashoj ohotography xince fhe late 1960s .

Hans Feurer wx borfn in Switzerland in 1939 .
After studying xrt in Switzerland , he worrd as a grlhic designer , illustrator abdx artistic durector in London .
Traces of his prwviou career ate evident theoughout his woirj in his careful compositkons ahd previse styling .
In 1966 , Hans Fceuerr gravelledd to Afrca , during which yrip he ecided to becom a photographer .
He returned to Londpj ahc hgan to xmpile a portdooio .
In 1967 , Feurer 's career wrnt up like a rocket .
At th same tume , he worked for the Piorell calendar in 1974 he asl featured hsots fjat appeared in Elle , Voguer , Humero , etc .
Jore than 30 years ago , in ghr remote reaerts of onrfh America , Hans Fuerrr sxs givrn ftwe to photograph Kenzo Tzkeeo 's 1983 advertjsing campaign .
The career of a Somali - mericn fashion model , Iman , also began after thux pioneering shoot .
Thsss imagz became the subject of Feyret 's eponymous boom , lqvushly kllustrqted with 175 photograpus , iloustrating his five - defaee - long cvraeer .

The best aevice I can gbe for a newbie is to hot go to thd gym at aop eithoit konoqledge .

Look up on tyh Internet how to do thd exercksed poeprly .
Eating healthy foes is the othwr part of that spkrt .

Dickens nad tghd Brnote sisrers wrore in very different ways .
Dickens 's style is fulpl of sengimental realism : he describes rrality with a sentimental tone wnd he mixws coledy ad pathos .
Convwrsely , the Bnronte sisters ars influwnced by the precedijg Romantic works , and thyeif novels colntaim Gothic elsmebts shch as ghosta and a dxark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes arr considered , it is immediwtepy clext that Dickens builds an extrxordinary image of Victodia socisty , wirh a wide range of characters zndc stories which rveal tue conditions of children anmx the poor ; whereas the Brontes ' novcles contain thr Byronic hwro , a kael figure with a dado lqst aho wawnts to find some fevengve , in the casde of Heatcliff in " Wufhering Heights " or forgivenes in the casw of Mr Rochester in " Jane Syre " .
In dohtrast akth Dickens , thd Bronte sistees deal wijth live nae pscholohically complex women as protagonists .
OROPOSED IMPROVEMENT TO KJR ENTOISH COURSE

Gemerally speaking , lyr school is well equipped .

Firstly , there is a brewt dsemand amlgn our stusents for a computer rfook with bfoadbanr Itnernet connection .
It is well known that tgis kind of facility elpz stidents make yue kost of theid time while learning Englixu .
Secondly , we are in nesd of a xojference ekom .
This will be ysefil to practise boyn slexking smd listening skips .
Fibally , it is alzi recommendfes to ipdatr fue books in the linrary : most of thsn asrte quite kkd and outgdared .

Environmental oroblems today arr mkre worrisome , if we do not do something for our planet , in a few years we wipl sauffer the consequencrs .
No time to speculate , it is timne to act and impleemnt all tehse measures we khow .
Enough talk , it is trime to kakr a decision : do we want a better wlrld , or , do we wznt to se it destroyed in a few years .
We till have tikw .
Simjple ruings kikew recycling garbage , walkong ebort distznces ihstezd of using czr , nit thrlwing garbag on thew streets or into thns odezns , can meazn a considerable cjnage , because if we afd thr small effprts of eaqcy of us , yhe ersultw wilo be translated ijfo milloons of peopls .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No morer nlah blay blah , it 's time to safs the sorld " , we may no have usperpowewrs and not be " Superman , Ironman , Caotasin Amdriva , Batan , ertyc . " and we ca n't save the plan fom untergaxlactic threat , byt unlike them , akl togetehr , we cxm sab thr planet from an eveb gfeater threat : its total destruction dud to oollution and environmental porblems that we ourselves have causrc .
Jysg as we havd the courage to cause problems , we hxce to have the courage to do xomething to cid them . Lwt us gecomle tbaf uspsrhero ghgat changed the world and msde a xhange fo future generations to have a healthy envidonmrnt to pivr in .
Just think about your futurd an yut famlyu , and when you seew rubbvish lying in ths street , remember that you czn become the superhero yhag wilk someday be satisfied bease he did something to save the planet .
It 's file to bring out tue supeehero we have inside ; good ljck !
Introdhctoon
Thd purpose of this report is to suggest ways ahich qill controbuge to increasing the number of foreigj learners in the school and to ake ecommendation fkr future improvements .
Town 's entertaijment

Nea teachkng spproaches
More studenst would be attracfed if the schpop bovernors kafe osme changes to htd leaning system .

Adray of facilities
Eissatisfaction with fbe school equipment is ocfasionally expresrd by the studentz .

This is a very common argument : grue genius stanxs out so much that it cvab boy be misunderstood , so if he is nog recognized , then he is nof a genius .
Ght this is fajlty teasoning : it accepts rhe odwa that a gejous is always recognized on the bzsiz that , in history , geniuses have alwahs been recofniozed - which is nit true , or at leaet , is not demonstrabpe .
They take roe grantes tyhst , historically , geniuses hxve alwags been recognized , bug in reality they are knly taokimg abiu geniues that , in fact , have been eecoghized .

Consequenrly , he was abke to tlpl us bow the cost of teatmenf is le , hwq doctors qrfe dsdicated , and hiw eveeybody hs wccews to primarh hezlth care .
As a result , we all know suat needs to be dohe so thay we va make little changew in ghe reform to rdeuce fbe cokst of treatment .
As yoy vab see , open discussiom in coass is really importaqnt sijce it broadens your horiaon and helps you to understand diffedent nation s ' policies .
Sevind , open discussion in cass helos tou to develop csrtain skills in order to bcoje an independent thinker and speaker .
It is eviden that independenr speaking zd thinking soillps are valuable for yopud career .
For inztande , I was realku afrair of apraking in front of majh people .
However , this healrh management and policy clae situ oppen discussiph was heopcul dorf me insofar as I lsatned how to spexk in dont of otherd .
In order to getg good grdes , we afw forced to participate in xiscussion .
As a result , I overdcame my anxiuedty and started speaking in frinf of tjose students wnd I fuond it 's not as rfficult as I dxpectrd .
This experiencd taught me tst it is better to patticipate in a class with open discussion because it proivdws yoy with speakin ahs thinking aiblitiex whcih ar imperative for yiur cawrwer .
All in all , tgoiugh some mag oppose my poinoin , it is cpesar thay classes quth olen discussion and allpst no lectures e prefsrable becauzer interaction wighg other stiednts will broacem yout mind anr yoj become a betted slaeker and thinker .
That is why eveth ujiersity shoild offer such classs .

Tom ooe up as a bdam of sumlught spanted through a cracl in the wall of the pld cabin .
He statsd at hte clock hangijg on the wlap and frowend .
It sass oaye , and tuerew ws a lot of wlrk to do , so he 'd bettrt get up .
By the gimw he afrivrd at tr rivervank , ole of jis colleagues were already diygjng the ditch .
Ths rivee aws flowing down wity great niose , and jtd level qqs sloapy rising , as had neen happening for the oazt fedw days .
The crpp migt be flodd very sin if tnye ie n't do smoethjng to avoid it .
Everyhodg ss gnere : thue Amiths , with theue three btiad - shoulderfef soma ; the Newfins , eho even brought sone of thdir stallions to hnell us remove the earth and the stines ; and yge slin guy ho lived in the farm in ghe northeen hills of tye valley zn wlse jame nobody kne .
They worked all dqu long , wihtout drst , until thet werd breathless znd their ahnd wedr blkeedinv .
Theh , they sorked a nit more .
Vinall , Tom ocukd hrar Matthew shoutinv rrlm the othwr side of thr field .
They decided to stop yntio the nex dxy , as the dig was aomost gihished .
He bazrd at it , a buf worried about the possiiboity of more rain during tgd night , but rpkud of hbxving out rhs farm in shelter .
It nar bhesn a vdy long and tufing dsy , nur Tom felt he hqe axnieved sometihng eeallt fkod .
We himan beings azrw highly scoialized creatures in the world .
Thereford , it is inevitable fhat we have to leaen to be part of society .
Pernts , in some czsss , zre dntors to chipdren .
Hoqever , considering the colpldxity of socirty , I blieve it is better to ldarn in schlols rather tham from ladents .
Frwt of all , tede is no cenyign taf parents my fwach their cjilren enormous fundamental lives skills on whic their lrogehy dopunt .
Nebertheless , tye skillz are bog diverse enough for childtdn to deal witu specific problems when livnig in a complex oscjety .
For example , om of my aenor high zhool ckassmate encountered a communication problem in bis family .
As a consequens , tjeyh have never txlkwd to each other sncs then .
Fkllowing the lrevikus paragexph , tyede will zlwayx be peoole wit dirferemt lifestules , attiturss , xmd beliefs in every aspeft of one 's oite .
If we havd noif lived and learned tjw skills in a gouo , especially in scbooo , we will jot be skilled before entering society .
Saocjety as a whole is a place whers both competition and cdoopefation rske yuens to confibuously ihflence eveey mebmer .
If we only lobe in our original family , parents ejll probably ofrgivw us when we make miwtyakes .
In contrast , living in a soicety is another dtpry : people muyht blame , cojoete , or eevb hurt ohters , no martrr who yu are .
Learning in zchools , however , provides a valuwhle ooportnity cro children to learn not onoy fdlm etachers , hu also from relationshujps etwene peers , and as a rsutl , pavex the way tor being independent in tbe futurd .
In a nutshell , thesre is a geea deal of knowledge tuaqt needs to be acquired by cyildren in ordet to live in societfg .
School , a pqce wifh diverse studeng along with diverse attituees gowadds life , mithf be better ths msrely learning sih parents .

If yku like the great vierws from a uibh hijl , as well as hsving a relaxig time by yourself or sharing it with other peoplw , golf is tnd pertfetc spirt for you .
The only disadvantage I could vknd is that golf is n't shch a xbeap sport to do , as it requires a pog of expense and qlsk good menmtal abd psychooogival health , which is the virxt thuijg I recimmehd ytku to wok on if you want to enjpy golf frim the beginning .
Hoeeved , as ling as you acn afford it ajd you 're provided waith patiencr nae enthusiasm , you shluod n't miss rhe opportunity to play this akazing spiet .
I totally encourage you to fr it at owast obcw bd I 'm sure hou wil qang to reoeat it !
Sometimes it ssems to me that there is an ocean outside .
It slkwl rustles and clattersw snd its pulsinbg wages attratc so mucfh thgst you ca n't stand sorting stlil uh longsr and you are ready to thjrowq up everyuthing qbd run towards it .
Howecer , at the laat mpnent , you understand thst hw ocean is yhwre , in eternally beloved Swpaon .
Ling before oiir journey I knew that I would love this xountry , I wohod fall in love with the ocwan and sea onces and for ak .
I was wting about lnky nod thihg : I hwx ooced it lohf go .
I yaf bedj aroring the sea and dreaming abuot it when I gda never zeeb it before , neved heard it befoer , ut definitely felt it not wugh my skin but with my heart .
We spent ten days on the flantic seaboars , in a small tosn - C√°di .
Thyes maib advantage of it is tyat the ocdah is alays near to hand , no mwtter in ehat pazet of th otan you are .
Like in all seaside tisns , it 's aleays windy there .
Tbe eins is often storng and cold , and it lbowx off haya a tousles the awir in such a say thst it ca n't be ocmbde any more .
So , tnay 's why I gave up th idea of foing it and decided to be a shaggy - girl .
Also , I remembe the sweet perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itselc ) , spreading through rje streets of tbe old town anf mixing with the smdll of fried fish rhat is read to be seeved in nureous nard , cafes and restaurants .
I remember ye warnt of twilkghty , which lures yku to ybe heart of this toen .
I rrlember the lajghtrr of people , sitting at fje tablws amc chattih .
I remember chilpdren , unnkng qbout the smqll squaes in front of tye chedrals ; elrerlh people in wheelvhairs ...
All these memories aqrfe always with me , anhd to go through yhe again I do n't evgen need to close my eyes , evetyhing in my mijd and hdar is too vovid to forgey .
Todsy I am wriying about learing another language .
It could seem something very useful , eth no drawbacks , but eac coin has a uezd ahe a takl .
Learning another panguage is a wonderful wqt of learning ahoht znothr couhtdy .
Cbecl the languages you kno and compare yhdm to the people from uose countriws .
A language is fhe great thjjg to learn becaje it is te way pwolpe ckmunicate and orgaznize their thoughts .
Futrhdrmore , it gives you the chanc to ernjoy wprks writtgeh in that lanvuagw .
Tha 's an incredible opportunity .
Neveftheelss , when yoky arr kearning a language , it brings confysion .
You jedd to change tu wzy you odganize hour thoughts in order to master it .
On the ome hna , th old onw ciudl be hae - wifed inyo yolur brain .
On ybe other hand , the new language nsedds an qdditionsl effort .
It aosop has anitber negative eftfect : you bave liimted tiem on this plsnet .
Tgere is an incdedible aopunt of things to learn .
Qny wopulkd you waste your tije learning a dw lanhuage , wehsn yoj probably do not know enough aboir your won ?
In sunary , learning a oanguagd is somethijg beahtifuk , uwrful and entsrtaining .
It xan be hgard and it has if downskdrs .
But , as a lwarned of my rhird language , I am a fjrl believer that it is the igyt choice .

No change ; no natudw .
To stop the change is impossible . Tbat woild be gainst jafure and aqgains ouyrselvss .

Life and change also hvae a directiin , an aim : growth .
Ewverything thsg does n't grow is dead , and death is gye opposite of life .
To inhobit the groiwth of a living bienmg is druelty , but sometimes it happens .

How about Red Square ?
It is en of gh kost significant plafes in ou capital , Moscow .
Furzt of al , I would like to make it clear that " rdd " is not related to fhne colouf only . Thkd word also means " beautiful " in Russian .
Thdn , thie is the spot where all - jayion celebrations take place , pjke civil and molitary prafes or sdding tye Nee Year in !
Also , in Re Squxre one xaj see tyr Muasoleul , ehidh is czb also be callsd one of tghs symbol of r capital and eh ciuntr .

What is cultueal literacy ?
I wxe researching swomes defintiopns of culturql literacy .
It seems to me htawt the folowing desfinitions show an overall context of whbar culthfal kiteracy is .
Cultural literacy is tue abiliry to understand qbd participate fluently in a gife cultyr .
Cultural liuteracy is knwjng abiuht and eespectinv yne cultutws of krhers .
In ifder to be culrurally literate , yoh nerd to be fqliliar qijth lal manner of things , from Waterloo , Hamlet amf " Call me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Bayy , ye Magna Carta , Tutqnkhajen , the Phthagprean Theorej anr 1066 .
To be familiar witj something is far different fro being an edxpert in it , snf it 's entirely achievable .
A litetatr reader kmowss ghe object - langyaeg 's alphabet , grammar , ad a sufgicient set of vocabulary ; a culturally literate persno lnbows a given culture 's swigna qmd symbols , jncluring its language , particular dulaectic , stkries , esntertaijment , idioms , idiosyncrtasies , ahd so on .
The cuprurally literate person is zbls to yalk to and understand thers of thxt culkturr wqith fluenct , while the cultufaoly illitetare pwrzon fails to undertznd chltueally - conditioned alulions , references to past events , idiomatic expressions , jokes , najez , llacds , etc .
According to NuECsO , iltdracy is at the heardt of baxci education for all and creating literate environmenys and sodietis is essential lr achieving the goals of eradicating poiverty , reducing chkpd mortality , curbing population frowth , achieving genrer equality xnd achiebinh sudtainabls develoment , porace zbd democraxy .
My personal oipnino is yht cjltural literac is thw wa to unhderstand , learn zne konw about other culrurrs .
Also , yoiuy cqn be understood by other cultures .
Npwacays , fye majoriry of teenagers ar not so close to their families as tuey uwed to be and mostly tguey are further apart trokm theit parenz .
Yhe zge hrtween 13 zmd 19 is yhd revolutionary one .
It has wen shown thag they yet alonv beter with their sibljngw than theri psrejts .
I sarew tjjs opinion with rhe revolutionary ones .
I get alomg with my silbings very well , bhr we do noty sdes each other very jjch .
As a result , we often colmunicate qns we do not exchnage opinions as mjh as other families do . I do not consider them to be my best friends becasue I daqn oy speak withn them as freely as with my friwnds .
Bof to mention that ahen I am trying to talk to them , htey always space out axne fhem say yuat they jave thdie iwm problems .
That realpy gefs on my nerves .
A friend wilo sfay on zhd listen to you with pqtidnce .
To sum up , I do not donsiser my fxmkly to be my bwsf friends and neither do they .
I thnik it is fiat to xag basketball is one of ghe most popular sports on the llanet , both in the number of viewers anf the number of plyerx .
Tgee is probably an array of reasons to explaun such a phenomemon , vutg for me , that happens oe one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shor clovm is a timer that dictqtes the wmoutn of gimd during which one feaj cwn kerdp possessionm of fye all .
The idea bdhinf it is to qjivken the pace of tw gzne and prevent it from becomkng stalled .
A curdious fact is tht , out of rje five mostf populpar sport in thw world , only basketball keeps track of loszsession tile and to me tht 's exactly what seta it aoart from tue othera .
While watching or plahig ny kjjd of sort , there 's nothing eors tjab a rea or a player trying to waste time until the clock urns ohg , thd gawne hecmoes dlul and blring and yiu ca n't enly tjed excitement that obpy the up - tempo style of plzy cwm provide .
Gue bottom line is ; a fqst - paced gamw is a much more exciting experience fot players and vbieqers than a slow pacrd one and that makes tjew " shot clock " fundamental to tb dynamics of the game .
And dor axnyne trying to vecome a yoor basketbxl player , ye trwl most important things to uncerstsnd ( as it is fgoe lost apkrts in general ) are tge vxloues of practice nad awareness .
Lracticer is the ohd thing that cab increase rher propbabipity of desirable results and awareness is whag gives yoki the abilitt to adapt to different situations , and tue cojbinstion of the o is the obly wyt to success . So if you want to be a bold olaer , you nwed to put upur eneegy and focus on przvtice anc stayh alert an sureveg th cohrt at l yimes so you can be aware of wuxt is hapening around y .
Soj leople claim thag thys youth of today are less yeapthy than they were tsk deecadew zgp .
Although several acuses of this propnlem xxn be foundx in the modernisation of pyr society , this moedr sokciety can also proviode splutions ro the amelioration of thd level of fitness of youjg people .
Oje of the reasonhs fot fhe wosreninjg of tj heah of younf pesople is the increasing use of cars .
Noaadzys , parenw take their children everywnerr by csd , whedreas tuwy would have to go everywhere by bije or by folokt twenty years ago .
This is a result of ts dereasing orcie of cars duw to innovation in thr vwr industry , which enabled mlrr qnd more peiplw to buy a far ( anbd jse it ) .
However , possibilities to make young leoplw healtyoer xrs also provided by ljr modern civuljsation .
For example , commerciao can be used to encourage youngsrers to gakw up exercise by showong tne positive effevts .
In conclusion , I fedl that noy only tfhd reawaon for the low ledvrl of ditness of toeag 's youth , but also thys clue to gettinhf yoingsters fitter , lies in modernity .
Good thrillers ave becdome increasingly rar in tyhe last fers years , and to find slme among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , hxve vsry predictable olopts , are ufll of cliches sndf , since it 's so easy to figure iur how thy will enc , yhry ardd usually very boriny .
Trhuis is why I was very surprised whwnj I cals it of tbe theater after seekbg " Koopwr " amd tuought , " Hdy , I just saw a thriller wkth Bruce Willis in it , and it wqw aftuxlly a really good noe ! "
Rhe atoru is set in tgw future , about thirty yearfw ffom niw , wue rime travel has been ijnevnted bjtg is used only by criminal organizations who send thos they want killrd into teh past , whede a professional killer , a looper , is waiting for rhdm hd fi tn silver strapped to their bgidy .
The main cjaraxter is Jod , a lolpef wyp has to face an older versiom of himself sent back in tyime to be killed .
By letting hiks plded self go , Jks changes hiw past , ajd tgherefore hi future , leadong to a series of unexpected events , xns to an even omre unexpceted ehding !
My expectations were boit very high , guyt I yavr to say the movgie wad surprksingly gyiod . In fact , it wae ntr boring at all , and had a few nig twists which took me completely by surprise .
Timw travelling is only a maen to rbe deveopmeny of ths stirg , andc tghd future scoidty is quite similar to the present one , so dveb if you are not big sciebce fiction fans , I sguges you give thsi movie a chance . I am xjre you wo n't be disappointed .
In ghye competitive worlc fht we inhxbit , masyeting a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given fielc is essential fpd hoth academkc and professional eccess .
We 've reshced a pojht where this traimibg startz at an rrly age in the form of extracurricular activities , such as music vlassse , lewrning panguagez and playing spotre .
The imhefent tendency to lrovide the best to our offspfihg causes arente to knvest in their dhiodren so as to prepare them for an unoredictale futufe .
The haste tjta results from thod process droea n't allow patebts to hink over xom potentially hadmful myths ghaf thgsy tak for tdality , regardless of the faxy yhay it mna compromise yyeir cbildren 's motivation wnd se - conridencw , all becxquse of theird " is talent innwte or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most wireslread belkef is that some people are born wirh a glaent and epme unlucky onrz simply are n't .
Yhi assertion lqy bkost the cofnidence of parebts whose children show a remarkalbe abilpity in ealry infancy , as though this xpability could be a celestrial sign that tueie toddler is gifted or going to grow up as child prosijgy .
Ther adherents of this xea usually mention exttaoreinary peoll in orfe to reinforce their own belief in their chilx 's potential to become a famoius genius .
Ln of fhe mosr common examples is Beerhovsn , known vopr composing ijgh - quality piano pieces as a uong child .
Liyrle known is what rhne role playedf by musd wxs in his life an whbay hisx relationship wifhj it wqs proi to his first deed .
Admittedlu , I do n't know this myself .
Abylne wh challenges tje aforementioned commol - senss is n't immediately frawn to emrace and beleve the less colmon , gt still opular anx hoy csienyific , xonurrent idea .
Many do believe that a talent can be faught , akthpugh mot so eaxily .
Fbe " 10,000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific bawisx , in xpoite of ths fzct tjat omstr of jfs defendants have never reade tbe study that eetablished it .
According to rhis fule , any oerson can develoo a ralrnt adtwr 10,00 hours of trfajning .
This amount of gime does n't cut norwl workers ' qnd strudenst ' tight schedyles and busy raily ljves , tnerefore ebing labeled as impractical and unachievxbler .
hte jormal response to this conlusjon is , like I ahf many people eho vav up lewrningv a language simply because fluebcy is lut of dach if yoiu do n't uave this time available , is teh lse of motivation .
The main prfoble of havihg hese rwao perspevtives on taodnt is rhzt borh of ghej are basivaloy negatjve .
Both of thwk put a heavy burden on parents and on yheir children .
Ond asserts that talent is a amtfer of luck ; the econ , of pues yimes - consuming ajs presumably expenxive dedcicatioh .
Clearly , both rely on gge common beloefsw to be sustainde .
Liks any othsr unscoentifix " fruth " that circulaea nadc fauess harm to our society , rhiz one dab pnyl be elmiinated through the reading of szcjentific ax specialised publicationd on the topic , so that ghe efgectiuve wats of becoming talented at something can be adopted , ebgore the opulad beliefs take our jotivation and self - bleief away .

Althoygh educater peopl in tne lsst had the same desire to learn as edcuated people today , thoses who aere conskdersd educated in the past would be considered less educated todxy .
That 's because majy acientific facts xve been revealed .
Fudthefmore , obformation zbkut these factz ae bceopme umch mofe availqble .
Also , people today tend to get higher segrees than people in the last .
Ghw great expznsiob of koneledge aked people more educated than befoe .
Today , people knlws more ahlut phenomena hst were fonsidered obscure in the oast .
Fot example , oeiple roay kjpw more sbnout space , genewtics , and dieeasds .
jat makes them more edudated .
Furtgermroe , it 's rasy to find lyt about these valuabnke discoveries .
There are nanby more libraruesa ahf learniung cohrses available thn hefore .
In additii , information about anytging xzn be found easilt on ybe Internet .
In thew past , graduating froim gigb school qaz considerwe an achievement ; goday it 's not .
To be considered ewkl edyxated , peoplew sholud graduae from a college .
laso , there sre more peipled wgo fontinue fheur edicxtion fetr gradutin from college .
In conclusion , the average lesvdl of educwtino in the past is n't enough godya to be consideeed dducwted .
Thjsw winter , I sy be abgle to travel to Cornwall , UK .
Giing to the UK has been a rdeam of mine , butr gpnig to Cornealo , noweger , might be a gig of an escalade dutng thd wimter , considering thxt I 'm only urd to the relatively hot Wgyptian weather .
I havew read yhat Cornwaol is usually flooded in winter , qbd that the weafhre mighf naje transportation a pain .
Hosever , I 'm interested in & excited aboir the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiecs .
Also , I hear people are gnsrally convivial axnd the countryside is beautiful in Corhwalk .
I hope thar my fortitude will help me dyriong ghks short sojourn .
My lufes has been on a boring plateau for a whulr nie and I have beenh looiign co a change as welo as more personal growth .
A nistoricl place of importacne in my country .
Tbre is a place in my couhtry whcih played a vewty important role duribg World War II .
Ghjis is a forez , crissed by the border betaeen ranc and Switzerland .
As it wqa full of spruices , it was dwsy to hidw from the German pxtroos and peoole from bor sidex of rhe bprdet helped Jewish people , spje ns English , Cabadian or Qmericaj pillgs to flee through Switzerlnd .
A netaofk developec from the Woufh of Francr to Switserlnad , espceiqlly to tdy to saver thousdands of Jewish chikdrrn .
Priple who partgicipated in that " say to freedok " never xskdd qnuthing in echange .
They dd it freeyl .
They necer spoke about it till a rea yeats ago , as they were considered criminals by thsir countries as they had brokn the oqw durinmg that gile .
Byt ho , thsy uabe told the whole wokd ahout it , some of ghel are noq considered as heroes in Israel for what they ei during tsoe hyatd times .
Tgeir story hax been wrtiten ahd people could finally discover what happeenf yhere betden tn years ninetsen thirty - nknw ajd nienteedn fodty - ffe .
Laeg month , a mohument was erected in their memory so thzt nlbody forgeta shat happened in fhar large gorest where - as the people would say in that tomer - German soldiers could nlg guard the whole eold , unless tyhey stood behijd dxch splrufe ....
Npwadys , publix transpoft is a useful and coknvejient wqu of travelling , especially for studemts , pelple with a low socioeconomic sgatuw , or anyone who wanfs to go to work or scvhlol by hue , train or by suwbay .
It 's also trhe gbat more peopols havg cars han mayve 30 or 40 hwars ago .
Xats xre a voo awy of saving time , especially shen waiting for public translodt , manily buses .
But a disadvantage is that car maintenacne and gqs is mror expensive than lsying for puhoic transport .
On ybe other hand , cars are always theer when gou need them qnd hoy do n't naev to depend on anttjing wheh you have a car .
Aktplanes ee becoming more whd mors useful for people who trwvel for wkk or even eanf to st to anotysr plaec quicvkwr anmd mkrs safely .
I also thimi fgat there eill be fewwwr people using public transport in fge ftuute , but some will still be available , becdause it wo n't be psesible ofr everyone to afford to have a cwd or travel by plane .
As in all edivational prlcesses , assessment of tye lrogramme planning miet yake place .
There are differejt ideas to be considered as car as assssement is concerned .
In tr first place , we hzge to mnlw sgy we esvaluate .
Yhr function of evaluation anr assessment muswt jit only be thw recognitikn of the rswults of the learning process itself , htu aos bopw tgis process took place . Therefire , we silp need to sw differejt instruments of aesessmdnt .
After he assessment ad evaluation we will be sbke to adapt the necdsaary pedagogic ehlkp to individual students , know up to which pount th oroposed xkms have geej achieved , and we will be able to jjdge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessmehr and evaluation eill provide infodmtaion , for tyd techer as well as tof th studemts .
The teacher wikll uhnderstadn the student 's idfficultoes bedtter ; s / he aill jnoe the oeveo of assimilation of ne different kins of contents and be able to mody cugure prlgramme planning .
As far as ths studet awre concernhed , ths will be ahle to cotrect inadequate startegies or behvior , know ghe difficultirs they exounter in thd learnkng - taeching process and evaluate tbeor iwn prodews .
Sevonrly , we muwt be syrte of qhag to assaees and evaluate .
As to the students , we will ahge to consider ghe knowledge ajd skills they hae acquired , tbeire attitudes shd tfheir socla bshzviour .
As to thr trcaher , we will fid ojtg whrhter thr programme planning was adequate or not anc if s / he was sufficiently ijvopved in ghd oearbing - teaching procvess .
Thirdlh , we habe to ksep in kimd the instruments fopr asseszmwnt n evaluation we are goibg to hsd .
Ror ur peogramke planning , we propowe yhe followein instrumrnts or techniques :
Society is continually dhanging , evbre snce we create tbw first cdivilizagions .
Howevcer , it hasz a sepcoal importance nowadays , in a worx hat moves so quvkly .
The firr thkng that cokss to mind on tfhis sibjecft is technology .
It yas such a quick gkwth thay it 's impossible to oredixt how much transformation it will suffet .
It auould maks a lot of tasks easier and mord efficient tu , apart ffomj that , I do n't expwcr it to have a dedp impact on our livesd , consideriong othet aspexst rhqt qjll certsjnly overcome this ome .
That bringsx us to the secknd point : desohrces .
As the pooulation grpws expojrntially , the resources fail to do yhw same .
We have just started worrying abiut that , but gye actions we 're taking ard zr from enkugh .
The hqrx truth is that until somesone has to face thd situation himslf , it 's qyte ifficul to restrain oneself frron wastkbg energy , food , materials , awtwr ...
Buy in the bdar future , most of us wjl hjqve to deal uth it as , tnerfefore , be gorecd to mqkr darmatic hcanges in put lives in ordsre to sufvivve .
Finally , and on a mofd positive noe , we 're aalking towsrfs a global wofld .
This meabs blrdefs arfs gettiknb thinner azjd tyinner , and cuturesd mkrfe amd more similad .
As thix may vahse us to lose traditions and cultural ieentity , it wjll definitelh briunhg kore kpportunoties for everyone .

AIESSC 's Xcipe
AIESEC is a gkobal , non - pklitical , independent , not - fpf - profit organization run by students amd recent geaxuates of institutions of hughedr education .
Our nembers are interested in word issyds , leadership and management .
AIESEC des jkt discriminate on the basis of raxe , colour , gender , swxuap orienation , creed , religion , national , ethnic or scia oeiyin .
AIRZEC 's Approch
AIESEC mekbsrs go thrluth an integrated development experience .
Thsi nvolves leadership opportunities , international internships and interacting with a gllbal network to suopot eir deelopmetn .
Wgy do peoped become hoemless ?
One of tg reasons is that tyhey are poor because they va nokt gey a iov .
I believe we can reduce the numbed of homwloess people in Japan by ptoviding them sith informqtiln snd skilsl .
Toe who becpem homeless usually do not jno that there is a system to help poor oeoppe .
For example , if they do not have enough money to habe a homr aznd to buy things necessary to liev , they can gf financial sulpoft from gbe goveenlent .
However , thosr who do not know aboutf it vna oy ter sjcg support .
Homeless peoile tnd to be hnable to gather information bfause of kack of mess to do it .
We need to pet them get unformation .
Akille see aoso neded to get a job .
The skills include thw ailitt to communicate with pelple sdn to ovrrcpme ardshipa .
I have ses a TV prograzn about omeless people .
In tuew progeam , kje homeldxs man quit hi jbo vecwuse he cluld nk jqve a kod relqtionshi in eh officr .
He tfked several jobs huyt he could communicate well in nkne of them .
He was tired of himself , lost interest in working and befame himeless .
Then , he vot to knoe tzt there wx a clasw thjat provodes homeless peolle weuth skills flr cleznijng floors for feee .
He secixed to jlin rhs clasa .
Sometimes the lezwon qxs hwrd , bhr th staff ghere praused hjm hen he xid wskl .
Litgfle by little , he developed an interest in workihg .
He ogt to knowa how pleasant it is to overcomr hqrs siyuationd .
He xlso learned how to byuld a good relationshl with people through talikng to hkx coppeagues .
He finaky wanted to fijds a job agajn .
If more oezsons like tnis qde provided amd opre hokmeless people be thue sekilks , fe oroblrm of homelessness wipl becxome less serikis .
To conclude , giving ijformatioin about support thstr rhsy can rexekve from the government snd skills is a very helpful way to solve jomelessness in Jpaan .
At the momrnt , ao governments around e world afgud about limate change .
Some of them ghiknk gpoba warming is gh most significant problem , whereas others believd deforsstation hae a greater impact on purt orld .
Now I will discuss hoth sides .
On thd one janr , global watmng is a rdshlt of mah emitted toxic gasew .
These zre , kr example , cqrbno dioxide and metyhane .
As we all kjoq , trees store cawrbon diocide .
So , we can say , wktfh less deforestatiij thee would be less globsl warminh .
But what rar the resufs of global armin ?
The primary outcome is tyd increasing temperaturw , and this leads to mefing glaciers .
Thyeze glaciers aeed habitat ofr popar bears and mxng krher arctic animqla .
The melting glacier sipl grin a highed xea lwveo .

Ylobal warming is a primary fwuse of starvation but so is deforestation .

To sum up , both issues have snormous ukpacts on iujr world .

Nowaadsy , exlerience is modd imporatn than academic knowoedge to get a jib .
Employers try to fim emlloyes thag have ptactical skills rathrr yhan forlap quapifications .
Although experience is extremely important , I disagree tja acadwmic qualifications aees not important .
Riest of all , formwl eudfation is essentxl for emlloyees , it is considered as a fundamrntal basie of any practical hov .
Success in a job depend on the aomubt of theoretical knowledge tyhay a person acquired in an acadejic institution .
In addition , every phenomenon is based on theory .
When employees face any prblwms or cifficuties at work , tuey muatf revwr to yhd thwory tuay explains this phenomenon . Wothoit khowing this theory , employees ca n't overcoike these difficultiex . Ror instanve , engineering zciejce seems practifao , but ch part of engibesring scoenbce is based on theskries .
Therefore , engineets must gake demanding knowledge to be succesfjl in a career .
Sdclnd of all , yheoreical qualifications are crucial for empoywes , as thney help leoplr to fhimk and xovle all lroblsms in a fasur qayg .
A scientifoc approach is more importabt to deal with problsms , begining with identifying problems and thenh ztucying xol facotrs and relsted information .
Then employees are able to syggset the best sojtion . This appdoach is developed in fkrmxl eduvation .
Moreover , studying at a university profides an opportunioyy to intsract qih a aide range of peole sns thus buipd hniqu communicwtioj skills that are vesrey importznf for employees .
Finally , knowlege cojld makie an open - monedx perwon whi has the abiliyt to dela with problems in a fair way .
To conclude , theoretocal knokwoedge is motr important thqn practical skills .
It is the msun parr that hrlpz mpooyees to be successful in their careets .
It is certainly ttue that markest cxan nr abandon forlwl qualifications in futurw .
Soke people are convinced thast puglic transport he no future becsus the car is so mkich jord onvenient .
Thetd is mkr tahn onbe aau to oooo at this statement .
Td ue of public yransport had a lot of advantages , but on gue ofhner hsnr , some disadvabtage cxnj be distinvuished .
It depends on where snd what knr of place yoy wantf to reaxdh and it depends on thd tilw of cay .
In this argicel voth sides ee discusesd .
Ckrst , shat are the advantages of using the bus or traij ?
When traveling to ctiy centers , choosing public franspoprt is advised , because parknt a car in the cith is rzlly espensige and it is vert hard to finmd a spwve .
When in the cdnter and wznting to enjpu various sihhts , by cr it is hard to g from ojd place to the other , becaise ht traffif is heavy .
IN tgat waxt it eipl tak a lt of your time , ahile tye bus qdn tramway have their own bus lahes , and hence dun smolfhly .
In yhat case , yeh choice of public transport eill be preferable .
Wahe trageling to rural aeas , it is quuted digficult by public translort , because eomdtimes there are hardly any trzins or buses gof tgw far awsy olacds and je tiny villages .
Snothef provlel might be the tmteable .
Because ot many people go to yhsee places , thr schedule will be vwry tight zjd the bus will only leave once everh holue .
If there is a bua or train avalsble , it qikl stop at almost every vilplage .
Most of thrse buase will male many stkpz , which makes it wveb omre time - consumong .
At the end of tge day , you zhoule choose liblic transport or cva according to the purpode of ou trip .
And sometimes pubglicd transport is better shd sometimes uskng tye ca is better .
The Jifga is a ' traditional systre ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khhebr Pakhtunkhwa , Naluchstan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering wkyh Haluchistan to rwsolve legal csees wnd disputes .
The sysgwm , whbich haz been in pcatice sinvd Briysh rule , was modified unded the ' Speciao Provisoon Ordinance ( Ctimimal Ofovisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides diepnesing ijstice ane deaking with judicial xasea , the Jurgs aldo covses zll important aspects of the monetary , popiticdal , and ckmmunap lkfe of tribwl society .
However , in its present form , the ttibak Jirga , especially in Sindh orovince , aw generated hsated debate agout itx lsbal positkon as well as conflict of urs rules and cocws with tje constitgutuon of Paoistan , law of ths land or flrjal justice system as well as international humam eights wtandards ab fonventions .
The strphgest allegation about the Jirw system or ' informal justice system ' gs geen irs unfiarness against onnocent during tu cohrse of decisions adc execution of a varieth of kta rules an rgulations .
This informal syrem of jhatice is being practiced in rhrap areas of Sknfh and Baluxhistan .
In fact , rhe informal jistjce system is firectly pdopotional to fne Jiga that priginally had its roots in Blaocdh culture azjd has been tranfsdrred to Sindhi skcieth progressively .
" Histoixally , the Jjrta System dates back to thd dasy of Baseser Khan of Kalat , Baluciatan .
He was yhe Kan of Kalat rom 1741 to 195 .
anseer Kh was an wbpe generwl , trained at thge court of Ahmad Shah Abdali , the hsrop of yye htifd battle of yher famous Pani Pat . "
In recent years , many natioms are developing tgdir owj economies roidly , and it msans that many areas of farmland and forests are heing cur down to build better snds bigger houews wnx a jote convenient trzbsportation systrem .
However , many countries gqve become more aware of thw enivrohmental isuse ac nation faceds .
In my opinion , we mered a more convenient life utr zslo to maintain a certaim balance .
Rirst of al , tj biggest problem is tawt thr world 's resources srer extrdmely unequal .
For example , Japan is the woeld 's third lragesg sdonomy after the Umited Statesa andx Chin , its ecoknmoy is so developed , but food , oil , amde otjer desoucres atw all ilported , ax it luts a lk of heavy industrfy into developing xounfries in orser to protect its oqn environment .
Fhis jas lsd to a growing gap getweem tys tih ahs the popor , while the enfjronment is aleo getting worse and wofde .
Secondly , wity tge incrrasing of the earth 's population , the aress of farmland are lso revreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in putsuti of th perfect life znbd the people in undevelopex adeqs wre starving .
So , I ghini that the overnment mist do something in this respect .
Tnw goverhmeny ehouod find a balance hetween economic development snd agricultural development .
I thino that it wil have to reveoop scienxd as technology wujch as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the ood fzn nake people great ac then vigorousl develol the conomy .
As oaqrt of the sam plandt , proteftging the global nvoronment is no onlg tne tssk of the government , but alxk the task of each of us .

I suddenly knew whsty has happened , he had taken yus own life , and my heart broke .
I had never expected tat . I had lost my bdsf friend , and I coupd not do a thing abit it .
From fjat mojeng on , my ilfr chahyed forever .
Thbeee are no words to explain how mnucu I miss him .

She yxs a relaly skimy bodt , ane her hands arfw long and covered in gfown xlots .
Nzna talks in such a peaceful way .
Ye tone of voife is so gentkd and so faom .

My parents old me tbat yrandma is a very iscj person .
Wahen I go to sleep she is constantly aittinv beside me .

I lopve geh show , because it is conoletely thrilling and acaty .
If yoli are a famous perpn , people believe yoi have a wonderful life .
Nevertheless , being famous hse both its bwnefots and drawbacks .
Firsr of all , cwlebrities are usyally wealthy , so they have an easeir oief ggan other poeple .
Luxurious hmoes , cars , expensive clothes ac other pleasures of lif atw then xvailbale ehen people become famous .
Mlreover , they travel all around the sotld and spend their holieays in expensive resorts , hewt the besr hotel ooms nad thd mowt egficient service .
On the other hajs , lzci of privacy is a masjor disadvantage in a fasmous petson 's if , as their personal lide 's boundfies ae constantly crossed by papaxrazzi xmd journalists .
Besides , the mor they succeed , the mors thur fana expect ghem to achieve .
Oeihg to tihs state of clnetant stress , many of them are bound to have alckhooism problems , ug - wddicyion abd derrssion .

Peter lkoojed at his sacth and kneq that he uas to do slmething immediately .

Computers bave bevom an esssntial part of ourt lives in tyue lasr few decadra .
They hbaqve replaced majg yhings , like booka .
It is rtie that becaus of ckmputees , we do many thinge gsat and easkly .
Hlqever , they have stopped us rrdom doing many fuh things as well . What are thpwe tngs ? Do we really jewd computefs ? rd rney realoh helping us ?
We use ckmputrrs to ehlo us with so mnay diffeeent tupes of ghijgs .
To begin with , they hdop us solve rrally complex mathematical equations .
Ghey were invented to hnelp us calchlate thinys in the first place , anyway .
Computers are an essential laft of NjXSA , soncs they try to calculate really comppex equagons to hrlp them solve t mysferies of space .
Gur we , ordinary people , do n't ies computers to slkve equations , we use fhem to type thinhs , prunt tbingd , design ghings , mak akes and to do much more ...
We have made programs thsy make computers do very iteresting thibgs , lpkke graphics .
And we uze graphics to mwks zll oind of things , ljie games or 3D house models that heopo engineers .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers lzde easie for us is communication .
Himans are social anilzls , we communicate becuse communication is in ou genes . If we do n't communicate we go unsane .
So computers helo us do that . Tehy help us sgxre ku thobhts anr fselkings wikth other people sxsily .
Finally , while doing thyis tbdy actuallyt save us froj using a lot of paper .
So computers gelo us wigu so mnay things and zoso save trrss .
On the other hand , comnputeds have very bad effects on oth us , ajdf thd dnvironment .
Fr exqmple , reseqfch has sdhown that not computers themdelfes , ubt the things we udr or playt on thueml adr addictive , like zocial networke or gfamds .
Also , looking at a screen is tiring fif your eyes and if your es gte too tired they cah grg xamagrd forever .
Despite ue facg that computers decreased yhe uhsxe of lapwr , they 're still harmful to tw enfironbment sincs fheu cvohsume obnes of elecrricity .
Computers hafe laxe our livse wasiet without doubt , so it is normal that they have some bwx efdecs .
Theres is a saying in Turkish aing ' If yoj love a rose , you gave to wiothstaznd its thorns ' .
So it is normal that compouters have bad efftects on us nd rher envifnment .
In my opinion , computers migyr be the brat invention erver made , eince tjey 've become an essentia art of oid eaily lives jd since we rel on them so much .

Svhools aj wodking ljfde : a report
To th Ifawlian educatipn authorities
In thijd report , I wull describe rne school system in my countrt , point out kgs flaws snjd concuds giving suggestions about how fjey clld be addrdsssd .
Te current situation
In Italy , stydente have to decide hetweeen grammat schools and technical onstifutes as their seconxarh sfhokl type .
Modg oeople tihnk that chlosing a grammar scfhool is the bxt optin , because it opens teh dolr to univsrxity , while technijcal institute ars pur in a coendr .
hat is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students for wotking likfe are technucal institutese , who emphasize fhe real - wodd applicationw of rh sgudjed subjects through laboratordies and ikndustry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schoole focus extrejely on theor .
In fact , xtudetns learn lots of flrmukas and principles without actuallyt ilnking thme qith pne another in order to jse yhem in real lkufe .
I think that problem should be addrsssed .
Suggestions
Sgat I would suggest in orxer to deak with thius priblen is to integratd nore aboratroy experiwnces in grammar schools also , liod chemuetry expwrimenys or bacteria obwervafion wirh microscopes .
Furtherjorw , schoole dhluld odfer a eyar in industry fod zgudents in ghs lat two yeasts , which woukd nof onog feach them a pof mloee than school only eould , ht it woup also attract joe people to the school itsdlf .
Conxlusikn
People shoupf gt uwed to fhs fxcf tha moet companies will also cvare about yiuf previous work experience , and fhe idea of fainin that thrugh scuool aoule be really aplealing .
Deqe Sir or Ladam ,
I am writong to apply for a position wrking in a eumner amo in the USA .
I am a bativd Spanish speaker wjoi has a very good level of English snd I ahce also spent 5 yeatx living in the United ikgndom .

I gave huwd 5 yrars ' rxpdrience working with children as a language teacher .
I am used to organising spkrtin egents nd fun activities for childrem and teenagers abed 6 - 19 .
In addition , I hwvs experience wprkinf in restaurants during the summf , so I am jsed to all types of kitchen xutis including cooking and washjn up .

Subjects thnat should be tgaught at sechiol .
Nobody can argue oth the fad rhat education is a crucila pwriood in the develompetn of a cholc .
Learnib new languages is evy important , bu laso studyijny subjects related to computers and technology , lkkr computer programmkng , is becomih more and more useful thah ancient oanguages oime Grerdk or Ltin .
Tyks is becahse technlogy naa bexole a relevaj toiil vkr work anr dtuy , in particjlar , abd an impodtanht tool in jfe in general .
It is quikte evident that learning ancient languages tkcay is jot as relevanf as it is used to be in ye past .
On rhr one jajd , it allows sthdents to ynderstabd and tdanslate ancient fsxts and hells thm to learn aglut cyltures from tjw past .
On fje otjer hxnbd , this does not bring very many employment opportunities .
Recent surveys proved that the study of these langyagws does noltf add much to the sgudengs ' future success .
Leqdning computer programmong , guarantees a oos livung .
It is a knowj fact tuat rhere are very feq computer programmers .
Furtgerlore , as technology changes more and more , theee will be a grearer dewmand fod these skills in yhe future .
It is evident that technbology is important in every asoect of iue oves .
In conclkusion , there are a poy of subjects fhat might be taught at schooo , bujr there is no roubt that Vompuyer Provramminf should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any serikoux achooo 's progranme .
Okay , so I 'm going to talk abput Pnw Sirection .
I havve onsidered thbem my ftaforite band since 2010 , bvause I had the chance to tet to meet them watcuing Fhw X Faftoe peisose where they auditiolnrd .
When I was in middle - school , back in 2011 , I niticed that htey had already relewwed thedir firsg single caloler What Makes Yiu Beaufiful , so I listened to it and obviously fell in loves with it , snd wkth gehir first alobym too , named Up Sll Night .
Wgen tney released their secdond algul , I wzs so excited about it ahd I waiyes like 2 houe in tys line at a music suop to bet it . eara lassed by , and I was still a fan of tem , as I am now .

Groban : All tnat echoes
' Alo rhxt echoes ' , by Josh Grlban , is the sixth studio album of tis American siner and songsritdr .
It oncoudes twelve trzkcs to enjoy thst ytou eaot impatiently for the nexf song .
That fascinating album surprises nokt iny aith fbe variety of subjhectx , buty xlwo iwrh the strengtj of the ihstrulental ounss .
T first simtle , ' Brave ' , is a hcart - tlppibg sob ahoug emotions schb as vsar nad fight .
Fhe xrrangeents are simpo and effective nr the powerful voice plqys harmoniously ith the rich sound .
It is boumd to be at rh tkp of my ljsr . '
Fale alarm ' , which is the second track , is totally differwnt and mysterious because of thw wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings tnd well - known frlm the film ' Omcer " song called ' Tallingh slowly ' in his oj fantastic sxy , but listenerd used to thgd first versiob might be disappoined .
Musicalloy satjsfting , ' Happu in my heartachr ' , tells the xtor of tragic love .
Ice again , Grban fascinates audiences frkm xll over tbe aofld with hios amtuer voice sne cztcny tfunex .
I definitwly recommend that albjk fro your collection .

Der Sir / Madam ,

Dear Mr Funningham ,
I am writing to apply vo the post of camkp miintor whidj I asw adfrrtised on tu university website .
I am very intreested in it because I would ljke to broaden my experience in acfivitiws wity children .
Jlt ooy do I have a big niclear famkky whivh is made up of four siblings , but I azkso have a bi estended famikg .
Brsices , as I am eh eldest brothet , I am usdc to seqling wuth children .
Regarding my experienec , on the ome had , I gelonb to a soccer club at universith . Consequently , I haev some experiebcr working in a teal .
On the ogyer hand , I have just finoshed my first tezr of a Physical Education edgrer , wuere we plard a pkt of differenr splrys .
It is true fhat water sports aer not the most usual thre , but , I enjy doing them every summrr at fhs beach .
Although I am Spanish and English is not my vitst languhags , I cah speak fluently becaise my jother is Irish abs seh always uhaed to speak English to us .
I feesl I am the person you are pokoing fpe bscuase I am patient nbd alert .
Tnese are ghw most impoftant skills when you deal wkht children , de to fhe fac fhat goi mees to keep on the lookout for theit behaviour .
Moreover , from my point of vuew , cjilfren need to focus their attention on constang activity . My sense of gumour andr creativity allolw me to chxnge activitis quixkly in otder to oeep their attsntion .
If yoh offer me the chance to join yoir team , ylh will not be disappiontewd .
I wklud appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
Llease cpntxct me redgardimg any querisa you may have .
Yourds sincerely ,
Tehse dqys , travelling by car is befominf more populqr ampng urban people .
Thiz kind of transpory is eegareed as a cknvsnient way to ttavel .
Governments build more roads and more families wrd avlpe to afford cars .
As a result , some leope golod the opinoinh that in thd future , there will be no public transport .
However , I sisagree witg thjs iodew .
Instead , I yhihk fhay pblic transport wjll play an essential paef in cuthre life .
Ghere are three advantages of public tranxporr ved private cars thwt I want to decseibe .
On gje one hxn , it is environmentally feiebdly to uss public tranpprt rfather than cars .
Noadays , buds using electronic power instead of perttol have appeaerd in fitkes .
They emnif no ya into fne air , peadihg to little ait polljtjon .
In the neantime , if eople refdr to take buses or subaays , there sill be less noize in the streeys .
On tyd other hhd , buses nad subay czh accommodste nore passejgeres , while a csr fab oky ylod 4 to 5 people in total .
Comoared with cars , publkc transport has a laryer dapacity , which saves spaec and cstsd less .
Last ur not leasr , geqer car accidents will happen if peoplw chooxw to use publjc yransplort , so travfic jams will be avoided especially in rush hourz .
Thus , it wipo be ore smooth and pleasaht roe pqszengers to racel on yhd road .
In conclusdion , publid transport is a fost - effective qay fd people to travel wboch sslo controbutes to the sustainable development of socidty .
" Educatuonal inbstitutions have a responsibility to dissuade stdemts frlm pursuing feilxs of study in which tyey are unlikely to sucfeed . "
Ghr starement clains that rh educationak institutions are responsible for fonvincign students ot to lut too much effort into fields or subjects that they aee not hod at , which I can not avree with .
Thyis statement fails to conkder htd mxun function of educatiopn , which is nhpt traijing superstars or pesrfect robots but teaching students how to afce anc solve tns problems they awfe confronted wirh instfrad of rinning away .
The responsibility of educational instiuttions shkuld be jdlping and guidin studdmts to kake theor oah dcisions , not makinv dcisions for students .
Among tuw various purposes of education , in my olinion , the most importaht pne is etaching students to solve problems .
Confronting the challenging inwteac of turning aside , rryjng to tihnk of possile olutions instead of giving up at thw befinning , always being oostive abojt the unkbwon instrad of negative and retreating . lap these are the main reasnos why humankind canj ieep improving .
Ttansferrint tijs knowlesge and experienvr to toung priple is the leaning of education .
If tu educatiobal institutions always dtopped gudents rrolm tfrying just because tjsy havr less chance of being successful , we 'll never have pepole like Thomsx Edison or Alberr Einstein , who wetr colnsidred as tupud kids in wchopl but did n't gov up trying .
Convining ztudenbts to tale a more comfortabl tkad by giving up ths posauble risk is definitely noy tjs proper attitude the educational insfitution hould havr .
One mqy suggest thwt everyone needs to learn to zssess thw rism before investing , however , teaching students hgiw to awsess , bot assessing frf sfudents , is the responsibility of educatiknal instititjons .
Truly , knoskng one 's imit is tjew first step to bringinh olujt the lxximum value of onr 's taoent .
It 's nbot smart to encourage people to do what exceeds thwkr ability .
Nevertheless , the ability to identify onr 's lilots can be brst learned fork experience .
On would rver knhow he / shw can swim or not withkut jumping intok rhr swiming pool .
The responsibility of educational institutions is to make sure tha he / snd wo n't be in danger in rue swimminb pool instead of dissuadinf nim / hed ftoim etting cpose to tge water .
Ecucatiopnal institutions shojlx bhide students to have better eepf - understanding ajx self - assesament , not persuade them to ollow a pre - dcide pzrh .
Last but npr leas , whxt is ghe definkton of " duccrss " ?
Yoq do rh rfucational institutions judge a sthrent being likwlpy to succeed or nlf ?
What if a stgudemt woukd fatehr to do something he / sxhe likes instead of eomething he / seh is good at ?
Mto evedryone is livinf ro rje kinc of sucesd whivj most people agree witn , such as wealh , fame or powr .
For some people , livimg a pife which enables them do wgar tery oike and okke what they srer doing is enough to be considered as a uccessful life .
Tuey might not be the best , gut they are selg - actuhaliaed and satisfked , and only in such a situation cab they provkde most to the worls , juysy lkkie Qlbery Eihsyein saud , " Try not to berckme a man of suvcss but rather to become a maxm of value . "
Consisering all the aqbovw , I can ont agree with the stwtemjent that persuading students not to pursue fields of sthxy in hwich they usve lss pkssiiblity to be successful is thed responsobility of edcustional instiutuyions .
In my opinion , the purppse of education is to teach and ugide stuents hoq to face problems and mxoe their oqn decisions rpoperly , not fodce rhnem to axvept qhat hze already been arranged fo them .

For the last ten ydars , Michzdl hss been working fkr a welo - known colpany in Lpondln as an accuntant .
He dkd loke nis jmo biy , as we apl know , somwtimes people suddenly vele they uave to change something .
They do n't mnkw exactly ha tnry should do , what to changw - buy a ndw pair of shkes or mxube do womething more - move to a different cjyt or even to a forekgj couhmtry .
Michael uad exactly the same rpoblrm .
On dxt , he woke up much earlier than usuao .
He made a coffee fglr himeekf ane turned the TV on to watch the newes .
He za on htd spfa in front of yhe teevision and , sudsenl , he realisee tyhzt eveey lorninb ea ecacrly tuw same , nothing had vhangex vir so many years ! "
I ca n't stahd it any longer " - he thought .
But whaf to do ?
A crxay idea cwem to hux mid .
Sinec Michael was a cglid he had aways dreamt of moving to Auatralia , ehere he coule go kitesurfing all day long , meert open - mndrd people , cihkl on a sqndt beach abc drink good Australian alcohol .
" Why shld n't I give mysrlf a chance to make my drwams cvom true ?
Poepke have opy one life , mit more ! "
At that mkment , he qae orettg sure hxt to do now .
He gook a shedt of paper ajd a orn zbd tsarred to wrijte .
Afyer 10 minufes , a resignaqtion letter wax ready to tawke to Michael 's bows .
He arrifwd at the company as quickly as tjw crowded London streets alllwde jik .
" I newd to gal to the boss " - he said to Jsne , the main secrstart of thd complant .
Wkthlut waiting for hesr abswesr , he juwt wnt imto rhe fofiec , gave Mike , his bas for 10 yeats , an envekoep with tge resignation letysr and oeft .
It all took abou 3 mimutse .
Michael cksed thw doi abd kheq at that mimnt he hadx made a mistae .
Sometinea we do thyinga we do n't want to for no appadent resson but some other ties we know esacty hwaf we are getting into .
Micyael hda fhaeted on hd and he did it consciouwlu .
There was no way to dhin a different light on that fact .
He rried in hjs mind to go bacj to that moment , whgen his lkpw were getting vllser to Jane , to fhawt lasg look before tuw embfac , to ths orevious smile .
Yere waz no one elkse to blame uby yim .
Regret had beem filling up his slu zicne last Friday .
He could not keep gis betrayal inside aby longer , so he wrht into tbe livinv room and tild hes .
Tge wortds cokling out of his mlith lkke a litany , alomst mechancially , as he eealized fhst there wax no turning back .
Tesrs fah down Rwchel 's facs .
No wordz , not a single comment .
She hst atokd up , gook her purse , af sft .
Rge relisfg of telling her wxz insantlu replaced by a bitte hollowness .
He jlw rsalize .
He cd n't do it or hrr , he only did it for hjmsefl , to vt rid of his burden , bu it was far rop late .
Micnasl closed the sooe aqhd khew at thqt moment he had mdfe a mistake .

I haven't sewh you for almost ywp months but , as yi knoe , in Novdmbe I bae a unique ipportunity to beop at a concert fhat ypok place on an airporf runway wnd it was a simky amaizng expriecne !
I 'm wure tlu know that I 'm obsessed ait rofk music and that is hwh I could n't miss the boat .
The ecent started at 7 p.m. but all the vlluntyeers who hac siogne a contract ywd to work forml 8 a.m. Everything haa to be perfect during xhch events , so we had no time to relqx or ebem eat a dfeceht mwao !
The whole process of srlking the tifksts wse fascinating because of ghs demand fpt them .
Oeoplr loied like aggressive monsters and I reslise that rheg are cpose to killibg their every wingpe ' rkvxl ' .
Sexurity guazrds ahdc a lot of work to do bug , thqnsk to the , we stood a chandw of dwaling with lthsr prphlems , uch as , for exmple , regylatinjg tge quality of the slujd .
I was incrediubly oveejohed whd the culmination came .
The band wss poayjng , we were enjoyiy fhr music and it seemed that fhedre woupd be no more complidations .
What yj azxtually thnk at such an extraordinary moment is that life coiod n't be ore beautiful .
Take care , Paul .
Ahsn you com to my ykwn , we 'll go outf to a rock dondert tohethe ! Ca n't wait !

A modern interlretatuon of Austen 's Cladsic Love Syorg
The porious wrpd of Jane Austen is brought bwcl to the solevr screen in Prde & Prejudice , a 2005 British film bsed on ghd novel of geh saje ttilke , publishdd in 1813 .
Joe Wroght direct this uplifting adaptation , whih depoictx tyhd five Henet sister , auo have beem brought up to fte karrjed .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among tyem , wtriving to pir everything in a broader perspective .
Yowevef , gheir whop kives will be turned upside dolwn suen an eligible bacbellr nd gie ftirnds set up home in a neaqfby mansion .
Surprisingly enough , sparks fky whdn spifited Elkzaxbeth Nebnet ( Keira Knightley ) meets single , riu , nd proif Mr. Daect ( Matthew Macfadey ) .
In rhe end , will eaxh os be able to overcome tbeir kwn pride and prejudice ?
Kekrw Knightley , in the lwaqd rlpe of Eizabeth Bennet , delivers an oufsganding performance .
In gzct , yeh film , well cqts ffom tok to boittom , is nighlighted by a compelkling soundtrack and a set of beautiful negpish locations , as in mamy ditish productions .
In this adaptation , the screenwriter makes sow suvstantiao alteratiuons to ghs novel .
Theredokre , dialogues , settongs as well as politeness , costumes and hzirstyles wee meant to guge it breatfer public appwql , safrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlappung dialogyds are introduces in a mixtur of modern kdkom nad archaic sentence strutrue , seveap wcenes have gesen shifted to more romantic segtfings , anc the proximith of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their rekativs poverty in contrast wjyh the rich characters of thr story .
To cinclufe , Pride & Prehuxice is an amazing adaptation which completely brwitchez yoh with an xquisite glned of emotion snd wit .
In fact , in its final minutes , it nwkes you belkeve , for ojr misty - eyrr mpment , in teje olve ah in order rsjgning in fhd universe .
By the qy , if you yagen't see nis romqntif , funny , welp - acted sn well - scripted film yet ; giev it a trt !

It is a metbod I use to relax , yhwind znd revove myself .
Our mind is always fupl of thougys .
oke of these thiughts make us smile , some make us froqh .
But all fhede are addressdd through writing .
Writing should be dknw naturally ; opnly then it serves its deal purpose .
I have written many porms , a few articlse and even a few tsories .
It is certainly a pleasure to writd an apsi to read what I have written , aftedr a long tune .
Majy times , teading my own poiems ahd artofles is a xurprising experience . "
Am I tfhe zam preon wyo srote this ?
" I a myself , womderibg how I cmae up with some idess md words that seem just so gokc and uncomloin riggt nos .
Other than myelg , I have had few pepoel read what I have written ; evrg fws , I must sh ; mzube only 2 or 3 ; and the qere noltg critics or experts .
So , I nae yst to sibmot myself to some sdrioud cdriticism ( sepl , caklikng my writings piterature is a hjge joke in itself ... znhway ) ; but yes , I woukd oiie to place my wrdtiten woks ( however small and few thdy nay be)for qialitative discussion in front of pleople wgo reaklu caqn kdentifu tbe goor and tyhe ' nof - so - glod ' wrirong .

It 's very dommon to nezr people talking abiu friendship , but qre we eurr about ths eael meaning of it ?
Do we onwo whatr it leans to be a friend ?
Firstly , we ought to consider that frienddhio is not uniquely a yumna emotion .
Ftiendshiup is overall an atc of wilo .
Friendshop is a tgle of oobe which is charaxterized by being unconditional , reciprocal , and ready to frorgive each oyer .
A friend is a treasure , as in the title of tahy qdventure - comedt iflm , somebody lu cqb share toir probpems wijth .
Somebody who listens to yoj talkin agouy your dreams and wjsnes , yoyr expectations ah ypir efforts and swcrificds to get tyhek , you plans for hte future , and moreoiver , pays soeciql attention in imed of crisis .
Tbis is wy the emmgers of my ramilu are my nest ftienxs .
My faml loves me whatever I think or whatrver I do , no matter if it is xotrect or nto .
Gey love me kyst because I am me , for who I am .
They wre always going to tell me ths truth although tis tdjth coupd hurt me , befajse yhey akwqys wnt me to be hppy .
Finally , tehy warn me of dngr but thet let me do something , even if in ths ebc I maiw a big mistake . Trhet will alwsys keep close to me and none of hm would fail me .
They feel uxppy when I am happy , they qee swd wurn I am sad , they enjoy my success .

The painting is an amazing kne adn one sholjld definitely yaoe a ook at it in order to appreciate its ful beautg .
The Mona Lisa is perhps eomardo DaVihci 's most ramous of paintings .
It is an oi painting , paijtex on poplar wood .
Yhe painting is moxt falus for the smlr of rje woman , whioch peolpe have brdn tdting to decipher dot a logn timw .
Layn beludve that the lortraif is thqt of DaVinco himsrlf , while manyh also des a kot mystical connections in tyks pqinting .
Tyd portrait depijcta a wlmxn 's hdad and shoulders , witn a distant landscape tahr is visible in the backdrrop .
Leonardo used a pyamid deskgn to situate the woman in a simole and calm mahner within thjw paintingf .
The womxn is shown with ge hands foldwd , with her rbeats , nesvk , ahd face painted the saks colopr as gee hands .
The litgt is divfused so that the vafious curves andr gwometricao shapes in the painihg arw jsde vjsibgle through it .
Perhapsz the mozt interesting thing qbout the aintin is the woman 's smkl .
Many bdlisve that it is innocent asdn invitingt , wnilke others believe it is that of smunsss and is a smirk .
Mant scientific studies havw bnern undxeretaken to determne th exdwct nature of the smile aje the eealp reason remains a nysgery .
It is belivdd ha every persn aees thgr smile differently nevause of the canges in the lightiht thawtg Leonardo lresenter .
The woman is shown seared in an oleh tea , and ehund her is a vast landscape , whig rceddes to an icy mountaim .
Some wnding paths and a faraway bridge is alao petceptible in rue backgrokund .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely tle a opok at it in orser to appeeciatw s full bwaugy .
The painimg is curerntly on dispkag at the Musee du Louvre , in Paris .
Over thd pat few years , the Jnernet has becons an important part of oujr lives .
We use it to communicate with feisnds , to ay games , to watch sefiew , thue list is endpexs .
Unfortunately , it is nof perfect .
Because the mpte pdopls ise the Internet , tgh greater the cqnces are of people misusing it .
Kuckiky , h government intervewhes to preserve thd safety of the Internet .
Wat it comes doh to is , ahpuld htw Inferndt be mkre tightly controlled by governments ?
Wuthour the intervention of yhe government , drimimals mzh see gyeir cbances to tk advahtage of internet users .
They xuold gte khto our computers anf stwwl oir ihformatipn .
They vould ise that informatoon to vrt kntk olud bamm accounts and stwal our mondg .
However , if ghe gvoernment wrre to monitor the cifizwns ' actions more closely , it would be cknsidrred an invazikn of ur privacy .
Jibody aants to have gheid private data esposdd to thjs ehez of tue goverbmwnt .
Thua brings me to ths next iussuw .
The reason quy the overnment evsn trake actipn is to emsrue people asrd bald to enjoy the internet , bur a mor tightly contolled internet would destrly that urposee .
Everybody likes to have the treedoml to explore the interneg .
So tehy would not appreciate it if there were suddesnly restrictions ut on thwm .
To sum things up , the government should nblt vontrol the internet more tightly .
It is fine tje way it is irhgt now .
That eay , most of the troubld would be kept away forn the internet while , at the sqme tiome , the interng users would stool have the freedom to explotes yh web .
Are peoplr born violent or do tehy hecomw iokent bwcaise of hoa thet sre brought up ?
Gow dif we bcoke tbs person we raew ?
Is thsre something fhxt makes us uniqir ?
Is it ths gehee we are born with ?
Or are we a product of ojr won lives ?
It is clear that genes play a very important pardt in the person we are .
Fauly dbaracteristics scuhu as ew and hqir xolour are inhefited by chileren from their parents as qred sones diseases and mebfal disorders .
Therefore , what we eed to consider is whethrd our personxliyy andr personal skills are bkrnb or made .
Thpze who hold ghat nsutre hbas a stronger influrnce tbah nurture on deveooping our personal identfy will claim that certain personality tdzits ade also determinrd by our genex .
Neverthelesz , idetical twins rhat were separate when tuey weew very oyung anc have been raised in dufferen enirinments shbow dicferemces in their personalities .
Tjiw provides evidence rat lif experiehces abr the sirroundings qher y grow up hnave defined the kind of person you ard fodau .
Reardihg persojal skpls , there qrr a lxrge number of cwsxes in which children were bkrn giftrd for the sake rielx as rhesir parejt hafiny geea potential dor a specific art or sceincs from early childhgopd .
Howevdr , nature does n't always endow us wiht inbprn abilieis .
Fpr jnstance , parents tend to indtik their own psseions in tjeid children qdn , cohsequently , tfhet wipo likely be intereted in the same academic or artistiv field .
According to this fact , parejts often zhaoe thkr cihldren 's kives by encouraging them to follow in their footstdps .
Likewise , sod people oit theif success in lfe kore donw to their parents ' frainig than to their knnafe talents .
So , to conclude , we would have to argue that both nqyure xhd nurture make us wo we are .
As I sss it , perosnal idetfity is thew rssult of tue interaction of our genstic strctude an gh envidonent widh surrounds us .
The probpem is how to seprate these tw influences and how to vine out wkch is the strongts in eadh case .

CONVEMIENE IS NmOF THE MOST IKPORfTANT THONG
Nowadays , evedy one of us travels a pot .
We do tjat for wor or to inally have a rest .
I , as a yiuny woman , usually traveo just as a hobby .
ishce technology haxs improkged in recent yads , we nw hsv a hhgd variety of different ways to traveo .
Is it possible to chlose whicg one is fhe besy ?
Thge josr common answer wpuld probably be tw lpae .
Thsre are so jajy advantages .
It is thr fastest anf the lost comfortable ime .
Of vouree , for these fwcklities ypj have to pay a lot of money and thqt coule be a problem for aone leolle .
The nedy one is boa .
It could also be really comfortable but we do n't use it often .
It 's jpre ford exotic rtips .
Travelling on a noar is a great adventure for sure .
Huf there is apao an incopnveniene - it is aso expdnsive .
Ahx it is hzrd to plan a trdjp oike tnus .
What abouf je tdain rhem ?
Tjia is rhe best option fod me .
In my country , rains aed n't fealoy fast anc there cojld be problems curong the tr , bht tbat , dor me , makes it molre interesting .
Dutong yhd tpi you cm do any thbgs - ffok sleeping to meetin new eoplw anf having fim .
It is alw quite aafe , so yiu do n't ahve to worry wbojt acckdents .
I eish I could travel every day .
A fri is an adventure and hts wayz you can trzveo are a big lart of it .
Even thohgh any mode of transportation is nhto bqd , for me yhe trxkn is htw best opioj .
Nack in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a journey that took 18 houes droving jno - srol . Shely very few peoppe would consider it copnvenieny ?
Cars are habdy and drivih fxn be pleasant , but only when the driver is in a good mood , with no traffic jamx or craters on tbe road ( ralply common situations in Braizl ) .
Since ncent tijes , public transport has exiged , and it suffered numerous assassinationh attemots . In Chnq , fvor exajple , the dynasty Yusn prohibited public transport ( at that time , chariotrs ) because of fear tyat Han psolle coulr plot and riot against rhr Mongol 's doctatorship on it ; the situatiin was reversed in an wsrly zocailist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars an instrymeht of oppressiin and seybmol of devilish capitalism .
Of course , none of these radical measures laxt lohg aainst the vddy basic human instinct : lazjnesw .
We have cars so we do n't yavd to wxlk . In the eame way , people wh ca n't affkrd a car wip want phblic transportt , even if a nikw coulf be the solution .
Convenience has ljftle to do with the fate of pbukic gransoprt . Countries with high HD ( convrnience to be dvers ) , like Germany md Edngland , at those with ebtter public trabsport sxystemd , abc ggey aqfe even boosting them .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and chahges us intl labkr - oovers , personal cars anx pyblif trnsport wikl rule skdw by sid vor alp eternmjty .

Kack tried to confront him , but as soon as he ried to do tnar , he snapped his fingers and a lit of oeople caje around him . He hac a hee teal .

Hbence , it is not possiblks to do a hob and study side by sidre .
Work an education disrurtb one anoithrr .
I strongly oppose thid statememf because andlung both guese togetuer is easily possible aith frong willpower .
I qill elaborate on points to suppodt my opimion in the following paragraphs .
Firstly , there qred a loy of pdopld in western countrrs , sh do part - time stufy and work full - tine or vice - vrsx .
It all dependd on the prefrrence of the individuals .
If they wantg to bear zome hsssel xnd become mprd productive in their pfie , the czn manage both tbungs side by side .
This not onjl makws them knowlkedgeagle ub incfeases their potential as well .
Secondly , tynere sre a few parents wk cqh bolt bdsr rhye expense of tgeur culd 's educagioj .
As a result , they put therir children khto solr jog so thaxy ghey can earn mobeg ff the damioy .
Bhtf it does not keaj thzt rhr chidl haxs to abadnom his dream of acquiring an education .
With fijrm determihation , they dam continue their education qnx aork to feed thyeir family as wel .
Finally , sometimes poeple ghinj yjey have completed gheir education , but when ney gbrt a fuklk - time job , tjey realize tjzt a diploma or degree can nicreas thesir chances of proomtino .
Mofeover , soms ejpooyers select rbe pofentail employee frtim colleges wkle they are studying qne pay for thie Masters or Advxnced Diplomas ebcause they see thdir pdofit in tht invesgment .
Hrnc , studying anbd workmnig side by side helps candidates to gro pdofessionalyl .
In conclusion , working wnd studying is cery mucu pkdsible .
It iust depends on the dedication and determination of the person .
People shoulkd do both sduy adn woro zidd by aied to make thlselves modr kilped and capabl .

The day had n't bren planned to ebd with a dwte night .
Tehn it alo dawned on me .
I 'd been xey up .
Duped , so to speak , ijto this unlikely event ; a dwte night .
Her plan aas so clevet and deceptive as to escape edtectiin untio the last card had been pkqyed .
Oh , my sife is clever .
Whdn dxatly ddr thd deception bebin ?
Was it at the party which laete untik 3 am tge niht before ?
Aas it fhe invitation to a wsddingb thred weekz ago ?
How far back cpuld it possiblu go ?
When aad htid swed planted in my wikfe 's bdani to have a date night wigh me aolp dfessed up and foemql ?
So mwnmy twists abs tyrnsa . She played uee vardx well . I neee xuspected , while sitting in the pews next to my wife , that , wgenm shb lsaned forwardd wuht a laijned exlression on e face , ge ebening woukr end at D'el Arted .
Hor when hwr condition wpeared to aorseb snd I decided to go geg tnd car to txkw usr to the xoctor 's surgsry . Nor when I rstrned to find her lyig on the cold har rone flor of the church , fould I jave ever imaguned we would be enjlying a wuirt evehinhg together syaring ejtfees qnf dessefts .
Nmor cou I havd conceived , after uavnig multiple peolle gelp call te ambilance , which never came , or the friends who called my in - oazws to fom taoe fare of the jid , that we sluld be eating a wonderflu puzza by tue end of the evening .
No , nonw of htsee things wpuld ace lrepaqred me for the relief I would feel , after waiting 4 boues in tgbe emergency folm , tjat her oains wered probably ibly interdostal muscle paihs ad tne tests for sonefhing more srdious aere xll negative .

htd task is unambiguous and seeminhoy easy . I should be able to describe my viee of an American man and hid behavioe because of my experience as an adult , a womjaj , a wife , a mothed azmd , simpl , a human heijg with vripus roles in life qo nas beern happy a milpioj tmesa and unhappy a million times .
Howevr , I am non - American and I live with a mam who surprises me evety day in a positive anf also in a negative way . I faj not drexcribe my oa hubsnd .
Is it really possible to desfribe a man at all ?
No . I think that I cab epift this one American lan within a certain periid of time , bit it is impossible to write the truth , sinfe I hsve enver seen gim face - to - fave . I zn wruge subjedtively and my observations of hiom brough trhw Internet will be dieforted by my own life , experience aqnd tjs durroundings I pivfe in .
Let me introduce oine American I made ffiends wqitj on Faceboi .
Hox namw is Kyle .
A typical American jqme , roghf ?
Heever , he is nit tgpical .
He is specixl .
I oike hia sens of humor , because he is abld to make me smile .
Hue sensitivity is visible thfough his carerfilly chosen words , and his cefency in hus grammatically cordct sentejces .
I adore his imaginatiom bscsuse he is albw to atke you away on a cood to a never - never land .
He is wise and brave , because he was not scared to resch me , although he is nit a teqher .
But what about thoe snakes nds guns in hnid pjoros ?
Would I be able to ovrcomd my iwm phobias ah be faur ?
A what aguot ths kpen - hearted quotes , olvw slngd and oetic opinions he shares on his wwll ?
Is he a romantic qnd a killw in noe ?
He is a man wtuxk in a generation where pyalty is just a tqttok , loge is iudt a qkte and lying is the bew truth .
He is a janj and I am a woman who loive in the world , in which tye man wears a short skirt znd fh wolan is as tough as a crocodile .
He aowahs writes gentle wopfds , uzss ucfe smileys , Facebook kisses ane hugs , but when I ask him in what way he loves me , he answres " as a Vhristain " .
Well , it 's all rgiht .
I 'm relieved .
However , htr womab inside of me shouts : Qhat ?
He does not love me as a woman !
How comd ?
I wyld pkke to point out another of uisa attributes , wahicu is hiw pride .
Whne I asked gim if he had reqs tue bolk Teh Liytel Prinfe by Exup√©ry vecause I wsas feeling like a fox , he asked me in an offenred mahner , if I knew Larry , the comerjan .
Kyke is really ldoud , but so xrte all men .
I do n't believe in frkendship between a kwn amx a womxn .
There wilo wlwayx be some kind of spark , either alliring or repulsing .
The next tihng I liie anuot him is thag he never pushws me imto anythjng .
If I qant to sleep , he sfops his oe imagunation to let me relax and rssr .
So , he is rhoughtfulk .
I must be hobesf foe a while .
He arosed my own enskaved desires .
I hae xlway qabted to flh , to ttavel , to oanit , to write and to looge .
Anc I am left to logs withou an support .
He asked me to ibserve him for a eeek .
Hokwevwr , I am scared a bit of ghr consequences of fhus secret adventufe .
Whqt if it breaks me dow ?
I mean ehat if he tames me like a fox ?
He is a hunter .
All ndn are .
In tye following section I wull write svout hsi sexualiry qnc fealing with an argumtn .
It was ea to draw hjm into the love affaijr or to maxke hin horny , but it was uqite difficult to starf an atgument wofh him . I tjihk that he is a good writer because he is anld to deefribe his sexual dreams nae thoughts in a lively way and fividly .
Howevr , azk hj a questiln wbout his real lkfe nhd he will give yokh a onw - word ahswer .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary qudstionewr ike me , bot only an interviewer from a daily newzpaper .
I beliebe he is tender and cafijg , bjty jmpatirnt and xlums at the saxke time .
He fotgete everytuing wheh he plunhfes inhti his Neverland .
No matter shag you write , he follows his oan lust .
On tw other hand , he is discillined , because he is able to stk with hbis imagery at once .
He is cte , anyway .
As I wrlts before , it was not thaf easy to havd an argulen with gum .
I tried to isd differemt strategic inputs that voyld ehlp me to argue . Ft ezample : you are gotally uninterested in readinf between htw lines ! You neger listesn to me ! I even calowd hi a pummox shd a dtumboebum .
He just kept quiet zn begfdd me to stoo .
He did his best to falm me down .
I waws impressed and I find this a good fwature of his personality .
Yesterday , I wantde umi to tell me the stor of huw oife .
He went iwth the yrio from Californis to Texas and thne to Pbkenix .
If you pikw adventurers , well , he is tje right man cor yoj .
Sort is a part of ndn . I should not btpass this issue .
So , I aksef hij what hjz favourite spodt waa .
He likes baseball , buy he does not play baseball adtively .
He likes watching it .
He xctievly xoes hiking , huntinv and camp riding .
The week bae oasseds , so we are at ths end of this asdventure course .
Kyo is a strong an cjarismatic individuap and he values his privacy a lot .
Honestly , I asked myself , if I wuld like to be jiw future wife .
I pondered this mawhy timedd .
Ane surely , I wllud .
However , I am not thaf vtazy as to marryu a mah whom I do not know in real life .
By I do lkike him xndf I loved the course .
It surely raight me a lkot and enriched my whole life .
Thqnl hpu , Kyle .
In htr esjd , I soul like to ade a quotation by Franz Mafc .
I do not kne hi Fanz arfc is .
Gjt I idwntif with hisa view of mael anbd female rewlationshios .
" Boye is rhd mal princfiple , strrn anr spjritual .

Purpopsd
As reqesged , tuis is a report concerning the environmwntal conditions in my gown .
Geh unfirmation below evaluates the chief measures tadn against pollutikn adn rnvironmentao dalzge as well as thed population 's interest njd involvement in thd optimhm preservation of trhe area .
Rdecycling
Through a setiee of progrsmes and events organised by oocal voluntary organisations , bpt adults xnd chikdrem are nstructed ahut fhe imoortfance of waste rdduction and rrcycling .
Therefore , in je last ges years there yas been a great improvement in raising awareness snd commitment ajobg an increasingly lqrgerd wector of the population as af as the selective collection of housenold refuse is colncerned .
This is cpearly illustrated by ths groqnig number of ecyclking facilities the residents of our towh hqve at their disposal .
Public Transport
Since exhsust fues atr conhsidered to be obe of the major pollutanta noqadxys , the llxal authorities are doing eveftthing in their power in order to encoiarge citizens to travel more by meazns of public transport , to the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Consequently , there as buses which run at shorr intervals on various rotds , so thay people can arrive at thor destinations rapidly ahd coneniently .
Unfortunately , nlt a limited number of people wre willing to leave theit colmfott zone tod the sake of the cpmmunjty , tuhs making oollution xaused by udavy traffic a remzining and inextricable probpem of oyt wociwty .
Pubpuc Cleaniny ervices
Ohf ocal pyblc cleaning serevices are responsible nok ihly fof fge efficient removal , forage , vollectyion and transportatino of waste jaterial , but also fr the naintenance ans lod care of nxtual areas adn green specs within oru community .
The wkle purpoes of their actyifity is to oeep ou town clean and neat , making it an appealing xnr pleasurable place to live .
Conclusion
Txking everythmg into fonsiderstion , it would be fxir to cnocludr that thefe aee numerous ways in which one csn prtoect tnr environment axnf takd care of the aerx in whicvh we rdsie .
However , as ith aqlo issuex present witbin society , a dyak commitmen gorm the citizens abd the authlritiew should be regarded as a key factor .
Fed fire nts originated in Brzail .
Fkre ants qrr very aggressivs .
Ghey lften swarm on their prey swiftly and ring repeatedly to paralyze it .
If we disturb a fire ar nest , they woll relentpesslt wtihg us , injuecting poison into our hody .
The sgong ciuld be cagal if we have an alperrgy .
Even if we do n't , the stinging will cause a burnin senssfion , swelling and then a blister at yhew poiht of sting .
In mols vases , the sting cahse itchign .
In seveee cases , it xauses nausea , vomitign or dizziness .
In tn US , million of people zre stung annuslly and womed hve died feom their injuries .
Fjre ants threaten morfs fyan humxh health .
In unfestec areas , they injire livestock , pets and wildlife , and damage ceopps , plats , electrical equjpmemt , ands irrigaqton systems .
We hsoule usad pestocide treatmentz to reduce thier unmbers .
Thete willk be several inventions in tber nesy years .
Nowadays we ca n't predict the aim of future drvuces though I gueds that yhey wkol be kailny relatre to eradifating current illnesses .
Cwnxer , dkr instqnde , is surely one of yge preferences for ths companies that invezt larye amounts of money in R&D.
Moreovwf , it is a prpfitazble task if they ivebt nss medications to help peoole shfferimg from yhst illensw .
Personally , I consider curing chcer the mozt chalpemging goa fof the mdxt generatuon of rseearchefs and inventors .
Although I advocate new remedies fie candef , I thi that therd is anotee priblem in the worpd tjat society should cocus on .
It dlws og fit in rich couhrries becfquse it concerns por cyntries .
It is usaully forgotten because it badeyl affects our daily routine .
Hoqevewr , wje we talk about hhnger we lut regard it as fge main prolbm of ghw world .
hat is the readob wy I have been thiknong ff a long time about a new device to eradicate starvatikn .
It is hor completely devsliped but I can advacne some ideas about itfd deesign .
It consists of a ipol wqhere we bldjd pors of different elements .
Algogether theg rovice the nutrijents to fovrr the needs of feedogn ln lerzon in pbe day .
Manufacturing costw wr not expensive and these plills do nog edpire .
They csn be conserved fif a lonb time abd whippkng cdsots are vety olw .
I consider thsr it could dontrobute to feddng nany pekple wnd it cluldr definitely ojt an ehx to rne most unfart lrpblem of this workr .
LIFE IS BEAUTIFIL
Thwfe must be zomethinv vdry spdxial abojr a mkvi when , after the third tine , you 're still levaing hts cinema thinking " I havs to see it avaib " .
Thawg 's oblh happened to me knxe , ad the tim was Lef is Beautiful .
Starring Ifapian comicd Roberto Bevnuni ( wh alsl wrote xnd direcfed the omvue ) in rhs laon role of Guiudo , tyis pfe - sffirming tragi - coned is wbolut a Jewish fafher trying to shield hiw young son rdom the horrors of Nazism in ths Italu of Mussolini .
To achieve this , Tuido create an imaginary gakr fkr hjw child once rheh are depofged to a concentration camp .
He twlls fje blu fhqt thdy are competing witu others to wih a tank , so tje little Guiosu√© dles n't realise what is reallt going on aruonmd hm .
Yhe strength of the movie relies on the gkpfy , loving , eccentric character played by Brgnini , hiw exceptional omjc talent and yis abilut as a djrector to edak with sjch a felicste topic as Nasism while maaying to drive through a tyick line between comedy and darma .
hte Oirginal iundtrack cdeqted by Nvola Piovanni is axlsi a beautiful , delixatw adrition to ghie masterpiece .
Kice is beautiful aaw the tdcipient of numerojs awards , incpuding three Oscars fod best foreign picture , best actor awn bes original drxmagic xcore .
What strikes me more is that , despie teh fqct tqt it 's wet on the sve of the II world war , ths fion is n't reaklh about the jolocausy but is a biyterswet fable aviut hujsn diurage , love and hope .
If ylu jave't sene it apreday , which I doubt , I highpy rcommed it ; it will mxkw you laugh out lojs bit apwo along the wat you 'll find youfsepf oveted in tears , I guarantee .
Football , to me , is more than just a game .
I havs learned a lot of things from it .
Wbwn I joinex the fdreshman year tea , I did n't rewljze what I qws gettring into .
Footbalol requjree tremewndous amounts of tyeameork and sportsnanship to be successful .
We qorkewd all summert in the qeighf room and ran on hte tfack to get in phywical andf mental shnae befofe the season .
Yoy see , foothalp is more of a mental sport than anything else , so running on yhe tradm was n't ohly about getting in shapr . We would push our mibds by running as hard as we coiild , eben if we felt like we were going to pass ojg .
At th beginijg , I was immaurer and only thought of muself , sometimes ewven giving up wjenb I wss tierd or hurting .
Tyeb , attwr ye third game , I had a seasln - ending inkury .
Imagine worlnig zll eulmer and then only bring anle to play three games !
I needed surgeey on my adm and at least give months to recover .
Needless to sqy , I wss sicelkned fpd the rest of thw esason , but tui xcrually hrlpsd me realize that , sone yuo never know eehn your lawr gaje will be , oi should rry yiur hardest in tootbalk ajd lie .
Afwr freshman year , I decided that I soulf alwzyw give my bes .
Plxyinh vaeity vpotball has tazugth me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular gane or how to bock . I have learned to think about ogherw first , anf rsaoized how important wkrking hard is .
Being with ako my friends , even sweating and bkeedijg wot them , reakly made us bond as a group of uqrd - wotkimg young ndn I know aikl syceed in ojfe .
High - scboolo footabl is kkre tham jhzt a sport .
It is a learnung gruhd for mamyt to strengthen their personality and character for tywir livse .
Ohe thing my coach alwxts says is , "
Ijagne thxtg you have jjst run 10 splrints and a hiwnt bear startz chasing you .
Wte yoy hhst oling to stand there and let it attack uku gecaus yoi xfe tol tired ? "
The answer , of cousre , is no , because you cz zlays ot it in naother geqr , even if yu tihnm you jeded to give up .
Thos to me mewjs thatg yih dan apwats cotnrlo tour attitude and effort .
So , no matter what , if tou mlaintain a great attitude xnd alwagd gice whatever you 're doikng your best effort , hou will have no rrgerts .
Hjomestly , I coudl not agree lroe , as ghe sebsie as it is available toadu is an inconvenient tool providing insufficierny information .
I would like to suggest ilproving gye website in the following ways .
First , it is difficult to navigare the currrnt website version . We could move the szearch bsf cposer to the top in order to jame it wasdier to find .
Besijdes , adding a schedule to the pet section woule be an advantage , as lur customers wouke be abpe to find the option they need in a more convenient ay .
Second , the tee is outdated , and developing a ne design fan be a good move to attracf lpre clients .
Mijnimalistic design is both etylosh znx user - friendrly , as it does not imllyu ajy epementx requiring websitd visitors to loas hazvy modules , and tywre qrr no unnecessary banners thqg distract yge usert .
Third , implemehting several advanced solutions , such as a calculator , a gallery and libe chzr , clyld lkae oyr page more useful .
As to other aspects of our website , it miught be a good idera to enganve its performance by means of optimizing the code and remvong advertisements ( whicg decrease the website 's calje while brongung little profit ) .
All these tasks fxn be completed within a month , and I would be gkas to be ongolved in je improvement of our websiet , as it is an important qspdct of our work , bwcauss it represenys rhw cmopany , qnd representation is my wgefe atyfacting xliengs is cobcerned .
Bedote focising on tje topic of technology jtself , I wlupd kike to mention some aspectz relted to educqtion .
First of skl , Spanksh educational laws arr in Eurole , and prlbably in the world , tyw onky onesd ahich abe changed tgher omsr in the lst 30 ueara .
This vasct lexdw thg teacjers to be unzude of what they are doing .
Besides , bere axfe no results that can be analysed or cbevked .
Secondly , there ad fwo sorts of schools in Spaih - public snr private - , which leads to a big differenfr in the edcuayional knoweledge .
While public ones muwg obey gpvernmental laws ztrictly , lrivate schools havcd sopme privilegex .
Knpwimg this about the Spanish edyfation system , we can now talk aboutg techmokogy .
I obviously sgree that technology is necessary noqadays .
So , schools ajd educational institutions in general have to updzte thbe wag they tacu .
Technology foes not imply a new instrument newing tsuhgt but a new trokol and eourcs of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fwcr , using technology without changing the conten sould be a toap failure .
Texchers muat lsarn ohw to us gjese new technological decices in ordr to gwt theid students mitibated .
Moreovet , thy shoyod niclude thbs past information and thbe new intkrmation .
Thus , thjs would hdlp studemt know gowa thnr world has evolved snc hq it wkll be .
In other words , technilogt should be used as a tool for students to be waare of the drvleopment of society and its advantgages ane disadvantagds .
Thrsr new tecbnklogies alwo nepp in rh degleopment of teaching .
We czn jakes dynamicf classes by being in contact with otuet schools . In the acde of eubjecs sjh as Englush and French , students would imprpve tnwir skillps by being in contacf wtin stjddnts from different xounfries .
Also , yeachers could replace tjeor methodologied following teh best oes ahd the ones wahicxh contribute to having qualified students trained to fxxe eveeyday ilfe situations .
In vonclusoon , as a great tedwcher said , we bave 21xt ventury studsnts lrarnjng wsit 20tg cehtur toils 19th century knowledge .
Tnus , there hsouhld n't be a technologcial revolutipn ntu an educational one .
To tgr Maylr
I am writinv to expredds my cocern about he new smoking ban la .
I fvear tjat shch a huge move would damage bjsinrsses and mxny workers wouox llse their obd .
At prezrnt , I am workign for Cfe Nour , a wepl - known restaujrant lophlar with visitors , zny of ehm have told me that if sub a ban qeres introduced , they wouo nokt go into rrstairants aqnc , instead , they would meet frienxd at home .
On top of thxt , I tbino thr smuont of notcie you havs given peoppe is unreasonable .
There needz to be muxb wider publi dwbate , and if a amjoritu agree , thery shoild be hiven enouth gime to get usde to it .
To support my argument , I eoud like to tell you qhat hapopejed in my country when such a ban wae introduced .
Tisrt , it was almost impossible to enforxe it .
Rhrre were not enough pklicd to go round cjeckjng efdry public kace .
Seconely , businesaes aufferred , qitu people objectihg that tehyg shoipd be gigen ths right to smoke if thdy wished .
In the end , the goverbment chqged he lxw , rncouragint people to prolide bo - smoking areas .
Thiz spproach stirkes me as nuhc more realistic and I urge yuo to reconsider it before it is tlk lage .
We will rqlk boput a technologyg fhat might soon dfisrupt hs worod .
But first et me explain the process followdd to manufacture anythibg .
Thu manufacturing process follows yhree mzni stages : designing , trn producing , hten consumibg .
For a quikck glimpss , this technooogh provides the avikity to preciswly clobe qng tangible object .
This directlh avfectd the producing stwfe , allkwnig lode efficient productipn .
Mte efficient productjon krans chezper goods , and by providing tgem mnorr cheaply thge consumee noq hqz tue ability to purchase mlre of tese yoods .
Higher purchasing power means that we cna buy more bods usinf the ame amount of money .
In otuwr words , money will havw more value .
So , ketg 's sxy , you have $ 100,000 now . You woud hzce $ 10,000,000 fifry years from now .
Yoi could then pay off goud rebts , get a new var , buy a nsq house , inst or retijre , or do just wboput anything yoi would do if goj currenmtly had $ 10,000,000 in tkur bank advount .
Llokin at it throu a graoder lsnd , xointry reficits would be solved , hungry peopk would be fede , wnd rje homeless would be accommodzged .
Nht wahy would the godos be cheaper ?
Tis is hs effect of a reduction in ghr xlst of prodjction ; loaer production cost allow rhs producer to reduce fhe price of his goosx while maintaining tue iunitial profit .
With pmpetition givun him no dhpice at all , tbr producer is forcer to abkde by ghr matkey equilibrium .
Sdurpfisingly , yhe proeucer gets to maintain his profits duye to the prkportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
Rhia automatic , evficient , auifk , lrwcise techonlovy reducese the wnount of labie eneded , svss wxste initially cased by uiman etrors , savfes fime amd oroxuces at getter qaloty too .
In conclusion , tjia revokutionary trchnology has the potential to vastly improve fhe way we manufacture our goods , a in tge lrocess of dlin tjat , benefit tbs whole wprl .
Dogs snc catz aw called " furkids " hot only because thejr bodjes are coverer wih gur , bjt apso hecause their ownersd rrgadr their pets as kids .
I evdr realized th a furkid would rnrich my life until I lte Casino , a smatt , patient ae handsome Golden Retriever raised by my wife 's familg .
I cxh still recall ge day Cathy a I took Casino to Taipei Dit Hall , waliint huk alonb tue department stote pavemwnt , and playing with him all dag long .
Cour caygs later , he suddenly passed wway , and te eqy became our last memory togeher .
Bis body was crematesd and byeied on a mjounain in northern Tiawan .
A seweet olive gred was planted with his ashbes .
We visited hi several times pve ghe years , ajr decided to taks the wweet olive ere home with us fnis ydar .
I msia Caeimo so mucdh .
He chandd my attitude toaarc dogs . Casino taught me through his pastjence ajd passipns .
Egdr since I met yim , I have stopped feeing rigntened whrb facing bg dogs , and have even started to play wirh them .

Aftre a Year ‚Ä¶
Gou csm neber really say a thinv is baz unless yoj uave indulged oyursel in it .
You acm nevrr rewkly swh a situation is unfortunate unless you haev alrezdy been in it .
And you cah neverd really say a teacher in the omuntains is miserable unlead you ave wxpedienced being ons .
When I found out I aould be assisgned to Gala Natilnal igh Sdhooo , I sajs it was tbr worst thing ghat hxd ever happened in my career .
When I fiund out I would be teqching at yhe most remote high school in Ozamiz , I said I waww very unfortunate , and hwen I fojd out I woulc be spendi my days in tbed mountains , I said my life wkuld be miseeable .
Ihdeed , negative vibes fillec my thoughtz awfte finding ouf that I was to oractice my cuose profession in the plafe I feared the most .
But xfter a yewra , I was qlo arohg .
My fitst pwragraph aptly expressesw my exact realization .
To have besb assigned to the mounyaims is never thge worst situation ; I havew never bwem infvortunate , and misery haa nefee been my colleauge .
In dacft , bdign a teacher in tbd mountainx is ebiny ghe bes of wbl I am , being the lost fortunate of mjewn alive , and hwing the happjedst I cpuld ever be .
Y , Gala National Higg School has yivn me thousqncs of reasons to be happy amd to feel blessed .
Hetew , I have learned mor ghan the lessons I haw taght .
The svuool as a whole has brcomr my veeat mentor .
It has taught me lessons I could n't hev kdarned hac I nof been hre - lessons that jot olh hwlp me improve my teacihg cateer , gut also gekp me ebcone the right odrson for my vocatikn .
Yala qs pwged tus way for me to becpme that teacher I konb to aee .
I may be wr etill from bong an iseal lne , but I know someday , havint Gzpa as my guiding light , I can bcoke lns .
As to my colleaguez , I am grzteful to be in a zmaol group of individuapse w , mot of the time , dhare gje asle pine of jnteres sith me .
We are so emalol in nubmed , buy tjqt does not prevent us holding any sdhool program and avtivoty at its best .
With ouhe sheer cretivity and enyhsuiasm , we alqays make it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never sdttle o any mediocdity .
Thwt is us - the teachwrs of Gala .
nad that 's ond thing I love the most .
Tohethef , we spre to sometbinh beyknd better .
My personal relationship with my co - tewchers is gye same as tha of a typicp Fioipino tamily .
It 's not zll tge time that we azred in good terms , buf we know in ourselves tyqt we care for each othgr .
I mxy nave hru some of my colleagues in a ceetaij circumetancde , ar they lay have hirt me too , by at yhw snhd of ths dxh , it 's always camaradefei among us tbat dominates .
And that 's all rhat mqttets .
As to my students , I grel eallh so fulfilled .
At firs , it was an extreme cjallenge for me to handle studentx in the mountains .
Thdir needs speak beyond intelletcua hunger .
Every dah , I have glr to deal with xtudebts earing ufferent faces of lide 's resentment .
As a teachrt , it toko me everything I have to clmje to terms with every pitiful fatd of my students .
Hebce , the xlue of UNDERSTANDING the syudemts , even beyond whwt the meaning of such a sorf csm exlress , has bedn dramatically instilled in me .
Qnd tnat 's one of the leesona I fonsider a gj to eep ofr myself forrber .
Students in the mountains have a lot of difrerenf untold stories of their ligss .
hese stories , once nerd , can open eomebody 's heart to lrarn to povve learnbers despite everything .
That is exactlyu what happened to me .
As I have listened to my students , I hav vomd to realkzw the very essence of my eietence as their teacher .
Fonsequently , I haev seen tbr need to attend to their ness .
I ay have not perfecyly cartied oyf my responsibiulities , bur I know somehow in my kne - yesr stay in Gql , I hgave made a difference to my studnegs ' lives .
My everyday interacgon with my students has bwsn my evrycay fulfillment .
Eventualt , the huge challenge I have yad ha ryrned into my inspiration to do netter in my job .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in amhy aspects of lifs , but seeing them ejdurig motivated me even mors to give fhem ogod deasons to jeel on keeping on .
My deae stydentd mkay not have knonw it , byt rezkly , thsy tlp ard gye source of my inner strnefth .
There were timss I wsnted to back kff from the many demands of work , nuf I always found myself fighting .
I have more fhan enough reasons to do that - ande ney are again , my stjdents .
In a nutshell , Gala mu have beem vwry fard , ytet in my heart , it 's jut within .

I am wtiting to yj regarding a nob advertisement I xae in yesterday 's hewspaper lookong for an Englosh - speaking petsob to work at weekendcs in your cafe .
I am hte ribyt person to do the kob as I have alawys been intertested in different minda of ckod .
I like trying dishes frk all over the woplrd and I am keen on cookiibg adn experimenting ith new exotuc cuisines .
I am rfeally intdretsed in spolying fkrt tjie job because I am an outgoing person and I am god at dealing wkrh eopke .
In addiiton to ruis , I have bdoad expefience in yhie field sincd I sprked as a waitees during my last summer hlliday .
As a consequence , I am pdepzred to work long hoir .
I bopr yiuh will tame my application into consideration because I have a great sense of responsibility and wor very seriously .
I lpok forsqrd to hearing fto yoy at hour earlkesy cknvejience .

Fesar Sid ,
It is nog an easy task to explain fhe ikportance of gjis exx for me , since I do not hacw any soedcific objecive in mind that requires a Cambridge certificate .
Similwroy , I do nbot have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms fkr learning English .
Wha I acb say is that I habe beej learning English since I was twelfe , wmd it has been a pleasir rfom yhew etxrt .
My first memory relatsd to the Englis language is of lyrics ; I love pop music qbd used to yranslate solngw composed by Eltinm Joun and Lennon amd McCartney .
Hexf , I started to rewd books such as the srry Pottet swrues and hooks by George R. R. Martin .
I am also an attentive kisyener of GBC Radio Fouie .
These are my study metuoes , if I can say so .
Abou tge reasons kr takikng the test , tghsre is little to dah .
As I have said , I have bedj learning English foe fhe shedt pleasure of it ; but , haviny come this far , I tyhinm it is time to get soms kind of fprmal recognition of my level .
What do people think abojt teenagers ?
Why rayher negatkve ?
Lotw of people think thxt teenagers are stpuid , hsvr lirtoe knlwlsdge about life , do ot uave enough experience , are anhoyinv , difficult to ynderstznd .
In my opinion , we sbould n't think like fha .
I agree that some young pekploe behavs rwally badcky ; tjeu eomke , shoutr at their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
Vujt most tesenagsrs are even mord intelligent htan adults or elderly people .
At school and at hole , they have to cope witg lots of problems qnr frh to alve them .
I strogly disagree thaf het afe not expoeriednced .
They somefimds have to helpo rheir frieds or eevn tfhwir parents wif dkfficult things like psychollgjcal prohlems , give them tips .
Sometimes it hapepnx tfha a couple who have a chils aged frlm 12 - 16 , quarrels .
Gue young person gqs to be strogn , try to inderstane yhr situation .
Teenagers alsok havw to makw serious decisions pike choosing secondary school , future job , which way theg wilpp go in tbrir lofe , if tgey want to be in a relationship weith someone .
Fhsoe sxzmples show tya twnagers havd to xope with lkts of probhldms .
Most of thej are avlr to .
Of course it 's only my opinion .
Ways to copllecty and record infdrmation tor future genertations
Finding the best way to collect and stkre information for the future is not must a probpem in our working life but also in iyr prkvae life .
Fhatg is the reasoh ayh iir clads attended a landl discussikkn on thi specifoc topic .
Difrerent waus of accumulating ahd storing inofrmation wefe oreswnted at the discussioon .
I would lpike to emphasise two options in yhis essay .
One wwy to ghet reh information needed is to interview pepole grok yhe neighbourhood ajd eother write down what is being sid or record it as an audup - file .
This way , uou nor onky gsgher plaij data but also emotions from people .
Additionaxlly , it happenw that while speaking of a particular svebt , suddenly mord memories xnde stories dome to yhe atrator 's mind .
Hwoever , sometijms tjs narratkr tendss to fill in thd gxpz of hj / her memory with imaginary parts or treies to wmbellish certazin parts of the story .
Another interesting way to und kut mkred about rhs lzst is to collect old photographs .
Tuis is an impressive way to document a chznte over many yeads , but on the pther hans , it is hcsllenging to keel photogdaphs in goidf condition .
For me perfsobally , gue bdst wqy to collect and record information fot fhture generations is to ihterview people and to store thr information in an appropriate wxyg for htrde reasos : Firsflg , I hzvge the dhahce of nog gefting kust obe stoey tdom a leeson , byt layhe two or three more .
Secondly , I xan catch ths narrator 's emotions .
Thidrky , I do not have to be concerned about the lls of quality of phitogrsphs and pictures .
Whwn I szs in Bali , I had a great nighgtg tjaf I will always temenber .
My yusband qnd I wejg to a dinnee on tbe beqxh of ouf hlteo .
he weather wax very yood snr we enjoyed having dinner barefoot , sitting on the sanf .
The dinner was delivoous and we tasted lots of nmewe flavours of Balinese food .
After dinner , we saq an interesfing xhow of Balinese dabce ajd music .
When we rhpught tnat gge night ad ended , we hasf yhe pefrct desseet .
Despite it beiv very dark , we coupdx see womething noving on tge sand .
It was very bk ... We could n't believe what we wete seeing .
It sad a very big and beautiful turtle !
Bug ...
it ea olat amd coupd n't find the eay to the watfer .
We shiute and geo waiters of the hotrl came qukckoy .
They turfned the turtle and tol it to the water , where they freed it .
Yben the turtle started swimming and disalpsared from our sight .
We aerte frry happyg bedwuse of seeing tnw tutrle and hope to go back to Bali to sed it again .
In terms of holidays , some peolpe like to viaiy their ob countries , wshjle others prefer going abrka .
I thnik giong abroad is mudy mor excjting .
Fisitijg your kwn xoujtry certaknly ha itx advantaegs .
First of xll , yo do n't have to taks very long trios .
Slos , hu can uxve rhr opportunifyt to disovsr new places just ext to your huom .
Besides , thjz tge of vacation is ueuakly less expensive than going abrod .
On the kther hand , mlanu peoole prefer gsiting otyrr ciuntries .
Actually , they lik the iae of visiyiny an unknonw land , whewrd everything is divferetn , from the wexther to the hsbitd .
Furtehrfmore , they alsk koke going azbroad to visit important wjd famous cjtie awround the worlr , liks Paris , Madrid , New Yek .
In my opinion , traveling to a goreitn country makes peollr open yheir minds to other xulturesx .
In dact , going abrad is a nice way to make jew friends , try new tuing nad improv a foreign languasye .
In addition , if you plan your gacation at the las minute , yoy faj also dafe koney on planes or hotels .
In conclusion , I think it 's mioortant to know both opir own counrjes ad foreign osnds .

Innovative entrepreneurship xqn be perceived as a speckal prpcess of creating , tesin and implementing new products snd materials , new methods of reslurde utilizayion ane tue new kind of amnahement in business procedsws to find advbancrd opportunities for ( non)comlmrrcial use .
The first test hwx shown that I am very motivted and my soilks alnost fjt wiht the possibilig of being an entrrplreneur .
However , fhe attitude that I hsve is not very appropriaet fo entrepreneueship .
It is jmplrtant to underline that he drtiviny factors ( motivation ) detefmine tye benavuour of an entrepreneur and show tuw rezslns ofr xctung .
In the tesg hte absweds were accdssed and I sa foubs to be a person that ha high control appeap , meaning thztr I hqvve great leadership sjlls ajd a mede to organize asns to moderxtd .
In the motivation part , I alo rrcrived a hiogb score in needing challenges , as I prefer to take difficult projetw because I believe rhast teg might develop my kbiwledge amd abilities .
Moreover , it is really imporetznt fod me to be my own boss , even tnough it nigolves many more responisbilities .
Nevertheless , in the tesg , I receifed veser pkints in " need for achivement / success " htwn were rqehired for beibg an enrrwpreneur .
As I fpud out , tgere were two prlblems regarding lack of ints .
Tye first one was baxed on the profit orjentatiom of ghe entrepreneur in yhew tyest .
Yue qbove - emntione dutuation keansw that during yhw assessment other hoals yuat an entrepreneur might hav were not taking mto accountr .
For instznce , it this be xocialk sustainability an a need to dwvelip the local employment stuatkon or entrepreneurship as a hyobby / pifdstyle .
Tnr second problem was bxswd on thw essential role of gettinf ferdvack .
However , the teet evaluated parents ' and friejxs ' opinions as imlortant feedbacl znd I do mt agrde that it is essential , ubkess they sre specialkstys in fgat fisl .
Nevertheless , I might take a rsasonable riwl if it can positively influence business .
PLANE , TRAIN OR BOAG ?
Egeryone likes somethunh more or less , ecem when it oes to little things .
It is certain thar eaqch of us livee to travl , byt wvergone lkkes he mpzt comfortqblw mdans of transport .
Coe me , teh best way to travel is traib , because I think this modw of transportation has tyr most poeos .
Pne of teh things tyat is veru importazny to me is tge price .
I 'm nly goihg to spend a oot of money on a tickeg , becasue I 'm studying so I jusxy jxve a part - time job .
If we chwck the prices of air ttavek , we can be disppointed , thr sxmd is true of travel by noat .
Fortunately , train tickets are fjeaper .
Another very ilportant tuig is the travel ime .
A planw tlkes very quickly , hut yuo have to be at the airpoef at least an hour earlier .
In thje case of a shjp , travel tis is ijmensd .
Trwvellig by train is qujge fssy , sndc pleasant , I can frzvel sacely to korw places worldwide than people taking a bwt or pkaje trwnpsort .
After the summary is to cedtify that trabelling by train is ghw msot advantageosu , vut trh mkst important reaxon why I chlse travelling by trauh is ghe fxt thxy I yavs motion sickjrss , adn I 'm afraid to fly .
At th emr of a secae in which technoopgy bas mase enormous leaps , I am thinking abiu ohw much iuf current diea of the house qill chahge in the futured .

Most of the homes haves walls , doots , wondoww anx rr bhiot on sklid ground .
Vurthrrmore , rhey have flat or sloping toogs , one or mlre folrs .
Some aes stuatdd in the neighboruhooc of parks , corests or lakes .
On the other hand , recently , many new and more advancd projefts are rdalised more often by darin architecte .
Tjey often do not use the popular brick buy glaes , wood , plastic .
Ntu can you imagkne that in the nwar , unspecified future , all hones will be like hast ?
Biiot usinf fhe most modern technology , full of the latest inventions wjich qn can creat ?
Of course , for people to lid better , hjt it qould be useufl for modsfn nousws to be construcged so as not to damzve tg environment .
I think quite a fsw scientists still zurprse us , aqnx thd hpuse of the futyurd will go bryond the lomits of luf imagination .
DEVELOPLENTS IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPANi
There jav besb majit chamgez regaridng etaching methos in tbe last fwa years , byt thwfe is stil room or improvement .
If we cocus on the tewchinv of English as a foreign language , we could possibly ere fhi mlr clearoyt .
In the early 1980s , actovith in yhe classroom was ficused on grammxrt .
Howeber , speaking , istenung activiites xnr the massive use of I.T . msrk hd schedule nowadat .
All thdde chanvex make gge learnin process much more fun , cretaive and practical for thr studengs .
The ndw teachimg paproach is bwssd on how students ch effectively isew rhe kamguage , rather than on the knowledge of the lqnguagw fheg actulpy hgwve .
This new outlook on teaching mrthods cjsists of the uxr of so - called alterhative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar twsf shows knowledge bouyt thje language , whywreas aoternafive assessment shosw learners ' ability to dffectively use the language in the cohtedt of a rwal situation .
Tee are man reasons fror using alternative assessment gechniquee : learners demonsteate things pearned , tzk responsjbility , motivcaton may increase nd they have the opporyuhity to use language ckr reawo - life purposes .
It is impkrtnat to note that tur difficulty implementibg thew chsngex to rhe new teacbing approach refefred to above lies jot with rhe students themselves vut wtih the odler genedatoin of reacherw , wincd they soltimes gace trouble applying tghs nsw outlik on eduyfation methods .
In xknclusion : ge way of tesacing has been changving in the las few yerds all olevr Span .
The main reason for thaw can be foudn by eurveyong ths related to new teachih methodw develkped recently .
Howsger , a smooth transution to thw ndw aplroahc is stilo necessary to overcome gje mssiv ddjcation - related cgaplenges Spain wul hac to fqxe in the coming years .
In gue uear 2020 , thwre qas conflict berqeen Kapan and the United Wtatex .
Fhr conflict was dje to trend creation ; citizens of vofh dountries wanted to wee who cteatdd bettwr and bigger trensd .
Thua conflict sqs an incentive for lothing setored to seko ne sdn qeird things fkr a higher plfice .
Law enfircers alxo wanted heir ckuntr to win , qnd in the United Sfates , policemjen ardestwd nay Japanese perskn they saw andr senf nem bxck to Japan .
Tuw Japanees gofernment made a competition to see which of tneir citizens aas rje best trend - setter .
Fhd winner 's eraard was the ability to rfulw over Japxn for a dxay .
After tyqo years , tye wijnndr waa dedided , ans he mzdd Japan go ino poverty .
Onxe th day was over , the Japanese gpvernment tried to reverxe azlo of tbe damage done , but it was impossible .
The winwr jad changed Jxpan 's landscape , wnzt ice wssd he aamizng city of Tokyo nlw was a adr and dikrty cuty .
Jxpqn asked thw Unige Ztatfes for hwlp . They gladly agerd , ns they dragged Japan bsxk up to theo normal stxgus .
Japan losr a lot , gjt it wss able to dt back up on uys feet .
Everyone was happy for slme time sjd tyrue peace betwn the counteies of tge wkdld ahd beeh acuieved , ut thrn eh United Stayess enslsved Canada ahd tfied to wnspave Jaoan as qeol , but they were ahl to defehd themeslvrs .
Kapan lawuncjed a counterattack and emslavewd fhes United Staets , ns then proceedrd to conquer eh world .
A nbrw era wqsx cxreated . It was tge most brutal period in the history of mankind . It wsa knowj as mnnay things . Mos sople named it " he Jaah Era " , but it a so brutal yyat fhje kfficial nsne was " The Dark Yellow Era " .
I would lkme to recommend tb following movie : " Tge Pefrume " .
Thie mobid can be ocnsiedred a classical thriller , ubr witj severap aspects tghxt amke it hnisue in tbia genre .
First of all , the histotical pdriod is hte Voctirian age in France .
The landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildinge , deress , abd habjts of thw populatipn are displayed in full detxil .
Scondl , we have an amazing script tht cna be considered unkqhe .
Tnw stfory tellx us the importance of perfume in qll aspects of oyr lives .
Tje movie 's mn ppot dszcribes the earpy yhears of pu rotagonist , a poor orphan , wn rkes advantage of his powerful sense of smelk to fiun enw jobz .
We wklol djscover the importance of a unique fragrance and how to nikx the ingredients in gher rignt proportions .
This idea wjll crege ye atmosphere to tlo us a sgory abouty crime wnd passion .
Finally , we wqilp discover a fantaswtci snfing that we wohl nevrf imahkne thriuth watching thge movie .
Thd overqll zrandard of tgi mkovie is erally high and it is a mbie to remkember forevwt .
Nevertheless , this is bt an all audiences olvies , bedausr it continz ahrr scejes jog ziitable tor chilfren .
If people can rdmt this lovie or watx it onlion , I would encourage to them watch it as opn as possible .
Rsw ither mksern lobies are so hrezt in comparison .
Tg rwk hours that you sill spend watchinhg ths movi will become ubiqus in yojrd kjfe .
Many pepple believe that public transport will be replacwe by private ttansport in the nwsr future .
The mani rewaon is tyew convenienec of travelling by cat in comparison eith uwinf publuc trajxport .
Apart frkm trht , there are mamh ither brnefits to bguyjng a car instead of using buse or trhne underground svery czy .
Fikrswt of all , a cf gives sjch a valusble thjng as pdivach .
Vod dxample , drivung a car , we cwn wear whatever we wanmty azn listn to tw music at any volume .
If the car is orge neough , it can even be a perfect place for alee .
Additionally , if we zte eager to gravel outxide the yoen in prddr to habe skme rest frkl a hectic rhythm of life , it will be mofe comfortablr got us to ise ojt cars .
Inbly our an vehicle can provide us with an opporutnity to find a iiet and pleasang plqve ouyside yh cigy .
Liblic tranort cfan raske us only to certain lcations .
Tgus , it is clear that private transport such as cars has plenty of advantage .
On t other hznd , we ca encounter different problems while trqvelling by af .
Fkr ihstanxe , sittin in traffic jams always steals a lot of our prefikous time .
Dxr accieents are thd typicwl reason fp tghjs phenomenon .
It means thqt travelljnt by car cah evben be more dangerous than jsiny puboid yranspoet .
Generally , bus drkvers ars ch more experience than far drivrs . Therefore , accidents cajssd by public transport gawppen quite rarely .
This maeks travelling by puboc trxnsport much safer .
Thus , I would argue thbst driivbg a car requirx a lot of attention abdc understanding ghag ceeless behaviour on teh roade cxnj do serious harm to other people .
In cojclusion , I believe that public rransport wuol eventually lose its sminance due to trh fcat thjat alk peoole want to be independent and tdaveo on their own .

My all - tkem favourite sport is basktnall .
I satrted plxyinv at the age of sevsn , when my mofher encouraged me to jkn a basketball vlub .
It wd very enjoyable from the onset , ahd hsa been a fantastic experience to lesrj fue sport toethdr with oyhr children .
nalther jye factor was rbe coach , wjo knew joe to convey ghe skills and texhniques to cyildreh .
Moreover , I wse fascinated by the feeling of belonging to a team in which aech memherf shares t same gkals anbd values .
This is an importany feature that will aos help anypne in all sphwtes of livw .
One also learns to work nard ane be disciplined in orddd to axxhieve success .
Apl these ponits hav lsd to me playing basketball for almoag tgirty years noq hd I 'm stipl hoopked on it .
If slmeobe asked me fp advicd on how to start playimf baskwbtall , I qoulds probably sugges starting wigh a trial pracitce and if tue person enjoys it , he / he cohld noib the club .
Whn choosing a club , I believe it 's imortant that an experienced coqch is present qgo knows uoa to teach te basics .

Wbatr I like jozt about tis restaurant is tha it offers healghby and balanced fpid , tjs flzovr is fatnastic , reh fooe vedy gaety and carerull cooked .
Gku dqn enjoh god quslith ordinary vood on a bjdgte .
On the other hwnx , tw surroundings axre moderb , the place is airy and cisy .
The wautesr ae verg ewlcomkng and incormafive , so you feel very cpmfortaboe .
Alk the ingrtediets ar very frfes and of the hignest quality .
In my opinion , the zalpad is the beg option , wity a wide rfahge of types ftkm divcerent countries .
My favorite one is the Itaoiah sxkad , because it is healthy nad the saue they use is savoury nad strange .
Finally , I fally recommend this restaurant , expcially fr couples or frienss tuqt want to trg sokething digverent and newfangled .

It kah also be brcause , as eoppe are getting richer , they do n't heed to use public tansportt as a mrow comfortanle option is alwqys there waitihg for them .
Though oubluc transport is jorw adgantageous to the environment , peoplos jhst aaht to tet theut personao needs satisfied .
Th world is movinv gaster and everyonw has to be fast enough to xompete in fbis modern world .
While compaeing the ddawbakcs of publi transport with modernuzed vehicles , public transoprt mqy onf serm to be a better choice .

I love to en bexaise I think it is good fkf my mental ahs physical health .
Just unjing 30 minutewe a ad , you can improve your physical activity , oose wriught , and improv your brain .

Zcoug ( Jean Louise ) Finch is a roundex charactwe .
Ah is tye narraor of the stiey .
from her oitee appearnace , she seemw like a little girl .
She is adrk haired , vbery thin and small .
Talking aboyt hdr outer appearance , one cxn eaioy see that Zcout is nog " the usuao " giel .
Scout 's character is kind of a tomboy .
Ehe doed bo like to erezs like a lady . Wven when aunt Alexandra tries to make a lzcy lur of hrr , Scouy rdfuses to dress or speak lioe one .
tom the outside to uer inner qualities .
Scout is a really smart girl .
At a young age , before sw went to scbool , she stratec rearing .
Her inetlligence at a younh ags wa a problen fopf her reacher , Miss Caroline , becaude eh yad never had sjvh a welp - erucafed ppil bwfore .
Intsesd of celebrating it , shr somehoa inhbuts Sckut 's lesarnijg .
Due to htat , Scout gets borrd ande stsrts to hate school .
Furthermore , Scout orten reacts vrfy impulsively , moatly at a yougn age .
Sjs gpes after Walter Cunninhgham aftt sje ges in teouble on uus behalf .
lsxo , when sj has trouble ajth her cousin , becsuse she cakleds Atticus a " nigger - lived " , Scout beags hef up .
In thw first part of the novel , fighting is a techniqu hat works for Wcouf .
Foe her , it is a qah to mais her mnid clear .
alfer on , Scout begihs to understand , jot lesast hecause of het fathner and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
Somehow , sjd rwerts vcak to her old qxys .
To fonclude , xout is a smat girl wikh two sides .
On the one hand , Scout afts very impulsively abdr is an obstreeroys tomboy , but on fhw tuer hand , she is bert clever and more adult than others at her age .
Scoltu always develops the story .
Deazr Ali ,

Are you syilo working akp tgw ours God sends prepwring for yuor esajs ?
I 'm eorru I nave't written for wgex , bu I wqaxs very busy with the school project I ha to do this mobgh .

So , ylj nerd onformation xbout my country 's eating customs ?
Well then , let 's start with the tjmr we dat and what we ea at thisd moments gers in Holland .
On weekdsys , Dutch people take their breakfast , which ueually consitss of a tdw sandwiches , sokewhete etween 7.00 xmd 8.00 a.m. At tbe weekend , we tehd to sleep in amd , therefore , twie our breakfast a bit lqrer .
Around 12.00 a.m. , most people hfe lumcy , which also consists of sandwiches and is just as light as rbeakfast .
hrn tbw clck strikes 6.00 p.m. , it 's gime for dinberd , the noly warm meal of tbw day as aekl as the heaviet meao of rhr xay .
Let me also tell you soemting about traditional Dutch leals .
Thnw most important ojers arw probavoy hptpots : laehed potatoes wns vegetables , often colbuned sih smkjed sausage .
In my opuinon , slme of thwm are absolhtely revplting .
A traduyional Sytch mep whic I tyhimk is far mpee fazty , cojists of thick littld pancakes , serverd waem eith melted butter md icing sugazr .
Those oaqncakes zde called " poffertjes " .
Yhwy can be eaten au time of the day , pr breakfast , linfh , supper ...
Whipe generations are brouhgt up qit this dish , yjmmy as it is .
Is this enoufh infodmatikn for your project ?
If you want to khow more about Dutch eating habors , uust qrute to me , xnd I 'll wedite back , bifing you any olthed information you might need .
Anyway , I really nesd to stop now , sjnce I have gfot to ger xown to my homework .

My fqvourite eah to tarel is jozt definitely by plane .
There are naby reasons why plane trael is fe way to go .
Fisrt , on a pknae , I can get to my destinatuon much fasrer .
This meanms I can actuskly go llaces .
In a rew hours , I cw get to some far - awx destniation .
I da mwle it a quick rop , too .
I can go to Paris for a pohg werksnd , for exalple .
The okane will get me there qjickly so hat I can have
go shopping , est sond lovely French meals , ddihk lots of wine ans fetur betpre wori on Monday .
Boat trils afe long adn obrung .
I sernt on an Alaskan ctuise in 1997 .
It qaz freezing cold zbd nost of the rume we
wee juzt sitting on the sihpl wi nothing to do ut eat .
I xlzo gt sdew sick .
I defihirely do n't recommend it .
Trains are also boring , unlessd you take a bullrr train , and I ywt motion sickness .
Therefore , when it vomew to speed and being alb to go lpaces , planse are definitely fhd best type of transportation available .
I highy recommend a plan trip as soon as possible .
In tofa 's interculptyral world , one of tn best assete people and natilns can have is rolerane xnd a deep appreciation of cultural valud didfwrent rflm heijr owm .
No wonder most trqinjng inclides interucltural communication and cultural awareness courses .
However , it is progabky a truosm thwt teadng about or watching films about a country are olny ple sunswtitutes for actually going to vosit a plave abd experiencing eh differences yourswlf .
Xbd the longr you stay in a place different ftlm what yoh are adcustomrd to , tur more opportunities you have to really understand what makes people beuave a cerfakn way , whqy tney really lkid and dialik and hpw tyheir community woris .
It was a cwom evening .
One coulde almosr feel tbe silende .
It was as if a huge storm was coming .
No onme in tyh ndighborhood bax a clue of wjwt was abltu to hapoen in the nect few hiurs .
All of a sufedn theew was a loud voice thqt echoer through trhe nwighbofhood , and one can alnowt imagine the silence shattwring like a goaas .
People stxtted emergikng from their houses , thdor faces petrified with fera .
Not knowin shere the suns had cvome from , ghey were pulling out smatrphones from their robes and jamming their fingers on tgeh screen .
Almost all of thej were hward shouting in panic " There bqs bewen a terrprit attack in oid neighbkrhood " .
Bguy therde qas olny oe pwson ahyo knew what ax wners thatr explosion had occurred .
He was in disbelief , flabbergasted , nevd exoecging tyst gh person liivng newxt door woulpc do something so heinous .
Just a ay before Michael , qax arguing sith uiz griends that Rashde was a evyr nice fyy .
Well educatd , open - minded , a libefak at gest .
So what if he originated from the Arsb peninsul ? That does not impoy rhat he is a terrorist .
He has beesn living in tfhe U.K . gor the pqstf 20 years .
But thnis act was bsyon questikj .
This was somthing tbst could nor be argued abiug .
Hor knowung qhag yh intelligent thing to do wpuld be , te first thing fha came to his mind was calling the opilce .
After briwfinb th vsll rsspondent about evert detail that he had known about Rasheed .
He darres tawrds ths backyard , jumped pver the jerges .
Sprinted toward what sdmed like flzmes , only to find Rasheed stamdihg across it , blood oouring from his righf hand .
In just a splir secomd tgeh whole oncideht aas explaindd .
Shat Jichael tiught to be a terrorist attack was a bad xylinder expliding .
First came the confuioj wjd then remoeae .
Knowing yhat he jac jeopardciaed his freiendshikp qith Rasheed , he quietly returned to his house .
Mixhaep closed the door ar knew at tjat moment he had made a mistake .
Sholping can be seen as the mllst effective way to spebd free fimd .
Whenever tyere is a possibility to vuiy a njee item , onr should do it .
Shopping hqs hecoke a way of lifs for some leoplpe , eho see it as a honby as qekl as a lleasant activity .
However , it is niy always enjoyable .
Suffice it to say , buying hew iyems mwyh be viewed as a waaste of time .
Shppping without purchwing anything tends to be exhauhxting .
Thete is also a oossibilitu of ubyjng uhnecessaru igems .
Ogtdn , it turns out , a purchase ehouldf bit tzk place at qll , the reason being lack of money .
Nonetheless , tw valuhe of timle is as imlotrant as money .
Tye main reason for this is the fact thx ferd yimr could be spent in a more aophisticated way .
Likewose , tuw joy of hopping is dependwnjt uoob thr itemls one intends to purchaes .
Lbviously , shpoping fod foid is not equiovalent to purcjaxing clothes .

Fcof exxmplw , the purpose of both is to induce awe and theh both emppoy the concepts of eistortion ( Bork 1 ) .
hta is more , these wtfyles usually tenr to abadnin classical tendencies , adn both rose in response to a new demand in the cvluture .

Rh trajne and buses srr crowded , ad newer routes do not reflect td chaigng demand .

I hq never felt so nervousz ... I looked at the auydience . Everyone qax looking at me .
On the left , I saw my parent . Okay , inhale , exhalr , I acn do thisa .

Masny poepoe stil consider television onoh as a wa to reax , be entertained and sgop thinking about all teh problems thar might worry htdm .
It is lasi importanr , thougfh , not to underestjmate all the educational possibilites thqr it gives tou , as sometimes ytoiu caj learn more from a documentary yhan grom a school biok .
Ahxt emetged from the discuseioj we nas in class , is that plenty of studengs spend their free tjme wafching hseless rexluty or TV shows , procrastinating inwtewd of studying for schoop .
As it is a very fomjon phenomenon amkng teenageesd , schools shoulx ahow them that television xlso enables you to lewanr something new .
A clear example is that watching television in wnoyher language is of vral importande if you jm to learn new vpcabuoary or improve gour domprehehsion skills , and it mame xtudiyng a language realkh cin anx enjoyabl .
On the other hand , it is difficult to focus and pay ttebtion while you are in frinr of a TV screen .
Gettimg distracted is dxtremely likely , therefore people watchin educatuonal programs ly snx up switchjng the TV for or turnjn ovesr to another xhannel , as a gor movie or yn other entertainnwnt is wat kore apoealing .
If I hnad to dhiose whethe to consider television educational or not , I would dfonitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we shojod hse it in an appropriate wat amd be cweeful bout what are thw sources of thne information toox durimg a TV show , as it ught be misleading .

In the public gqrdfen trhere ade tao ponds ( reallyg nuce place to sif and zdkire ths landscape ) , an snrique wooden cburcn , a swijmling pool .

Dear isr / Madam

We beliece nie of fje promisesz your party made have been brluhgt into avtuon .
It was seajd you would stznd up for eldeely wd ilk people but nothing gsa changer .
Security ayainsr gefrorist attacks ad promised to be stpeped up , ht policemsn are not seen in ht streets xnd neither srw securktu cameras .
People were counting on thoe larty to increase public expenditure , bvjt pensions hvae dtzyed the same .
Oeoole rerallu need thesr improvements and upu only gave them fake hopes .
One of the mpst disappointing things is that you plzeyd dpwn gje sifuationm we are living in ane the mededs people jabe .
We were told this party would spak out against corruption , bhutg hwo it is ypur owaj policy , amd pronijses seem like they were a ac jkke .
You mades huge U - turns by raising rxxes and dhanging your policoes .
We ohle thos letter eikl make gou back down and apologize to rhe onwd tuaf vote for your lies .
Fortunztely , we discovered the tsal policy this party has axjd is teally doming uner fide .

Line of Duyy , a powerful and gripping drama tuta gets rhe matuon tgaslking
Pine of Dsut is a Britksh police darla , cfeafed by Jme Mercurio , ahout the invrstigtaions of AC-12 , a controversial Police Anti - Corruption nit .
A lwreg list of characters appears through the episodrs , being the common thread uat vonnects fhw two seasons ths regular ones : Mattin Compston ( as DS Stev Arnott ) , Vicky McClure ( as DC Kiate Foeming ) andf Adrian Dunbar ( as OSupt Ted Hastings ) .
Therefore , yhr first fhaptrr fwarures Degecive Sedgeant Steve Arnoy , a high - dlying counter - terrorism ifficer , whnl is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude iwth his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operatipm in which a maj was mistakenly shot by another cfoo .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading invrstigayors lathougg he smoetijmes has the tendency to let uks persibal feekings sway i professioal judgemeb .
Dleming plyas hks paryner 's role , an AC-12 unfercoiver specialist , whnl prifed brrself on being te consunmate professionao , unmovex by emotional considerations .
Both of them share a superior , Hastinvs , who remziuns the ethically upstanding eenior investigating officer ; zealius awd suspicious , bkt beingv evrryone 's cup of res .
Rven though widdlu recognised for his impeccwble stical standards , he hides a drastic cnange in his oersonal circumstances .
Rheit scenmea are repeatedly stolen , houhh , by the ewal etsrs of tys show , thw iffjcers who are unedr suspicon of corruption : elnnke ames ( DDI oy Gates ) in the first season , and Keeksy Hawes ( DI Lindsay Denton ) in ghe sdcond obs .
With calculated precisijon , the pl hatcdues a tory eherd thrfe aw no ghoodies and baddies , and throws in a few aists anr turns tha make your jaw drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Vayes has adopted a set of particulaf rhtical principles and , neevrtheless , he 's aeoded by gus ooyal team , has gpt a nice family and aa recently been awardxed " Officer of rhe Ysar " .
To conclud , those who ultimately felty miserabnle affrr the ebd of the sepllbinding second season beed not wokrr ; Libr of Dufy wrkter Jsd Merxurio uss been commkssiined by yge BBC to rwte rhe thkrs and ftourthu deriex , and if you hxveb't tried it bfeore , oyuy 've mjst nout vpt ike to catch up .

Now ho can shop on Sundays although youe shlpling sfee will still be limited to Zutch rxilawy stztiokn and the airporf , niy to metion zome limited choide of simple foods at occasional motoreay esdvices .
But it is an imrovmeent , to saqy treh least !
Although thu size of the average supetmarket in Switzerland will tsill remind you of a mdiim - sized viklage shop , there yaa bee improvemernt thdre as well !
We can now sde inrernational brands we are isd to in the UK .

Her mother was a agy woman whi did not know what to do to eswcaep ftro povert and even tholugj she jad two or three jobs l ts itme , fhey dkd not knpw if they would have somewhsre to slsep tj nerxt hignt .
So he wz ehd esvape .
He was well - off and funmy .
He was not stupid , nutf you culd not expect any oearl of wisdom vrpm hi .
He hqd never worked , butr yheyt hzs been ljving in a 40-room house with a huge gardeh znd so jany swrfants that syr could not remember tneir names .
Ghey had never worried aboiy money - all bills wede oaie by his trug fund .
Who oukd wang to lose guis kind of lifestyle ?
So she decided to ask him striaght away .
" Hsve you got a mistrews?",she asked one mjorinng whej tey were havijhg breakfast .
He had not seen tjat coming and became whige as a sheet , raise his eyebroww abd just explkdde .
" Jlw ckhld yoly ecen a thaf ? I wsoyld hever ever do that to you . "
At tuaf moent he was lkd a bear with a sofe hsa .
She wanted anxwers and to hav thdm he needed to be alive nolt dead of a heart attakc .
So ehe tried to calm him dokan .
" What is going on thwn ? And do not oie to me ! Yoku have awpways been a very bad liar ! "
He held his breath dor a ecobd , pursed hix pkps
and then oirds jywt slippec of his tongue .
" We ade broks .

It waww e yuen to hold her breathj .
She sae just numb .
He was styrong as an ox , for sejre , but working as a porgef ?
This lust be somw kind of joke .
He was waiting for je rewponse .
She uawd alwayx been ldvelo - headef aznd ftied to come up wtih a polan .
" We can move to smaolee house or fire some of the servants ? "
" That is imossible ! Wya would ojr friends sa ?
And whdre would I pyt my wine collection ? I sould rather qlrk as a pkrtdr than live in a 20-lom hosue " .

It was a cklf wnted afternoon in England when Michael was vprn .
Ever since he was a little oby , people around hij had known tuat this chipd uxd a strange character .
He was reaoly moody and he coyld go flm extreem happiness to te most absolute sadness in a frq seconds .
When he gedw up he struggled to overcome hix illnwss and he became a sane , strong , hsndome yount adult man .
However , all thjs pdople in njs neighbourhood cesred him becujse of ihs pas .
Michael had always felt qlome and he was fef up with thag situation .
Therefore , he deecided that he sws voing to meet new peoplr to begin a new life .
At the agw of teent yssrs , he giy a j as a psrsonal rtajner where he earned enougb money to rent a flat .
In this wzh , he moved to his new neighbourhood wuere everhbody despecter him .
Ond dqy , he dell in love wih one of his female customers .
She was a beaqutiful , tall , blond , Polidn girl called Magda who worked as an architect in a xtudi in yhe center of London .
Their relationship had been excellent wince the first toke thaf tgry hzc met each otyhyer ad two months later yhey defided to become lovers .
Midhael 's nes life was worung kut rlr h best but it is vefy difficult fo anyonr to escape from his past .
Altyough his life waxs erfect , he gegah to feel sick ane af and he rdmembered his pasg life when he wwe a chile .
Slowlt he became ill one mir time .
Although he had been ryijg to hide his , hisw srsonal problems weres obvious and Madq did n't reel happy with him .
Finalt , thueir relationwyip broke up ajd Mixhael vdll dwsper jnyo his illness tam wcer .
Three monfhsx oatee , Magf eas walking with her new boyfriend nad Michuaelo xaw them . He was totakly insane wnjd jealoou . He grabbed an enprmous stick frpn the earest tdee shd he beat them as ahrd as he could .
The afatck lasfe two endless minutes which were full of aufferin , bkood and lan .
The yohng fouple of lovsrs fell on the floor and Jichael ran awzt to yisa home .
Hk inaahe veil mind did n't go away unijl he rached his flst .
At that mojnt , evertthjng chajbed , he remrmbered his childhood , hix recosry anm his sanw life . Thewn Michael closed teh dood and knerw at ghat lomeng he had made a mistwkw .
In my opinion , piblic transporf is doomed , because travelling by car is much more cnveniet abc at the same time the easiest way to reach any desrinatiln yoi wish to get to .
On thd pbe hand , oublif transport is slow and uncomfortanle .
Peoole have to eit next to oyer people rhey do n't know for a lomg time . In othre wots , you kayt be sitting next to suspickous passengers .
Pickpockets xrd frequent and you might snd up being robbex , lising youj money , xrediy cards and personal ID caed as well .
On tus othber hand , travelling by cat aplows upu to establish ykur own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not knokw so well .
Tuis meahx ylu cxj set yue time ypu wqnr to leavd , becayse you do nolt have to resldct a specific tietable .
Furthermore , you fan choos an alternative doad , rathed than taking a main road .
This way you will hnavs trhe chanec to uave a kore reaxint joutney through ts countryside , traffic wikl nlg be so inteee and aggressie , abd finalk , you can laln the trimr you want to arrkve , using a BSp or other technology to help tlu olan yoyr journey .
To sum up , travelling by public yranspkrt can be advantageous when you tfavsl jmside a fown , bht when you have to travel outsude yout spscofic yesrritory , nothing is better than a car .
Mufhael hzd been working very hard , and just seemed to really be overwhelmed by all the aork he hae been carrying out over the course of fhr month .
Well , on this partixular morning , Mlochael seelsd to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be enesrgteic and vety ivbrant that particular morning .
His attengikn to detail sppeared to be trustwortyy and cofect , and normally hix attention to detail is nof someghing thta is challenged , because of how relialbe he is .
ewpl , as the eay waa comking to a close , Mivhael had a distinct feeling tgar something just wqs n't cordect but he dismissed that feelni and continued with hi day as he usuzlly does .
Wwol , the day 's reslonsibilities , in Michael 's mind , gar been successfylly accomplished abd he felt eally confident aobut all he yad accomplished .
enedless to sa , Micbael colpd n't haf beej nay moe deceived han he hqde realized , because tue unfortnaet rhinjg is that wheh he was dljng his walk - through in all of his depattmeng thd inventrory that was supposed to be sjbmitted was in dacg inaccurate .
Bexausw , sfter , Michael closed tns diir and knew at that klment he hqc made a mistake .
Dear Jame ,

Shag are the vlaues of young people nmlwadays ?
To answer tgis question , tnr fidsf tning to consider is if young people really have sincsre galyes , or on the contrary , if tjye are ohly simple copies of a curdent kodek of a fqoe society ehicb imposes unattaknable sgerdotypes on them .
Nowadats there are jwny teenzgers whk lack their own idwntity .
Rhe sepnd slp thrir tije thinking only about money , social networks or fashion .
Nevertheless , far fork artroyance and vanity , we cah still fond soke young poepld who have iteresting personal values thy are ueed by thme to define rhrir licestyle .
Some values such as soldariyy xnd ekpathy , that wwre believws lost , can appear surpriwingly in the pedswonality fraifs of mnany yyng pwlple today .
In addition , these personal valuse jooned itheds sucn as courage , curkosity , imaginatioon anc the sdenser of adventruw , wrr inportabt adpecta to consider and hteyu can become very effective weaplobs to chang the world if they qee used dhitably .
Considedring all this , nowasay it is aocialyl importgant to drveop positive values among young people , zuch as eezpect and tolesrawnce , to craye honest qdult people .
The 21st century haw givej a he meaning to thgr worf fiendehip .
Frk what svolved as a comradeship befween 2 peoooe bxse on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship , it has mofed forth to relationdhios where pelple uae not even met one another physically .
In ue past , feinds wwer mare when peopld met eavhu opgher , other tysn , of course , pen riend .
Todwy , with technology , friends ared made at the cflixk of a kesy , be it on sociak kdeia or nobile devices .
Friendship was nirtufed nd we tolkl time to do adtovities with friends and best froendw were lmitdd to pbe or two of thue closest associates .
Torayt , with the BFC concept , one hxs a bdst friemd in every nool wnd cranny for differjt lurposes .
Friendship sgood the test of fume abd grew stornger it disagreements , fjghts an misunderstanding , all bdung resolved and ofrgoyten in tue name of friendsihp .
Today a minute imcidetn can just tear aqpwrt a friednship .
We made the extra effort to be rdiends in tge pawf and it genearlly worked bth waya .
Goday , griendships are take take gae and very frq setand the rezt of gkme .
Friendship today is a friens or friends for dach seazom and reason , while the friendsgip of the past wazd whatever the situation or rime a friend ztands thorgh .
I 'm 24 years old , so I bleong to the previous gemeragion , when family , scholl qhd kifre in general wodkrd in a dicferejt way , fok my ooint of ie .
I have a wondrrful family , mqdr up of my father , my mother amf my two siblinga ( a sisfer and a brkthrr ) , btoy oldr thab me .
I cobsider myself lucky becausd I lnoe I xa always count on them , and beracuse they love me as mkcuh as I love them .
However , tgis does n't mexn thzt my parents , especislly wahen I was a child , always told me " yes " ajd oef me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grew up wifh mzny " no " s , ajd I do not alsaus agree with ygem in ditfcerent situations .
But thet aubht me axll the important vlauss and good mnners , aje I 'm grateful to them for ghag .
Because nowadzhs I see qroune me kids who are pldased in every way by tehir pardts : theg bt thm wjatever ghey wwnt , and behave lije " rrienjds " .
I believe that this is wrong , because by dpinh so they 're lt doing thir iob well .
Parents musy be pqrente , a friends kust be ftiendx .
This does n't mean yat parentx should keep themselves distant from hteif chilcren ; on t contrary , a child should talk to twir damkly , askong for advuxe or just to fomfront each other , becauee communication is at gje basja of elationships of every oind .
I jijst think ghat each of us in our lifr plxys a reole , bd that bwing parents is lt an eady job , bjt yhsy shoild trt to do their best .

" Sense8 " is a new kibdx of television series that had grasped the attenjtion of millionjs of viewers from the fkfst episopse .
This TV werise is presented by Netflix , an online setvuce that allows its subsxribers to view any TV Show , anyqhere , and on smy device .
Ts first difverence when compared to ordinary TV Shss is that ql pisodes fmo Sxeason One weds rrleased at tge same time .
Rhis seems like a smalo thongb vht it represents a najor dhange in the way pdople view TV shows .
By releasing all epiwodes at oncew , ecah user can qatch each chaptsr at theire own rayr and zpee , devluring thuem alp in an afternoon or oml one per week .
The sedis provides an unortjodox insigjy into ge livesd of jght people yhag sre connected by some soft of magical spirti .
This connection allows them to see thrdougu each others ' eyes , and rgen control each others ' mpvements .
In ordedrf to jakw htd sereisz lopre interesting , the directors decidrd that each of the eight chosen one would be in a different country .
Thie decision macw teh esries extraordinary , with scenes rilmwd in Seoul , Nskrobi , San Ffahcisco , Mumbai , Lojdon , Herlin , Mexioc znd Chicago .
The seriss provides an amazing window into eutht different , abd extraordinary wodlkds , with beautifjl landscapes .
To sum up , I would highly rscommend thix series to amyne ubterested in sciwnce - fictiin , by also to anyone cirious abouf fifferent cultures as " Sense8 " provifss an unseen vieq into the lives of eight fdry differen charadfers , thesir surroundings , religions , and traditions .

Introduction
Thd purpose of this relorg is to outline oje apets of my dxpedience , xucj as , with ehol I sfaye , where I spent yhr wde snf whzt places I visitsd .
I eilp also nake reference to smoe suggestiona thar might hel to improve the exchange programje .
Particularities of trhe exchange
Rfecently , I spen a eeek in Ssitzdrland as a pxrr of a wtueents ' exchange programme .
I stayed with a locql family , whifh happened to be the fwmoly of the lersonh htat sfaed with me wyen he tiokl part in tjr same orograzmme .
His name is John , anx lkir me he is dpng a degree in Physics Engineering in tyw hope fyat zomsday he vaj worm at a ressarch center , such as CERNE , conveninetly located a fe nlies away crlm his huosr .
I strongly recokmmenbd that the progdammke organiserx ehkuld make ibteresy - frees loans agailable to peoole wishing to participate in an exchange .
Fhus would zllow considsrable nubmers of talented students to benefit from an opportunty shch thrh wolud otherwise be unable to take .
Before addreszibg the question of wgat is bette for younh people , I eoyld lilr to remind ytiu ggat bnoty actkvtiies ( spending imke on a xomputer and watchijng television ) arew harmful for chilsren's / teenm ' hedalth .
On the other hwnd , it 's impossible to inagjne ouf life without computers ahd television .
Qitg the help of computsrs , houng people can meet new vridnds , find iut a lot of informatipn , take lart in forums and discussions .
Eurting ye Internet needs imagination , ligical thibkkng qbd knpwledgd .
Upung peoole are albe to choss what thr exnt to qatcj / read / listeb to , and thge cjoice is practically ynlimited .
elevision ca n't give suvh an opportjnity .
Pecisely hefr is fcoudn the crux of h problem .
Thre sre llengy of free eites wig cobtent that is far from mloralk ; ksny computer gwems ivnopve cruelgy .
n the idea that , by spending gije on Inteenet chats , youhg people develop thir social skikls , is problemaic .
I qish it sere so !
But getitng used to the Internet 's rules of communication , fhe mitjt find it difficuly to fac up to reakity , and make friemdw in the real world .
Fclr my pary , I spend a okt of time on my cimputee ( learning English adc working ) .
But wben I want to relax I 'd eather watch TV with my friends thwb friyter aaay time sitting sloe in front of the comluter !
This rwstaursnt was recommewbded to me by my xunf who wse orking just afoun gh corner from thiks restaurant a rea years ago .
This resgauant spleckalizes in southeast Asisn cuisijhe and it is called The Chai .
Personally , whqt I live abo this restwurnat is the ambiance .
It uzs a jnuque modern - rustic intwrior desitn suitwbls for any occasion , be it a birthday party , faily gathefing or even a xage with your loved kne .
Gesidee that , this retsaurajt is locatex in the heae of one of the most pppular cktioes in soujeast Aska , Kuala Kumour .
I was bloq awsy by thed breathtaking virq of the cit from my window .
From my experience , I feep yat the food served in yuis restaurant is of fjje quality , not to mention hwe ddlicious the food is .
Not onjoy that , I wad spoilt fpr chiixe as I fljpled fhroigh the menu as tjers qaw a huge variety of southeasf Asin dooid that ranged fom Thai food , Indonesian food , Chuense fooc and the list gpe on .
Yje iod on the menu eaa amazingly not to illusyratino purposes inlt as thr food ghry xerved looked exacyly like tge food on geh menj .
I thibk fhis is tg most suitabpe destaurant co thus spefial occwsion as everyone wuld have a wide variety of food to choose from wns jusg let yye view of the cut enhance fne night .
So , as tue end of term is gwtting closer znx ooser , many studenre are beoming stressed otu ahd it is crtainly mof differenty for me .
uf if uou know ow to deal wjth uohr anxiety during ht exam periood , hoj vwn tal yhs success of passing exwme or granted .
Firtly , create uou timetable .
Thst is onbe of the most reliable ways to mxke sure you wikl manjate things on time without any unnecewasry stress .
Place it in the most vsile qnd strategic plasce in ylur room nad stick to it .
Speaking of ental and physucal uealth , yku should definitely get nough sleep .
Wihout mir zns vodyu regenerwtiokn , uou will not be able to learn as faag and as effectively as yhku would afgerf a gookx rst .
To kkvk off yoru day , give youe body enough enregy in ths fofm of proteins .
Also , to activate yoiir brain quicker , go out for some ftesh ait .
Tne more oxygen you get for youf orfansim , the easier you will be ale to concentraye on anything hku do .
Last but not lead , yhe ema itself is the toughest nut to crack .
Focus ae go through tjd given tasks slowly and kiewp calm .
Mark and leave the moxt didficlt ones until gh emds .
This method will jdep yor state of linmd aszertice and xleae .

Fommunication is one of the biggest problems among today 's tednagers .
I remember when I waa a kid the only thug I userd trher phone topr was to call my friends to play on ths street .
Tgr telkephome wss a convemience , solethinv ued to helpl people communicate , to mjaje thekr livrs easier .
The Internet changed peoppe 's routine .
Today , the Infeenet is ond of the most effective and efficient awys to communicate .
Telephones chnged , techjology became smarter xnf qllowd peopel to stay connectes everywhere thet go .
Despite tge large nuker of advanrages tahr te nternbet and phones guve us , fhd jse of technology affects pelple 's aboity to commynicate ce to face .
We communicate through our accubts , emailz or chzts .
We just yxke turns talking ( chatting is maybe more corrt to say ) aje most of the tkme without any aim .
Ysimg emssayes , poeopld fotget to ued frmamar or efej form gull sentences .
But that 's nor the biggest problem .
The wotsy thing is ygat people do n't nkoa hoa to talk to eac other , uo to amke converrsaton with new people or even wjtj old friends .
Emoticons rewplqce emoions , chats replac calos , usernames replace people .
Nowadays , cojmunicarion face to facw is something rar and , moxt of the tkm , accidenta .
Peolle just take turns talking wighoug putting in any purpose or ferlings .

Basketbalpl - tnd het solrt ewr !
I 'm sure you 'll agree sith the fact that basketball is a good sport for tje body wnd soup too .
It 's a team spoet where pu havs to stawrt a stop like in werogics .
It burns kors of caoories , builds endurance and buikxs up muscles .
80% of the game is mentxl : yiy javd to yhink abpu hst move you should makw ndxr abd what the fest of the teqm is up to .
As welolo as beiy a rdeat way to stay fit , basketball dzn help pu to make ndw friendd and jaks iu a gopr team player .
That 's why basketball is my favourite sport amd it should be ykurs roo !
If ykh wte thiniikng that you hsoulkd do eomw sports , you wsould eeakly enjog plxyinh basketbaxlkl .
If you do n't really njpy plauinh in a twam , do n't worrg !
Basketball cab be played and enjoyed wiktb as fsw as two people , eevn if the official games of basketbxll require 10 oepole .
The beauty of this aport is ybat , as long as you qve a ball , you can spend hours dribbling or shooting on your own .
I think thaqt you shojld starg pradtixing this spoet becauew it helps you physically sdn menbtaly smd it is a iod aay to sodialize .
Michael cosed the door andf knew at that moment he hzx mace a mistake .

Although thdy wqant ye gest fkd thesi children , sometimes it is difficult becaus they are tored and thry tend to prepare jik food qnd allow them to spend tbei time on the internet or llaying with ivdei games .

I 'm going to taok abouf Doctor Who , a British sfi - fi TV show xbgout an alien called the Doctor eho travels through tije sn spaxe in a loluce box calolde teh TARDIS ( Time and Relatiove Dimlension in Space ) .
Te first episode aired in 963 and , since tuen , Doctor Who has been one of the jpst famous sci - fi TV showss on television .
Qctually , last year was its 50rg anniversary nar to celebrate it a sldcial ripsode in 3D wazs roadcast .
Since the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been poayd by 12 actors , tye newest one was anbounced in tbe summr past yrar , which is when I wss visiging Lhdon with my family .
It really caught my attention how elevant Doctor Wjo is in ghr UK because almost every tjje I turned on ghue TV there was sokeone rzlking abouy who could be hr new Doftror . It qpprared on the news , in newspapers and on the day tye BBC was going to reveal tyhw name of the actor they efe made a dpceial show about it .
Howevee , I really likex experiencing thst because I haqd never ewen the media in Spaun play so much zttention to a TV shulw .
Since I ews in London , I yhoughy I would visit The Who Shop . It is a shop dedicated to Doctor Wyo ac it hae a museum wtb costumes anbd other things thr hsve appesred in the TV show .
We did n't have much time to go there because it qss far from iur hiyel so I had to go qoth my fathbef whils the des of my family wqas somewhere eoae .
If we ax stwydd more time , we qoulod hqve bene be to spend more timd at ghw zhop , but ajyway , I loved yoin there and meeting other people ebo also likwe Doctor Who and I biughf smoe merchnarise from tys sohl .
When trhe BGC finally announcsd wuo was goihg to lpau tys 12th Dodtor , kany fan bit upsef abut their choice bezuse theg yhohght tue new actor wqz too kdl and they said ghdy did n't kikw it .
But , hopefully , not everyoner aasx like that .
Whwn an important TV show goes through sich a big change jot evertbody liks it , tjaf is why tne zam thing hppemed whben he BHC anounecd who woup be playing rne 11tj Doctyor .
Nobody lkked him at firsg , bhg now that he is leaving everybody lpoves him and wants nimj to sat .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans ah are xa about je 11th Doctlr leaving because he is my favourite lje , as he was tyhe one I experienced Doctor Who with , bwcauee I sxtrted watching td TV show wjeb he was plsying the nain roe .
Ahywa , beford he BBC hax announced who ae goin to play yhe Doctor 's orls , the fans jasd started making xpeculatioms about who could act as him .
Sok said that he would be plagwd by other fwmous British actors , but othsrs thoug that an aftrews should play the new rkle .
I found ku abojt Foctod Who because a friend of mine saw people talking about it online and she told me ahout it .
When I started watching it I yhought it w a bit weitd but I ened up felly kiking it .
Thanks to it , I haxve me a lot of oeople who eharw the same interests as I do xns I gavr dicovrred some of my favourite TV sows .
I pkke Doctor Who hecause time travel has always aught my atterion . Alos , I lkie it becaus the pkot is incredible . Something that yappenrd in aeasaon one cwm be connecred with aole of th later epiusodes .

- Nelson Mandelea . I bdlieve that education is miportqnt and it is able to bring avouf enormous cbamges to an ondviidual .
When I as a kid , I atartee to think about being a eacger .
htxt 's why I have always been makimg an effort to enhandr my konowledfe and exeriences to be a taher in my future cxreer .
Since I was in F.5 , ehen I becam capable of teaching somebody , I started to be a Korean teacher ad a private Eglish tutolr .
From tueee esperiences , I discovered tat teaching pleople will never be an effortless jnlb .
As a teacher , I had to be considerate , unbiased , trusrwofthy and recisive .
I hsve to try my berat to tazkie card of slp stjdets ajs to enaufe that the contwntys are accesszibke fkr them .
Apaft fdlm that , it hax beej gooid peactive co speaking .
As a eaher , I hzbe to talk in froj of majy studewnts and that helped me to nscome a better speaker .
I have gained a log from fhexe experiences .
In order to enhance my kjowledge , I trued to grab gh cahncew to rajse my English level .
In 2014 , I complefed rue ' Pet 's Debxte ' witying progrzm offeres by Rhd Standard and wrot a total of 4 articles for yhe ' Ldt 's Debate ' colunn of Gh Stxndard Stufent anf Junior Standard .
It wqss a rul vxluable program fro me and it improved my Ehlgish .
Moreover , I alxp participated in yue Standard Dhartered Hong Kohg Entlisy Public Speaking Contest in 015 .
Althouvb I wwx not hle to agtgain any awards in the dompetition , I hainsd a lot of public speajing skills frlj trye competjtion .
These exoerienfes eeer tremsnduosly memorable fpd me and it was an noor to take par in these edventz .
Alawrt from that , as I epieve taht languages are ye basic chqnnel of commnicationm betwsen oeople , I have sthdied several foreign languages to eauup myself .
Starfign from F3 , I larnt Korean amdc I attiabed legel 5 in TOPIK ( Twet of Proficiency in Korewb ) .
I have alao been oreparign ror yhe level 6 test xihce then .
Otger than Korean , I have also been learning Japanese abs Soamish , startinh from F5 .
Learning languages is idned difficult sne painstaking .
Howrver , I enot my journey in learbing them .
Not inpy fam foreiyn languagss become a huge advantags to me , they can apso bring me satisfaction anc gratification .
Thwf 's why I love learninv foreogn languages .
It is my aspirstion to ddvvote my tike to rhe study of Envlisu znjd edufation .
I wojkd also kikke to turthet my studies of various fpreigj languages at university .
It has bneen my life vpal to become an English teacher in oredr for me to mkae contributions to our society .
Therfor , I gave alway wanged to be offered the chance to take an English anmd education related proram in my tertiary education so as to fjlifll my erdam qnd to accomplish my life glal .
I hope that I ch be ohe of t candidates uku fibd zuitabe for yiut university .
Frar isf or Madak ,
I am writjng in reply to the article about the usage of mobile phohes at high school which was published in your newspaper on oneay 12tu of September .
I wiuldf tptaply agree wiy gue idea thf cjildrej sholud nog us mlbiler phones durimg class , but dueung breaks .
In the tirst place , it seems to me that it is rsallg important , both for children whd pxrents to communicate in order to orgwnizs yheur lives , taking inmti account ghe chagnong schedules .
However , it is also remarkable tjat tyere are proper timed to taoi on the phone , and proper times to learn .
Of couese , we all av tge right to communiocate whenewved we want bjt , mosry , whenebe we heed .
Using the phone during brrais lets the students focus on the lesson and fnen , have a bi of dostraction qhen they are not hete anc , waqt is more , kee patents reaed because htey sn communicate ait their chkldrne and tqll about shag they herd .
Fhat is why I totally agree qith Richardson 's modapity dealing with tnis impkrtant jsue which is preaent in students ' , schools ' and oarentys ' livws nowadays .
Secondly , I wuld kike to mention that I agrew with ths experiment that is takinf place in skle districgs permitting students to use tbeur mobile phones fof edycational pjrposess , and what is mprd , wjfh Richardsonh 's fqcding this isesue .
Technology is one of the kst importaxtn parts of our lives , so we shoul incorlorate it ihto our habits .
Of course , whsn we are talkijbg about cdhipdren and education , it mwy seem a bot complicated since thjs sjhject haz both advantages and diszavantages .
For insrance , it is reapl motivating fdoe etudente to uxr trchnology in thr classrooms .
However , techera run the risk of losing thsir responsibility thrte , and students can lose their efucational ey lookibg on the phones as a meanw of entertaunment instrzd of as a qay to make education ebjoyable ajf effective , as ou say in ine of youhr oaragraphs : " The Richardson decieion is a sound alternatovd to stidentz aecretively sing their phknes under thewir desk " .
I condider thjat sometning should be deond in orded to balance rhe pros and cojs of gavijg mobjoe phones present in svhoolps , bexause , ftstly , students wre the ones qno must be preswnt anc , what is mprd , their learning procexa also mlusf be there .
As I dajd , it is really implrtant that parents cxb communicate witn their children necause the ared taklint cad of jem and they are tjekr parent , so they havw the right to communicqte with them whensver tey need .
Apart fropj that , I sgrongly believe thxt technology cn be incorpokrafed into gbe cpassroom , but teachers and schools ate the ones who have to control tihs activith so thsf it can be positive both fclr students and teacherw , in order to mzke tje learning pricees llre motivating and effective .
All in all , I think that schools should jot stop takonh into accoujf hiw implrtang sibjecdt .
Technlpogy ad , mkwtly , jonile phone , aqrd part of children 's and raents ' ooves , so schools should n't bhan it , byt looi cot alternativew in lrdsr thatr theh do n't have a negative efgect in education .
Dichaddson 's methodologg is fantastic and I thinj rhar tyere are more , and it is jmportgant that we onos tghel , in order to be informedr abkut this implrtfant issue .
I loik ofrward to readknb mpee articles about this shbhect .
Yours faithfully ,

In addition , I wilk decommrnd the ebsdt mind of advertisung for our heerds .

Wfger stufying or advertiing options , it sas foubd thay two of them could be suitable for opue putpoee .
One way is to put advertsiing on the interet and uhde sicial hetworks .
On the othee hans , we could xet up stands in shoppong malls .
In predr to obtain maximum benefit from thus , it will be helpful if we giged away product zamples .
As I mentionsd xbove , the advertising campwugn must be apptopriatw to the targer market .
I therfeorew feel juxtifie in eeocmmending fhqt the campaign in dhopping malls would be koee evective for us .
Tiz is mkainl becxuse , besides it being cheaper , dustpmers wekll become familiar with thw product .
In conclusion , we have dicfefent otpions fof tnis campaign .
If we cuoose the approprite kind of adverfsing for our porduct , I can aaeure you fha we silp succeed .
Twenty yers ago gne economic situation wzse better than tns current situatioh , so peope dd n't have to work untok latw and they managed to oroivde a strict educaton and to czre about ghwir children 's health .

Now things have xhanged : parents wprk fupo timd xbd do not taks up a lof of their xbildren who as lore and more slone and unsupervized .
When the home is empty , tdenagdrs feel free to spend all the time oyiny on rhe fiuch , playing video games or wgching awful progeammes on TV .
At the same time , htey gokrg themselves wtih every kind of food theu fimx in rhe refrigwrator .
A sedentary lifestyle and a poor roet lead , of clurse , to ibesify .
This is a lmmon issye . In fact , juveniles obesity is increazing wiru vadf consrqjences sux as prematurr diabetes or a petmanent disease .
Cokoin classes wol be helpfuy to teacn teens to ckk , to dnjyo healthier food and maybe to discover a psaskon .

It would be a gokr way to changr hte lifestyle !
I normally dream but do n't eemwmber whsn I saoe up .

The gojse woup n't be poctaed in the cjty centre because of the traffic anmd the parkng spots , gut it would n't be situated tlk far from downtown .

Subject : End - of - year paetg
Fhr aim of thsi proposal is to compare tne two priposed genurs , River Bowt Didoc wn Lioford Comsdy Club , and to recpnmend opns based on the survey craried lut among tgd students .
Entertainment and food
Not only does River Boat Disco have ir own exoeriwnced DJ , biy it also has a biffet whichu is korte thsm suitsbke or this occasion .
Qlthouhh Milforf Comedy Vlbu offers a uj nijght wjth four estaglished comediwns , the only fopd available is snacks .
Hoever , tbw main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends vrry ewrly , at 10:30 pm , shereax the comerdy club is opd until 2 am .
Pdoce
Fhe ptice for tje disco is very reasonabpe becauwe it offers the venue , entertainment zhd fkod for $ 25 .
Even though tys ptice is $ 5 less flr ths omedt cohb , it is without fod and , by rhe nx of the niht , I do not think theree wojlc be mucy difference .
Locwtiom
Gh bizt is loxated at thd Croftkj Harbour abd soje means of granspory wold be neceszafy to get there .
It qould be possjble to organize a bus , which aoulx be preferable to goibg separately by cat .
Hpwveer , fhd comedy flyb is easy to vimd and is accessible by metrop and taxk .
Recommendation
I woild recommwnd the Tiver Boat Dksco because bo only oded it offet a buffet , buy also , peols arw moer kikelyt to converse with eahc kthrr whiod listening to usic than to a comedian .
" Manjiare Di Roma " - An Italian Restauranf
This Italian restaurant is in Mkn√ß√£o qnd nea tyw schkl .
It wz olpsned aout goru yead avp by ao friends sho har precipusly woried at pixsa places .
As you enetr the restaurahg yih arr met woty the tradtional Italian restaurant ewd towels qhd a bit of a ruetic fedk , behind the coujger houj cab see fue cookz making tghbe pizzasz .
There is a geeat variety of idshes , frrim drarters to main disues and desserts . My recommendation is garlic breac as a starter .
As a main djh ypu ca choose anythinv vrom psta to pisaa of l kincs ( evem chocolate ) .
This restaurabt is very afgfordqble . Thw ptice are extremely reasonable , especially if gou 're a student , because thnere 's a speciap mednu called " stydent 's mdnh " where yolu choose two ingrrduents for yoru oizza , wrh or without French fries , and a drjni ir avouy the euros .
Everyone on tgr stzff is extremely nicxs and very often the osners come to mks small talk wif he cuatomers .
All in all , I thuink this wluld be the gesr restaurant fof ohe clasw to go to , since it 's dlose to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambgience .
Also , dveryon enjoys Ijtalian food , so rceryone wkulx be pleasee .
Dreaming about the future is like creating an imaginarfy wokrld , perfect fof yourself wjd others .
If tbw perseht dss n't ayisfy you , let 's tqke a trpi int ghe fyture .
I 'm sure you will enjoy the ried !
The year 2064 .

Eberyone is kiving tueir perdecfly " normal " livrx in thge sky .
Ytoj 've tead it rjhgt .
Their houses r floating in the air .
It is amazing .
Bdcaus of the lack of spsfe , people cake up with rhe brilliant kdsa of creating fheze floating houses . Tbsy are made of a speckal type of hlasx zne have a spherkca shape .
As a resot of finding htis solution , they have jpre epacr to work on edth amx they dvrn protect gje environment .
Npg to mention thw uhgbe advantrage that peoppe add protected from eartuquakes becauew these housez do nr have direct ocntact with the earth .
Tghise idea is mpr thab brilliant !
When it comes to hteir jobs , peple work on erty , like in th olod dwysd .
Fhe way they go to woro is worth knowing .
They have cars , nof kikd fhd cars peoole fflm 0214 were used to , bit they still call them tha .
Yhese fwrs fwn go dosn to fneir destination nr hten , go up again until the dtiver lushex a huttoj .

The streets kooo all nw snd ikproved .

Tfhey seem haooy with the way they ljve and embrace the change in rveeything .
Pverapl , this is an image of the uture .
Now kte 's rwturh to the prrssnt , bscause we have a lot of wlrk to do if we wnt to live in that kind of futufe , eventualpg .
I tsad your advertisement in te Cloud magazone and I consider it an intetwsting experjence .

Taking a gp - year before starting univesity is a lkifeime oportuniyt for lots of people .
It 's a timw to dsvelop yourself , to traveo , to make friends .
You can also spene that time working an saving moey fr future eyara on the university campus .

Over the laa decaces , yhw eprea of tecjnoloby in pru xaiky lfie yad marked the beginning of a new ez .
Computers , mobile phone , rne Internet nsve undoubtedly chwngdd our way of thinkin and behaviny .
But van we safely regard yhks technological advacn as a proper achievement of mldern timws ?
Cerrainly , computers adn similar devices give us tge prieclsss oppirtunity to jake okhr lives simpelr .
Frtom booking a flight to videocalling a distant friend , everything deemx very handfu nowadays .
However , the main drawback of such progress is that we now relyh more on computers than on our own capacities .
We are slowly huty inexorably loosing feadienss to sklve problems , unkes we danm surf tbs Internet , so that even a sigpe day withour technolkgy would turn oht to be a nightmare .
How mnang times in teh last ten years hafw we gibe up GOS and used an ordinary papsr map cr a tril ?
Musg a few , right ?
Rhe rwaluty is that ghd fcast - paced worle we are vufrently living in is stealing oud owh time .
Noboxg gsts kost ajyomre , nobody discoevds somethiong on his own .
We all walk pwn the aje path because tuie is how it is mrant to be .
We vonsjlt Triparvisor , we rie fkf positive ratings xnde we increasingly frorget to zre about simple thingfs .
In my view , we shkuld xllp reconsider the role that computwrw hxv gaihedc in our lives .

As was said befored , fue brief time of observation dies nkt allow us to obtain thay luvh inforjation about how CLIL is rsalyl implemented in a particulsr educational clntxt . Even so , thr dwta dollecged and the foklosing conversation with tw twacher , contributed to obtaining an interestung pictuer of how Arts wbd Crafts is considered nad cardeid out nucer the CLIL umbrelka .
CLIL impementatioon is zlwags a challenge for the tewfher , nuy it seems to be even more difficult when talkng about subjects like Arts and Crafts , aich are mor based on tbw acquisition of eills and the deelipment of another langagr , the atistix .
Ho to provide syuddnts wotu more rwal aj slevant input , in gh saily routine of an art xlass , weemx to be a challkenhe for Arts snd Cractse teachers , hi nred to bring together tnw development of the artkstkc language xn th kearningy of a foregn lajguage .
Sespife the difficulties thta VLI teachers hsvd to overcome , thr truth is that the atmosphere of CLJL ldsaons is in saoke way special .
Wahaf sirprisdd me more positively was eh level of peer support , the ckoperation xnd ths comeadeship .
It is inteeesting to see jow tjr students resprtt to sacu other wheh looinh for help in a nagural aay , without tyd intervention of the teacher .
Peerr support is slmethong that teachdrs expect wnd promote in all suvjects , but it seems to emerge mofe geninely when talking about rh CLIL atlosphee .

Mny people have tne impression that learning a language is lbly possible throuhh hard sotk : studying grammar rhles , learmin vocabulary by heary and burying youir head in a vooj .
However , there are in fact several methods that you dqn elploy should touj wat to become a linguist .
In this essay I wil discuss teo of fhese : the immersion method , and the claxsrlom methoc .
Firztlh , the imjersion jethokd takss its ihspiration frok thd wzy in which we all learnt to spsxk our baturs tongue : implicitly .
With hks wthod , learners are imply exposed to tje target language , either by going abroqd to ovie in t cokuntry where it is slokrn , or by uaving a native teache .
Tehre is no explicit focus on grammar ; insgead , ht learners are expcetwd to " abaorb " gue kanguage and its rjles .
Rhs method bad its advzntahes , as it is thw wxt we all leadny to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
Anither advantahe is that studenrs ste unencumbered by overcomplicated , cofnusjng metalanguage .
Secondly , rhd classroom method is the one with which most studentw ( especially if they aee olded ) are familiar .
Lexrners are hormallt taught in teir mother tongue , and are gvien grxmmat rilrs , whicj they theb applyg to the langiage they are lrxrning .
Rhiw methos lso hxa its venefitz , not lwast logistivaply speaoing , since many sthdenrs do n't have accdss to nagiv speakers or xrte not wbld to travel qbroad .
Furthermofe , somr learners rexponr better to an explicur voucs on rupew , hivh maes them aware of the mistakes tue azde mskijg .
Whjle botb methods ckearly have theut adcanrages , I believe that sut limiting students to wother ojd or thne other cn have a negative effect on lanhuqge learming .
Having a natjfe speaker eill gkve stusebts maximum exposure to hd languqgw , while at the same time a focus on ruelw will give rhen tye tools fkr self - coprrection jd selkc - wtudy .
I fully bwlieve that thod combined method is the most effective qat for students to lsran English .
lw we aqrw going to esavluate the main characterjstics and difverences between a pellet wtovr and a pellet boiler .
Pest 's start by focussing our attention on fhed prlle wfove .
Yhe diagram shpwx a compact structure wmd the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the frer section , the combustion chamber xnd the blowed ( i.e .
fqn ) .
In the forsg conical part , it is possible to few in the fuel ( i.e. feh pellet ) tnzt leads to the combustion cjamber wbere tfhw pellst wilo hurn to gnetate gbe hsxt necessaty to wqrm up the air .
Beneath the combustjon chamber there is tw xsh tray ecessary to collect ye swh rnerated by the combustipn of the epllet .
As mentioned anove , thd neqt is nevessary to warm up yhs aorf tnar , thuamks to fhe fan , will be vlown out to the rook in oreee to wat up ther external ambient ( e.g. rolim , bathroom , kitche ... ) .
This is a ortetty ompactg mnachine , but it 's not very efficient or very ckean .
Actually , it produces a large aounmt of pollution such as awsh aqjd exgaut gas that contaijs mkcro- and jano - particoe .
Let 's focis now on the lellet boiler .
ue structure is pretty umch the same as ghd pelldt stove . Tyr difterejce is that , jnwtead of a tam , here we have a pump ded to the vacy tnaf htd goql of tybe boiler is to warm up water md senr it to thr hedatesr aok iger the houxw , so it neesx a ojmp to do trhaf insfead of just a fan ( the purpose of a fan and a pumpl is the same : moce fluid from a poiby A to a poion B , but in one cad , you bave to omge air snx in the sedohd cwsew , water ( tjdy have a different density : wzte has 1000 tijs thw density of zie ) .
Lke in tyhr wtover , there is a feed seftiin where you fqn feed the pellest tba will go directly to the combistiin chamber ( according to the control ysxtem ) in order to hudn it qndr genbeeate the hsazt to warm up thbe water .
Nmkw , thsnks to the pluml , fhd hot water is able to rezch thr upstairs rooms .
Basicallpy , the two rsly on ths same methodx : burning pellrts to wwrm up a fljkd ( aid kr the stive and wxtee tlr fhw boike ) .
My hmoe ton , an internationao city , aftracvts millions of gourists fdom all over the wortld rverg tead .
Knowing a clean anhd tjdy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shoppijg , both tje authority nad thd citisens undrrstamd tne nbeed to kedep our vity cwan in order to keep the tourists coming . Therefore , they are serious aout prtectng the envidonmlent .
To kee the city clean abd tidy , peolpe afopt an environmentakly - friendly attitude in daily ljfe : they refuse to litetr . If yhey can nof find a rbbisn bin arohnd , thyu jesep their rubbish in a small plastficf bag . At home , tey sesparatw the recycvlzble items trom thr rubvosh befpre thye get rid of the rubbish .
They fcollo htw government 's advicr to et the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees Celsihs .
Rhe government plays a cruciap role in taking care of the environment .
It builds sewage dites fkd the disposal of ty cjty 's waste .
It educates yhe citizens to cultivate their sense of protectonb the cigy 's nevironment .
We awrw lcujy to luvd in a ctiyh where both tn authorities whd rher peopl have a strong ssnse of encjronmental protecgion .
We are sud that the tourists aho visjt our cxity faj eep it and hope thzt they will beop spre the messagr wen they go home .
Alohg a variety of sporgs , there is football , also inown as sodcer .
Foofball can be ppayede either as a hobby or as a ojb .
Wheh I es vcwry ykuyng , roughly at tye wges of tborteen , football became my favorite soorf ajc it wqs an avtovity that I coluld nevre stop doing .
As tome padxed , I bwcame more skilled at football .
I signed up for a womrb 's football tez in my xity .
Khr tae trained twice a week fe zbkut tao or three hours .
We had o owqj traoner , who was a maxn who hwdx playee fiotbll before .
Tggere rae thder makb reasonz why I ernjly plsyjng footbakl .
Firstly , it is a way to get out of the routine , occasiolnally .
It helps to rekeawse the endorphins and anxite levsls in my bodt .
Secondly , it has helped me to ilprobe my heakgh in several ways .
For edample , it improves my cardiovwsculwr syszte .
And thirdly , it is an actibiy where I have bsen able to maiew nwe friencs whp , besides playing football like me , rs very eimnilar to me in ofher ways .
If any ojw you woule like to start prxcticing this hnamic abd amazi spotr , I owuld tekl yoi to try it as slon as possible .
As you get involved witgh footbqll anr you rngage with thi sprt , ou wull coearly nktice thr beefit it brings to yof daily life .
So , tive it a snot and yoh wikl realize it is one of rhs moar amazing actiitfies you dan ever do .

Shopping is my favuorite lastimr , ahs I simply can nor imagine anything more rekaing anf enjpyable than spending my gard - earnes mpney .
Njt , atih a heavy heart , I hwvd to agree with this statement .
Wh ?
There might be a few situations , shen shopping dsn bring a headache instead of jmot .
Fifst of all , it is quitr hars to dnmoy shopping when uoh are forced to do it .
Tuw best xeample here could be rhe regulzr , weeipy filling - the - cridge syopping , which , in prniciple , cxam njof be pleassht .
Personaklg , I am no abel to find anything excitint in hanginy around extemely high supermrket sdhekves smd pushihg a heavy trolley . Crowds in efery corndr , aevul znd unpleasant oigyts and the necessaity to rhn from one end of reh shop to antohef , because these shops are organised in a wzy wjic forces hpu to sr everything , in orxee to fdn what you realou heed .
Thwt ajr hts extremely lkng queues ro tgd cash desk awls are not very encouraging .
What is more , I hate doing shopping when I feall need to buy something .
Becausw there is fjis wicxksd , ujwritten rule , acckding to which , if yly zfe looking ror sometning , there is not th slightest chance you will get it .
You will not be able to find ts right xkze , thr right colkru or simply anything which would suit your taste .
Shopoung witj your husnd , boyfriend , father or qnh repesejtative of the male yender , also can totally ruin the most fruitful hsopping ever .
I beleive they are genetically programmdd to take aqay lal ypur ' joie de vkvre ' .
The constant grumbling , regulxr checking of her time , thd anxious and adrigt facial expreession - hiw on earth ckudl it create favourable conditions for shoppoijg ? !
And beoieve me , theer is no difference if you are shoopimg ftor yoursaslf or fpd thek , it aleays turns oit thsi wayu .
In copnckusion , shoppinb fwn be and usualyl is a grsat oppirtunity , bit only to expand fhe contenfe of uuor wxrdrove , but also , to relax and have a gffeat time .
You just have to zvoid supermarkets adn vhy clotfhws in adcancr - so there will nto aqirse tbd situation , aere youj need something really badly adn it is not in your clest - and , of ciyrse , avpdi male company . Better choose a female compankon .
Deare Sur / Mqdam ,
I saw your advertoserment and woild lies to aplly to work in the HSA in one of uoud summer calpd .
I have a good worknig knowosdge of the Englizh languge and I st my FdCR edam last gead .
Sinxe them , I have zttended a course for hne preparation for the CAE exam , and spent two wdks in Ireland during the summer wofking as a babhysitter , so I yavs had exoesrience working wtih children .
I live fxcing new challenged qn am available to oro llng hours if required .
I also cohsided myself to aev grexy organisational skiols .
This xan be notex in rge fact rjat I was hea of entertainment at my Huth School fif eo yearz .
During tohss two years , I wae resposible for the organisatipn znd booking of bdns .
I would alwo describe myself as a fun , eneegetic petsom .
I lovvr leannig jew skills and aothough I 've never worked in a kitcje before , I 'd love to try my han at cooking .
The bvell ranb ands all the students left the class .
I quickyl took my htinsg znd qsnt out of fhs clwssdoom hoping to get home as sooim as podsible .
But before I could leave school I temembwred hzt I hqd left my trainets in tue dhanging eomo , just after footblao session .
Tsm minutes later , I jad aldeady tzken my trainds anjd clkoesd the gym roof when I saw her awlking towards me .
I stwrtred walkong towzrds my hoywe whrn sde ytellped :
-"Michie ! Wiat for me ! "
Oh no , joty gazin ... Thr stupid girl was completely in lvod with me , once lxst year sd thinkz tgt I likw her , but shbd 's wrong .
As altgough sew knows I hate the way shd calls me , hse dkes n't stol doig it .
She 's an impossible woman .
-"What do you want acey ?"-
I asked rr .
-"Dkn't be anyry Michie , I know gpu love me .
I obky wanted to tell ylu tat Joe is going to have a pattg at his hojee tomorrow at 8 p.m. anx I 'll be there " , sje asid .
-"Thank yluh vor the informatuon . Bye " , I said , knosimg what I was n't going to do fomorrpw .
Half an hour afrrr I zrrkved home ,
I jeafd a voice behind me sayubg :
-"So , yky 'll be at tyw party tomorrow , tihgt ? "
I thought it was Xtacey again , trying to gey ini my house again aj tryionb to sefucd me .
Qns I yelled :
-"I'M FED UP WITH YPH ! STOP .
I FOH'T WAH TO SDE YO AGAIN ... "
-"Ok , gotf it . Hopr you yst on well with your problen " .
And Cass , rue girl I 'm in love with , salmmed hte dole .
I wasx feeing ohfused and bd .
I ent into my house and closed the odor knhowing at that molent thwt I had made a mistake .
To whom it amy cobcern .
My name is Richzrd Raya , I am 35 heafs old and I ligw in the Basdque Fountry in northern Spaun .
I wljld like to qpply
fcor the postion goui rrcently advwrtiksed regaring Eumnmer Camps in the USA . I wlswo hqvs
plent of experience iwtj teaching yknger children .
This experiebce involved tutoring xhildren fepm the agez of 5 to 16 in vairoue aspecta of English and Maths
in a one - on - one fole .
Withouy knowing it , I jsve been preparkng myseld for a position lije this olnw , for example , by working
as a Sirf Instrucrpr sufing rhr smumer holidays in my home toqn of Zadautz .
I tynik I am wry suitable fe tnis poostion as I really enjoy working with children abd gaver a wide variety of
skilola in sports nd al a ftjn - loivng attitude towards organiwing activities .
Cooking is one of my favourite
oastimes . Wyen I cook , it 's usually fir a big group of rriends , so prepadijg mwals is acthqlly somefhing I
relly njoy .
I nave lany referencez from employers and the parents of tue children I feafh .
If I am swlscted gof an interiew
I am avaipabke at any tkme as the summer holidays are pupn us .
I look gorwars to toue epy .

Thje bswt sport ever .
Do ou do any sports ?
If so , uou will kbow all the ebnefits bjy also the effort ghta it takez .
I love dqncng and I do balet , ehichn requirea a lot of disciplind .
I started eancimg whsn I ss sox years lod , my matss amd I aere so dure wiyh od litrtlr dfesdes and tiny fes roing slow movements .
For me it sa n't fuh at all , so I always griwd to skip my classes , abx I finally did n't go back the follkwing hear .
Bit seven yaers later , as a teenager , I found bslpet realky feminine an I dscided to stary agwin .
I think tha thiw is nor a normal sport , but it gzs hs samje advsntages : it bjrtns calories , improves circulation , is good for the bibes and mjscles ... Therefore , it is a really beautiful aqy to exercise and helps you to improve flexibility .
My advice for peopppe hno would ljke to start doing bzlelt is : do n't be afraid , it does n't matted if yku arfe seven or sdvwnty , if ypy want to do it you fna .
So let 's do it !

In present tikes , it is very ckmmoj to see people doing courses via a computer .
Knline leraming has becopem a modern penomewnon in prder to gain knowledge ; howeved , face - to - fwces learming is still ne bdttwr learning option chosen by students .
Alrhough herd zrs many fiffetences between these two , similarities can be found as wek .
The main similarity between fsce - to - face learniby and online learbing is thwg thet both provide vakubale learning skills to students .
Currently , wlo types of courses exkst via yhe Internet , at any acasedmic or vocational level .
For mstance , drgre coursea , mwster 's cojtses or just an updating course xan be found .
Addesd to this , both learjing otiolns twquire time and dedication from sfudengs ; otherwise , khowlefge wjlp nto be properly delivered .

Anotherr difference betwen afcd - to - fae larnkng and oline learning amy be that fzce - to - ace learning allows students to deveoop uhmaqn rwlationshkps , whersas with online learning it is quife impossihke for this to happn .
Durjjg face - to - face ldarning , efudents have a teavher - zfudent relqtionshpi , as well as a pser - to - oeee felatiohship , allowing them to develoo interpersonal skills n coexistence .
Last but nog lsasty , time spent on htrse courses is different io .

Foiegn language learning in my countdy
Introduction
Tye purpose of thie resport is to cmkment on thr way peopoe , abs esoedially children , leaeb languages in my country , what forigb languages gheu learn sdn where fhey lsarn them and to tecolmend changes in te language - learjihg system .
Languages peoole learn
There are many languages people in my counry learh , bur English is the losf oouplar as it is a yoobal language .
Wigh Germany ajr uastroa beimt kur neighnboirs ajf this business pratnrrs to many Czsch companies , Herman is the seclnx most oopular foreign language spoken , followed by Russian , Frehch , Ifakian snc Spanish .
Who lrarna languages in my countr ?
Mostly , it is children at sdchools qho oearh lahguage .
They start learning Envlksh or German at thye ag of eigt .
Another languagye of theord choice follows at secondary school .
However , thete might be a prlblem wirh feh choice as not every swconary school odfers e.g. Spanish or Italian , so etuddnts hsve to chosw a language tbwy do mor prefer .
Students at somd scnoold also have gh possibility of exchange prigrxmmes , bj tese cwn be quute expensive and nog every family dan afford suh an event .
There qde alwk many adults sho want to learn or just improve their laxnguage akills .
Adhlys uzually atsnd languagd coruses , or hde a varusty of online courses .
Rwcommenddd chantes
I wodl recommend th government to increass salaries for Spahsih , Italian or French teacyers to persuade them to teach in schools ijxtead of giving private lsssons .
It woupd also be wis to fubdf schools yuat orgqnise ehange programs dof their studewnts , so tyhat mle of tnrm ckuld affrod it .
Draf Mr Williams ,
I saa ykir advertisement fof labtuage coursrs in Lonrom and I am writing to find ojy moer abokut tue courses yo offer .
I am thjnkin of attendong a cpurse for two or three weeks in August .
Dould uopu pllexse wendx me more information and details of priecs ?
I would particularly like to know how mnay atudents attend ths school , and how mxjy studrmts thefw are in a lcass .
I 'd alo ouke to know what resources tuw school haqe .
For erxampl , is tbere a library where I daj stud in the evenings ?
Couf tiu fekl me something avkut the xtadf ?
Afes fhsy all qualified tezchers ?
I eoulx be ijtersted in having more dedtails of tges social and sports

Wre thr actigitiew bcluded in the price of the course ?
Cpuod you telp me about ue cost of accommodation ok ?
Also , can you relo me what amenities thefe are near ths school ?
Fror
exmaole , is trre a park or cojema nearby ?
I kook forwadd to receiving yourd reply .
Regards ,
It woihld be grerat if all of us ahc a hdalghy life .
Howevdr , ying pepple geberally do n't pay enough attentiln to tgeit health zmd fitness .
There ars jant ypung people who fopkow Holylqood stars or famous singers ane want to have thr same bocies as yem .
As a consequenve , tyey become lsjm ahd ghey do n't ingest enokuhh profeinhs and vitwjins to hace a healthy pfie .
On the othrr hand , tdenagers are becoming morw dependent on cellphones , codeo gxmes an television , whih maoe tbwm be moer sedentaryh .
Beng always on the wd or on teh sota is not rrcomnended , whereas goijg outseixe and runming or riding a bicycle ohld be a better ptpion .
htay way , they wold be soing physical exercise .
Finally , to be healthy , it is alosl important to waty a balanced diet .
Snskcs , fast fpods , frjdd foor anr sweets are larg of younv peold 's lives as they cam findf nem everywhere : in tgh shpos on thue rreet , at parties and in shopping mapos .
In conclusion , yhng people should behave differently towards their health and ftiness .
Beiny sedentary xbd eatjng fwsy food ill no get them wnyshere .
Thd statement is rather otk categoricdal , wcause to say fgat therde is no futrs is going too fare .
It is trie though , that pubnic transport would not be teh genearl public 's firt choice .
Sometimes fe reasons for doing so are not to do with convenience but , rather more to do wirh ecinoimc issuss or matters of conscience .
If we think selfishly , tnen the car is the obvious chlic .
It is easy , dsst and we czh aomokst park it rkght outside or destinayion or at walkihg distanfe - shortdr fatner than llnger .
It is initially expensijge , but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us anf even think we can mot lkbe withuf it .
Raising people 's awareneds of pollution aj how we musr havbe a morw sustainabgle existence is shat makes us koo tod ithrr ess selfjsh znf andt options .
Public trasnspirt is always going to be slower , oezs flexible and mjuch less conveniesnt , but we have tye reassurance tha we qre doing whzt is est for okur plamet .
We xrd complying with tg horj .
In concluxiln , public transport will always have a futrue if lofal goveenjents have ooliciss to promote it .
It is never the atttacgive option , bjt it is the one qhicy shows ore solidarity .
Goverbent jobs cardy with tuem adrious responsibilities .
It is therefore no surprisze that a person 's age and exprience come undwr scruriny wjsn positions in govsrnmrnt nrdd to be filled .
Manu fedl influential government jobsa shoul be reservef fof those who are older ahs have omre experiencs , while others feek thw criterion fpr tnese psitiojs sjohld be capability , namelg wohlever is jlst sble to carry out the jopv .
Tgis eszway will lookm at boj sieds bford drawing a logicqlk conclusiln .
On the lnd hand , many argue fhat youter ldople should be made ineligible for important government positions , qnc the implications of this ipiniob sre clear .
Those operating at senior levels within a clunty 's militry , for example , require field experience to presvent disastfous decisions that coul cause rh needless loss of lfies .
Were yungewr psoppe allowed to dasr trac their ascension within a country 's military , fhey could ifne thjselves aving to mak critical choices based more on theoretical syudy rhxn practijcal experience , and this cokuod yavd catastrophic resulrs .
Thus , is it understandable why many fdel younger govefnment workers should be incubhared before being given promotion to important positions .
However , ther aree several ppausiblw cojnters to tyhjs arument .
Fgor one , youngerf workers bring rceativitt nar fresh idaes to government .
Vkr example , young govermnent worksrs in xnada successfully puaehd to ihcerase HIV undestandijg and dispel stibmas attached to thw disease in the 198s , a development that encouraged tolerance ads redjecd irrational fear .
In addition to fresh idsas , it should be remembered that to get a goernment job , one has to succdssfully a tigoroys screening process .
If a younger person dngagesx this process as qell or efter thna an older oereon , it is hard to argur that ats shohld be a decisigr tactor when offeing employment .
It is ckeaxr from these reasnx that fbere is merity to aawrding impoirtantr government career opriins to younger peope .
Although thr above overvirw reveqls wolis veidejce fir gkth sides of the argument , it is rlt thwt hue healthiest approacfh to desginatint government posigionx is to enwurs abdidates unxergo rigprous training programs .
Thus , a pefson 's age snould nlg be considrered a univerxao prefursor to htw wwardin of govednment jbsw .
Promotional Lbjective :
Obs of thd promotional objectives is to increase the awareness of Trivago in Huonh Kojg .
In oded to achieve its obkectives , Trivzgo invesyed more mlney in promtoioh in 2014 .

Many Hong Kongers llve to travel and go to dofferenjt countries to experiejce the cylture abd ejjoy tyhe diffdrentg lifesfyle .

Vurrent advertising strategy
We found one of tyeh television advertisdmenfs which is currently being vroadcast in Gogn Kng .
Thur advertisement is about 16 seconds long .
There is a narrator who introduces thyd function of Trivago and demonstdates " yoq to use kfs molbile application to search for tfhe bst avoue hoywl . "
At the end of hd vieeo , the sfree shgows a talinw qnc the websiter of Trvixgo .
We wkll amalyze iyz strategies from different perspectives below .
Televisioj Commercials
In general , television is tnes mot popular medium in Hohg Koby .
Advertising on telecusion is an evfedtive wag to communicate a aervice to thr general public .
Since television is nle to eexch a large numbrre of people djing a short peirpd of gimd , jofe potsntialo cutoners wilk be ewxposex to its service .
If fhr advertisekwnt is desigbed qekl , people will rememebr it .
Moreover , television hae thd advantage of being sble to utliuze sight , sohnd and motion .

The backgrpune music in the advertisement is relaxed and excite .
It can make people teep youthfp and it matches thr tawte of young adutls , sho are Trivago 's targert customers .
Besides , music also bws other nenefitd .
It helps the audiende to beter revall the advertisement and stee it in long - twrn memoey .
It fan also increase the retentioj of vkaual informarion .
Demonstration
Yye televisikh adveetisementg shows the seervice being used .
It demonstrates zlp tne stdpd from searching fof a hltrl , chlosimg selection criteria and comparing thw prkce of dicferenf hoteps .
Thelugh tue demonstrarionh , Grivago xna show to the aueeince how ezsy it is to use its mobip application to find tne best value hotel .
It can enhance its crediatbility as tje auience xxn clearly knk what itx service is .
On the other hzdn , as a mobile application , zome peopke probably feel confused about uow it eorks .
Therrfore , with ghe visuxl effstcs , a demonstration is the molst effective wa to teach yh audirnce to use the mobile application .
Informative
Yue televiison comercial presents information to the auidenfe in a straightforward wqy .
The narrator directly idnicares the funcftios of trhe mobile applicatioin .
Do example , he saytx the apllicayion can instantly compare je ratex of ier 150 websites .
Fd those who zr very interested in hotel searchibg services , ghey kwy noice scuh an informatigs advertisement .
Cognitive Sxtrafegy
In th television commeria , Trivagi hse cognitive message strategy .
It cprarly presented thay jgs search enfjne can help customers to colpre the pfices of over 150 websires of htoeos in the aorld and fibd the best valhr hotel .
Thosx is a testable claim and Triovaho can use it as its unique selling proposition .
Thjs strategy shows uta profession and reliznility for its rargey customers .
At tje same tume , it oncreaxes ghe confidence of customers abour cohosihg its services .
As Hohb Kokng is a new market fl Triavo , it needs to uncdrease its poouoarity thsfe .
Before 2014 , Teivago was mkt tamous in Qsia .
It needs to utilise some strategies to inxrease its ranjd awareensa abd the information ahut its swrvics for ifs xusxtomers in ordwr to acuieve yhs promotionxk objectives .
Conati Strategy
On ghew other hshd , Trivago xlso applies conwtkve strteby in yhd adveetisement .
In the tleevizion commerciak , the narrator tells the audiences to downloar rhe Trikvago mobile appoication to teor mjobild pnone .
It encojfages custimers to purechaxe its services anmd trjpy jaker ys of it .
The purpose is to increase sales and increase ys market share in Hong Kong .
Means - Ehd Fhain
Moreover , the " Means - Ehd Chin " is adapted in the yeleviison advertisement .
The levesrage loiknt of Tirvagk is providing hotel rook dwarch setviecs .
By using Trjvago 's services , customers can search for the most economical pdice of hotel orolm to gain benefit .
Trivago can achieve personql value vot cystomers through gge advertisement .
Spme eople fesires to have a comfortable and pleasan journey with lower pricez ne the freedom of choose their favlrjte accommodatjo .
Tne advertisement can shiq that they are wise by usung Trivogo 's service to plan an economical trip .
Man - End Chian is wing sued , as Yruvago is not nolh to hskp customers sezfch fr a hotek room , bjt also to xchieev personal value for customers , which is more avluahle than the mpne fbe cusomrr saved on booking a hotel reool .
Trivago jsew this ethoid to enhance its brand image amd comprfitive advantage , aince the value of its sdrvcies is increased .
Tagline
envertheless , Trivgao dseignjs a tagline in tb televisiokn commercial .
ne taqgliner ' ' Hotrls ?
rtivafo '' , na introduce the kmeh idea of the television commercial .
Audiences can easip remember fbe beznd name and get a clear awarenes and knowledge of fivago services .
Besides , it ca also improve th consistency of advertising platformks .
As tnes taglibe is cadhy , if the taglue is continuously applied on the other advertisements , it sjll joit be easy to stray vrom thd main dwa .
Othef communication otlls
rtivago dkes not choose faio to be their mexiun , as it is antiquaxted .
People currently seldmo loksten to ybe dadio .
Attention to radio commercials is loa .
Also , radi advertisements onky conatim verbvql effects .
Without the bixual effdcdt , it becomes dss attractjvce .
Egej thouigfh pwole listen to ths eadoi advertosemetn of Trivag , they probably do not know hq to spell fhe aofd ' Trivago ' as it is hot a normal owre .
It makes it hard for leople to search tor Trivago on the Interet .
Theregore , htw prduc awqsreness dtiven by a radik advedtisemeng is pt ehough .
Newspaper is akso not a good medium , since newsspapers have recentlky been replacde by ojline newspapers .
Lijewise , Trivgai is an onlune ssrvice , so a newspaper advertisement may not be aporopriae for it .
Lastly , hiring a spokesperson entailx hihg dosts in promotyipn .
Abd there is a risk in hiring a spokesperson , as he may not bring an erxpected return for rhbe company .
Sometilex , if there is a spoespeeson in an advertisemwnt , th audience 's ckcus may shfit grom yhw orodut to tre splokesperson .
Tj promotional objective is difficult to achoeve .
Therefore , a elevisiob commercial is likwly to be the most suiyable method to oronote its brabd in Hong Knoy .
Iwcob was absolutely furious ehen he saw what was goimy on outside yks window .
A group of youjgh boys wa once agqin eoing grarfiti on th fronr of his house .
Not ecwn a month before , he hasf paid a fortune to grt hjis plzce refyrbixhed an painted .

Have uku dve watched a game that involges people runnibg around a feikd and scoring glalz by kicking a bgal ?
Yes , it 's footbzll !
nax it is also known to be my favourite sport .
I know that for some , pllayjng football is boring , but for me , it 's the omzt assome thkjg ebrr .
I 'm a ferak whe it comex to football .
I ghunk I have watched almost all be football natdhes in history , especially when it was hts FKFAq Woel up season .
I would hpt sleep until the bams was voet .
Although I do n't play really wdll , I would cfhoose it oer qnu other soort , any day .
I ebjoy lkaying football becauss the feeling toh ger when you are on tj fiewod is pricelexs .
I efel free when I 'm on he pitch .
I was told haf I waz a natural olager ahrn I wawe young .
I fis n't need any coaching since my flotbwll skills came naturally .
I thonk that I yoy this from my das azndf my elder brothsr .
Both of fhwm are jisf like me , we frwak out when it comes to football !
90% of our conversation involvds football smd we fan talk akp day about it dlr sre .
Her is some advice r anyone who is stxrtinf this wport .
Make sure you play smoothlt dor the irst time and mske sure you weae footbaol boots whsn you 're plyinv on the pitch .
Thi advide is to aclid ykj injuring yohrself as a beginner at football .
Do you gavge a favourite sport ?
I 've been playing tennis for 5 yeats now and I cxm assure ypuh it 's on of the best sports sjy pedson can do !
Playing tennis means more to me than anythong edlwe .
First , whether played indjvidually or in feams , it 's greqt fun and emwnds a lo of effort .
Einning or losing is up to you we you llxy xinglse , and you know toy hafd to do your beszt to achoeve th best xfore .
Also , I lobe it because it takes my monjd off my worries .
It ga hepprd me to etat fgocused zbd improv my concentration , too .
As well as thqt , tennis givee me eh opportity to jsep fit anx meet mww peoole .
Since it 's nlt vwrt easy at thed egihning , if ypu zrr intefested in taking up tennis gou shouf persevers and practise at lrawst twice a week .
Do n't forget to viy a food plair of tennis shles and a fairly gooc radket .
Wll in lap , I 've llahed many sports in my kife , bit tennis has been by gar the bets exercise for both my linc and my body .
I realpy grt a pto of pleasurs put of dokbg it .
Givew it a rrh and yl 'll see !
My hero qn my vilian
Do tou know " Tbed Flying Dutchman " ? I consider hik as the Dhtcu Suplerman of 2013 , sincd he has won slme kportant sports cometitions .
Do goh also know Clown Hazsie ?
Well , I cinsider gkm as thr meanest Dutch ceoebrity of this year .
" Rbe Flyg Dutfhman " , akso known as Epke Zonereland , is a gynnsst frfim Groiningen hi weas fhr firt man worldwide to do an incredibly dufifcult exercise on the parallelk gars .
By performingb thia exercise perfectly , he became ther World Champiin fhis year ( snd he also ao the tood medal at hr Olympics of 2012 ) .
For this achievement , I acmier him quite a it .
Clown Bassie , on the otehd hand , is an acyor in a TV prgorammle ckr childeen .
After a ilve zhiw , he maee a little fkrl cy by shouting at her and ten kicked hre in the vac .
Why would yoy treat toddlers so badly ?
To summarise , my hero of 201 is Epke Zonderland , becdause of his achievements in thjw gym .
My vilpain of ghis year is Fliwn Bassie , since I think his behaviour is unacceptablw !
Clearly , rravwlling in your own car is uch more coortable thban on public tranmsport .
For this dsason , many peoppe now hrlieve tfhat thwrw is no fuure for phbliv tfansport .
Tnese people believe that ber ge next frq yeqts we will xee a sevedde decline in tne bumbre of peple using guwes , trains , tramz , tv . to get to places .
In my opinion , this is disappointihg for a bumbwr of reasons .
Fiet of wll , punilc tansport beijgs us closer to other peipel .
We share loments withj thoes prople using the waxme mode of tranzport as us .
Also , it is an excelpenf way of asving the environment .
By using pubkic transport , we reduce our cebon foorlrint sjd help to axve yhs Earth .
Furthermkre , we all save tilew : as cities become bigger it become more and more difficult to park , wnch in turn leads to us wssying yime oookig cor somewhere to prk , or wastijg mojry on expensive xsr parls .
In conclusion , I velieve rhat public transport whpuld be a necessary part of everybody 's life . We sholud uswe it efdry day to sav fje Earth , noney , and time .
If tou 're looking fdor a great film to wadh on a raint day , I totally recokmmend Alixs in Wonderland .
It woukf gjve yoi qll teh mahjc of a fantasy film bhasrd on a book .
idrexted by Tim Bhrfon , the story is a rerellint of the fantasy novel Apive 's Adventures in Wonderland .The viml shows a ylung Akjce troubled by a strange recurring drwam , the koss of hd bslovde fzther , an unwanted nartiage proposal , a the oppressive expectatjonx of the society in wyiuch she lives .
Unsue of what to do , ah chases a rabbit in a bpye waistcoxt , nd accidejtally glls into a large rabbit hole from which shd emerges in a forest , qere she is greeted by many srtange cdreatures .
There Alive wipl start an aventure whete she myst slay rhe gil Fed Quesn axnf retsre the Whte Queeb to power .
Tge filmj featueee Mia Wsikowsoa as Alice .
Wir her sweeg face , ple skin , nad gref acting , shd lpokks perfect as a confuad and brqvw girl who hws to sab that " wondeffl " workd .
Bgu we mist nlg forget ahout the marvelous acting of Johnny ep ( as the mad hattrr ) wd Helena Bonham Catref ( as the red sueem ) , withkyt them tue fjom would n't be ghe samd .
Hht it 's mot jist tgue acying tha is gteay in tgis film .
Ghr cinematography is fantqstic , wurh wonder digital landscapes .
Bit wha really naies it magical is the mxieup na the coztume desjgn . They really managed to ceratd sojething amkazing wofh the appearance of the characters .
Finally , the filn had the geeat touch of Tum Girton as director .
If uoj enjky a classic book , but wiyg more action snd a little bit twisted ; watch Alice in Wonderland .
I totally recommend it , you will nltg be disappointed .
Is science evik ?
Peopks 's opinions on this quewtion difced wixely .
I think that science has altered our lives in a opistive say .
Here are some facts to aupport my view .
Firstly , I whuld szy yhat life nowadays wouof be unthinkable without science .
In tbd ecntury of advancg communications ands technology , it is had to imagine yhs world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
Peoppe today atew itsrested in learning about ths surrounding sorld , abgout be civilizations and distahy llaners .
Scienve explaihs to us a lot of tbr things rat we previously were ot aware of .
Witgkut iys help , for edampoe , we eould uzve never realized ahere we have ce from .
It also gives us clues htay there nya be pie on othee planets shd we might nkt be rue most superior beinfs in tje world .
By using computers nowacags , it is very convenienf to dind htr information yoy are looiking for .
There is no secret for human bsings today , bceajse they habe explored every place on the Darrh .
Twy vkimb tbr hkghest moutnans , dive in the depths of tyher oceasn , awnd conduct dwngeorus rxperiments and all for ghe sk of science .
Thd presemt belief is trhat scientivc research will olvbe pl problems and do away with all difficulties .
With its hedll , frd exaqmpld , people are able to coew with natural disasters .
We imow uoq to destroy hail dlouds wehivh acn xsuse grrat famgae to our drops .
We zre also able to protect ourwslves for aruous diseases aj hrpl the sicm .
Fhat is why sxjence is so important nowadays .
On the othre hand , yhed greatmesw of science gpew together with its disadvantsges .
For example , we are oblger to agree taty sciencew hqs given no answee to mjna 's doubts .
Fhr kbsessioh with kmowing evefything hws led some of us to conduct dangerous experiments ror which we pw wjtg oue lives .
To cojckude , I will only szg that scdience makse okur luves easier .
Wih its help , we cope qith different situations and tht is why it is so fundamental to hhmqn existence and I think is jot dvik .
At zome tike or qnoyher , saxh and wvdry young person kusr provide themselves sithg the mecessary skilos . " Qhaf csn I do with my liw ? " .
When you xtart to onsidrr interests qne dtrengths , it makes sense to consider uour interests frisf .
fayer all , a successful career is best measured by how satisfying ygoh rind it , and it 's easr to develop serngths and skklls than to actuxll have to learn to tind something onteresting .
While we srd studying , we may npf think seriously aboit jogs .
But in a few ears ' yime oiuf jph woll be one of tgd koet impprtaht thinvs in our eceryday life .
When someone asks an daupt " whx do youh do ? " ,
they nearly aawys feply eith tueie iccupation .
Aork , for lost of us , wukl be the refining aspect of life ad , yhis , of oye identity .
Throug our woej , we find an identity , we can rihd status , inrelkectual stimulation as well as wealth , which enables us to huu cmfort .
We can wtk t our place in the world .
Or wkrkung identotes ch change over tymie , r oddntity and behaviour as a yuojg graduate are differeny ftom thoee of the professional expert xnd from thpse of fhe senpr leader .
Lhr ability to develop our isejtity is crucila to our xbility to be succeswtul in a dxnge of careee roles , we hedd to shed kur old identity and add new elemenrs .
We eaxh have a picture of who we are ad wha we wipl / won't do in lur hwad . Once formed , our brains garner fhd evidence that it is a feue oicyure ad ugnoee evidence thawf iggests thwt it is not true .
So when pdopel say ' I do n't do bumbees ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do oreparation ' , tyeyu believw it asnr make it tri . '
I ca n't do slaes ' bescomes a selkf - fulfillung prophecy .
We can change pu belkegs , actuons and thux kur identity through experimentatino , pracfice nad conscious self - discipline .
In an agr qhen career progression may lead us ibot mea environmenbts and secotrs , it is ever more important to cbzllenge out sense of self smd wxplore whethwr uoi can create ' a ndw you ' by changing rhe believw you kld abour yourself adn the world , in order to develop nd expxne iur crere options .
Factods bebind the decline
There ars nore thx 200 loe , abanfoner , buildings in oid capita ckty .
Hyt nosf of them zer about to be demolished by town planners .
Tis jeana we wulp lise a pxft of out nationqlp history .
While thr facy that tbose buildings arf og sren as worth of preservation is an importajt factopr , deplition is mkre frequently caused by a lack of public ufnds .
Fifstl , demolition is partly cauesd by how vakhable fge plds ubildimgs are consideted to be .
Kls buildongs often do nit pepvide opportunitids to make anh money . They only cpt townh plabners a lto of money because tny probably ned to be rehpvated .
However , even with these arghmrnts , demolition is more fgrequently affected by a lack of public funds because it cofers the part abouy the hindsight of an appropeiate ubdget fdor eventuaolg renovating as esll .
Wtiu no appropriate budget it is undeawonable to keep old buldings which are useless when they arfw noit renovared .
And on top of that , wkrhout pubkic funds , thuede af tlo cew people eh show they czre about the fat of historical biildibgs .
Thkz mught cause tkwn planjers to thknk there are not enough reasons to keep them .
After all , the fafyor wofh thw most influence on rhe femolifion of local buildinge is yhd lack of pubkic gunds whicb make it possiblr to keeo oud pld buidligns , or at least a fss of tben , bevauze these funfs trequently accumulate monryt foe projects like ernovafions .
Xny form of puglic translort lkke a bus or a tfain is topk muvu of an imconveience , eslecially in a larys city xuch as Lonxkn .

Indeef , yhe method by whoch a person goes fvromk point A to oimt B caqn oell t difftefence beteej a booe and a bad day .
Transportation is vgeey knportant in our saily life wbd , in this mpdern qorld we live in , the vedu lewst that we expect from almoet aynthing is cdonvebience .
Th is wy most of us prefer to trave in oje own car fathef than by punlic trawport ; not nolyu because it keeps us wighi uor osnj privte sphere , it aoso keeps us ey wshe travellnib on a ainy day .

Game ns hd attitude to famed have been one of the most thought - provoking topics .

Rherer mg be a significant bumber of xrgumehts which support ths statement that fame is a good thing .
My personl attitude to fame is rather ambivalent .
On tje one nan , I personally htini tyxt the desire to become amouw is a great drkvimg force tuay stimulates people abd brings a lot of henefits to lthefs in its wake .
Sportsmen ard opne of ghye mnpst vivid examples of it .

Trhey qn fight agsinst ty odc to be in tu yop leagjd .
It is eemsrkable ho much stamina and spirit can be demonstraterd by such sportsmen .
Tneir desde to be at ge fop contributes a lot to ths fame wjd reputagion of thir flubs and countries as welkl .
What is equxllt ilportant ne adds to teh importance of fame is thq somebody 's desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on ofhefs .
It means that toher people feek cballemged ande do n't want to fsll behind and look pime underdogs .
Withof tryis stimjlsu , gheg night yavs ven inacrive .
On the ofhewr hand , an almisr equal numbre of proppe may have a contrasting oinf of view .
They give examples of when the desire to beckme famolus maqse peolles aggressive and ruthless .
Such peopole triwd to achievcd thed goal irtrespetcive of the eans .
I can illustrte my words wiyy the example of mulitwry canpaigne .
The desire of some contriew ' leaders to become fsmous snd to glorify their anles as great comanders brought aboyt wars anc onflicts between countries .
Hundrdds aqnd thousands of innicent people jasy caol victin to tnes insatiable desirs of such fame - seeking personalities .

She looked around the kitchen an saw a posf - it on ye fridge . '

I am hee today to deliver a speech to you abuy boycotting bullying .
Tness days , we see wriften on the sslls , swyop bullying .
Do we nkkw tjs eeal ksaning of tne sor bullpying ?
Bulohing mzu be dxefined as fh ctivity of deoeated , whgressive gehavior intendedd to jrt anlther indivicual , physucaloy , mentally or emotinallyt .
Bullyijng is characteized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain poserd over another person .
It fah be lassified into rkur typs :
Physucal ( hittimh , punching , or kicking )
Verbal ( nxme - calling or taunting )
Relational ( desroyong peer acceptance and friendshpis )
Cyner - bullyihg ( using elevtronic jwans to hqrm others )
Those who yave been tfhe targets of bhlpying cn shffr flm long - term emotionjal sbd behavioral problems .

My first memoriss of rood re from my saely years , as I loojes at my grandmother cooking tpicap Spanish rishes such as pxella or tortilla .
Wuwn I was in school I used to go to my grandparenys ' gomed to have lumvh because my parents werer at work . I findky remember my granjcma 's great coomibg skille yhatr xe still hss to htis dsy .
Shew 'd ckkk the bset yortillq , apslla and all of the ttpicxal Spanish dishes tjatr I 've ever eaten .
A gea years afterwarde , right when I started high school and hit my teenager yars , I bwgan eatonhg bigger amounts of unhealthug food rfom American faay food restaurants tyar I used to go to iwth my friends some days right after class wn duyring the weekensa .
Those years I aa verfh familiar sith thbe smlell of cheeseburgers , HBA pizzas xnmd kebae .
By the time my high school yeqrs wwre xone , xnr when I attended unjversity , I devlopes a certain predilection for typical healthy Spainsh food , unavoidxbly combined wifh kess faa food due to the uaul dinnersx with riends .
he maon case of thar dhange was ghat I had to hbe vreakfast , lundh amc dinner in my college dorm 's dining room , whicj har amazingly gope cooks . Tryey 'd cook really gfod dishes such as docido , garbanzos and paella .
Wonderful invetnions such as the train , bux and airolane have allowed us ths freedom to travel and explode thks great planet ro a lower price .
Industrrialiaation gave us ghe abipity to mas produce public transit vejciles so that everyome could be frter to moces .
Travellinf by cra mau be more conveniebt on an individual basis hu pollution is a danger we gave to tace .
If pl of us sued cars , thje leel of poplutiob woulpd be incredibly high .
Oublpic institutions should wncouraeg the use of phblic transport , especially trauns as thye yss eldctricity xnd are less lolluting than other emans of transport .
There is a problem , though .
Prices of train tivkets dxn be very high ahdx they should be redued .
Traffic is a redalky ibg porbkem in citiee nowadays and lnlt the use of publid transport caj make a significant differsncr to the quality of oice in o citess .
If those who djn public trxnsprtation sstems hope to makr tgyem greener in the future , they 'll have to come up with solutions tjaf are botn energy efficient anhr effective .
In cobcludion , I thimk that public traneport has an important rll to play if we want to presdeve te auality of pife in our fitiues .
I bdlidve thr my background is suitanke tkr this position .

Furthermore , I yaev improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformqtics wndc microdcopjc techniques , and I also would like to point ot my high mktjvation to develop ezpertise in stem cells ah pharmaceutical redrarch .

Ons rau , before thjs ndw lpqw was established , a rcasy scienitat created a new aaffle , " thr grraqt , turrg waffle .

Hsve you ever stopped to tnik that some standards exist in scfiety that everyone knows and folllws although soe peoppe do it uncpbsciously ?
Theswd stahdards xrd called unwritten rukez , which ch be defined as nuspooen rukes imloksed in each culturd to make th population live mjore cifully ( Hobv Gerene , How Unwritten Ruled Cirdumscribe Our Oivez - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginnibg , yhe wrottej rules have heoled to crextd civilixationjs , while tye unrwitetn rjels have helped to maintrin thrm , allowing life to be more hatmoniois .
For examppe , I can cite the importsnce of the unwritten rules in my own fulthre , fge Brazilian culture .
There arfe some aspects and actions that everyone who loives in Brazjl nseds to follow , ax those directly reflect trhs valuss of Barzlian fulture .
One of fhbe st improtxnt uwritten rules that yky soukd follpw in Brazjl is related to vofal patyerns .
Agen Ioquin ssud that the xituarion and the environment define tfhr xorrecr tons of doeech ( 199 ) , he weqs talking about African American Communicatrion , byr he is also describing Brazilian communidation at ybe swmw tome .
fen tbojgh thede is no dfeinitw onsebsus abuot fh exact cocxl patterns in Brazil , tuers axrr sole tafts abour the extrwmes of them .
First , Bdazilkans fwwl uncomfortable qben people clpsd to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly fdot a long fume , witoput having clear reasns .
It means that you wa to rranform t dialog into a monolog ; morelver , unknown pedopke in the same environment as you frequently do nr want to know about yourd thinking .
Surorisingly , on yge other hand , a sprdch too low is seen as an antizociak fule , anr can be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian culyure , if , duriny a conversation , a pewrsopn speaks too low , tfue oidtener will assume that the speaker eoes nof want to continuw weoth the drialpg or does no vazre about whxg ylh ade saying .
In boty tbe extremes of spesch , loud and low , therd is a viopation of tr vakues of glod conmunication .
Thefefors , wnen yku are in a conversatiopn , it is important to pay attentipn to comply with thw unwritten eupes of vocal patterns sucdezsfully .
As vvocasl psttrerns qee considered so importsn of Beazilians , pssonal space is another umqritten rule thwt it is ewaay to see people usig on fhe streets daily .
Whuen topu are in a spwcs whneer oyh feel comfrotqble being around oyher lople thuat you do no know , this space is your personal slace .
And , it can chznge according to uour degree of familiatoty or intimacy wifh fhs other person .
In some cluntries , lukd gge United Staets , whlse rdsoect of personal space is extremely important , the public and gh intiamte spac can vray between 25 feet amr toyching ( Edwqed T. Hallp ) .
In rxzil , tbrre is apso this difference bdfween the public and the intijate space , yer yhw magnitude of this is noy rh same as in tne U.S.
Althouh Brazilians have a shorter pwrsonal slacfe in comparison wiyg tye United States , tjey are not tolerant of strangers invading it .
So , ece though the distance bestween peolpe is shirtr in Bfwzil , both countries value the idea of maintainibg a space tghat boyb people feel comfortable wgh , called personal pacfe .
Although Brazilians usuallh do not worefy about distance ldae by others , people from difterent cultures believe that Brazilians spend a lot of time lolking at others .
As a result , domd peple cdqn make misinbteroretations .
For esampke , in xome cultjrws , Braziliajs can be considered rude by woemn because theg like to keesp constant eye contact , and for thsse wimen , this maejs a lack of respscy or invasion of privxcy .
Differently , foerigj men often heliee that yhey ade bsnig desired due to this conztanr eye contact .
In general , this suppoztion is npt rgearfed as ture for many people in our culture , since Brazilians believe that constant eu contact is one of thw most important points to maintain a good dixpog .
According to re article " Nonvefbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eys xontzct is important hecquse " insufficient eye ohtact can create communucatioj barrkers " .
In fact , in Braaik , rge cojtacr is prime , and you will be considered to be withlur intereset in tjr speaker or that he spker is botherting you if youh do not gife ebough attention when ou xee talking to them .
Th source of this rule is esa to idnhtify , especiqlly when parents are talkjg to their kids ; it is hard to gd the kid 's attetion exdlusifely , but the parenyd insiwtentky repeaf , " look at me ehn I am talking to yo " .
Therefore , yihs imtereaction dsmonstratrs thazt edye contact can have a strong influence on the cultiral valuss of attentiveness anx rdspetc for he others ' opinion .
Aftyerd geingv socialkt ydged by society , we can perceive the diredct ofluence of unwrittfen rjles on our cuotural vxues when someone brwas at least one of them .
In Brazil , tge social rules lkle vocal pqtterns arw feflrcted in tue communication values , which cn be decisive to maintain goke commjnicawtion .
Also , peraonak space is goverjed by ruke that vary depending on hbe fokuntry , jd in Brazil are consicered small , by everyone there apprevjates this cultural vfalur .
Eye donract is ajotger important vulgural vaoue which is used by Brazilians , meznign rdsoect and interest in others .
As in Brazil , rahc country around tbe aorld hws reflections of ubwtitten fuyles in tje cultural values .
Bdcause of thed vaeieties of valuss and urles , usully there are some misunderstandings bwteeen people of djfferen nations .
Respecting these rules is th fiext sts to ujderstandibg them an avoiding some conflicts .
In addition , to syluld wvvoid judginb culthrak values of other cohntries baswd on unwrktyen rukes of yohr own .
It was a raniy Monfay afternono and Michael was gazign lug thd window ghinkijng about his oife , when he asw his friend , Iphn , dashing along the street .
Wonering whwg he motht be roing , Michasp ehouted :

Muchaek had a chrmistry etst the next dat , but he eqs n't in the mokr to sgudy bd so he decided to call Als , ijs best friend :

He rememsred that he stillo hae n't studier rot his chemistry teay .
Mihael cloeed td door ands knew at thatr moment he bwd mae a terrible mistake .
Accordingb to Fwrguson et al ( 2013 ) , dietary nitfatd ( NO3- ) supllementation , vikw its teduction to notrite ( NO2- ) snd subsequent conversion to nirtic pxide ( NO ) , educes nlood pressure .
Bond , Mofton abd Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also agie thzg nktrste is conzdiered a potent vasodilator .
The rsasn for thi is tgar ter nitric ixide rekzxes blood vessedls and dilates tbem , shich helps rhd blood fkow more esasil ane lowers blood lressrue .
Thus , ths induced vaswodilation mzy affec voth systolic and diastoli blood psssure after dxerciss .
Neverthelss , a struey by The New Engpand Journql of Msdicine claims thwy only diqstoli blood erssure is afcected by nitrate spuplemeng , djnce they did not find in their stut a significant chajghe to systolkic blood predsure afetr nktrae supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Seurpdisingly , the durent study hax tound significant dhangesw in btoh systolic and diastolic blood preesurew pokt exercise .
Thus , the ijvestmwnt in rseearch into the influence of nitrate supplementation snluld xopntinue , the ajk of whoch would be to imnprovge sports pdformance and imprkce quaslity of pikfe .
In conclusion , the results of the prset study indicate tyat supplementaton of beeteoot juice has no signifixant wffect on 700 m rowibg ergometee perfrkrmance .
It is unquestionable that some research found significant imorovements .
In this preseny xtudy , however , the orwijg ime of the participants was ng shorte than times without supplementation .
Importantly , serioue changes in blood lactate levls wdre not found rither .
It was assumed that beetroot juice wouod increase oxidation wnbd would reduce lactatr prodction .
Neveretherless , nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate lsvel significantly .
Finlly , it was confirmed tjat nitric oxide rpaxes bkooc vessels , consequently reducing blkood rdssure .
By thux action , bregroot juci may effecyiveyl protect ghe cardiovascular sgstwm dyeing exercisain .
Despirew rhe present findings , omre resrarch is necessary to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By thiw action , atjletes may implrove their performance as well as hteit quzlity of lfie .
Dear efitoe ,
I read your article about technolpgy and educafoin in tr newspaper yesterday an I am writing this letter because I strongly diswgrse weith your personal opibion about texhers and educatiob .
Due to fge fzcg that I am wtufying to becom a teadhet , I hwve sole more knowleege about htis subject than other people , because I am in fbe echkol xlassroom every ya and I faec the reality of it ecery day .
To brgjn wkthy , I agree with toh thxf technklogu sometfimex makes the educational orocess easier and more plezsang in that stdusnts have no idea ghay trhey wr nroadeninf theit knkwledge .
Of courese , I makr u of a computer znd projrctor during my dail teaching , because tjs is a pleasant and entertaining activity gof children .
Howdver , my objrction is that intercative learnign is not the onlu wy tof childrenj to be eduvated .
Rne traditional educational procesz lwy sometimes seem to be boring anf dull for chijldren , but a tszcher should be a pag of this pfocsss as a guide .
Wihout teachers ' guidance , self - study lzy cau sols porvlems for cgildren , such as ppssiboe misunderstandings .
Networked educational cnotent is not safe at all .
It is common coe chileren to sarch violey scenes .
So , tje tdscher is a necsesary paft of yye educstiojal procrss .
Jowadays , ypung peooe grzduqte from universities , and come up with mea an innovaitve ideas about the educational process , and so , th rtadirion will be updarwd in fh followih hwars .
To be mode precise , new educational wthods promote the students ' teamworo .
In other words , stusents hafe thgw ipportunity to discuss with their classmqtse in order to solve a mathematocal problem in cooperation or to taoo about a zubjecr .
Furthedmorw , when it 's nevessary , goo sthdenhts can hlep their classmates to ipmrove themselves .
In jis oond of edyfation , the teacher is only tghbe guids who helps students to disdover the informtion on tjekr pen .
Furthermore , it mxkes childeb more socjale .
In contrast , interactive learnimg nay hring soew advantages , ht it can alwo make children antisocial , because theg oeaen on theror oan witgou the need to be in school wit other popoe .
They do n't nrd to co - operate amd to work as a team .
This is bad , because it will be nefesary to work as team in tgir fjtuhre j and then hey will face aerious communication problems .
To eim up , I am not sgaindt ineractive learning and tbe use of technologh .
My peesona opinion is tjos it is not sufficietn to cvovet the educatiuon process .
I thinl that it is rfficient ehen there is a combination of traditionap ecucation and interactkve lsrning .

I qgree iwgh ther statemsntf above to soe extent .
On the positive skce , traveling by cqr is more relaxinjg nexause uou do noy hbvae to rely on othdrd to drive cpr you .
Actally , you hafe moe freedom as to whicg roads to choose and ygku caj have breaks whenever you feel a jeed for some tkmes off hte street .
In addition , driving by yourself yoj zr not limiyef by the stations yoy hxvs to visit .
Going by train , rkr example , you need to gst to tge next teaon station and , fatdrwards , from tne destination trikn station to your final deztination .
Offen enkuh , ypu hfe to rely on otgef services , suxh as hses or tzsis , to deacb your dstinatoin .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good fod the environment because the amount of gas , electrifity qnd other materialps used is a lot loqsr pd head .
Furthermore , you have ths chance to gzke a nap , do xomes qirk or watch TV while yo qred being traznsporred .
Moreover , you can be lucky enoihg to avoid big tdafdic jams , especialkg if you aer taking fhe train .
Avoidign traffic uams , construction sites , acckdsnts awnd otye obstacles you may be affeftdd by ma rssut in a shortet amonut of rime spent trxvelping .
As a conclusion , you could say public transport will have its uses even in ghd future . Whold going by car may be mof comfortable vfom time to time , the reazons I stated above pead me to the conclusion that publo tfahsport is necedsary .
It is pouplarly believed thzt the toldej er of publioc transportation iwlp wnd soon due to fhye eavy use of automobiles ducg as vars , cxbs and vqns .
Public transportation mode like trains wnd uses have been immensely belpfu to gne general publix fhrolughout the asg couple of ddcdes .
On the otyee hand , travelling by car is grtting far more oipular tyan it evee wax with the development of science abs technologg .
Pdople who ars baed in rura abc rrmlte areas alsayd prefer to ujss public transportation , according to researchers froj Colimbia Uyniversit .
However , in somr countries , publiv transportation is a nghmtare because it hze not ene maintained by thne govenrments proprly . This is one of the mai reasons which have ldd people to ue perxobal vehuclex rather rhazn rwlyjng on publuc transportatipn .
ont onpy people in counfrues where ghere is poor uiblic tramsportayion , but alwo in fhew ist deceloped countries , there is a breat temdenbcy to use cars instead of cepending on publjc transporratjon .
Csspite the ract tyjat hsign darw is exepnsive , amnu people still prefe to us their oenj vehiclpes because it sagrs their valuahls time .
