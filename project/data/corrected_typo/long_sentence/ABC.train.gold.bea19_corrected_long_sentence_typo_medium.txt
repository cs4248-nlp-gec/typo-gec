Howsvet , travelling by bus or tram mever geg qway from our awily toutone . Travelling by bus is no as convenienf as gettijg in a fsr , but you can nrver kboe what might happeh with your car , where it miggt tst studk in traffic or oske kther acciddnt might yappen .
Let me ssplain my reasons . When yuh drive uohr car , ylu csj take it from yiir garage or oitskde the main dokf of your house nd it ysts yoi to whreger you want . Bt on ths oyher hahd , if you take lubli transport , it will be much more inconvenient because yph havr to catch the bus at a vs satop ... Where is yoiur nesresf buse stop ?
We muts get tdi of hd strwss quickly befirde we lose ourselve , bscause it 's fery hatmful . For sxakple , you can read a bpo , do sporf , play music , eat derlicious food , remember ap the positive thinhx that haqvw hsppened to hou , gwlk with someone who you trust , get rid of everyyhinv tahy maids youy upset and makes your life tiring , go pur qn eat a kexl qth tou best friends , and there are a lt of thjngs yu xa do ...
I actually piked it qiit a lot . I iusf lkved all tjr suspense snd tnr parrs where they leave you hanging . It 's just deallt interesting .

D. Prrhaps bilingual scholo creation might be a glor idsda fod Colombian edujcafion improvement , but it waould be appropriate to be aware thsg Colombia atcually hzw publiv schools with a basic edudation wehre English is ocnsidered as ajother academic subjectr , in contrast with the private ones .
On the oje hand , travelliny by car can be an excellent way to gst to where you sant to go , wirhout going on fokt to find your bsu stop and becomes lpes important if you livd in tw cerbtre of gkur town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spnmd tiumr waiting for your otner transport , anc y fah avoid the crowds of pleople that are in the subwqy stations every moenimg to get in yue line if yoh want to arrive at eor on tim .
On teh other nnad , lubkic transport is ghbe only dseource some people nave to vdt sroujd , and more than excellent for yne environment , it 's also a gpod way to avoid tsffic ad spending money on petrol , since it 's cheaper if yu catch a buys .

Byt lubli trqnaport yaw a fhture for a lot of reasons . First , yimw . If tbr place you want to rerzch is realt far , ths different types of vehiclss of pulid transport will het you there fatser thzh oyur car . Alsop , tb complications about yye field , like if you want to go from America to Ewuropd , thede is no hihwy that crosses the ocan . You need an airolanw and , unless oyh have one , uou will not be able to achieve ttvel betseen vontinents with yku car . A different rezsonm is politics , becuase if you want to go from anywhere in the YAs to Alaska , you will not nserd to pass through Canada . Cnfort is a rally important raeson , becauww driving fot 8 hours is exhauxting and it qill also be unsafe . Economics is a facof too , because the wear nas tear on your car wpl be more yuan in normwl sud snd yge price of food jd extra stox rhzt you ailkl need to do . It silp be mkrs expensive than on puboic transport .
In concpusikn , dod me , it is a lie that punlix trahsport has no ftuure . Hokweverd , they havge to lake improvements to tiz , like ghje use of bwtfer types of fuel or emdrgy . One way is using renewable soufves of ensrgu , suc as sola , haeolic ( wmd ) or hyxrajlic(water),Xlso , ther ar biodiesel and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
If there was someone who asked me " Whaf is your fsvorit sport ? nd why do yoy ednjoy it ?

I have geeh playung this sport since fwele years wgo .

Gh transport sector in Arab countries shffers droml mabu shortcomings xn oopr perfotmahce and is a cause of environmental llllution aqnf thoa is due primzrily to a lack of the vapzcity of public institutikns to dsvwlop strategiws necessary to intervene apprkpriately and allocate investmebtgs effectievky and improve the organizational capacit ab rssut .
