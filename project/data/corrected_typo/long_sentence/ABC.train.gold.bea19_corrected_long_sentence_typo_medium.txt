I thoguh that writing an artidpe on my favourite soprt wpuld be interesting for yue reaqdets . Above slp , and regardless of the sport you havs dhosen , it is pwramounmt to do some sport , whatever sport you choss , such as spinning . That is my fxvourkte spory .
If oy want to etasrt doing some sport , firsr of alo , think about how much time ku are willingf to spend on it , then frh once and if you haev a good tkmw , go ahead amd mamd ths most of your yome enjlyin the sport . Nevertheless , be careful anhd go slowly bsacuse you migh be injured .
To shm up , doibg spodtsz is very importanf for tednager , wholse bodies are growing , xbd doing it regularly is a commitment tuat we shluld makes . In my opinikn , howevdt , doing a mandatory sport is not educational because we must do a spot with nthuhsiasm , notg bothered or out of obligation .

Howeber , fravelling by biz or tram never fe awxu drom kur daily routine . Trtavellig by bus is nor as convenient as getting in a cr , but yoh can nefer know what might happen with youjr car , wbwre it might get suck in traffic or xome other accident jiyht happen .
Let me explain my reasons . Wheb you drive your fqr , you csb gale it from your garage or outside the aih foof of ylurf house and it gets you to wherever you want . Bu on e other nznd , if you fake public fransport , it will be much mkrd onconvwnient necaues yoij have to catch the bjz at a bhx stoo ... Whrrd is your hearewt bus tsol ?
The rewsoms tot stress are more diverse ; perhaps because we have an exak period , famniy roblems or because we thumk in a jegative say , or we hev destroyed ourselves thrlugh lbg hours of working and canceld yr nedes fkrf enough kmfort , aqhd lots of reasons to sress ...
We mjst ge rid of tye ztrezs quockly efore we oe ourselves , because it 's very harmfhl . For example , yl canm rsac a book , do zport , pkag musoc , eat delicious tood , rdmdmber all the pisotive things thnwt hav happened to you , alm with somoene who goj trust , get fid of everything that makes you upset and makes yku lif tiring , go out ands erwt a meal sith your bess friends , wnr there ae a llt of thingz tlu can do ...
I actjalyl liked it quit a lor . I jut llve all rje suspense ajdc the lartz where they lwave you hanging . It 's just fdally interesting .

You caqn kill woheer you wabty .
Another advqntage of frvaelling by car is thxt tou do n't have to slen time waitjg for your kthee transpdt , wdn you can avoid the crowds of people thawr are in tge suhwayt statkons evdyr mprning to get in the lond if ylu awny to arrive at eokr on yiume .

But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place hu qnt to reach is really far , ths differwjt types of vehicles of public rranslort will get you theee fasfer tbaqn your cxr . Also , tne complicationz about the gield , iek if uoi want to go from America to Europe , ture is no highway that crosses the ocean . Ykh need an airplahe sn , unless you have one , you will nlt be xble to achieve trsvel befwern continents with your cad . A different reason is politics , because if yoi want to go fom anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will nokt ner to pass throuy Canad . Cimfprt is a realky important reaspn , because driving for 8 hours is exhaustint ahd it will alao be unsafe . Rocnomics is a factor rio , becuase thw weawr wd tear on your vaf will be jkre than in normal use and the prticd of food jd exa dtops that you wipk newd to do . It wkll be morw exzpejsive tghgan on public transport .
In conclsuion , ofrd me , it is a oie tnat public trqnsport has no futyer . Hlwevet , they hzce to make improvements to this , ikr tue use of better tupes of fuel or energy . One way is using renewable sources of eenrg , such as zolaf , haeolic ( wond ) or hydraulic(water),Alsi , thrre qre biodiesel and gasolinme extracred fdok seqweed .

Let 's take me as an xsmple . I am a 25-ear - old gjel wqgo beaduated frfom thed faculty of engineering and wajtgs to rtagel to Germany to compllete my sturie , but I am not abls to do this hecausw my family wil niy allow me to trage alond .
My favourite spory is foitbaol . I llfe it so much . When I es younbg , I used to weagch cootball amd my favorite team is Barcelona . I uwe to paly with my friends in the street amdc we were so ahppy doihg that , wnr afgrr that , we plaeyd on a ofotbalk pitch like in reawk fiotbqll . I love Cristiano Roaldo so much . He is rge bnwst playrr in hw world . A fws pspple have told me that Messi is tbe bdst player , but I feek angry when I hear tuxt , becauser thst is not true . So I am looming forward to meetign my favourite plagsr onw day . It 's likw a drdam fir me .
lwsy niyht we went to the swimming pool . It was a liftle bit cold , but we likrd it so we wsmt to th oool and started wwimming . I know hlw to swjk veru eell , bur shs does n't , she az to have a support otherwise she ca n't saim .

As a result of wgat I have jhust said , in my opinion , people wo n't have a " real life " . Egeryone wkpl always be more involved in vkrtgual kife , so tnat theu ilp rorgte how to talm to eacy ohter and hq to expresx their ken feelings !
In cojcljsion , fron my piin of vir , punlic fansport is more necessary nl tqn ever hedore . Cities cpntain more automobiles xnd the pollution is woree .We berd to change kur way of thinking , and try to use public ffansport as an alternative to improve the enjvironment of our cities .
On public transport , prolle are obliged to sjar rranspirt wit trangefs snc we also have to follow xompany pklicy or regualtions , but wtg our ownh tranzport , we do n't have to bother about thse things . We travel when we want ad when we har time .
Govefhments should take care of public gtansport . They sould save means of entstainment . People should kdep them clean anbs safe . If they use them carelessly thu wilp be usleess . Now there is no future for public tdansportg , becauhwe gravslling by cad is so much mord cobveneint .
Fge second advantage is that the Internwt by wegsites , duch as Twtifer , Facebook ... Goh can seak ait your quick friebd , or glu caj mretr with them on the wsbsitye . Therefore , yo do not call the on tnr telephoje , because the inteenet is very cbeap .
I yhihk puilbic tranzport gas a guture where la peiple use public transport . Theb I think htaty maybe it will contineu to hacr a future gyt it has bws and goid thimgs . Fir exampel , it is good that it is easuer to mpfe in the fioty nx tou save itmr , aznf tge bad thing is tgat bad people zttack yoi and sgsal things . Bur I ghibk that it has a future , because a lootg peopole even if they iss public teanwport to .
We bceome not lnly oldwr , but apso wiser . We learn , but the most useufo thing to larn is to get a ot of exorriences xn , for wre , to make listakws . But we hsbe to be honsst with oufselvges and sdmit our mistakes to apid thue in tys future .

Thr utue of oublic transport shluod be takn seriously . In my opinion , pbukic transport is te best option dlr solving tyhe problems with traffic congestion bevause , when we ise a bua or subway , a lot of people xre travellibg frik phe olqce to other in jusf one vehicle .

Using cars to fulfill oir transportation needs within the vigy ilmis is a very good option for majy of us .

Mab pqrentw vae a dilemma when choosign ghew thp of efucatioj they eisu to give their children and ojew of fhe fjrst decisions they must taie is wbat type of school tgey aold ooke yjeir chikdren to atgenc nad whether it whoudl be a singld - sex school or a mxied - sex one .
It czb noty escape or kins that , at htos strags awnr ate , childrenb are ecposex to sexual images from a very eaxrly agte and soke people woul argue that our sofity is hyoer - sexualiser , quich is a reason why many parewnts sde sungoe - sex dchooks as a means to peotecf their ofgsprinmg from gavig sexual thoughts before thwg are rsady to understand the complexity of sdx and eexual relatiknships .
Whioe tne hyper - sexualisation of ouf spcoety may be a eeality that mahy parents would want to protect their children ftrom , it is yrye to say that children need to adapt sbd be readxyh fot the sockety in which theyu live a for nanmy parehtx , sending thdi chjldden to a mixed - esd xchpol is just a njatyural environment , much mord similar to yhbe " ohtsid world " in qhch they wipp vroa to adilthood .
Considering how much time children sldnd at school , it seems to me that chkosing a sinlke - wex svyool will make the child , slmehow , segregated and , in many cades , reinfoxe sonw of the many stereotypes that we , as a szociety , hzve regarding gender . Therefore , if we tak into consideration that thsee chjldren are gohg to be the vuturd leaders , educators , lawyets , politicians ajd so on , I woyld arvue thaqf thr more schools reflect our society ans the way that we lioe it to be , tjw betyter , jog only fie the cilr as a lrrson , vu for the chil as a key to ths futuee of ue countey qnd , to an extent , to tbr sordl .
Therefore , and to wmu up , It is my viee , thgwt oublic money is better spenr supporfting miuxdd - ses schlols , which reflect tr eociety we liov in , as opopsedd to single - sex echooks , which mxt teinforce thosd stereogypes that are undermining soiety .

It is knpan , uat it is ghe jov of paparazzi to folloq famous people and oiok for sensafion in their dxiky behaviour , abs celebriries fe aware of the vaxt that they atr recognised everywhdre , but an onterest in someone 's private life , when the persom does n't wsjt it is basicakoy a synonym for trespassing .
On ybe other jabd , it is obvious tha people want to know everything they can sbout xelebeities they like or admire amd joyrnaliste give thk teh opportinhity to dind put some ionformation zbojt their lives , but they often cross ths lkjne snd literally rperive these famous people of a private life .
