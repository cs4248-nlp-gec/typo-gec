She was really proud of him .
She dreamt of being his wife .
But he did n't love her enough .
He was waiting 2 hours for her .
He hated that she was always late .
When Mel came she looked gorgeous .
But time was up .
He followed and apologized to her .
Then he hugged her .
And he was right .
Mel lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
His life was going to change .
He did n't care .

As a new college subject
The reasons

People look happier .
Hockey as a lifestyle
You think that your lifestyle will improve ?

Another disadvantage is the weather .
Second , public transport saves city space .
Languages for the future

Why ?

Every house will be flexible .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Swimming is my favourite sport .
Why do I like swimming ?
Hello Paul ,
It is difficult to describe that feeling .
I am waiting for your email .
See you !
I could invite my friends and relatives .
That was only 30 years ago .

Fewer channels means fewer choices .
Internet TV is increasing

Essay
Football , a passion
Have you ever thought about playing football ?
The desserts are very good too .
People are thought to be jealous .
They notice any kind of failure .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public life .
To whom it may concern ,
That 's easy .
Best regards .
In times of joy and sorrow .
Also , they make us cleverer .
The Big Mistake
It was too much for him .
But somehow he did n't feel anything .
All that he felt was anxiety .
It was a big mess .
DOING EXERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH
Why do you have to exercise ?
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?

My curiosity got me into big trouble .
