Public transport or travelling by car ?
You drive the route you want .

Her name was Sara .
Her presence was felt .
All but one - Michael .
The pain of jealousy .
She was Sara .
His long lost best friend Sara .
That night had changed their lives .
Both of their lives .
In every way , in every form .
A dare to prove .
Courage can change lives .
He was isolated .
Abandoned by his friends .
All was a fa√ßade .
They had all worn masks .
Everyone , even his own Sara .
He had been wrong .
All along he was wrong .
He had distanced himself from them .
He deserved it .
Every bit of pain .
He had been blinded by rage .
All these years .
His selfishness stood in the way .
He had made such a huge mistake .
No one .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
I look forward to receiving your answer .

Why not ?
Everybody thinks that home is a refuge .
Not with cold and spacious rooms .
I think the statement is somewhat true .
Travelling by car is getting more convenient .
However , there is also a problem .
He had always been free .
Never had any serious relationship .
No one is happier than me .
It was love at first sight .
It was n't a problem .
They had a lot of fun .
Finally , he arrived .

This happens when some natural disasters happen .
It 's almost a love triangle !
The fairies control nearly everything .
It creates unreality and fantasy .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
Flower of this purple dye ,
Hit with Cupid 's archery ,
Sink in apple of his eye .
When his love he doth espy ,
Let her shine as gloriously
As the Venus of the sky .
Beg of her remedy .

So , the first two questions are :
I agree with the given statement .
One private car per individual is needed .
It saves a lot of our time .
Domestic violence
The culture is caused by organizational variables .
These variables influence the behavior of employees .
Should smoking be banned ?
There is a great public transport system .
We could reuse and recycle household waste .
Why is that so ?
