The Future of Public Transport
On arrival they see starvation and death .
This illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .
Will there just be one system ?
This loss need not however be negative .
Politically , we are moving closer together .
Many people would not .
Firstly , a positive approach .
Why should this matter ?
Why ?
That could have disastrous implications .
They cried , they cheered .
They encourage organisational skills and tidiness .
But are they such a good thing ?

How did I get here ?
This wave is the microwave .
Eating is something everyone must do .
The idea behind the radio is simple .
Radio keeps people informed .
Nowadays , everybody watches TV .
This is based on equity theory .

They come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
Different is beautiful !
