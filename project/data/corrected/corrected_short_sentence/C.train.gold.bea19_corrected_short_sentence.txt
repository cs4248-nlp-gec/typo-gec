Dear Johanna ,
The book opens with a boy .
At night , the maze grinds shut .
His name is Kyle .
A typical American name , right ?
However , he is not typical .
He is special .
Well , it 's all right .
I 'm relieved .
How come ?
So , he is thoughtful .
I must be honest for a while .
He aroused my own enslaved desires .
What if it breaks me down ?
He is a hunter .
All men are .
He is cute , anyway .
He likes watching it .
I pondered this many times .
And surely , I would .
Thank you , Kyle .

Cars are here to stay .

The old house looked abandoned .
I guess what goes around comes around !
Something was wrong !
She was sure about that .

Maybe he had a mistress .
They met each other nine years ago .
By accident , he thought .
She always planned her steps carefully .
So he was her escape .
He was well - off and funny .
So she tried to calm him down .
" We are broke .
We do not have any money left .
So I have found a job " .
What can you possibly do ? "
" I am a porter .
She was just numb .
This must be some kind of joke .
He was waiting for her response .
They definitely had different ideas of poverty .
Slowly he became ill one more time .
Dear Jane ,
