Dear Paul !
Hope to see you soon
John
But time was up .
No ! He had never acted like this .
He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
And he was right .
Mel lost the baby .
He broke up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
He did n't care .
Hi Jane ,
How are you ?
I was glad to hear from you .
It 's near there .
You can walk to my house .

Dear Paul ,
What 's up ?
Love ,
But , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
I am 20 years old , and I live in Port - Said , Egypt .
It is n't just a dream in my mind , but I work hard to make this dream come true .
We went by car and it was about 8 hours long .
It does not have very much to do , but there were the falls .
They annoy me .

it 's a team sport .
They knew when it would be the ' Green Nile ' or ' Red Nile ' to stock up with clean water .

Dear Sir or Madam ,
We had a great time .
Are you okay ' , I asked .
Why ?
Hello Paul ,
See you !
That was only 30 years ago .
You just click on it .
TV is dying .
Dear Steve ,
It was good to hear from you .
But I wanna find a job to help him with the bills .
Can you give me a hand with that ?
You can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .

Hi John ,

Many even use cars .

I agree with this point of view .
She was with her mum . .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll ! Could you buy it for me ? '' she said .
And then ...
You just have to deal with the game .
It is not fair .
It is never too late .
Enjoy !
Dear Mrs Kate Ashby ,
Essay
I have been there twice , and I like it .
That 's easy .
That does not mean you will never find one .
When you find one , spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
It was too much for him .
It was a big mess .
They both knew that they loved each other and they cared about each other , but it was too much for him .
Topic :
He has no idea how he ended up there .
My area is very clean and very green .
It is a good place to live .
Bye for now .
Nouf .
Dear Les ,
Who on Earth could that be ?
