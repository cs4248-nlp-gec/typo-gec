I haven't written to you for ages because I was very busy because of the exams at University .
What about you ? What 's new in Brazil ? As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization of a concert which was held last month .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all the tickets , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to the dressing room to get autographs from musicians .
I felt like a star ! Crowds of people were waiting in front of the dressing room for autographs , but only me and my sweet girlfriend got them .
People were so envious ... I liked it ! It was a fantastic experience .
Next time , I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn good money and you have a cultural experience .
Advertising is everywhere .
In spite of this range of media , TV continues to be the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many ads on television , but , is it true ?
There can be people tired of so much advertising content , but this is completely necessary .
There are a lot of products which have to be advertised and a lot of messages to report to people .
TV is the most accessible means of communication and people can see the messages in this way .
In one ad there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies ' investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of ads on TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
Yes , it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay in the sun because you end up being burnt by the sun .
During summer I love to go to the beach and go sunbathing with my friends as well as having fun with them playing volleyball or running in the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the heat of summer .
Furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
I saw your advertisement in the newspaper and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment . That 's why I need to work in order to pay my fees .
I have some experience working with children of all ages , and I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also , I 've just got my FCE certificate this year , but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native - speaking country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient . Therefore , I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily to any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas , plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and experience a different culture .
Yours faithfully ,
He finally , after 5 years , won a swimming competition .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
He followed and apologized to her .
Even if I am not very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to do is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to make a lot of movements that are impossible while in the air , creates a wonderful state of mind .
Swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't give up before trying , because it is fairly simple and it can give a lot of satisfaction !
·Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activities to pass the time
As our town is well - known for our magnificent beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign and local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing at the beach or canoeing and waterskiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
In Castelldefels , there are other activities that are less popular , but cheaper . For instance : free zumba masterclass , beach yoga , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities on the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finally , I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both the popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would have a great time here in Castelldefels !
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than taking a taxi .
I am an Engineer of Execution in Mines , I qualified at the " Instituto Profesional Virginio Gómez " .
I am particularly interested in and I am competent to apply for the post of Chief of Operations at the new underground project , Chiquicamata .
In the first place , my qualities and professional skills seem to suit the requirements of your company .
On the other hand , I have the theoretical knowledge to use the new technologies this great project requires .
I am also able to lead the operations of the project responsibly and through team work to achieve the objective and to continue with the prestige that your company has .
My work experience is outstanding because I had the privilege of belonging to the " Minera El Teniente " as shift manager , Chief of Operations at " Minera Andina " and at the evaluation department of CODELCO projects .
I really appreciate your time and consideration .
Without further ado , I remain , yours faithfully ,
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that people who know how to speak a foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in big companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , there are more benefits . For example , if you want to travel to another country , it is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand everything without complications .
Today , globalization is bringing the world closer together . That means that there are more possibilities to have contact with other cultures , for example through literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive in different ways , so if you have the possibility of learning a new language , do it , because it will bring you many benefits .
Yours faithfully ,
First , people in this area have actually found a suitable place to enjoy their time through a wide range of activities and games which are held creatively and effectively and are suitable for different ages .
Besides , it has enough modern facilities to serve the users in peak hours and the trainers are everywhere and ready to give help .
With the purpose of attracting more people to join the club , besides its good points , I would highly recommend that they should arrange the time suitably and avoid they hold the activities to avoid problems .
Given is a diagram introducing the procedures for making bank notes .
Designing the bank notes is the first and indispensable step .
People should decide the background colour and the artwork and they have to consider the security issues .
Then , skilled machinists prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
After that comes the most significant stage ; that is , inspecting the quality of the printed sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged but still good sheets , people will cut them into separate notes and pack them together in order to dispatch and distribute the bank notes .
In conclusion , the diagram gives the quite precise process of making bank notes .
Everything began a few years ago , when Alfred , the Mayor , read an article about the importance of the surroundings to the health and happiness of people .
A concerned population
While youngsters use their time trying to inform the oldest people of the village about the importance of taking care of our surroundings , middle - aged people have planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making it a more attractive place to live in than we used to have .
The local authorities helped this initiative by creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order for it to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
People now are worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet , it is called .
I 'm writing to you about the staff recruitment for the " New Cloud Generation " project .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years ' experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have good teamworking skills .
We also require that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However , it 's possible that we wo n't find enough people with that profile , so , we could accept people with one year 's experience .
Finally , I need you to prepare some profiles of the qualities that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than the one I told you before in that e - mail .
Please , answer me with the information as soon as possible .
It was a really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoyed it very much .
You probably wo n't believe me , but I met all the members of Dżem band . I talked to them and we had lunch together . They 're very nice men . Because of helping them , I had the best place during the concert and I have their autographs on the latest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be able to talk to you about this experience .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth taking into account for the next course that will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject , even English .
That way , we would have been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is one of the top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows the different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors gave a great performance .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine at Port - Said University .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information , so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field , as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Over the last two years , I have worked in many places , such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and a water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can work miracles in our lives , so I chose this program because I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer , but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
I learnt from research that you can do everything at any time . In addition , a little tired can change life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is to travel to all the countries in the world . Also , I have attended a lot of conferences in my field , so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for community service and the development of my society , as I hope to come back and teach others what I have learnt .
I saw your advertisement this morning and I am really interested in it .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to 12 years old . I consider myself quite patient and fun . In my opinion , they are two highly necessary qualities for this kind of job .
I do not like to be alone or feel lonely . This could be one of my great weaknesses .
If you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Although privately owned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and on our planet there is an increasing problem of space and pollution .
I would say that , most probably , private cars are not " sustainable " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population - growth forecast tells us that , in the next 35 years , the world population will grow by a staggering 3 billion human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream of a future of technological people flying around , each of them with their own small private helicopter .
I guess that in our future there will be no helicopters , and not even any cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independent transport will increase dramatically .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spent 11 months a year studying , partly because , after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because the long vacation will get students used to having fun instead of studying , and partly because some difficult courses should be continually studied .
More reasons and details will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
For example , when the semester starts , students can not get over the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studied rather than having a long break .
For instance , learning English should be a daily activity . If you have a long time without studying English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on the aforementioned , I totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spent 11 months a year studying .
My father was a professional soccer player , so I think that I inherited this love for soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
When I play badly , I feel agitated , but my teammates give me their unconditional support .
I know health is very important , so if you do this sport there is a high probability that you are healthy .
The flight was approximately five hours during which I watched beautiful movies .
They were incredible , amazing and beautiful .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she said they do not see me frequently and many other members of my family .
In conclusion , I had a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visited awesome places like Niagara Falls and Time Square , received a lot of presents and , especially , ate a lot of delicious food .
Most students attending universities are away from the city where they used to live , so , they need accommodation to live in throughout their studies .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations , such as shared rooms and dormitories for their students to lower the costs , because most students have a low income .
Other students , who may have family financial support , prefer to hire an apartment to live independently .
Sharing houses or rooms has many advantages , such as being cheap , safe , close to the university , and a chance to learn how to share everything with others . Saving money and time will be more obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times those for hiring an apartment , and because they will be closer to the university . Saving money and time is more efficient because of reducing transportation costs .
In spite of all these benefits , I prefer - if I can - to live in an apartment where personality is very important for me .
Although the federal government which is decided as a role of the USA has many benefits according to the reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The strength of federalism , which gives more liberty to states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture , when it may create some conflicts between states .
An example of this is the marriage of homosexuals , where some states allow this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even though the federal government lets each state function independently , it still controls the main decisions .
This causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to the USA through the Nevada desert .
Also , the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the states and the federal government blame each other for the increase in unemployment in some states .
In conclusion , federal government , which gives freedom and power , causes many problems , such as no single policy and confusion over responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting , but they also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico , I would give two important pieces of advice ; first , try to get along with your travel companion and enjoy the Mexican food instead of criticising the spicy flavour .
People say that on every journey people suffer at different moments of the trip : arrive , get away from the frustration of an unknown place , get along with your travel companion , succeed as a traveler and arrive home triumphant .
This minimal chance will make a big difference when you visit another city .
In this way , visitors will be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious flavour that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I have offered two important pieces of advice for visitors that come to my country : try to get along with your companion in order to have fun , and try to enjoy Mexican food , because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed for the first time in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced face - to - face communication .
Unsurprisingly , the social consequences of Facebook and Twitter play an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy and there is a possibility of a cycle of bullying .
This essay will focus on the benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comment the on potential future of these implications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted to readers almost instantly .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with the daily activities of friends , making observations about relationships , maintaining one 's own feelings within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their common interests via the social network .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see all the daily activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also , there is a high potential of being deliberately aggressive toward someone .
However , information which appears on Facebook or Twitter is easily accessible , so everybody can easily respond as it is a public opinion .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comments .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involved with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous harassment of a woman by a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking , harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face - to - face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without having to see each other 's appearances .
The possible outcomes might be that the more time people spend on SMS , the fewer communicative skills they have .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the usefulness of these implications , people should pay attention to the fact that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life and avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits of using Facebook and Twitter are that people can communicate and be connected to their friends frequently .
Also , people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggression towards each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included on all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travel , special occasions , etc .
This practice is considered one of those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques at the moment of taking a picture should be considered , like learning to draw .
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs have been taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generation 's lives ( teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related to the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of special skills , techniques and knowledge .
The British summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
What if you do n't have any of those requirements ?
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . To put it simply ,
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best means of transport for the environment .
Although some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones that use gas or diesel ) so , people choose these ones and that 's why pollution is one of several issues that we have to deal with .
Environmental care is gaining strength every day , from kids to elderly people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for society 's consumption .
If people did n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably happen when the destination is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government should reduce the fares on public transportation . That could make people use public transportation and protect the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent global warming .
In Coslada , people are well informed about taking care the of environment .
There are many ecological islands .
Nevertheless , it is never enough , because dog owners are mostly to blame .
The most important thing in environmental protection is the education of children .
It works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is reasonable .
We live in a cottage and we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The proceeds are given to several organizations which take care of the environment .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization , which is over 6 thousand years old .
All historians , researchers , scientists agree on this .
Egypt is a kind of river civilization in the huge Sahara desert .
Throughout time , the Nile has been the only source of water for Egyptians .
Furthermore , the rise in the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
But such a high level of development of Egyptian civilization has a negative side as well as a positive .
A great number of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearance of a lot of plants and animals .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt becomes developed , the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
It 's quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousands of tourists , who come every year .
In addition , naval wars were represented in order to celebrate the Roman army .
It has been ruined through the ages , but now people understand its importance and take care of it .
In my opinion , it is important because it reminds us of our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand that we should never give up and to follow our dreams .
In this fast moving world , transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Travelling by car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages to using public transport .
Firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport , it is cheap and affordable for all classes of people in society .
A number of buses are provided by the government in order to meet people 's financial means .
Using public transport is a waste of time and the fact that there is no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly , travelling by car has its own advantages and disadvantages .
Not everybody can afford a journey by car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy a high level of privacy while travelling and it is convenient
and sophisticated and you can travel faster .
To sum up , with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both have equal advantages and disadvantages .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , but just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Somehow , you ca n't always identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which leads to some misunderstanding between them .
Moreover , some old people might take this considerate action for granted and they might even command young adults or students to offer their seat without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city has nothing to criticize expect that .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films .
Firstly , it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
Television can teach kids important values and life lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
News , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television also has negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services for an international bank , in the mass market and small business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition of the advice to the signing of contracts , building and maintaining after - sales relationships in the interest of customer satisfaction
I have also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortgages , personal loans , contability and investments .
I worked for several years on the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .
In many years of work , I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations and always work with serenity and enthusiasm . I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic team .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always being willing to learn , respecting other points of view and finding ways to deal .
I have worked for the same large company for 25 years , so , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
But , probably , this situation is only the period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this sphere .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Maybe robots will be able to drive more intelligently than people .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think it might take away their independence .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is really useful to speak the local language , it makes your trip easier and more comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing at the international level . If you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value to your profile and you can get a higher salary .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign media , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greed .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
Technologically advanced countries have cleared a great number of forests and land to build tall buildings .
All the examples above will increase the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher the temperature increase , the worse the quality of life is .
If people around the world do n't put more emphasis on our natural environment , we will have a dark and hopeless future .
Everyone will live in despair , but be unable to find the entrance to brightness .
These terrible consequences are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied hearts .
Undercover work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the real danger is if you get discovered .
I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistant which I saw advertised .
For the last two years , I have been a member of the swimming group at the University .
I managed to win many competitions in this country and abroad .
I believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , considering the swimming skills I have .
The job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained and , what is more , it would provide me with new knowledge .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should require further information .
I am available to attend an interview at your convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
In our modern world , many people are suffering from stress that springs from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave this condition during holidays .
In this respect , many people prefer to go to natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations in their lives .
For example , walking by the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly about their experiences in life .
People can review their decisions during holidays more accurately and helpfully .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions about their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of developing .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest mode of transport .
Statistically , cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
From my point of view , cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
And this undesirable waiting time might not be so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedules .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausted , especially over a long distance .
Even though cars can provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , the advantages of travelling by public transport should not be ignored .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private cars .
As we all know , the more passengers use public transport , the less car exhaust is emitted per person .
Recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relationship between car exhaust and lung cancer .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering diseases and saves lives .
Correspondingly , the space for each person is becoming more limited than before .
If every citizen owns a car and uses it rather than public transport for every travelling opportunity , I suppose that our streets will become a car park and everyone will spend more time in congestion .
Last but not least , public transport allows people to do other things which are impossible when driving .
Drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense mood .
For a passenger , however , travelling is completely relaxing .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just look at the scenery .
Though there are many advantages tor public transport , that does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one mode of transport can replace others .
On the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , get to know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
Also , in recent years expressing yourself in English , French , German and Russian has became something essential in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitable in the future , but to achieve it they will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .
I have had a part - time job as a babysitter and I take care of my 11-year - old brother very often .
I have worked in an Easter camp too , and I have already organised a lot of activities , like " rappel " , paintball ...
We ate delicious food and played interesting games together .
We had mouth - watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
Adriana and I immediately went to her and picked her up . '
I had butterflies in my stomach . ' Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unforgettable day !
Inside , they will be full of conveniences .
Relaxation , learning , kitchen zones , and so on .
Television will be cordless , as this way as at present Internet .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport , so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming has different styles ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful for weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight . It is also the best sport for asthmatic patients , because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you want to start to learn to swim , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your own age .
I got a lot of experience from them .
During a concert everybody can enjoy , themselves but nobody thinks about how they prepare for a concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time .
For example , they know everything about each helper 's jobs , but at the same time , they are just concerned about their own subjects .
I want to explain to you some interesting parts of my experience .
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertising , technology is having a huge and not always positive impact on outdoor advertising .
From black - and - white ads posted in public places , we have moved to practically living surrounded by outdoor ads placed in every available and imaginable spot .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
The recent developments in mobile technology allow advertisers to offer personalized advertising to each of us .
I 'm sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca on my computer or mobile at home , on my way to work the ads on the buses I see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an ad from tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
It will suit me sometimes , and it will even be useful , but I 'm also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive .
The way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
Advertising might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed in the wrong spot or shown at the wrong time , they lose their artistic side .
But , technology is here for better or worse , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in the suburbs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
Together we could spend time in a pleasant atmosphere .
Though I am a beginner at it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
Since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n't learn these important techniques slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during practice .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
The number of channels is gradually decreasing
In our country , one decade ago , when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All TV channels tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
Internet TV is increasing
It costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who , to watch this or that television program .
You just follow a suggestion made by someone .
Big broadcasting groups are used by all of them .
It is expensive to keep journalists and cameramen all around the world .
Nowadays , only national or international broadcasting groups can be in the competition .
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
I am a 20-year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
From several trips to many countries I have made so far , I would say that I already have some experience of travelling around the word .
I am interested in joining your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different ways to find the way or to orientate myself in the wilderness .
Furthermore , I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
It will be helpful if you found a small apartment near Cambridge University where I 'll be studying English for 5 months .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
But , if I were you , I would take a taxi because the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
In my opinion , we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment in order to do work better than before .
Actually , students eat a lot of fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to cook food . For these reasons , I think that the best restaurant is somewhere where they do home - made food , and a good idea for the main course is : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and , for dessert , apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture . Maybe we should choose a special restaurant , like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , a more or less relaxing environment . But the atmosphere is very important for dinner , and I think that we should vote on this , because we will have a good night or not depending on the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very good for us , because normally we speak about books , work and studies , whereas with this type of environment , we can speak about ourselves , our family , our hobbies , and everyone will get to know something new about other classmates .
I love the food there and I think my classmates will too .
They are incredibly delicious .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you will definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile on your face .
However , if you do not like burgers , you can eat whatever American food you want and you will get the same fantastic experience as a person who has eaten another meal .
Though travelling by car is more convenient , it is expensive .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in the following ways :
As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
The middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
Public transport is even good for our environment compared to cars .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than their film versions .
That 's because while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books develop the imagination of the reader .
Also , many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .
She was eighteen years old , she had to be independent .
Tennis is an individual sport .
It is a combination of physical power , technique and mental power .
Like other sports , tennis is getting more modern , faster and more commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
You can either find a professional coach or just join your friends .
My name is Andrea Cocci , I 'm sixteen , and I saw the advertisement for the weekend work in your cafe , and I 'm interested in working with you .
I ' m the perfect choice for this work . In fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us food is everything .
In Italy , I attend a school for waiters and cooks , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I have been employed in many famous restaurants .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money on it and you will not be guaranteed to achieve your goals at all , so it could become a real nightmare if you do not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view , I think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages , especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always another solution , which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
At first , when I started to play football , I did it with my classmates , who were all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . However , some years ago , they started to include me when they played , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
I recommend a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic , traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant and is always tasty and fresh .
The've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional desserts .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go to at the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually go there .
The media accompany famous people , such as politicians and film stars throughout their whole lives .
In my view , public figures deserve to have their own life , without being photographed .
On one hand , becoming a public figure is associated with journalists , mass - media , flashes .
It seems to me that journalists might be absolutely toxic and they have a bad influence on society , which assesses celebrities through the prism of journalistic documentary .
It has always been very useful since a long time ago . Nevertheless , nowadays , there are some people who ask whether if public transport was suppressed , society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the great advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very convenient and good for the environment .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is global warming , because the atmosphere is very polluted .
Finally , the last reason is convenience , because if you have a car , it is so difficult to find a parking space in the centre of the city .
Personally , I have got used to walking around my city and my car is only used if I travel around the country .
Take the example of mobile technology . Your latest handset , with the latest configurations becomes outdated within a few months of buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people 's lives will definitely change in such a long period .
In the last 50 years , science and technology took great leaps ; the internet and mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at our fingertips .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do n't need to be in front of anyone , everything can be managed through virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than in the past , thanks to the progress mankind has made through technology .
On the other hand , terrorism , global warming and greed have become the top challenges of today 's world .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public life .
The corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people 's leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in the coming years , imagining better lives for people 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool . In the right hands it will be a boon for us , but in the wrong hands it has the power to destroy the world as we know it today .
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
I 'm a motivated , flexible and open - minded person and I have had a lot of experience in this field , as well .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as an educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor activities .
I have really great memories of these experiences and I would really like to relive them .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientists that think it helps children 's brains to develop , but it is important to supervise them , because there are a lot of violent games .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work , for research , or google information and also connect with other teachers , speak about courses and exchange information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve for the future .
Nothing is impossible in life , but it is not easy to find sincere friends .
Friends do not have to agree with everything you say , but they should share their views about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You can find a variety of articles , such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travel , the weather and the environment .
There are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official language . There were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and the economy very highly developed .
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes , when I am watching TV or I am reading the newspaper , I notice that gadgets have become very useful in our life . It seem to me to be good opportunities to make our life easier .
They believe that it is a useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
Personally , for me , I like books very much . When I am at home , I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
In conclusion , I want to say that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier .
He thought it was easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what was going on with him .
This woman , who was standing next to him , was his girlfriend , his future wife .
He knew that she loved him as much as he loved her , but everything was just all wrong at this moment .
She could n't understand what was going on , because it was just three weeks ago that they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
He stood up and said to his girlfriend that he needed a break and he had to be alone .
In conclusion , I do not like to do any sports , but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we should not stay at home or work all the time .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to preserve and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness of the importance of reasonable use of it .
The local government is also taking serious action aimed at creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste with the active cooperation of most of the citizens , who are really concerned about the recycling of waste .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish , taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
And that is a negative point . These dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to exchange the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I suddenly remembered that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that did it would be rewarded with a bonus point , but anyways , this is n't important information .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful , so you ca n't distinguish where the explosion hit .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how I am going I would not do it , because I have to face all of this .
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Nowadays , there are a lot of different types of exercise . You can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the gym or practise Crossfit or something like that .
I recommend you practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Is there no future for public transport because travelling by car is much more convenient ?
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and the underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perception that a car can give you freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14-year - old boy explains " I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
Indeed , cars increase pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . " On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fares on public transport ) , but also , it is safer .
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it is obvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Do you agree or disagree ? " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " .
Disagreement on always telling the truth being the most important thing in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being truthful is crucial in a relationship , always telling the truth could be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about a personal matter and it would feel awkward to mention it to colleagues or an employer .
To further illustrate the first point above , you that could hurt someone 's feelings by telling the truth at all times .
For example , if some woman you are acquainted is with wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting the occasion .
In that case , they could still make conversation without spoiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters . People usually tend to keep it private , since , most of the time , it is strange and inappropriate to talk about oneself too much to people at work or even people that one has just got acquainted with .
Due to this , we 're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he could give me the answer I wanted .
I ended up getting expelled from the school because the teacher and our classmates suspected Michael and I had stolen our classmate Sally 's wallet .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we were the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , we refused to return to the school and decided to change to a new school as we know , even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
my name is Bianca Padovesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .
I think I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English which is very important for communicating .
Also , I have a good relationship with little kids . I usually look after my nieces and nephews over the weekends and they love spending time with me . Moreover , I am very energetic , always awake and ready to work hard .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of my character , as I can invent new and entertaining games for the kids to have a great time .
I like making puzzles or games which involve running and jumping , which are important for the kids ' development .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection . I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but , # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself . I have to think about whether it is better to help the entire world or just save a group . The decision was in my hands . It was # conventional to help the entire world , but I do n't want to die . While I was thinking about that , we found a body . It was the familiar body of someone that was in the group . One of those guys we wanted to find , and alive not dead . His face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive to at least tell us what happened to everyone . The # battle against hunger started , everyone was hungry , and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things : dead or eaten away by a walker . So we needed to find something that was a # nutritional food which we could eat with no problems and be OK .
We got close to the pharmacy . There was no walkers inside , so we ran into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check on us in the night . I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway services and they 're often overcrowded .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
If you like shopping , in the outskirts of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and beyond .
As in all industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is provided almost for each area and each building .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in the music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
As far as I 'm concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable when under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which show them in an embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celebrities ' ' work ' , so they have to take it into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolable spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
These rare fragments of life without the eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , non - famous people .
To my mind , they do not believe celebrities are normal people like everyone of us , only with more money in bank bank accounts
So , as you can see , I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability to have a normal life should also be given to them .
The film starts by putting your in the flesh of the main character , who is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what seems to be a camp .
However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , and it is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
The people who live in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves against the menaces of the maze .
He took the role of runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and looking for an exit out of this place .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that is hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully I 'll be playing for many more . What I love about it is , first of all , that , tall or small , anyone can play it as long as they 're determined , So , basically , it is a life - long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball . Most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you will probably miss something . Each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player detects the location of the ball in that amount of time . And then there 's the intensity . If you haven't seen a game , go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd . You 're missing out .
Personally , winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
Everybody cares about cleanliness in front of the house and in the garden .
Especially in spring , there are a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy . The waiters were very friendly and informative .
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant is a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant , despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive , and I will , no doubt , be back for other meals .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known to all of us .
Legalization of drugs is an argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of exclusion .
Marginalization has a link with the illegality of this activity .
Also , this illegality is responsible for the attraction of drugs because the majority of people start using drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment becomes an addiction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has tried some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy themself with friends or just to try them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong , because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and be very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life , because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to impose limits on themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country , so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
But unfortunately , I have an exam on Thursday , so I ca n't meet you , but you can pick me up from the school at 1:30 , then we can go to have lunch .
My school is really easy to find . Go straight ahead onto Aljameah Street , then turn right beside the farce of KAU University . After getting off the bridge , you 'll find the school on your right .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , which is like a little safari park , or Doñana National Park , where , in that period , you can see some migratory birds .
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school . For this reason he is always misbehaving .
In the Simpson family , all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
Everything suggested that I would n't get out of the house for quite a while .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name on it .
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
They are very casual about the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So - called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip about others , not doing anything for the improvement of their own town .
All the households nearby the public road throw dirty things away easily and do n't even bother about the order of the municipality .
