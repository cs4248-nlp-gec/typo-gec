My town is a medium - sized city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high - density population because of its small territory .
Although it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the center of the city which is surrounded by a park .
There is a commercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , grocers , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
The quality of the products and services is quite good , because there is huge competition . However , I recommend you be careful of fakes or cheats .
I have my own plan too , but I do n't want to be the same as them . I want to become a journalist .
Working as a journalist is very exciting for many reasons .
First , I will have an opportunity to live abroad .
Next , I will have a chance to attend big parties or events and I can make friends with famous people . It 's interesting !
Finally , I will have a high salary when I am a journalist .
To be a journalist , I must study very hard , so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream come true .
In the future , I 'll become a journalist .
Before , it was really convenient to go by bus or by train , but with the new economy , the fares are more expensive and a big difference from the past is that it is less expensive to go long - distance than short journeys .
Furthermore , the biggest group of positive feeling students in the present is live with various nationalities .
The possible reason is these international students can not speak English fluently .
In order to give a good image and show the national parenting , our respondents tend to have a great pardon to other nationalities .
First , I tried it with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar .
The main reason why I wanted to try it was to lose weight ( I was a bit overweight ) .
Consequently , I realized that although cycling outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed most breathing fresh air and taking pleasure in the countryside .
If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to look for a good mountain bike .
It 's important to avoid accidents , be comfortable and have a good journey .
Secondly , he or she should buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing .
because it 's difficult to understand ; for example , the characters are ,
The movie is about Lucy 's family , who move into a farmhouse that is mysterious and
Also reflects a comparison of Lucy 's family , and characters
The story actually takes place in a camp and a farmhouse , mysteriously
It 's interesting because Lucy 's mom discovered a wall in their farm , that
In the summer around the lake , there are so many concerts that you have difficulty finding the right one .
In the following decades , revolution and civil wars smote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born .
There was an unparalleled expansion of the English - Speaking Peoples both by birth and emigration .
I a very good experience .
Travelling with family is different to travelling with friends .
We went there because the university orchestra from UAZ invited us to go there and play with them .
We went to to Acapulco to play , to an event where universities from Mexico go and present cultural activities .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there . That was an incredible experience that I will never forget .
Really , I think it 's a very beautiful , interesting and breathtaking kind of sport .
Sometimes the weather conditions are not comfortable for guys . For example : wind , light fog or freezing temperatures . All of these are very difficult conditions .
And also most of them are very attractive . A big advantage for girls , who like nice pictures .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and , normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable .
Sometimes the staff go on strike and we customers do not know in time . As a result , we can not get to work on time . That is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive , but public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantage is not so good , actually .
People usually tell me I 'm a cinema enthusiast , and they are right . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film , especially when it is a thriller , rather than doing sport ,
If you want to see a good thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and , in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone , because I believe people would like it for many reasons .
What 's more , the plot is easy to understand .
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and scientists .
However , the soundtrack was awful ; it did n't get having a scared .
In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thriller , which must be seen if you want to have a good time , given that it achieves keeping you in suspense until the end and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have a better opportunity to see it than this week , because just now in Spain the cinema festival is taking place .
In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve , because my country is so poor and , besides , it is considered one of the Third World countries . And another thing that must be taken into consideration is that the politicians are horrible . They have destroyed my country .
When we ask ourselves how we can take care of the environment ,
Perhaps when we are shopping in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask the assistant for a bag or something similar to carry this food or other things home .
But we should n't forget the pollution cause by cars . We should use a bicycle or public transportation more .
Also , in the same way , we should walk to our destination .
The governments are also important for taking care of the environment .
They should have healthy habits and , by their example , they can improve the habits of the population .
I love sports but I do not get many opportunities to play a sport . I was born in a village in India . My parents are farmers like most other villagers .
The only playground in our village was the school ground which was full of small rocks and not good for playing any sports .
We bought a television in 1888 . After that , I became a fan of cricket .
Sachin and Ganguly were my favorite cricketers . I love their batting .
It was the summer holidays and Michael 's family were at the airport waiting impatiently for their flight to Mexico .
The flight to Mexico was incredible , and very funny .
Some minutes later , they designated how the cousins were going to share the rooms .
When Michael got up in the morning , he realized that his kittten had disappeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
One of the best restaurants I 've ever been to is Spizharka .
The waitresses are helpful and smiling .
Warm candlelight and small tables with patterned table cloths create a friendly atmosphere .
I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside is below zero .
In contrast , his wife respected and loved his mother and never complained to her husband about these bad situations .
Because of this , he always defended his mother and always said the wife was the one responsible .
When he came , his mother asked him to up quickly , pretending that she was tired .
She was shocked and apologized for a mistake she did not commit .
This was one of the everyday inventions that affects our lives .
Edison is said to have created the first commercially practical incandescent light .
He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb .
Some historians claim there were 20 other inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version , but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
( taken from www.bulbs.com )
Edison began serious research into the incandescent light bulb in October of 1878 , and his original design was in 1879 .
Edison and his research team made his discovery commercially and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Tom , a friend of Peter 's suddenly fainted and fell down in the class room . I did n't know what to do immediately . First , I calmed myself down and I checked his pulse . It was okay . Then I knew that he was out of danger , so I called my classmates . Everyone came rushing to the spot , but still he was not moving , so we decided to take him to the hospital or call an ambulance . Finally we called an ambulance without delay .
We were waiting patiently . Finally , the ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital immediately .
Recently I saw a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine .
I was interested in whether I could write such an article and win a prize .
It 's ordinary bodybuilding .
I live in São Carlos , in the countryside of São Paulo , in Brazil .
In my city , protecting the environment is so difficult .
First of all , we have an extinction area of cerrado close to the Federal University of São Carlos , but sometimes , the area is used to construct a new university building .
Secondly , the council does n't care about the environment ; for example , the council stopped the garbage collection when the new mayor took over the council .
It demonstrated that the effort that was made in the last 10 years was over because of the new political position of the mayor .
It is so stupid because the environment needs to be more important than political positions .
Instead of using selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or a sanitary landfill , we have used a dumpfill that is contaminating the soil .
Finally , the population , most of the time , does n't matter to throw away garbage on the street or in a prohibited area .
In conclusion , in my city , concern for the environment 's protection is not working as it should for the protection of soil , environment and health .
The environment is our surroundings . There is no awareness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is happening in our town . They usually speak about how hot it is today , but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our surroundings clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free .
They do n't care about the environment because it does n't give anything to them .
Management accounting practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
Most organizations know how management accounting practice affects their work . Therefore , they choose good programmes and employees .
I was in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist , but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world .
The environment is always a hurting problem in the world .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country . About my village , we use banana leaves instead of nylon , dispose of garbage sensibly ... and so on .
I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh ) , and I 'm in grade nine .
Are you studying mathematics for your exam ?
I have just finished my lunch break , and before preparing everything to go to work , I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a little surprise with these fantastic photos . I hope you like them .
I would like to apply for the job that you have advertised .
I have worked in many kitchens before , and I have gained a lot of experience there .
We got there at five o'clock . We had not yet reached many people , so we took the opportunity to give the gift , which was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new one , as the bride loved .
Half an hour after we arrived , everybody started arriving , there were many greetings , thanks , hugs , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificently stocked , with plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course . Also , the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool . We were lucky they had an amazing wedding planner who arranged magnificent and fun activities . He said to the bride and groom that they should each get into an inflatable ball and try walking on the water for as long as they could , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .
In my country people make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of bad habits concerning their attitude towards rubbish . They are always throwing their old things and rubbish away in public places . The government also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour .
Once upon a time , there was a monster in a city called " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very tiny city . That was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively monster . He always migrated to the north every Monday .
In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , he was the opposite . He killed people , destroyed complete cities ; he smashed all the architecture of the city , and did a lot of bad things .
One day , Monsteration 's next destination was the city of Michenstain .
But when he arrived in Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the middle of the night when he arrived , so he was eager to destroy everything .
He was spoiling all the people 's crops , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area .
The next day , he was a very attractive monster . In other words , he was undercover in another monster 's body .
He was completely different ; it was impressive the way he was acting .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I think had no cure . It was called " The Monsteration Infections " .
( In those times , there were diverse monsters , but none of them was like him ; he was the number 1 of the monsters at destroying things . )
Scientists were trying to find a cure for the Monsteration Infections , but they still do n't have it .
In their laboratories , they had a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them .
Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team on their iPods .
The scientists that were making the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " Magnificent " .
Well I 'd like to talk to you about my experiences as an English student for many years .
I have needed to use English a lot of times during my professional activities . For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago .
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I 'd like to be an excellent bilingual person .
Currently , I 'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my goal .
I 'm writing now without using a dictionary and doing this composition without translating from Spanish ( I hope hahaha )
I hope you can help me understand more about how to improve my English level and develop my skills .
It is impossible not to love doing sports activity in the fresh air .
On the weekend I stayed at home . I started reading " Eleanor & Park " ; it was amazing . I laughed a lot because of the things that the characters said .
The day before I started school , I did an investigation for literature class .
The Metro is even good for the health of the people as there is no pollution because it runs on electricity and it also connects most of the city . As Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
Jiu - Tian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " imitating the faces and posing as gods " .
Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy a car with expensive tax , so people have to use public transportation , such as buses , the subway , etc .
Public transportation will rich , so we can build more stations for suburban and more public car to carry this .
I am 29 years old , and originally from Brazil .
I am an English student and I have been studying for five years , and recently , I passed the FCE , which is a well recognised certificate .
In 2010 , I graduated in electronic engineering .
From June to September of 2013 , I worked for a tourism company . My position involved looking after groups of people going to England . This previous experience makes me suitable for the job advertised .
In addition to this , personally I am really helpful , exciting , cheerful and committed .
I do sports such as football , basketball and chess , and with these skills , I could help children have fun while teaching them all the benefits of doing sport .
In applying for the job offered , I am willing to work in all different sorts of jobs . I do not mind which , as long as I have the opportunity of being in the USA , as English is my passion .
To sum up , I feel rather confident to assume this position and thank you for considering my application .
Yours faithfully ,
Alessandro Costa .
I am really overwhelmed to be the third member of my small family- Peter , Maria , both of whom are my parents of 45 years of age and my little brother , Patrick-14 years old in a mischievous manner .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions . This mostly happens in high class families , as they focus on achievements like power , political influence etc . On the other hand , for middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
The metro is the most comfortable means of transportation in Moscow .
Using overground transportation is not comfortable because of the traffic .
There is no difference if you use a car or the bus .
That 's my dream " when I joined the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I had achieved my dream .
all of the answers were , " you have to listen and read so you can write and speak well " . I said okay I have to depend on myself . I began to join groups on Facebook where I found some of the people shared their knowledge with others . I followed them immediately .
to teach children and adults in my country good English , and I want to avoid traditional education .
The best thing that can encourage me to open this center is that I have 5 friends in my country who study in the faculty of languages and translation and I think that they will be very happy about joining me in my center .
Public transport has no future . The crisis in 2008 has reduced oil prices , The oil is cheap now and new cars are more efficient and the government give incentives for consumers .
One day in October , Michael , a boy who was studying architecture discovered a box with a message . While he was opening the box , he heard a door open .
Michael was very agitated and confused because he did n't understand anything .
This situation was impossible because his father was dead and , at that moment , he ran and opened the door and his father said " You must stay here , because I must speak with you more and explain why I can speak with you " . But Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Today we received a shipment from Visual service center under our old account number . It could be a mistake by the service center as a notice regarding major organizational restructure has already been sent to service centers .
In the issued notice , it clearly states that all defective parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01/06/2015 .
If any more shipments are returned using our old TNT account number , there is no option other than to invoice the service center for not following instructions .
Many doctors recommend the practicing of sport , because it is very healthy for our bodies and for our minds .
Even if you do n't lose weight , you can gain endurance and flexibility .
My other advice is that I am absolutely sure that you will feel wonderful and happy ! May be not the first time , but definitely later .
In conclusion , sport is absolutely necessary and useful for you to be able to improve your life .
I like everything from pop , electronic , hip - hop to calm music .
I like the restaurant we ate at when we were on a ski - vacation in Champoluc .
This is the power of information technology .
The social networks , such as Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google plus ... are connecting us to more and more friends , companies , public figures , books , films , social organizations ... . We really have a lot of things to see , to think , to " like " , to " comment " on and dozens of other ways that we can make an action to interact with others . So , maybe it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves , to take care of our health .
They help us to communication with the world and we have only twenty hours a day . We know more things but we lose more time for many other interesting things .
But it just happen in the information technology and related fields such as : communication .
On the other hand , we still have a lot of other technologies to create a lot of useful machines , on - side services to make our life better and better day by day .
Transportation helps us go abroad more quickly , even go into space on a tour .
We feel more happy , comfortable and refreshed after something like that .
Biotechnology gives us more food .
Yes , we are solving many problems with our technology for our feeling , our health and our finances , too .
You take the world in your hands with technology to make your life better and better actually , but it is not full that it will good , let keep it with your needs , your time and your money too .
How can I help the environment ?
How can a group of friends help the environment ?
Egypt has a lot of historical places , such as the pyramids , and is the one of the empirical in the world and a lot of people from around the world come to see these pyramids . the wold think about how the Egyptian people made these buildings maybe a thousand years and they still stand without change and a lot of tourists come to take photos in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptians made them without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machines . A lot of scientific teams come from all over the world to study these buildings and conduct Egyptian science in a lot of universities around the world , to study how the air goes inside these buildings and how it keeps the food inside it and how these big stones were taken from distant places and brought to this place and how this building kept the bodies of people after they had died and how these people live inside the buildings and why these buildings are like this and what the benefit of these buildings is and how to make kike this building .
Public transport has improved regional development in the past decade . It 's convenient and necessary for city life .
But when it comes to travelling , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not want to go where everybody goes .
And , there 's really enough development on our planet . It would be better if we could leave some place empty , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well .
Today we have cleverer cricketers and more famous umpires than other countries .
But those countries are very developed and they have many facilities .
But Sri Lanka is a developing country still .
We have no facilities like other countries .
It is very important opportunities in our country .
Volleyball , netball , Elle , table tennis , Karate , etc .
But they are not famous and we ca n't go to everywhere in the world .
But cricket is very famous and we know many cricketers .
We have a lot of shopping facilities , that is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops including clothes shops , pet shops , food shops , shoe shops , accessory shops , toy shops , present shops and any more types of shops that now I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need . Is n't it incredible ?
But for some of them you have to search very thoroughly because some of the shops are unique and some others are very well hidden , but for that you have specialized transport that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go .
It was such a great experience for me .
I enjoyed working with a soundmaster so far .
It was quite stressful but at the end of the concert the atmosphere was amazing .
It 's the heart of Poland and you will learn everything about work , education and people here .
We appreciate kind and hard - working people .
Last year I celebrated my fifteen party and I loved it very much , ( I want to celebrate it again ) .
I also went to piriapolis with my family and all the days .
I like English because it is very important to know other languages to communicate with other people and if I go to another country it is very important to know English .
I think that it is very interesting and I like it .
I am very well and everything is all right .
I had a really nice experience working in a cinema . I would n't have done it if my friend Lucy had n't encouraged me .
The staff were really interesting and helped me all the time and the customers were kind all the time .
First , as everybody knows , the cost of fuel is increasing more and more . Adding to that the bills that owning a car will bring , it becomes immediately clear that it is cheaper to get around by public transport .
Why then are there still so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of sitting comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
Secondly , the environment would improve . As far as I can see , the pollution caused by traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is true as far as waste of time is concerned . Obviously , the fewer cars there are around , the quicker you can get where you want to go .
In conclusion , I would really like politicians who care about public transport to improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and get around much more easily .
The problem is that if everyone thinks that traveling by car is convenient , absolutely everyone will go everywhere by car , and the roads will become chockablock .
I have been playing basketball on weekends since I was little .
I play basketball and baseball like there is no tomorrow .
I play with them in the playground .
The most people travel by car , because the public transport is not convenient for people to use .
The general transport facilities can be divided into three types .
On the sea , including the and port facilities .
In the sky , including airplane flights and airport facilities .
Transport facilities and economic development have a close relationship , and utilized of land is more important .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but the construction of seaports and airports must with congenital condition .
When integration of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport facilities will be convenient for people to use .
Some years ago , we did n't use technology to get in touch with friends and family , but nowadays it 's the most important thing for
There will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things , but maybe some bad things too .
I am not saying that we should always play chess , as physical activities are also important .
The reason why I would recommend someone this sport is that children who are not interested in their studies or would not be able to study .
In that case , chess would help him . It would make the child 's mind sharp and he would not get distracted by his surroundings .
Local transportation is one of the most serious problems in our area .
The local transportation has become difficult and expensive ,
so the government must take action to make it easier .
Public media also must educate people in the importance of local transport and how they can preserve it .
The government must save gasoline and jazz to solve the problem .
The government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe .
I thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers . Above all , and regardless of the sport you have chosen , it is paramount to do some sport , whatever sport you choose , such as spinning . That is my favourite sport .
If you want to start doing some sport , first of all , think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you have a good time , go ahead and make the most of your time enjoying the sport . Nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured .
The advantages they get are the following : they do n't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work .
These people also help to protect the environment by saving natural resources like petrol .
To conclude , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there is no doubt that the public transport system would be less inconvenient than travelling by car .
The process for making bank notes can be outlined in six consecutive steps .
First , the bank notes are considered how to design , including background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are prepared by skilled machinists .
Subsequently , the sheets of bank notes are printed on the metal plates .
The most important step is inspecting the notes to see which are good quality sheets and which are bad sheets .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separate bank notes and packed into cars in order to be dispatched all over the city .
Public transport offers a possible solution to the problem , because many people can be transported in one vehicle .
The government has a responsibility to encourage the public to use buses and the underground more .
However , there are a number of changes that need to be considered .
The government should raise taxes to pay for the service .
I believe that using your car has a lot of advantages or benefits . It is more comfortable and less expensive .
I do yoga to aid relaxation .
Yoga is a very convenient sport .
After doing it skillfully , you can do it at home or any place .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years . Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history .
In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking . Man has been able to invent machines which have been put to work . Automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people from hard work .
The disadvantage , however , is that , because of the machines , many people have lost their jobs .
Nowadays , people are constantly on the move .
Well , ecologists say that getting around using public transport is more beneficial for the environment than using a car or motorbike .
In recent years , the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago .
It 's more comfortable , faster and preferable to having to run to catch a bus , wait for a train , etc .
Also , it has to be said that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't pollute the air , and then , using public transport wo n't be necessary .
The Indonesian government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country 's cleanliness , and do neither the citizens .
This has caused our river some big problems , such as disease , unpleasant smells , floods , etc .
I myself , seeing the river filled with garbage , always seem to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant appearance of the garbage .
Garbage everywhere .
And the amount of the city 's parks does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in the city .
I wonder if the citizens in my country and town could make a better environment by throwing garbage away in the correct place and trying using eco - friendly transportation .
And government , please do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
I think it 's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizens to be more responsible for what they do . And I think that 's enough from me .
I suppose the government have also studied this situation .
I hope the Indonesian government take action regarding this situation because , if it continues , then Indonesia will be the most unclean country over the other countries .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she had fallen in love with , had written a letter to her .
She read the letter with a lot of passion , because it was obvious that Juan was interested in Alison too .
The boy felt very embarrassed , so he carried on on his way and he did not say anything to her .
Like with other things , prices increase , from food to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , electricity . Then people choose public transport in the future .
Nowadays , I usually go swimming twice a week and I really enjoy swimming because I can chill out and disconnect my mind .
Moreover , it is said to be healthy and improves problems with the back , so going swimming is really beneficial for me .
Recently , I found a gadget to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music .
Furthermore , it is necessary to wear glasses .
There are lots of kinds of transportation like buses , cars , subways , trains or taixs .
May Maybe they are comfortable , terrible , , dangerous or average .
I remember that my childhood was very quiet and happy around dinner at grandmother 's house .
My " private menu " included fresh food like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options and healthy food .
Why does everything look more difficult and harder than it was before ?
Ten years showed me that I can do everything for myself if it is enough for me ....
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
From this moment , they will have maturity and responsibility .
So , a lot of parents and students have the opportunity to travel for a year .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you gain a lot of knowledge , culture , discoveries and , with all of this , you gain personal experience .
Sometimes , this can change a person , making her or him have a new perception of the world .
However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel ; they start to work .
The job provides , like the trip , responsibility and experience .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a university .
Besides that , they have different points of view on many subjects , that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students .
Finally , to make a decision to not go to a university when you finish high school is n't the easiest action to take .
It is a big decision , that brings great consequences and great experiences .
If in a city people use public transport more than their own private vehicle , then it will help to protect the environment and ease traffic as well .
But nowadays , automobile companies are more focused on the improvement of cars so that they can be more environmentally friendly and traffic friendly .
The future of public transport will be measured on the basis of the advancement of the private vehicle .
Sometimes people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport .
But the main concern will be technology .
Technology is becoming more advanced .
As an example , if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
In contrast , doing a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility , but the most important thing is that we are always active so our body can get good results .
To sum up , doing sports is very important for teenagers , whose bodies are growing , and doing it regularly is a commitment that we should make . In my opinion , however , doing a mandatory sport is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm , not bothered or out of obligation .
I saw it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your
Thank you in advance for the information .
Yours faithfully
They would consider you as an independent person .
Accordingly , you would take responsibility for what you did .
I do everything , but nothing .
It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe in my ability .
I am overwhelmed with grief , living with them .
A good example of this is the large amount of informative news which we are allowed to get .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It is definitely also educating .
Meanwhile , if an individual wants to learn from TV ,
Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar are going by , the flow of life continuously revolving with the world every person has .
It depends on how you deal with what you have in the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future .
With the simultaneous growing inventions of technologies , way of living go through with it .
A complicated ways from before , advanced technologies make it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect ?
The digital age has been a big problem for the music industry because the new technologies and the internet have helped music piracy .
" Piracy is destroying the music industry " as it is a violation of copyright .
I think that people should be more responsible and respect the work of others so that society evolves in a healthy way and without conflicts .
This perspective on life is inspired by counter - culture movements and some people call these people " alternative " , but they are more common each day and this creates an inclusive and diverse society .
it 's r is n't clear completely , but I suppose it depends on changing life habits in the development process of our society .
The first and most important change is related to eating prepared food that is n't healthy . Usually , the reason is probably women 's lifestyles , which are going through big changes in the sense that they do n't like staying at home and spending their time making food . Now they prefer to buy prepared food .
Now , we forget big dinner tables that are surrounded by family members .
But a good change in our habits is the attention to calories and healthy food , because of getting information on the internet and other media that are easily accessible for all people these days .
In summary , l think the change is negligible but we can control it to make our life better , especially in relation to food , which is the most important aspect of our life but we do n't pay attention to it enough .
I am a programmer who wants to write about programming languages and skills .
The truth of the matter is I think I 'm full of ideas but , unfortunately , I ca n't describe my knowledge and experiences in English .
On Friday , we went on an incredible sightseeing tour , but the guide told me not to take pictures because I had to buy them .
On Saturday night , we went to a formal restaurant to eat pasta .
About one month before departure , they researched on the internet the places that might interest them .
There were Padang Matsirat , Cable Car , Mahsuri Tomb , small islands , Duck tour , beaches , shopping centre and , the most exciting thing was buying chocolates .
They said they had already planned everything and Michael had happily ruined the vacation .
He accompanied his mother to his room 's door .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do . After thinking , he remembered that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor 's clinic was far away from her house . Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street . After he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street . He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car . " Never mind " she said and got in the car beside him .
Peter drove his car to the doctor 's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother went up the stairs to reach the doctor 's clinic . After they arrived , they found that they had to wait a period of time to take their turn . They waited and then their turn came . They entered the doctor 's surgery and the doctor was very kind . He welcomed them and after checking Peter 's grandmother , said
she was absolutely fine .
I am not different in that . There is a backstairs influence in my life . He is none other than my father .
His means of making a livelihood is the simplest .
He always honors the oldest and taught us to avoid telling a lie . As far as I remember , one day he was advising me when suddenly an old man entered the conversation and gave a foolish speech .
Nevertheless , my father did n't tell him arrogantly but he made him know the right thing politely .
Travelling by car plays an important role in our lives .
However , travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car , but you can never know what might happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accident might happen .
This fact gives the government the opportunity to manage the traffic on the roads in cities or towns .
Private transport gives us traffic jams , a lot of accidents and stressful situations .
We get nervous because we are responsible not only for our lives but for other people 's , too .
And , also , we have to understand that using public transport is cheaper than using a car .
The other side of the problem is ecological .
Why do we think that only convenience can be the main point of using a car ?
What can we say about our ecological awareness ?
Public transport will have no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Travel plans need to depend on public transport timetables .
I will get some information for you if you are interested in that .
Let me explain my reasons . When you drive your car , you can take it from your garage or outside the main door of your house and it gets you to wherever you want . But on the other hand , if you take public transport , it will be much more inconvenient because you have to catch the bus at a bus stop ... Where is your nearest bus stop ?
Then you have to take the subway to your destination , so that means a waste of time . On the other hand , it is cheaper , but what happens if you do n't have any coins to pay the bus driver ? Here comes the problem .
Obviously , you are late for work , even if you have an appointment to have an interview for a job .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
I would recommend this film because it is funny , entertaining and you can learn principles .
So I do not have the opportunity to practise English , because most of my colleagues speak French .
It is bewildering !
Yes , we can say that the car is much more convenient . But not every person can afford a car .
after that last point We can not go everywhere we would like using a car .
There are also limitations there .
That fact behind sense because the maintenance of public transport is not the responsibility of the traveler .
You can get there by metro ( Teatralnaya Station ) .
From Red Square , you can easily see the Moscow Kremlin , St. Basil 's Cathedral , the State Historical Museum and Gum Department Store .
If you are dying of hunger , you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at restaurant # 57 , which is on the third floor of Gum .
It 's the capital 's central park where you 'll find lots of interesting things .
There are lots of facilities , such as sports centre , a ping pong club , a hire centre etc .
So , if you want to have a memorable holiday , the capital of Russia is the most attractive place .
He likes playing with his mobile phone , playing basketball and reading books .
We did n't have a lot of money , but I went to a private elementary school .
I remember two contrasting moments . One day , we had to create a team to do an exercise which used the brain ; they chose me .
I was too fat , too much fat .. I looked at my health booklet one month ago , and I saw that I have been overweight since I was four years old .
Until sixth grade , I thought I was " normal " , but then everything changed .
People speak differently , but with a basic level , they understand English .
It is difficult to go to an unknown place with different people , but it is a good experience to learn .
Everyone could speak and understand each other .
Because of her suggestions , I learned how to control my temper while I was dealing with failures and kept telling myself that it was n't a big shame because I had tried my best .
Sometimes , I feel tired of walking , especially on sunny days with high temperatures , but that ca n't make me stop doing this sport .
I want to give advice to people who love this type of sport : please do not give it up , and do it as often as you can , because it 's a beneficial sport .
The ordinary result of the big effort I had made at my university to have a good job in my specialization , as a lawyer .
Your qualifications are not satisfactory . You must be UK Or USA educated .
But it will be very romantic to be with my girlfriend and fight the system .
We generally use the word " stress " when we feel that everything seems to have become too much - we are overloaded and wonder whether we really can cope with the pressures placed upon us .
We can change everything that harms us if we need to , if we have the will .
We must get rid of the stress quickly before we lose ourselves , because it 's very harmful . For example , you can read a book , do sport , play music , eat delicious food , remember all the positive things that have happened to you , talk with someone who you trust , get rid of everything that makes you upset and makes your life tiring , go out and eat a meal with your best friends , and there are a lot of things you can do ...
In my opinion , the main course needs improvement .
Firstly , I am a vegetarian and I do n't have much choice of vegetables .
Some people in my college are vegetarian , Muslim , vegan etc . and they do not have a lot of varieties of food to choose , from like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
Yours faithfully
I 'm writing to you regarding an advertisement I saw on my way home calling for candidates to fill a vacancy on your cafe staff .
For that reason , this job is perfectly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to improve my income , helping me to pay my bills .
I actually liked it quite a lot . I just loved all the suspense and the parts where they leave you hanging . It 's just really interesting . The movie is about the American government , who annually give 12 hours when all crimes , even murder , are legal , and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call " the purge " and anyone can join in . You can kill whoever you want .
The diagrams illustrate the process of producing bank notes .
At the beginning , bank notes should be well - designed , considering the colour matching and artwork , including issues relating to security .
After designing them , metal plates are prepared with the help of experienced machinists .
Most importantly , before distribution , printed sheets with 50 bank notes per sheet have to be checked to see whether they are of perfect quality or not .
They can only be packed and distributed if they are of good quality .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are separated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from getting into the market .
Many people believe that nowadays there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the thought that they do help , for example , with travelling long distances .
The ticket does n't cost too much and it is affordable for the majority of people , at least compared to buying a car .
Secondly , public transport is more efficient for travelling long distance than cars and people would n't have to purchase fuel .
When people need to travel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , which is a form of public transport , to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and complicated distances that have different landforms .
In addition , you have to share with people you absolutely do n't know and probably wo n't see again .
Consequently , you can be robbed or get sick .
But , by observing all these people , you can enrich yourself with the different cultures and manners the others have and incorporate new topics .
Public transport is useful but sometimes inconvenient and cheaper . You can get to know new people and different cultures .
After 4 hours sitting on an uncomfortable seat , we arrived at the train station and then my parents and I went to the hotel .
It will be more appropriate for us .
All villages have a bus stop where the bus stops to pick up or drop off passengers .
And some buses drive at night to transport passengers .
Without it , many people would have a lot of difficulty going somewhere or returning home .
However , there are some disadvantages with public transport . They cause many traffic jams . This is because the buses are large and difficult to control .
The bus will not drop off the passengers where they want to go , because they have to drop them off at the bus stop .
Day by day , the country is developing more and more . Nowadays , we have trains .
We met each other near Oxford Street , when I was going to a supermarket .
She went with me and we talk about everything !
She is a very interesting and wise person , but the best thing is her humor .
Nowadays , using public transport is considered to be the most convenient
It provides citizens with the freedom to relax and disconnect while going home or to work .
You also asked about the leisure activities in Spain .
For me , the most interesting one is sightseeing around the city and discovering its monuments and landmarks .
However , there is also an endless of leisure activities , such as going shopping or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks .
If that is not enough , you will be able to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to clubs or lounge bars .
In my town people are very educated and very aware of the environment , they know very well that if we take care of the environment then it will be useful for us only , so they are always careful about rubbish and try to clean the village .
D. Perhaps bilingual school creation might be a good idea for Colombian education improvement , but it would be appropriate to be aware that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education where English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast with the private ones .
It depends on five main steps , which include design , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Above all , the design is the most important step we should know , which involves considering the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinists .
And then we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most essential part comes . We need to inspect the quality of the sheets .
If it 's good , they go to packing and distribution , whereas the others should be destroyed as well .
In conclusion , the whole process is an unreversed schedule .
Nevertheless , in my opinion , the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti - developed society .
To begin with is design , we have to consider background colour , artwork , and security issues , and then we are supposed to prepare metal plates , using skilled machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheets of bank notes , are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . There are some requirements -- colour on both sides , special ink , slightly raised images .
The most important step is inspection . The printed sheets should be manually inspected .
Finally , if it is a good sheet , the procedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
Back in the 40 's , Cairo was considered as one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly city in the world , Even cleaner than Paris or other cities in Europe .
Nowadays , Cairo can be considered as one of the - if not the most - dirtiest cities in the world .
Rubbish is everywhere , people finish their food and throw empty bags in the streets instead of keeping it until they find a bin .
So , the ugly truth is , my country is n't clean and people do nothing towards rectifying this .
It is a fact that , on the one hand , you have the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays , but on the other hand , we are unable to manage this situation correctly .
Max and his family had been on their holidays for two weeks now . This year they had decided to do a safari as a new experience .
Unfortunately , Max was not as excited as his family ; he had never really been into animals .
He only enjoyed staying at the hotel watching television .
Today , for some reason , he had this feeling that something interesting was going to happend .
But suddenly he heard a noise , it was his mum . " Max where are you ? " she screamed . The lion disappeared in one second , running .
Not long ago , I won first prize in math competitions at school .
The presidential election will begin in Taiwan next year .
My goal is admission to National University .
Unfortunately , my previous studies were in Arabic .
there are many differences between old computers and the new ones .
For example , new computers are smaller in size than the old computers , they are also faster and more efficient , they have better resolution and a bigger memory to save files and other stuff like apps .
We have diversified harvest like in the rest of the world , not only in the houses but also in every public building .
For example , in our school there is the possibility to collect paper and plastic in different boxes .
In the last year , some politicians have decided to put our city in order . So , for example , they put again to place the roads .
So the environmental impact is very attractive .
There are n't boxes for rubbish in every condominium , and we do n't have the harvest of the dampness that is present in many other towns in Italy .
Another problem is that the citizens of Trieste do n't pay attention to the environmental problems of their city .
In other countries it would be impossible , because if someone wanted to do this , he 'd have a fine to pay .
I think it is important that , not only in the family , but also in school , we could raise a new generation sensitive to the ecological problems of the earth .
In this way , we would have the possibility to change .
I usually go two days a week but next month I am going to go three or four days a week because I hope to enter a local competition .
Jerry read the email and decided to go to the shopping centre immediately .
The man was professional and gave him useful pieces of advice .
I like skiing because it is a sport that I also did when I was small . I like high speeds and lower living at high altitudes and enjoying great landscapes .
I like climbing , but it is a sport that I have just started ... but I want to keep practising it and keep learning new things .
The issue of taking care of the environment is very topical in the modern world .
The amount of garbage is increasing at the same time as the number of humans is increasing .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to increasing consumption of energy , water and other resources .
Pollution of the ecosystems is increasing in these countries too , as a result .
Nowadays , our local government is making some decisions to improve the situation .
It is going to build several modern combustion plants , and some programmes for discrete rubbish collection are being implemented .
There are a lot of citizens movement except official activities .
These activities take place especially in spring and in autumn .
I hope that most of the big businesses , plants and stations will be taken outside of the city boundaries .
These days , transportation has become so crowded . We have a lot of cars in the streets .
if everybody knew that there is a punishment for what they do and nobody can escape from what he did , I guess we would have fewer traffic accidents .
The bank notes are designed carefully . Workers need to design their background colour and artwork .
A new pieces of bank notes is printed completely .
Good ones will be packaged and distributed . workers will cut them and deal with them carefully .
In Cádiz , in summer , there are a lot of opportunities to work .
Since I was seven years old I have been on my city 's basketball team , and I have no doubt that playing basketball is one of the things that I enjoy the most in my life .
I like basketball because , besides the benefit that it brings to your health and physical well - being , it is also a really good hobby .
You also get to meet a lot of people at tournaments or even at normal games .
Thanks for everything and I want my money back if I do not get my cpu .
Nowadays , people are becoming more independent , and more than this problem , society now needs to show others this independence and control of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the one hand , travelling by car can be an excellent way to get to where you want to go , without going on foot to find your bus stop and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , and you can avoid the crowds of people that are in the subway stations every morning to get in the line if you want to arrive at work on time .
On the other hand , public transport is the only resource some people have to get around , and more than excellent for the environment , it 's also a good way to avoid traffic and spending money on petrol , since it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is that using the car can be problematic in some situations , like if you go to a football game by car , you probably wo n't have a place to park it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transport be forgotten , since as well as providing the only way some people have to travel , cars are n't so convenient for some situations .
I think you should go to a large school in a town because there you can have more friends and you can do a lot of other things that you can not do in the countryside .
I really want to go to a big school in a town , because here in the countryside , I can not go out with my friends or go shopping with them .
In a town you can do everything fun .
You can go to the shopping mall , to the halfpipes , to the skate parks and you can do a lot of other cool things with your friends , but in the countryside you ca n't .
As we know , nowadays , everything is possible .
We have so many advantages that make our lives easier .
In general , people have the possibility to study in libraries or using computers .
Personally , I think studying on a computer is a better choice .
Studying using a computer offers you the possibility to be more relaxed when you do it .
If I were a student that usually studies in a library , I would definitely try studying on a computer .
If somebody says that there is no future for public transport , I mind immediately . Today there are too many vehicles on our streets .
People are thinking about a comfortable life instead of the environment and saving money .
Mainly , the environment will change .
I think they are our first friends and our first confidants .
I would like to understand the benefits of an MBA at IMD and how it would help me in my career .
Watching our national team 's games , I came to the conclusion that we have no need to check our heart condition .
The Brazil and Netherlands games were a real test of our health .
I appreciate your support .
According to the reality , a lot of young people are n't very communicated in their life .
Most teenagers ca n't understand that , and they think that the job of their parents is not difficult .
But most young people are not interested in this type of music .
That makes them happy and additionally makes loud .
Usually , they watch crime series because it 's very interesting and really mysterious .
Because it 's very comfortable .
In conclusion , the life of young people is not very easy .
Hi , my name is Adrian . I am 17 years old and I am a footballer . I was born to be a footballer .
I played so well that everyone congratulated me . But that 's not all . One of the best teams in the world wanted to take me on .
I definitely agree with that .
Already , in only 20 years , a lot of things have changed because of the technology .
And I think that it 's not technology that will change , but the people and their characters .
Unfortunately , for this generation , there wo n't be real relationships , all relationships will become virtual relationships .
The good news is the people who can take advantage of technology can save a lot of time because they might have a sophisticated robot that can help at home .
According to my experience , if we do n't exaggerate the way we use technology like the internet , phone , satellite .
In some people 's lives , the most important thing is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I think it is important to look good , but sometimes the latest fashion is not the best choice to feel happy and comfortable .
On the other hand , the personality is more important and determinative than an expensive dress . It is a fact .
In conclusion , my opinion is that the personality is more important than the clothes we wear , but everybody has her own life and the choice to decide what she wants .
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life ; whether it is public or private , transport takes the same priority in each person 's life from the very early days .
In the age before industrialisation came into existence , people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convenient .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global warming is one of the prime concerns of the earth .
And when we look at the modern technologies of transportation , it seems there is no future for public transport .
It is inevitably true that excessive use of public transport leads to higher levels of pollution .
So , it would be better to go for any other alternative of green technology for future use to make this world a better place .
Yesterday , I had a wonderful day . In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training session with a Spanish selection coach . When I finished I went with my parents to a hotel to eat and spend time with some friends . After the food . we met up with friends of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode on a roller coaster , it was very exciting , and we ate a chocolate ice cream . It was delicious . In the evening , we went to a Spanish basketball league game , Obradoiro versus Real Madrid , and that match beat the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep .
When I find myself in London , I 'll go to Buckingham Palace , which is located in the City of Westminster and I 'll visit your art gallery and tourist attractions of the British monarchy .
Continuing my visit to London , I will visit the largest park in London , Hyde Park , which has a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for the preservation of the park .
Later , I 'll take the London Underground , which is a public fast transit system . I 'll travel on it .
When I leave the underground at Wembley Park station , I will go to Wembley Stadium , where I will enjoy an evening of football . The match starts at 8:00pm .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in classes , but it is also related to the quality of education in schools .
Education plays a crucial role in society and its future and by improving the standard of the education system , students can learn more effectively throughout their entire educational life and their career , but also their skills will be improved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , students can not get enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries .
On the other hand , by building a more effective learning system which will be provided by local authorities , students will be encouraged to learn more efficiently .
Lack of teaching methods , poor audience of the class , insufficient quantity of learning materials , for instance , all of these matters should be enhanced until good quality has been set up in the system .
Besides , by employing these kinds of procedures , students will also gain more respect towards their studies and their jobs .
It is true that coeducation can motivate students while they work with other sex students , we ought to also bear in mind , this is not the only solution to get the best result .
It is concluded that these kinds of developments will be put into action for all schools shortly .
I will start by introducing my favorite family members .
We have a good relationship , she is my best friend .
I appreciate him a lot , because he stayed with me and my sister and his life changed completely .
He invested in our education and today he has a lot of admiration for our lives and our decisions .
We keep in regular contact , we go out to dinner or have a coffee frequently .
How are you ? Hope everything 's fine .
Everything here is great .
It 'll be the second time I 've visited the UK , and I do n't want to do the same excursions , so would you mind telling me some good activities to do or some places to visit there ?
Our world is very polluted by public transport so we think about what will happen in the future . Public transport causes many problems in our environment , such as difficulty getting to the nearest destination , pollution , and disease .
We must think of alternative solutions to this problem .
We face difficulty reaching our own destination .
Nowadays , there are some vehicles that run on electricity . We can decrease pollution by using electricity .
In addition , crowded buses cause infections among people .
private cars reduce infections .
Finally , we hope for a healthy future for our future generations . We want to reach our destination on time and live a safe life without diseases and pollution .
My favourite sport is volleyball . I have been playing it since 2006 . My favourite position is number 2 . I usually play it in the faculty of engineering ? . It makes me fit and tall .
We won 1st place and got the cup . If anyone intends to play this game , he should practise hard to be able to play it professionally .
I am looking for an organizational development course .
Could you put in me contact with any of your customers for more information ?
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father taught me what football was , and I loved it , but , I really liked the goalkeepers . Why have I liked football since my childhood ?
I think football gives you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy football because it is a way to forget problems and enjoy yourself a bit , because when you are playing football , you are n't thinking about other stuff , you only concentrate on the game .
Football is a sport where anything can happen . the best teams do n't always win and it is unpredictable . There is n't a dream team .
Football is a good way to do exercise because it is interesting and fun .
The most important invention is the mobile , because you can do whatever you want with only one communication device .
Not only do children have one , grandparents have one too .
You can do a lot of things using your mobile , like call someone , text , take photos , listen to music , watch movies , play games , be woken up ( alarm clock ) , access the internet , check your e - mails , pay your bills , access social media , learn how to cook ... there are many more unimaginable things we can do .
And one consequence of this is that they have health problems .
In the future , we will probably be able to do almost everything using a mobile , but we must pay attention to how this affects our lives .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earnings allocation within regular families in two different years ( 2000 and 2010 ) .
Overall , in both years , the amount of earnings allocation was predominantly for housing , then followed by food / clothes .
There was a significant rise in the amount of budget allocated to both categories ( housing and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
Regarding the pie charts , there was a significant increase in the amount of earnings allocated to housing and food / clothes , from about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 , respectively .
However , the allocation of household budget for misc , which was the lowest compared with other categories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , fell by 10% in 2010 from around 15% to approximately 5% .
Furthermore , there was a slight decrease in vacations / leisure allocation from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010 .
Governments haven't been giving good ideas to improve public transport .
Consequently , people prefer to travel in their own car .
The first is , the government could create a new plan of construction for trains .
As a result , we could have more comfortable public transport .
In my opinion , public transport could have a future if we all collaborate to improve it .
Some people would suggest that learning new languages before secondary school discourages students ' usual learning and that their understanding of other subjects would suffer .
However , I personally believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages .
Confronting challenges . Primary students struggle with the difference between first language and the one they are learning .
Nonetheless , I would contend that learning foreign languages at primary school brings countless benefits for children .
Not only is there less study burden when compared with secondary school , but they are able to communicate with foreigners as well as extend their social network during this period and in later life .
Rather than being concerned about the challenges , children would deal with them . It is particularly advantageous for them to grasp foreign languages during elementary school .
By way of conclusion , I once again reaffirm my position that the advantages of learning foreign languages at primary school far outweigh the drawbacks .
Given that those children would have better development in the future , as well as more free time .
In my opinion , people 's lives will change dramatically in 50 years or so , because the world is changing all the time , and we have a lot of technology and things to do .
To sum up , I think it is inevitable .
He knew that she was inside , waiting for the last conversation about the life of Rose .
For this reason , we left with our new friend for Marseilles , where there was less traffic .
My mum says that I do n't eat fruits and vegetables , so I will eat more fruits and vegetables .
One of my favorite books is The Power of Your Subconscious mind .
Letter written to report on the awful environmental situation in my city !
So my proposition is to post some informative letters and posters around the city , and give bigger punishments for littering ! Also , the government should increase the number of rubbish bins and facility staff members .

Public transport is very inconvenient .
It takes you a very long time to get to your destination .
If you have a car you can get to your destination in a short time .
Our town takes care of the environment of our neighbourhood very seriously .
At these sites there are different kinds of containers for all sorts of rubbish which you can collect at home .
Like glass , plastic or paper containers .
The centre of our town , where the supermarket is , does also have a site for dumping your rubbish .
In the supermarket , you can find a container for batteries .
Not only the supermarket has these containers . They are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion , this gives a good example of the involvement of the local government .
This makes our neighbourhood a pleasant place to be .
Finally , I can say that they not only put containers for all your rubbish , but even special containers in the parks for the dogs ' ' pooh ' .
Studying overseas means not only changing conditions , but also facing many sorts of unknown pressure .
It is not easy to adapt to a new learning environment ; the language is the biggest difficulty .
Students have to do assignments in another language and use a different way of thinking .
The culture shock is what international students need to overcome .
Lastly , the problem is from students themselves .
They have left their comfort zone , and everything is fresh .
Besides , attempting open mind .
Getting along with international friends is a great way to expand your horizons .
We always go to the beach , which is very nice , and when it 's sunny and warm it is better than the Mediterranean .
I do n't know what I 'm proud of , but when I score a nice goal , I am proud because it feels good , especially when it 's an important goal that maybe will change the game .
I asked my parents and they said ambitious , curious and considerate .
My favourite restaurant must have good meat and be really nice .
Subject : Shopping facilities
Report on the shopping facilities in Katowice
Introduction
The aim of this report is to describe and assess shops which could be interesting for tourists .
Fortunately , visitors will find all of that in the Tourist Information Office and in shops on the outskirts .
Watching football is also a wonderful experience .
My favorite international league is the English premier league .
The environment is an important part of our life , contributing in a positive way to our part of life without even concern about important parts for us to survive .
Humans can easily damage the environment just by throwing their waste away without recycling or ruining the places where animals live .
Deforestation can damage the cycle of nature .
I notice that , in supermarkets , they use so much plastic just to cover a small thing or use a lot of plastic bags without even thinking about how harmful this is to the environment .
I lived for a short time in a place where the word " recycle " was completely unknown , but they used to do it because they were n't so rich .
Where I live now , I have noticed that we have the opportunity to recycle waste because it is a posh area .
In my opinion , the government should take care of all areas , whether an area is rich or poor .
Pollution has a negative effect on the environment . I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban areas .
To keep all of nature alive , we must contribute everyone of us for future generations .
Travelling by car is more comfortable than public transport , easier and faster .
The aim today is to provide you with a description of my best friend .
Moving on to the physical description , I want to say that Kike is a really tall man ; his height is 1.95 meters .
He has a strong voice that , with his appearance , makes him look impressive .
Concerning his personality , he is very friendly , generous , optimistic , playful and sensitive .
So , he is hard - working . He is a lawyer and always helps me with all my professional problems .
every evening , he takes the bike and rides along some paths for more than forty kilometers per day , so he is a very good cyclist and it 's quite hard to cycle with him .
I met her at university 20 years ago . She is 4 years younger than me .
She is very kind , sensitive and quiet . She also has an attractive personality and a big heart , but she is very nervous .
Young people are most interested in fashion and computer games .
Teenagers are interested in music too .
People who are in fan clubs are interested in touring with their idols .
At this age , people like being better than their friends and they like to distinguish themselves .
I am writing to apply for the job you advertised .
I have already worked in summer camps in France and in Italy with children aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
Moreover , I am willing to help organize sports or evening activities .
Last night , I went to a restaurant with my family .
l love the place , and the nice decoration of the restaurant .
This report is about how my city takes care of the environment .
However , a few years ago , the government has paid more attention to the environment of our country . For example , they did a lot of advertising on television , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not good for our world .
In the future , we must make an effort to improve our environment because we will want to give the same world or , if it is possible , a better world than before to our children .
Nobody can deny that transportation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can live without transportation as it 's the real means of connection with each other .
Cars are much more convenient , but this does not mean that all other means of transportation are not important .
Other people prefer to travel by train as it 's faster and more comfortable than cars .
Many people like to travel by bike in order to decrease the pollution which is caused by car exhaust . From my point of view , I prefer travelling by car , which is more comfortable .
Now in every country we have a lot of means of transport , such as planes , trains , undergrounds , cars , ships , and rockets .
Public transportation is the main way to deliver people everywhere in a short time . In the past , they had to use camels to travel , which wasted a lot of time and caused tiredness .
Everybody thinks public transport is not comfortable for us , but environmentally , public transport is good for decreasing pollution and our energy sources are also decreasing .
The castle 's architecture is in the Neo - Gothic style .
It was built as a foundation of King Casimir the Great .
This museum has monuments of the superiority .
In my opinion , it 's one of the most fascinating places in Poland and the most wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everyone should visit this castle .
The restaurant that I will talk is Woody Pool .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because there are always people laughing and talking about funny things .
The food in this restaurant is very good and has a larger than normal size because it is much bigger than the usual food .
The famous dish of this restaurant is a huge hamburger .
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the call meet there because , like I said before , the atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my opinion , public transport will become more and more important in the future . Travelling by car may be convenient , but it also brings air pollution and traffic jams .
If there were only cars in a city , the city would n't have enough parking spaces and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get to their destinations .
Public transport will have a bright future ; in contrast , travelling by car will vanish from our lives .
My favorite way of travelling is by train .
So , train is an intermidiate way to travel .
I started leading trener in the competition and I love this sport .
My favourite boxer is Floyd Mayweather .
I think is a better idea that people use public transportation instead of using private cars or motorcycles .
Accordingly , people do not have to spend lots of money on the gas that they have to fill the tank with .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to reduce congestion and air pollution by encouraging people to use private cars less and turn to using more public transportation and other forms for transportation .
It was a cold night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on telly , called " Dare to Win " . I was with my brother when we decided to call . The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answered in time , and there are different things for the winner .
A few minutes later , we were listening to ourselves on the programme . We were so nervous , but it was exciting for us . Our goal on the programme was to get a free ticket to the most popular electronic party in the world .
I am writing to apply for the job in the USA published in an advertisement last Monday .
In order to help organise sports and evening activities , I am a young person of 12 years old .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities , private cars are more attractive for most people .
Some people say that a trip by car is more convenient than by public transport , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that when travelling to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , because of the ease of having your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time taking cabs .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reason is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . Comfort is a really important reason , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .
In conclusion , for me , it is a lie that public transport has no future . However , they have to make improvements to this , like the use of better types of fuel or energy . One way is using renewable sources of energy , such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hydraulic(water),Also , there are biodiesel and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
My brother lives in Barcelona with his girlfriend and he is very happy with her .
Nowadays , it is possible to find any kind of TV programme you want and , yes , I consider that there is a lot of sport on television , but not too much .
When somebody gets home , he wants only to relax in front of the television .
Besides this , TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxing moment , mainly for men .
So they put on more and more sports programmes on television .
In this view , I think that though there are lots of sports on television , there are not too many , because people have looke for it .
In conclusion , I think that TV companies only want to sell their product and the people want to have their relaxing moment with the sports programmes .
Last summer , we went to Córdoba to attend a very important dance competition ...
When the day came , we performed an amazing choreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
We really enjoyed this experience , just because we shared it as friends and we took dance lessons with the most professional and prestigious dance teachers in the world .
I agree with the statement that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next years , for previsible reasons that I will explain in the following text .
Firstly , the biggest reason that people 's lives will dramatically change in the future is because of technology .
Technology is increasing throughout the world .
New technology has improve systems in many areas of society , mainly in information systems .
Information via the Internet had beem more quickly each day and it is reaching all parts of the world .
Furthermore , things and processes are evolving .
People 's lives are getting easier and more comfortable .
However , the advancement of technology , besides bringing advantages for everyone , will also cause disadvantages , such as unemployment , because machines will do the same work or work better than humans .
That 's why I agree that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
USA Summer Camp , I am interested in he vacancy at the summer camp .
I am accustomed to working with children because the last two summers I worked in summer camps and I have two little sisters that I love and who I spend a lot of time taking care of .
I am a hardworking and committed person in all respects .
For example , I learned about organization , how to control big groups of children , and entertaining activities for children .
I hope you are interested in my application .
As we know , the privilege of having a journey by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We can visit every place with no time limitations .
It made me feel like happiness was running throughout my body .
My teacher said that public transport has no future in our society , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . Nevertheless , I disagree with her opinion because if we use public transport we will pollute less .
No one can deny the importance of travelling .
Without travelling , people would be very bored , life would be very monotonous .
So , in the future we will dispense with types of transportation .
We visited many cities , like Taormina , Siracusa , Agrigento , Marsala and Trapani , and we saw a lot of historical Greek monuments .
That day , we had a great time and it was sunny and hot . I took a lot of photos and I learned new information about those important buildings .
People are interested in everything unknown , mysterious and incredible .
They look for new experiences .
Nowadays , a very popular topic among teenagers is the existence of extra - terrestrials .
In addition , more and more scientists agree that aliens really exist .
He is an important person because he is the president of the government in Spain .
He studied a degree in law at university .
When Aznar was president of the government before him , he was like a minister .
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago . This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I do n't want to be weak . I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule : the strong dominate the weak . When I step foot in the gym , I forget everything : school , home ... . Therefore , I enjoy it .
I just got the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell anyone just starting this sport to use their abilities and skills for the right things .
A few minutes later , some boy who looked older than my old brother approached the poor little boy . The little boy stopped crying , he My brother felt afraid because they looked like rube , but but he still wanted to help the little boy .
The little boy more and more sadly , tears rolled down from his eyes . My brother felt sorry for him . He gave the little boy his smartphone and put on some good music . The little boy stopped crying and started to smiled .
The surgery was successful .
It is very important because this was a city and a very important ceremonial center .
If you ask someone about the future , the answers will be different , but all will be around two main topics , they will be either optimistic the about future or pessimistic about the future .
Not because I am a pessimist but due to several factors and conditions . Allow me to explain my opinion .
It is true that every day we have new innovations which help people and make their lives easier .
But from life 's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human beings is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life .
To illustrate .
There is a categorisation of countries ; there are developed countries , emerging ones and countries on the way to development .
Who classified those countries like this ?
These questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for a convenient answer .
In addition , a general view of human innovation shows that the majority of people 's creations have a bad effect . This effect exists even in people 's lives or in themselves .
And unfortunately , this bad impact exists in almost all areas of life .
Therefore , The aforementioned information above shows that our future could be worse than our present .
To summarize , people 's lives see fast change and development , but generally , this evolution affects people .
We must stop all wars , conflicts , and impose human principles and values .
The restaurant I 'm going to review is called Tintos y Rubias and is located in downtown Montevideo .
It specializes in barbecue , beers and wines .
The restaurant has a rustic design and it has outdoor tables .
The service provided by the restaurant is exceptional . For example , the waiting time is very short .
In terms of food quality , the standard is extraordinary . They are well known for their roast meat .
We can produce electricity by creating wind wheels and water wheels .
There is a hotly debated issue relating to whether students should take at least one year to work or travel before they go to university .
And the topic of people 's views can be approached from different angles due to its complexity .
After carefully considering this issue , I also develop my own points of view .
I favor the former statement . That is , I think students should have a gap year before they go to university , based on n1 , n2 .
Thus , people could spend their free time travelling and having a good time .
Although traveling by car is really interesting , using public transport still has its advantages . By using public transport you 're saving effort . When driving a car for a long distance , you will get tired . Some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
Furthermore , your abuse of the cat has violated not only ethics but also the law .
As long as you are determined , you will be able to become a good master .
Design is the first stage , which includes three parts : background , artwork and security issues .
After the preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists , they take sheets of bank notes . There are three requirements for this : colour on both sides , special ink and images that are slightly raised .
The most important step is inspection : printed sheets are manually inspected .
Because I really love to work with people of all ages , and I would like to have this post and I 'm an energetic and hardworking person .
Therefore , looking after children aged 8 - 12 years is n't an easy task , but as a father or parent you must always give them good care in terms of your responsibilities .
There is no future for public transport . That is true , but I think that people are very comfortable and do n't think about the environment .
Secondly , you can drive your car everywhere . It does n't matter what time it is or where you would like to go . Travelling by car is much more convenient and comfortable than travelling by bus , by subway or by train .
These aspects or advantages are all that I can say about this topic .
My name is Anna . I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality , so I enjoy planning activities or organising sport events in a special and colorful way .
I really love children and taking care of them . I also have experience of working in summer camps and had a good experience making delicious food because I already did these things in other camps .
I chose this invention that I think helped humanity to communicate more easily .
After that , with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users

The environment is a combination of the air , earth , water and forest and all these things are interlinked with each other .
Most importantly , all species of animals and human beings are a part of this ecosystem .
The human being is the most wise and intelligent of all of these .
However , he is mainly responsible for disturbing this ecosystem through various activities .
Let 's talk about one of them , which is ' cleanliness ' . Nowadays , we all know that we are spreading garbage near our houses and offices .
This may be due to people not being aware of the consequences of this bad habit - spreading the rubbish .
But , these days , with education , people are becoming more sensitive and responsible towards the environment .
Along the same lines , inhabitants of my village do lots of work to make their area clean and hygienic .
They collect and segregate the rubbish into separate containers .
For example , they collect plastic waste in a yellow dustbin , while liquid and solid , degradable waste goes in a red container .
This makes it easy and convenient to identify the waste types .
To conclude , I would like to say that , nowadays , people are becoming more aware and environment - conscious through education .
Today in my class there was a discussion on television and education .
Television is an object that helps people to know the news in real time .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause a dependence , cartoons and " stupid " programs can harm young people most .
Today , there are many children that have a dependence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children 's TV programs , while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends .
Television can be a useful instrument if it is used with caution . Therefore , I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind .
I reduce the use of unnecesary power at home . In other words , I turn on a light that I need while I use it ; I take cooler showers ; I heat only the necessary rooms .
Recycling is another way to be ecological .
Today , we have more items to recycle as long as we clean them properly and put them in the proper bin , which will be used by specialized factories to make them into other items .
As long as I try to keep doing things in an eco - friendly way , I realize that I am giving a little from my side and I feel I am caring for my environment .
I am going to Spain to visit my grandparents .Then I am going to Paris to look forward my aunt .
In my opinion , it is a good idea to spend some time travelling , because you will have an opportunity to think about your future , but in my city , because of the crisis , there is very little work for anyone .
You have to come here because Holy Week in Linares is nice and the show is spectacular and if you want to have fun , I like the bulls .
I agree with this affirmation because public transport is more expensive than a car , is slow and is less economical .
A car is less expensive , more comfortable , faster and safer .
In my opinion , the car is more advantageous than the car and the car is more useful .
First of all , travelling by car is very expensive .
For example , travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faster .
Secondly , it 's not comfortable , because you drive every day instead of relaxing and enjoying the environment .
Using public transport has certain advantages and also , disadvantages .
Public transport has plenty of advantages .
Some people ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay for petrol , as the price is constantly rising , so using public transport is an economical way to travel .
The reason is they are tired of using public transport and they would get everywhere faster .
The picture illustrate the process of making notes .
It is the first step that costs troublesome , some . Some things must be included in the considerations , such as background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needed .
Printing is the next step . Usually , sheets of bank notes are printed , because there are some special requirements for the printing ; colour of both sides , special ink , images slightly raised .
The last step is the inspection . Sheets are manually inspected .
The inspection always has three results : the good quality sheets , the bad sheets and the partially damaged sheets .
If the printed sheets are good quality , they will be packed and distributed . Some partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate or packed or dispatched . The bad sheets will be disposed on . The destruction will be secure .
Television is one of the most important AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to your needs . There are a lot of channels playing many roles . For instance , education , movies , songs , sports , news and so on . Television is not only for entertainment , but also for education . Television can entertain you through it s entertainment channels , and television can educate you through it s educational channels .
In this day and age , most people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation .
It is also convenient for people who are rushing to work , meetings and so on .
Public transport is cheap and friendly to the environment .
They can use the money in a more useful or meaningful way , such as for investment in property .
Public transport is a way to reduce air pollution , because it can carry more than a dozen times the people at a time and reduce the number of people travelling in their own vehicle .
Although public transport is slow , it also does not take a long time for people to reach their destination , because public transport nowadays is faster and enough .
In conclusion , public transport is needed by everybody in a necessary time .
It can always make us save money and make the environment more natural and fresh .
Some kinds of animals will move to the urban areas , steal food from us and sleep on the streets or in the underground .
On the other hand , the expansion of a city increases pollution and all kinds of garbage . The air pollution is much more serious now , and seeing blue sky is almost impossible in some big cities .
Although the medical skills are getting better , the percentage of people who get cancer is still increasing .
In conclusion , large - scale building projects take the living resources from animals , increase the possibility of getting cancer , and so on .
Only if the government develop more technical property , pay , pay more attention to environmental protection , such as planting more trees and grass in the cities , and bringing in a special law for those missed animals will we help decrease the harm that building projects do to us .
I also have experience with teenagers through my sisters and I will look after them as I take care of my sisters .

But if you land early in the morning , the most convenient and fast transport is taxi , which does n't cost much to my house .
In the spring there is mild weather , approximately 20 - 25 degrees .
There is the possibility of rain .
So you can bring light and waterproof clothes .
You can only get to ' A Fervenza ' by walking or riding a bike , but it is impossible to get there by any other ways .
It is an incredible forest , the ground is covered in low grass and there is a little river where you can swim . It is the perfect place to have a quiet day .
My favourite sport is volleyball .
This sport can help your health and anyone can learn to play volleyball .
In Italy , volleyball is very common , especially in my region .

The accomplishment I am the most proud of was when I scored four goals in a soccer game .
I think people will be surprised to know that I was born in 2002 and not 2001 , but I was born the on first of October , so there 's not so much difference .
My favorite movie is " The fault in our Stars " , because it 's very good and I really like the characters and the story .
They were spending the weekend in the countryside . He had rented a cabin but he had n't checked the weather , and a strong blizzard arrived leaving them without communication by phone or by car .
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to eradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays .
ADVANTAGES
On the other hand , we help to improve and clear up the environment if we throw away the rubbish in the green points of the town .
MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
This project is focused on separating the rubbish at green points of the city and they also have to keep the neighbourhood as as as is possible .
CONCLUSION
To sum up , taking care of the environment should be an obligatory task for us .
The main reason for this is , provided that we bear in mind that we must collaborate with all arounds , we will keep the world on our hands .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps . I have looked after children aged 5 - 10 and it was a fantastic experience . I have worked at a school in North Africa as a volunteer and learnt a lot about children . I think that I 'm a suitable person for the job because I am an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking , I love working with children and I like organising different types of activities . I 'm not very good at cooking , but I can learn very fast .
Combating the destruction of the environment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constructed .
There is no denying that the environment is changed by the behavior of people and animals .
Another factor is that the animals do not control themselves and eat the plants leading to the destruction of the ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation has become more perfect , and the people 's lives have become more convenient .
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions . In today 's world , there are lots of construction companies and factories are not admission , they are destroying the forest , farmland and wetland , discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas . It leads to a serious environmental problem .
So the government should oversee these companies , and if companies do not obey the rules or laws , they should be fined and closed down .
Second , the government should publicize the awareness of protection
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work , as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expenses we encounter .
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars , reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environment .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women have died because of this .
1- Inflation in the population ; the roads will not be able to bear or endure huge numbers of cars .
4- Transport will be more economical than private cars .
6- Not everyone has the possibility to buy a car .
They should immerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active . for instance , it 's advised to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
My favorite sports are football , basketball , Formula One and Tennis .
Basketball is my second favourite sport .
My congratulations .
Sports are very beneficial for our health .
I like to play football because it 's a very exciting game . It takes only 90 minutes . Whenever I get the opportunity , I play football .
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which means bullet train , is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " , which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortably on the train .
Thus , not only to ride but also to watch trains is very interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable compared to planes .
Travelling by train is cheep and getting a ticket is easy for us in our country .
A plane which was travelling from Egypt to Russia was exploded by terrorists last month .
Compared to the plane , the train is relatively safe because it can only move on the land .
I prefer to watch films at the cinema because there are n't any distractions or noises and the quality of films is better .
There are several efforts that we can make in order to save the environment .
Plastics are non - biodegradable materials which decompose after 1000 years .
Non - biodegradable plastics could actually pile up in the landfill and cause the land on our earth to be occupied .
This causes their reproductive systems to be destroyed .
Hence , we should bring our own recycling bag or basket every time we go shopping and resist the temptation to get plastic from the shops .
In addition , we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emissions into the environment .
If the distance to the destination is short , we could replace driving with walking or cycling .
That 's the decent way to reduce the adverse environmental impact and we will be able to protect our Earth .
Since GM crop technology started to be implemented it has implied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
This technique makes weed control easier , resulting in cost savings and yield gains , leading to increased global production of crops such as corn , cotton , canola and soybeans .
There was also a cup in it . It said " do n't give up on your dream , keep going!go!we stand by you ! come on "
My name is Anna . I am one of many new students at Ton Duv Thang university .
I 'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a dormitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
I love Ton Duc Thang university so much .
These days people care about privacy and hence a personal car not only provides privacy but also convenience .
So the need for buses has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time - consuming .
We can see the future of transportation by comparing the numbers of cars and buses .
So I think the future of public transportation is gloomy .
Its very interesting sport .
In India , cricket is worshipped and players are lord .
I was very interested in making my career through this , but due to my studies , I ca n't make an effort toward this goal .
When I stay with you I would like to go to a Spanish restaurant .
Now I have lived in Badajoz for ten years . We moved here to go to the beach every day . I like the beach and the sun , especially in summer when the sun is in the sky .
I like dancing and singing too . I 'm very happy singing on the beach , especially if you are with me .
As time goes by , technology is rapidly improving .
More and more gadgets are invented , such as televisions , smartphones and so on .
There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly .
Using will not only get entertainment but also acquire knowledge .
It is a good time to turn to the entertaining programs , when we feel bored and gaze at the wall all day .
Television provides a variety of educational channels as well .
We . We can learn how the different animals feed themselves .
Above The above statements can ensure a rich and abundant life .
There wo n't be supermarkets .
I hope that in the future we will live peacefully and happily .
Hi , I am Amy . I would like to spend two months studying in England , two months doing volunteering in a children 's charity and the last two months travelling in the UK . What do you think of my plan ? I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to getting along with children .
I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me . it will be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip .
I usually run in the morning , when my roommates are still sleeping . I get up and run in the playground .
I started running because I suffered from neck pain and my left leg was not comfortable when I sat all day .
Furthermore , I wanted to reduce my weight as well .
If you want to start running , first , you need comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , to make a plan , like how long should I run today . Remember , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't set a goal that you ca n't achieve , or you will lose your confidence soon .
But now people are destroying it .
Besides , some people destroy farmland to build houses , but if one day there is no farmland , then what should we eat ? Nothing at that time . We could n't eat anything!So what should we do ?
The lecturer disagrees with the paragraph suggesting that the mentioned test developed by Alan Turing does not answer the main question : Can a computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " , who proposed a challenge to prove that Turing 's test was not conclusive , and that he created a paradox .
He selected people to go into a Chinese room . There was a computer in the Chinese language with different symbols . The Americans showed different behavior . They did not understand what was on the computer screen .
This was different to the original test mentioned in the text , where all the participants were American and native speakers of that language . It was really easy to understand what was on the computer screen .
For example , for young people in college , their studies are more important , as well as books , seminars , travelling , etc .
I agree , for many people , travelling by car is much more convenient . However , in my opinion , there is still a long future for public transport .
My grandmother is going to visit me in July , so I would prefer to see you in August .
Science , I just remember I have always liked motor racing , but one of my favourites is Formula 1 .
Michael is one of the most important economists in the world . He has written a lot of books about the economy and finance in the USA and Europe .
He decided to write a short essay about capital market abuse , so he considered travelling to Italy and picking up some financial data from the Italian central bank .
The key idea of this essay was the following : Italy in the time of Berlusconi almost went bankrupt , but Michael is trying to prevent the Italian economy condition simply because he likes Berlusconi too much .
He received a lot of criticism simply because many economists and econometricians in the world do not trust the source that he used in his essay . Moreover , they thought that he received money from the Italian government .
Two years after his essay was released , he would understand that his essay was wrong . Moreover , Michael would want to apologise to many people who read his essay , so , Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , and goes to bed . Thus , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
One day , a man and his wife were trying to find a place that was shallow and without pollution to cultivate . They were poor ; they did n't have the necessary resources , but the husband worked so hard because his wife had had an accident . It happened one day that his wife was working on a campaign for the conservation of endangered animals . She went to a place in search of animals . She heard a sound in a dark place in the jungle , so she went to investigate what that was . A creature that had never been seen attacked her . Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy , the wife of the man , on the floor . They asked her if she was OK , but she did n't answer , so her partner took her to the doctor . There , the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1 , 000 dollars for an operation .
One day , the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game , he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewel that had belonged to generations of gods . So he started throwing that for fun . One time that he took the jewel , it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewel emit some sounds that only giants could hear , so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes , so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .
It is very easy to spend hours being entertained by television .
I have learned a lot from television .
There are excellent examples of good quality television on the BBC .
What 's more , there are countries around the world that lack teachers to go to remote areas to teach that rely on television to teach .
I am writing to suggest a few things that our college can do for the environment .
In order to reduce energy consumption , we should arrange things so that , as much as possible , lectures take place in the daytime .
In order to improve the sorting , there should be litter bins for each of the mentioned materials in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the students and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the students should be taught about the environment .

Hongdae is most appropriate to feel a free and vibrant local area in Seoul .
There are a lot of clubs , pubs and bars , cafes , and karaoke , bars and it has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .
. You can experience 19th century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional customs .
Have you ever been mountain climbing ? That is incredible and amazing . Do you like your school ? your city ?
In conclusion , before I read the article I had never realized the importance of using drama in an English class .
For sure , I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives students the opportunity of not just learning something in the classroom . More than that , it is the opportunity to use their knowledge in educational and social life .
With reference to the recent advertisement about ' USA CAMP SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position in the camp .
I am a hardworking person and a fun girl .
Recently , I worked babysitting for one year at a school .
I like doing activities with them and I feed them .
I think I am a suitable candidate for this job , because I like children and I have experience of babysitting . Also , I work very well at making food .
I will wait a for phone call from you to discuss the possibility of arranging an interview .
I choose the wheel because it is the most useful invention ever because , thanks to it , human work is made easier , for example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today . The wheel was invented at a relatively late point in human history ; the oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .
The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland , indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land .
( Taken from http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-technology/revolutionary-invention-wheel-001713 )
Added to what I know , that makes it attractive .
Apart from strange cases , who does n't want to try the authentic German beer , or the Frankfurter sausages in the place where they were invented ?
In conclusion , members of your family play an important role in your life !
In the last edition of Pur Plus , there was an important discussion about the next plan for cities .
It was presented by a politician , an economist and two environmentalists .
The result will be the pollution of the environment .
So , we will stop traffic jams and as a consequence the environmental problems .
But we should not forget , that these options do not alloy the environment .
Introduction
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because they could get into trouble with the law , they could cause harm to themselves and others and could have a higher risk of alcohol dependency later in their lives .
This is an interesting question because I believe that my family are my best friends , but at the same time , they are not my friends .
The two maps show the changes which took place in the town of Shipsmouth between 1995 and 2010 .
First of all , in 1995 , Shipsmouth was a green residential city with two forests .
Squash can also be played individually , as two players together , or in a team of 4 players . squash is one of the very nice attractive sports .
I have practised swimming for 3 years . I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments .
I want to compete in the United States in the most important tournament . The best swimmers in the world participate in this competition .
Some swimmers are Michael Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Peter Van de Hoogenband and others .
Although public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly , it is not as flexible or comfortable as the car .
In the diagrams below , the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
In the first step , the bank notes have to be designed considering some , like background color , artwork and security issues . After the design has been prepared , skilled machinists prepare metal plates in the second step .
It is the most important step during the whole processing .
And then , some sheets and good bank notes from damaged sheets which are cut into individual bank notes and separated into equal ones and packed and despatched to where they are needed .
Other ones , which are bad sheets and bad bank notes , which are damaged apparently , are destroyed securely .
The most healthy sports are swimming , playing basketball , playing football or running , but I prefer to play tennis .
I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills , concentration and speed .
They will have to concentrate on the game and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing whether or not we agree with the often enormous salaries of football players .
For me , as a passionate soccer player , it is a good point to consider .
For instance Christiano Ronaldo .
He does not chase after the ball , does not fight enough to keep it . If he really needed the money , he would behave totally differently .
What influences do these salaries have on the clubs is quite simple .
For example , the restaurant business and the technology industry are totally different in Taiwan .
That is why many businessmen want to win this competition , so they have created so many special offers , like if you go to places , you can buy one get one free .
Apparently , the restaurant business is creative and marketing - oriented in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are two different types of company in the technology industry .
One is original equipment manufacturers , like Foxconn . Workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executives at Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung .
The other one is original brand manufacturers , like htc . They produce a lot of new smartphones and sell them .
So , htc has become more energetic and bold in making innovation .
Finally , Taiwan is still suffering an economic slump , but we have so many businesses that like to innovate and market their products , and customers like to buy them .
One evening , it was a blisteringly hot day but I still had to attend one of my friends ' wedding ceremony .
Consequently , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking for my friend , the bride .
It was ridiculous that I did n't have a girlfriend .
However , I still did n't have a girlfriend .
I was overwhelmed with grief .
I could not stand looking at them , celebrating .
I fell asleep immediately .
I 'm Patricia Agüero . I have seen the advertisement for work in your cafe and I 'm very interested , because I need work to pay for my studies .
Also , I 'm used to working long hours . As a matter of fact , in the holidays I have worked in many restaurants .
It 's a kind of socializing .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have travelled all over the world and during this experience , I have seen the necessity of work to finance my journey , so then I have dedicated myself to working on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience of this .
I have other qualities like , cooking like a super chef or even better than that . I am the most organized person in this country , and I love to work with children because it is a way to teach everything you know to other people and help them to improve as a person .
So , in conclusion , I think that if you contract me , you will get an excellent person and an excellent worker .
I think it is true that there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion , public transport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car , because a car is faster than public transport .
Public transport stops more times than a car , whereas a car goes direct to its destination .
I believe that people in the future will begin to travel in shared cars more often and they will use less public transport , like the train , the bus , the underground , etc .
Positive things about online learning are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do n't have to carry so much paper with you . Also , you 're on your own and at your own learning speed , which makes it more specific to the user themself . Maybe you 're more comfortable on your Smartphone than with paper .
Negatives about online learning are that you 're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer . If pyou do n't have any listening things in the app you do n't learn how to pronounce the words . In my personal opinion , its better to learn from a teacher not only because you learn to pronounce the words correctly , but you also learn from a person , which is , in my opinion , way better . I think we spend enough time on smartphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to learn as well .
The show seems difficult , the characters always have to face situations which are not easy to solve , but practically , this show is a soap opera in a hospital .
Today 's television is really good .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example , after school .
So , at a special time there is a special advertisement for this age group .
Advertising is important for the economy .
I would say if you know how and when to use a TV , it is good , but especially for young people who think it is good entertainment to watch the whole day .
The attitude of Colombians to the education system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
In the same way , Australians have a different attitude to their education system .
However , the attitude of the Colombian and Australian people is different in many ways .
Similarly , Australians have a different attitude to the education system .
This attitude is based more on the backgrounds of the people rather than on the system itself .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses , which accour for some debate .
Many would argue that its disadvantages have already outweighed the advantages , and many others disagree with this view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both the economy and cultural diversity , the need is increasing for resource which are used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significant symbol of the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of problems .
In the first place , the environment is destroyed , because there are some trees and flowers before the house is built .
What is worse , the space taken up by the house is where some animals lived before , so they lost their homes , which become the houses of people . Nevertheless , the earth does not only belong to the human race .
Secondly , building more houses is not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of a house is too expensive for the ordinary person .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by imposing certain laws .
In a word , the government should appeal to people in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only focus on personal profit .
Using public transport is " healthier " than using a car for the environment because twenty - three humans can travel on a bus and it is only one vehicle , but it would be twenty cars .
Also , people think that travelling in cars is faster than on public transport and I agree with that , because the bus or the underground is always stopping at the different stations , so in this way , the car is better .
I will use public transport , not always , but more than the car , although you travel slower , because I want to save our planet so that the coming generations can live in good conditions .
There are just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but you .
But , despite all these advantages , the tennis player has to take care in some dangerous situations .
It happened to me once and was very uncomfortable .
With reference to your advertisement , I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS . I am John from the capital city of a southern state of India .
I worked in a secondary school for about 2 years , where I gained experience which would be suitable for the current position .
As I worked in a restaurant kitchen as a part - time job , I gained knowledge of basic cooking methods , and hope it might be helpful now .
Herewith I enclose my current CV , which you can see in the attachment .
I am interested in working a in new work environment , kindly reply .
Yours faithfully
This was a very cool experience for me .
They explained all the procedures .
I could not cope with the responsibilities .
In work , I am confident in work . I have money and satisfaction .
I was the boy behind the curtain , I dealt with the sound of the concert due to my experience with professional music equipment .
I encountered small problems during the concert , but we fixed them very easily thanks to the team with whom I worked .
The experience is unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert .
People were surprised to know his relationship had been broken for so long .
Michael was a very intelligent boy .
She always told Michael to never disrespect when people are at the door and always be polite .
The building was initially planned as the Federal Legislative Palace during the regime of Porfirio Díaz , because society was governed and supported by the president .
In later times , society felt the need for change because of iniquities that were committed in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building was abandoned because the government and country did n't have money for construction , to the point that the building 's metal structure was used for weapons .
After the revolution , construction will be used to represent the success of the revolution .
It is so much more convenient .
When I was a university student , I wanted to swim well but I could n't swim , because I did n't have to swim in my life .
First , I registered at a swimming pool , then I went back to the swimming pool every day early in the morning .
The report was discussed at our meeting , and we wish to congratulate you on completing this audit and providing the details and evidence on improving the outcomes from students ' results this year .
One straight observation was the low number of students that have taken the math course .
We wondered if some work needs to be done to increase the student attendance on the math courses .
The diagram gives information about various stages in the process of making bank notes .
It is true that there are five stages in the whole process . We can see that the processes begin with design and end at packaging and distribution .
Looking at the information in more detail .
Initially , bank notes should be considered in terms of the design such as background colour , artwork , and security issues . Then , the preparation of metal plates is the next stage . note should be skilled machinists . Thereafter , the next stage is printing . worker should pay attention to colour on both sides , special ink , and slightly raised images .
Subsequently , the next step is the most important . The bank notes should be inspected . The bank notes are separated into good and bad . If they get good quality sheets , the next stage is packaging and distribution . At this stage , sheets should be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched . If they get bad sheets , the next stage is disposal . The bad sheets and bank notes are securely destroyed .
First , the bank notes are designed by considering background colour , artwork , and security issues .
Then , the metal plates are prepared by skilled machinists .
Third , this is the most important step : printed sheets are manually inspected , and these sheets are classified into three categories .
The first is called good quality sheets . They will be packed and dispatched .
These pictures show us what detailed steps are taken by the bank to produce paper money into the application .
Before the production , they have to think about the design , including background color , artwork and codes which make them different from the illegal ones , then put them into the printing machines to create them .
The most important step is the inspection by hand . That is to say , they should be separated into good ones , which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks , and the bad ones , which ca n't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage .
Look at yourselves .
We are architects of our own destruction .
If I go travelling I think a car is very useful , but driving a long distance is very tiring .
Consequently , you ca n't enjoy travelling .
I 'm studying Business Administration , I think my major is so busy .
I dream of being a Business Administrator when I 'm older . First , I want to work for a sports company like UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Family members are the people who will accompany us throughout our whole lives .
Compared to our classmates or co - workers , the members of our family know us best .
Families understand our minds so much . However , our classmates or colleagues ca n't achieve that because they do n't stay with us all the time .
In conclusion , only family members know who we are most deeply .
Tennis . Tennis is not just a sport anyone can play , but it 's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it . First , why did I choose tennis ? Seriously , in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play . I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to his professional movement when playing the ball . From that time , I was interested in this game and watching all the championships , so more time , time and time it is my favourite sport .
But , when our mutual friend introduced her to me , I realized that she was a nice , funny person .
She 's from Morocco , so she has Arabian features . For example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and big black expressive eyes .
First of all , although travelling by car has become more convenient , the growing population means personal vehicles are hard to manage .
Cities such as Beijing , a metropolis in China , face the salient bad traffic . As such , the government had to encourage citizens to go to work by public transport such as bus and subway .
Apparently , this measure has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , public transport plays an important role in our daily life . It has indispensable effects on society .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the attractions of this town .
In the town center there are the most attractions as well as one of the best bars in the region ; " the Albastirca " .
Many visitors come to it but there are more attractions than just one bar .
Another good thing about the town is that it is n't lacking in shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has recently been opened , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other hand , the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has recently been opened .
Conclusions
To sum up , I strongly suggest that visitors stay as long as possible in this town as it has almost everything that a man needs .
Some people say there is no future for public transportation , but I do n't think so .
Moreover , it is more appropriate to start constructing roads which are convenient for the majority .
First my favorite sport is football and I like it for many reasons . For example , while you are watching a match , you feel excited and entertained . Besides that , football has the best football player ever , which is Leo Mesy . He 's the best and he 's able to do awesome stuff when he 's playing .
One of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle . He seemed to be 28 years old .
He was furious because the American did n't understand what he said .
Then he was arrested and charged with the robbery before a magistrate , and is waiting for his sentence .
It is hard for an eastern girl to do what she likes because of her society 's traditions and customs .
Let 's take me as an example . I am a 25-year - old girl who graduated from the faculty of engineering and wants to travel to Germany to complete my studies , but I am not able to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
Today , because of the progress of industry , we have caused so many environmental problems that did n't arise before .
For example , lack of clean water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural resource depletion , etc .
The problems were n't very significant so we overlooked them , but now they have become serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
Anyway , we will make mistakes if we do the new challenges and new tasks .
Introducion :
The aim of this report , is to show how my town takes care of the environment .
The mayor , in collaboration with Lipor , distributed leaflets with information on " How to deal with household rubbish " . Each leaflet explains how to separate the household rubbish .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recycling .
How the town treats the environment :
As well as the informative sessions about the environment organized by the Mayor for all of the residents , it also has lots of staff that clean the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
In conclusion , I would like to say that the city where I live keeps the city clean and attractive , for people that live there and for those who visit the city .
First , the trend of environmentally friendliness has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel , taking public transport can decrease the air pollution created by cars , and more governments have built public transport systems , including subways , buses etc .
Transport in the city is n't inconvenient as it was years ago .
The other reason is , travelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts . Most famous resorts lack parking lots , travelers may spend hours trying to park .
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantages of travelling by car have been replaced gradually by public transport . The future of public transport is bright .
I am not a professional player .
Sometimes , if I would like to play football but it 's raining , I can watch football on television .
If I play football with my best friends , I am a goalkeeper .
In football , my favourite position is goalkeeper .
In Somalia , people usually throw the rubbish and garbage everywhere , and there is no a cycle which is intended to keep it .
The city council are dealing with how they can keep the city clean , and each and every morning there are employees whose job is to collect rubbish and keep the environment clean .
Many of the main roads of Mogadishu are getting more attractive by the day and the people have begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 times a week . Swimming is a good sport , especially in summer .
Studies say the cool water will cool the body temperature down and that means it will burn the body fat faster than the other sports .
By the way , some people do n't like to swim because they have difficulty finding a swimming pool . I think that is just an excuse to be lazy . The Internet will help you to find one . Let 's go swimming .
Nowadays , there are many choices for spending our free time , such as going shopping , travelling , listening to music , reading , etc ..
I have relationships with people who play football with me .
They not only help me in every match , but also share everything with me in daily life .
Eating a balanced diet is very important for everyone , especially for pregnant women , children and old people as their bodies need more nutrition than younger people .
Although a balanced diet will offer energy and vitality , that 's not all . Exercising is important too , in addition to a balanced diet .

If you want to visit me , you have to do it in the next month because I have a football tournament , and I must participate .
If you want to visit a restaurant , I would suggest the Dagi .
We , the management of The Arch London Hotel , received your email and wish to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desire to work in via return email along with a scanned copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us to make all the necessary corrections .
When it comes to public transport , the future is relatively dark according to the prospection .
Indeed , all the indicators show that human behavior will not change , at least in the coming decades .
On the other hand , governments are not able to change transportation policies to enhance public transport 's level of service .
Malaga is a town that takes care of the environment .
Around the city , there are a lot of containers for rubbish , pieces , plastic and crystal .
So , Malaga is responsible towards the environment and towards people in need .
These companies must take care of the environment or they will have to pay a big fine to the council .
So , in general , I think Malaga is very responsible towards the environment and acts appropriately .
The way of living changes every day : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' lives , we notice many differences .
Above all , they talked more . We live in the era of telecommunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Moreover , also , simple things have changed . For example , the food we eat . Some time ago , everything was natural , healthy ... but now everyone always eats " junk food " and things like that , which are completely unhealthy !
About food , I imagine a future society in which restaurants wo n't exist . People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before , food in tins ... so all unhealthy things , which will cause many problems .
For this reason , I also imagine that in the future doctors and scientists will have too much to do !
A lot of people are afraid of catastrophic events even thought it 's very improbable that the same thing will happen to us .
Some fears are instinctive and it 's positive because it protects us from real danger , it 's a good response .
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life - threatening and they can disrupt everyday life , but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay more attention to real dangers .
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote his story " The War of the Worlds " , so it was inevitable . People began to see space creatures everywhere .
They will have three eyes , antennae on their heads , and guns firing green extraction .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
tube and train , but is there a future for them or not ? I am going to answer this question by discussing disadvantages and advantages and , finally , I will give my personal opinion .
To begin with , public transport is not as convenient as using our own vehicle . Every day , above all in the morning , it is usually crowded , due to people going to work .
Although I have written some disadvantages , public transport is better than private transport .
Secondly , public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the environment , because it produces less polluting emissions , and many public vehicles use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than ever before . Cities contain more automobiles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking , and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the environment of our cities .
I enjoyed all the cities we visited but the best , in my opinion , was Siracusa . In particular , I liked Ortigia , which is the oldest part of the city .
Public transport nowadays has become a bit uncomfortable because we can not think of availability of seat .
Traveling by car or any other personal vehicle is much more convenient because it takes much less time and it takes us directly to the place where we want to go .
These days , private transport is more convenient than public transportation . Although public transport like buses , trains , ferries and intercity rail take less time and energy , sometimes it creates problems .
On public transport , people are obliged to share transport with strangers and we also have to follow company policy or regulations , but with our own transport , we do n't have to bother about these things . We travel when we want and when we have time .
So we can say that travelling in our own transportation is more convenient .
It 's true driving a car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wait for a bus .
They can travel to another place irrespective of the time .
Some buses have special and preferential seats for old people .
This is interesting because people practise solidarity .
This mode of transport is better for the population and means that we do n't have traffic in the city .
5- It gives me a lot of time to think about all my life without any disturbance from anybody .
Travelling by car is more convenient in my opinion .
Secondly , you might feel uncomfortable .
To sum up , in my opinion , travelling by car is better .
Unfortunately , it is very sad to say that people in my town do not care about the environment .
There are so many little things we could do to care for the environment .
I suppose their lifestyle is intolerable , resteless and I really sympathise with them . The majority of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities but , through thick and thin , they go on .They achieve the goals made exceptionally for the sake of money and vanity .
I receive a lot of calls looking for the previous employee and I have to spend my time explaining what happened to him .
I 'm writing you a letter because I have made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what the film is about and what the experience was like .
The experience with the film was amazing , because we laughed all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea .
In itself , the film did n't have an special topic , but I can describe it as a friends film , as there is a lot of laughs , jokes , and it shows that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
I started running to lose weight and it ended up being a life - changing experience .
Running is cheap and everyone can take up running , no experience required . After all , it is just one step after the other .
1 . Everyone spends a lot of time travelling .
But public transport has advantages : If we use it is an essential mode of transport for travelling .
Therefore , the environment will be improved .
The public transport is unsafe because of an increase in thefts and the kidnapping of users .
Also , that the cameras transmit immediately the images of robbers to other buses to ensure that they are alert , and that the drivers receive training and sanctions for driving badly .
Because we want a lot of money , a lot of things , we are always working to earn more money , we do n't meet our neighbours , for example .
It 's economically and practically more expensive .
In olden times luxuries were not considered as compared to health , but now everyone prefers to save time and maintain privacy , which one can only afford by using her / his own private transport , so gradually , public transport is losing its charm .
The underground , trains and buses . These means of transport are cheap , so it helps the poor to save some money .
Governments should take care of public transport . They should save means of entertainment . People should keep them clean and safe . If they use them carelessly they will be useless . Now there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars are faster than public transport , so cars are more convenient than public transport . They are easier , faster and more comfortable , especially for long distances . So , governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars .
Nowadays , travelling has made it easier for humans to move all over the world .
Many people have got used to using their own vehicle as their means of transport , where they can reach their destination on time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my view on this controversial issue .
As the automotive industry is huge , most householders prefer to buy a car rather than use any other motor vehicle . They can move easily from departure point to destination in no time .
As private transport is increasing day by day , it 's that there may not be any public transport in the future .
Secondly , if private transportation is increasing faster , traffic is also going to create a major problem , which causes global warming .
And the income that is gained through this transport service will automatically decrease , which will create a problem for the economy of the country .
Another issue we can see here is unemployment .
Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as public transportation , like bus service , cab service , auto service .... etc , in order to fulfil their basic needs .
More unemployed people may also lead to a higher crime rate .
I hope giving equal priority to both public and private transportation makes us healthy .
And we can see that controlling the traffic is not going out of the hands .
On the one hand , I like to have things that are typical in each country , apart from the fact that they are delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go and experience the food too .
I think if the government do the best work about the transport , they can save it .
Public transport is the best way to save the planet and have a better atmosphere . Also , we save money and can meet people .
It is true a car is more comfortable , but it uses a lot of mineral resources like petrol which can pollute the atmosphere .
Public transport is very complicated nowadays .
Day by day , the number of people is increasing in Mumbai .
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone , so we are communicating with distant friends , and we look for important information when we are studying or entertaining ourselves .
First of all , I am going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this topic .
The first advantage is that the Internet is very fast . For example , when you want information about something .
As for disadvantages , at present , children are always playing with their computer games and mobile phones .
Both computer games and mobile phones have got the internet . As a result , they have not got time for other traditional games .
Another disadvantage is that people do not meet with friends , since they speak on Internet websites , so every time there is unless relationship , the people are not sociable .
To sum up , the Internet is the most important advance in the world , but there are a lot disadvantages and advantages .
From my point of view , the Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse it , and should carry out other activities .
Anyways , I would n't want to ruin the ending but I would definitely recommend you to see what happens next !
I really appreciate your card that you sent me .
It made me speechless !
I celebrated my birthday without any complications .
I want to be an accountant .
Here is a description of my phone - model iphone 6 , gray color and there were scratches on the back .
I am interested in your advertisement you posted in an English language magazine .
I am working in the daytime , so nighttime , 6 pm to 9 pm , or anytime on weekends would be good for me , except on Mondays and Wednesdays when I play basketball as a hobby .
I am good at speaking and listening but not confident at writing , especially essay writing . I 've never studied writing in my life , so I want to focus on this writing part more than others .
Travelling by car is much more convenient but we all know really there is no future for public transport .
When we talk about public transport , there are many people and everyone travels but I think we do not feel relaxed there and if we talk about travelling by car .
It is the best or much more convenient for us .
I think there is a big future for public transport , because a lot of people want to use it and , more than anything else , it is convenient .
In particular , some people do n't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves , so public transport helps them a lot .
Already , public transport has been improved and that makes it comfortable to go on a trip , but I think it will be able to be better and better quality , because so many people expectation .
I like the car as well , but when I have to drive a car , I have to think about parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am travelling , so public transport is making connections between human beings .
The explanation of those who support the second answer is that everyone is born equal in terms of duties and rights .
Is it convenient to take a year off between leaving school and starting the university ?
I think it is not necessary and not recommendable because you have the possibility to earn money and it is difficult once you get used to earning money , you want to study again .
Furthermore , you do n't study during this period and when you want to start university , you wo n't be able to remember some important things
Convenience is not the only consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of people choose public transport for travelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes faster than driving a car .
In recent years , governments have encouraged people to take public transport because of the fuel crisis .
Some governments invest a lot of money in constructing public transport networks to make travelling by public transport more convenient .
It 's basketball .
Basketball is a perfect sport because you can develop your reflections and your relationships with people .
I enjoy playing basketball because I relax when I play it and I can meet new people and travel around my city or my country . That is the best , because you can visit cities .
And you enjoy yourself with your mates and experience all those special moments with them .
This is a sport that improves your friendships and it 's so good for your health .
A river passes by the city and , occasionally , there were floods in the place .
I absolutely disagree with this statement .
There are 7 billion people in the world , and the number is increasing rapidly .
Besides , it 's also an environmental problem ; exhaust fumes engulf the earth . The more the car is used , the more exhaust gases are released . We are killing our mother earth .
An automobile is a luxury in some countries , like mine .
In conclusion , public transport is our future means of transport . I mean for most citizens .
Not car , though it 's convenient .
My favourite sport is swimming . It makes me feel comfortable and leaves me in a good mood . I go swimming twice a week , and my advice to anyone wanting to start swimming is to enjoy every moment of it .
I think it is just a coincidence that the sheep looks like a human .
I think the sheep should be transferred to a place where there is specialisation in animals with the same condition .
Life is a long journey . Every day , we gain more and more experience .
We become not only older , but also wiser . We learn , but the most useful thing to learn is to get a lot of experiences and , for sure , to make mistakes . But we have to be honest with ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
I am in Kyoto eating Yatsuhashi .
As you know , my grandmother currently lives in France with my cousin John . Unfortunately , he has to do a three - month course outside of the country . John needs to leave France next weekend , but it is not possible . I have to go and look after her because none of my family can spend three months over there .

Nowadays , technology is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful .
We as humans living in these days , rely on technology . Every aspect of our lives is supported by technology .
And because of technology , our lives become easier .
One example is television . In the past , we used it only for watching the news and movies , but as time goes by and the technology develops , now television has other functions .
Television can be used tor many things . Usually we watch television for entertainment , but we can also use it for education too .
These are the proofs that television can also educate .
First , television has many programs which can be used for education .
Many programs consist of lessons for kids to learn . For kids who still want to learn to speak and know the words , it is very useful , because many programs are very suitable for them to help them learn faster by watching television .
Besides that , we can also use television to make us become knowledgeable , by watching news programs .
Second , these days , television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet .
By that advantage , now we can easily search and get information from the internet by using a television .
In conclusion , television can entertain and also educate , because television programs do it in an interesting way .
But we are too interested .
I 'm not good at playing it , and I prefer to play volleyball , but I like to watch the games .
The emotions the only try if you 're a fan of any team , and you know the happiness that you feel when it wins , it 's indescribable .
I like to watch the games at home with my father , but always go to the stadium with my dad . You feel indescribable emotions . And my father was to convey this passion .
The future of public transport should be taken seriously . In my opinion , public transport is the best option for solving the problems with traffic congestion because , when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people are travelling from one place to other in just one vehicle .
When we use a car , in general , one person is the only person who is accustomed to using their own car , so this is not exploiting the potential of the car .
It 's for this reason that I think public transport is a great benefit to society , and a good way for us to move from one place to another . I suggest that the government should invest more money for the purpose of improving public transport .
George 's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasty recipes from all around the world to enjoy your dinner alone or with company .
The head chef is an experienced and skillful man at his work .

So fairly George 's restaurant is one of the most universally renowned restaurants .
You ca n't disagree that our world become urbanization in the future , can you ?
Today 's television !
The big deal is entertainment , and quality is part of it .
You should consider that large and being untouchable TV is what you must find in one .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies on your own TV considering price and quality . Some TV brings you the experience of enjoying your favourite movies in other scenery . Will you try ?
Whether people who reach 18 should do military service is an issue . The supporters suggest that it is helpful for 18-year - olds to train their physical fitness and psychological qualities , whilst opponents point out that it is harmful to human rights and affects the development of a country .
Considering both views , it can be concluded that the government should respect human rights and set up a new department which can be used by people who want to apply to do military service .
You just have to think that 50 years ago we did n't know what a smartphone or a laptop was , in schools we used books of paper and not tablets or iPads , and now technology is part of our lives .
I think and hope that maybe in 50 years scientists will find a cure for many diseases and that will change our lives , because we could live for longer .
I want thank you for the invitation but I ca n't come to the party because it is my sister 's s burradas .
I am currently a doing Master 's but I can devote myself to the Fellowship , especially since I have finished the Pre - Masters and now I need only follow up from time to time with my supervisor . So I have the time for the Fellowship .
When I read his poem " The Adventures of Tom Sawyer " I was excited .
First of all , I would like to tell you about the atmosphere of the film .
It is like you are going downstairs to a dark room and feeling curiosity and fear at the same time .
That slow - motion action is so impressive that I have watched it all day .
In particular , I would like to point out Mathew McConnahy 's role .
The philosophy of this hero is so different to what we used to think every day that I have taken a look at my life from another point of view .
I work in advertising . I 'm an account .
This report aims to give a clear idea about preserving the environment in my town .
First of all , the local council organised a competition promoting ecological awareness and encouraging the local community to preserve the environment .
Second , new rules were legislated condemning any person intending to harm the environment in any way .
Third , supporting recycling by inventing three types of rubbish bins for hard waste , for liquids , and the third for clothes .
Football is considered to be the most watched and followed sport worldwide .
I would like to look at this sport from different perspectives .
Firstly , football plays a vital role in unifying people locally and internationally . For example , it helps the US and China to normalize their relations .
Although I have been playing football for years , I am still not a professional player . This may be because I am not talented .
We will learn today some information about Islam . Islam is a great religion that comes from the Arabian Peninsula and it was founded 1436 years ago .
Mohammed was a kindly prophet born in a small city called Mekka and he travelled to another city close to Mekka called Almadina because the people of Mekka were very aggressive and they did not accept the new invitation to the new religion .
I think the principal things in our talk are the internet , computers , technology and communications .
Education will not be in schools and universities , but it will be on the internet by many methods like : Self Education , E - learning education , on many websites like : EDX and Coursera and distance education .
Shopping will also be on the internet ; everything will be !
I 'm writing to you because I 'm interested in applying for the job in summer camps .
I saw the advertisement last week in the newspaper and I think that I 'm the right person for the job .
I 'm forty years old and I have experience of looking after children in my town because I have been working in a primary school as a teacher for four years .
In your advertisement you mention working in kitchens ; I live in a small town and my grandfather was a farmer .
Yours faithfully
Firstly , they design the bank notes ' background colour , its artwork and security issues .
Second is the preparation of the metal plates .
It 's done by skilled machinists .
They will package and distribute the sheets which are good .
Why not ? Firstly , what 's education for you ? It 's very clear to me that education is creating the conditions to make your thinking grow .
If the way to do that is easy and nice , I think in the end it is better than explaining theoretical concepts .
The other reason for my opinion is that almost all people prefer using the eyes and ears to other people , rather than write and listen to understand new things .
That 's why I think that it 's a good moment to see things in a new way and that can be a very good opportunity .
Definitely , it does not always depend on the kind of programme , but I think that nowadays , a lot of television offers help for people to develop more effectively .
I am communicating with you with the purpose of letting you know that we are going to set up a meeting at my office with the purpose of discussing how we could use social media to improve the communication with our suppliers . I think a great time for the meeting would be next Monday at 4:00 p.m
I am going to communicate to you something about military service .
The purpose of this letter is to notify you about some complaints that some citizens have . This is related to why only boys have to be in the draft for military service , and girls do not have to .
Yes , I have a favourite restaurant .
When I go to the restaurant , I always eat Mexican food such as tacos or fajitas .
However , I just go to the restaurant on special occasions , such as my birthday or when I pass an exam .
This diagram is used to illustrate the process of making bank notes , covering seven main stages .
First of all , we should think of a design and decide the background colour and artwork , or even security issues .
And then , for the preparation of metal plates , skilled machinists are used .
Next , printing . Sheets of bank notes are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) with colour on both sides , and specWell , the . Well , the most important step is inspection , printed sheets should be manually inspected .

It is located between neighborhoods with aesthetic characters in the Alhijaz design area .
And conservation mechanism followed in this house encouraged students to become a part of it .
Finally , if you want to rest and have good companionship , go to this house .
The pyramids were not made by machines or computers and that is from the secrets of the ancient Egyptians of how they could build a great building like that about 7,000 years ago and it is still strong now . People from all over the world come to Egypt to see it s great civilization . Around 2 million people come to the pyramids yearly . You can be one of them .
Come visit the land of peace and civilization .

My English language is weak . I would like to improve it to complete my postgraduate studies .
The reason for choosing the English language specifically next September I would like to get to know more information about an English language course .
Our school is organizing a funfair .
This activity is really interesting and you should n't miss it .
Keep your excitement and attend the event .
You will gain a sense of satisfaction .
It is meaningful enough that you can raise money for the poor or help meet somebody 's needs by buying things .
Also , there are some performances after the funfair .
If these reasons why you should take part in the event haven't whetted your appetite , you might try searching for some information about the event last year .
It is hoped that the successful funfair or other student s ' experiences will encourage you to participate in the funfair .
It is believed that the fun fair will be held successfully this year too .
Sometimes we have a presentation and competition .
Effective teachers have clear and consistent communication and management skills .
The teacher uses lesson time effectively .
Classroom management is good .
Students must take a serious assessment about himself .
This city is located in the north of Extremadura .
In Cáceres , we take care of the environment .
The people recycle the rubbish and they throw away the rubbish in different containers .
Sagrada Familia , also called Gaudi 's Cathedral , is a very touristic Roman Catholic church located in Barcelona which is still under construction .
Antoni Gaudi was the Catalan architect who designed it in 1798 and in 1882 its construction got started .
Nowadays , due to the current economic crisis , its construction has been stopped until an undetermined date .
It is interesting because it has
When I was ten years old , I really liked to play football very much . I joined a football team which is near to my home . I prefer this team because my family is not rich , they can not provide for my transportation fees to go to do exercise at a stadium .
In my life , many dreams have existed in my mind which are sweet , incredible , magical or horrible .
Constantly , I just walked like without terminal contest .
Nowadays we see an enormous improvement in infrastructure .
Nevertheless , travel by car is easier for commuters , for example , because they can choose a personal timetable without the terrible discomfort of buses . In addition , there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport , especially if the government invested their money in green energy and we could discover a new green car , which in turn , would revolutionise our lives .
Well , the way that we use television depends on each one of us .
We will have people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but we also have other people that use television for research .
For example , the channel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of information about animals and how they live .
In my opinion , people use television for distraction .
The television is being more and more utilized by people , so we are getting more problems with vision .
It looks like a kind of addiction ... We need to use the technology on our behalf .
The capitalist world makes us increasingly become us updated .
Nowadays , everybody has the ability to buy a television , so the numbers of TV viewers is going up ; even if you are poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
Shopping online is also not , from my experience , a good way of shopping .
Socializing online helps us to contact our friends in an easy way in different places and this way does n't cost us money .
Socializing does not cost us money , but we need one place to contact each other .
Now , public transport is not the future , because travelling by car is much more convenient .
People who do n't use public transport , think that travelling by car is much better .
Maybe it will be a really good opportunity for people to be more healthy too .
Compared with local bookstores , publishers or media such as newspapers considering the Internet market , public transportation has a much better future .
The first reason is that public transportation carries humans .
Even though people try to develop drones to reduce logistical costs , it is difficult to apply technology to carrying humans .
The second reason is that automatic driving technology needs some more time for development .
Also , automatic driving technology is already applied to trains .
Following your letter , I want to tell you about the apartment . It is very beautiful , not big or small , but medium - sized with two rooms inside , a bathroom and a dining room and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view . I am sure he will like it . to come and Tri condo b soon , n the end , I would say that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
I like talking to friends and I can communicate with other people .
Michael was a little boy . He was 10 years old . He went with his parents to his grandfather 's home .
Micheal was afraid . He waited for Sara to get out . He went to the shore to see if she came from the other side , but he found no footprints . His mother called him and he went home still thinking about Sarah . It was night and he was afraid to go there again . He went to sleep . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A clean and healthy environment is always acceptable to all kinds people .
Also , they obey the rules and regulations of the city authorities .
First , the waste management system of our area is more effective than before .
Our authorities now follow the scientific method for rubbish control ; recycle , reuse , galvanization .
As a result , the city - dwellers are now enjoying a more healthy environment .
It is a more expected criteria , why the authority step up many organizations working for waste management .
In most cases , not only my family members but also our neighbors like to avoid carbon - level - increasing products that are responsible for temperature increases .
Many organizations work to raise the environmental awareness of pupils , so people are more concerned about environmental pollution .
Now , the government is working to decrease smoke emissions from the mills and industry .
Scientists and researchers jointly work to reduce carbon emissions .
Some progress has been made already ; it s implementation also runs at full speed .
Last but not least , the strict rules and regulations have a more effective impact on making a good town .
Our authorities are more careful about the rules and regulations ; hence no - one can disobey the rules .
The job announcement on your webpage immediately grabbed my attention , as it has always been my dream to work for the German - Norwegian Youth Forum and the requirements are just the skills that I can provide you with .
Influenced by it , I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Since 2013 , I have been studying English and Marketing Communication at University College Syddanmark .
Furthermore , even if you just buy something you can afford , you may also waste much more money .
Travelling by car is certainly much more convenient than travelling by trams or trolleybuses , which only follow the lines of their routes .
But thinking about the environment , traffic jams and sometimes the absence of parking spaces makes me change the statement .
On the one hand , you put all your things in the car and drive anywhere you want to . On the other hand , if you feel not well enough to drive , you have no money to buy a car , or the downtown of your city is closed to all means of transport except for public ones , the tram , bus or trolleybus is your way out .
HOW CAN YOU BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
I have a few easy recepts , how you can be a well off £ 100 and how you can help the environment .
Firstly , I will describe how I can help my local environment and what I do that is useful for it .
I am interested in natural ways we can help in the local area .
I am a serious fan of the environment .
Secondly , I save water and electricity , because the costs are quite expensive .
So , my bills for water are inexpensive , because I have swapped having a bath to taking a shower .
Finally , we are obligated to care about the environment , because it 's our duty .
I think it is true , because a lot of people like travelling by car .
Some years ago when the weather was colder here people ate more meat with wine . In fact , growing vegetables was not possible because of the weather .
In fact , today people are interested in drinking wine when attending parties or meeting with friends .
Our commitments cause us to forget ourselves and our health .
It may cause increasing weight or reducing the number of necessary vitamins which our body needs .
In conclusion , if we make a decision to live longer , following a suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable .
You see , I do not see members of one 's family as one 's best friends because , personally , I did n't and still do n't have a great relationship with anyone in my biological family .
And this may have affected my way of thinking and acting in different situations .
So no , the members of my biological family are n't my best friends .
Thank you for giving me the chance to pass on this information as per your request .
In my town , there are many regulations that are enforced by the municipality and the environment ministry , such as preventing animals like sheep , horses , cows .. etc , from being in the town and in the populated areas .
Besides , due to the critical situation we are experiencing and facing in Iraq .
As we are fully dependant on individual generators , these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke , oil and gas left behind , in addition to noise , of course , because they are the main source of the 18 continuous hours of noise .
People , especially generator owners , have started using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid of as much as they can of the pollution .
Other residential areas , using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , have numerous green spaces .
Also , recycling the trushes is a very intelligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines .
on the other hand , the eldest people in our city have many social responsibilities and are encouraging the youngest people to participate in the annual gardening festival for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
Although each household can make a real difference by taking good care of the area in front of their houses and keeping it clean .
Hope that this information is useful
Michael and Marcuangolo were friends , but in school they were enemies . They had amazing battles in the playground .
One day , at the end of classes , Marcuangolo wanted to hit Michael , and Michael ran away .
Marcuangolo fell in the street .
A car crashed into him and Marcuangolo started bleeding .
They took Marcuangolo to a room and put the boy in a bed .
Michael understood that he must take away .
As soon as I came to university , my life changed .
Before I started university , I had n't a lot of friends and I was so lonely , but after I started to study at Ton Duc Thang university , I became more happy , comfortable and sociable .
I'll have a friend at university because I scared strangers .
The first day I studied at the university , I made a lot of friends .
It was a wonderful experience for me .
We were talking about the last match . We were discussing our faults , when suddenly we heard a loud noise .
Some passengers were hurt and weak .
I like the Indian restaurants in the city . In addition , the infrastructure and roads are well organised .
obeying to the statement above , it 's necessary to say that this is a very interesting topic , because it 's closely related to actual problems , such as problems with the environment .
That is to say , that most cars are not green , namely ; current cars are not designed to have a good impact on the environment .
Regarding the reason for the described situation , it is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies , which are aimed at getting as much money as possible , regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals .
Thus , the question is , travelling by car is so much more convenient for whom ?
For multinationals maybe ?
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , it is indeed less harmful , in terms of the impact on the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , whereas each new car means increasing pollution .
Travelling by public transport would be more convenient with a good conscience of protect the planet .
The idea of banning cars from the centre of all major cities has advantages and disadvantages .
On the other hand , the bad things are that you have to park outside of the city centre and these areas will be crowded , you ca n't visit places with your car and people with physical problems could have difficulties with public transport .
In my opinion , it is a good idea , but perhaps the restriction could have exceptions for certain people and certain days and times , or if you need to visit a particular place with your car , you could ask for special permission .
In the village where I live , there is a lot of vegetation . For that reason , we try to protect the environment . One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that case , we tell him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by taking care of them . For that we have a care centre and , other additional institutions . We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this . To sum up , our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that surrounds us .
I am one of the students at Telemark University College .
I am studying on the Literature and Language bachelor programme .
I am so interested in this major .
In my country there are many interesting places to visit and it is a country to improve with your job , also , also , it is easy to find a job . There are many jobs and many different types of jobs .
This country has many interesting places to visit . If you want to have an adventure , you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza .
If you want to have fun , you can go to Parque de la Costa . There are many interesting rollercoasters .
In my opinion , public transportation is the most convenient way to travel . The air pollution is one reason that I prefer public transportation .
In addition , it is more economical than owning a car .
When I was born , I weighed 3650 grams and I was 52 centimeters tall .
Public transport is not convenient for most the people because every person wants to arrive at his destination on time , but when using public transport it is very difficult to arrive on time .
It all began in 1981 when Freddy Fazbear 's Pizza opened . The establishment is a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant had robots . In 1981 there were four animatronics and their names were Chica , Foxy , Bonnie and Freddy .
Three robots at a specific hour perform a show with instruments like a band .
When Freddy began to sing , the kids screamed and they sang with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song . Bonny played the drums and Chica served the pizza to the children , This year the establishment closed because they found the body of a dead child .
In 1983 , the pizza restaurant reopened with more security and robots with a more friendly appearance .
The establishment sought a security guard who had to guard the pizza restaurant at night . I am the security man .
When I saw the advertisement for the job , in that time , I thought that it would be very easy . I called the number , they give me the information , and I accepted .
The rules are simple : just look at the laptop , watch the animatronics , wait until 6:00am and close the doors if you need to . I said OK .
My second and third nights were very strange because on the cameras the animatronics moved as if they wanted to get to my room and do something to me .
The fourth and fifth nights were the worst because the animatronics were very active , they closed and opened the doors because they were trying to get into my room .
This holiday I am in Barcelona with my girlfriend .
Rosetta becomes first spacecraft to orbit .
NASA replied that it was a really amazing achievement that Rosetta left the solar system .
NASA replied that Rosetta will keep on its journey travelling across the Universe .
Travelling by car is becoming a comfortable factor nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we want , we can start at our desired time .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themselves . Everyone wants to improve his life to make it better but how can we do that without doing anything ? We must start with education and health , which are the most important things to be better .
To learn , to read , to be knowledgeable .
After the Second World War , they improved themselves in 50 years and became one of the most developed countries .
It is easier and more convenient .
There are plants everywhere .
There is another issue that is due to heavy traffic but few roads that are wide enough so that most people are distributed due to these issues .

My name is Alejandro Martín . I 'm 30 years old . I have heard about your organization and I would like to work for you .
I ask myself If I had the possibility to change the world , would I try to do all that in your hands .
My favorite sports/ hobbies are windsurfing and sailing .
The best place I have ever been is on an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
A very big weakness I have is that I can forget nearly everything , especially homework and other school stuff .
happy , funny and sometimes bothersome .
My favorite restaurant is TGI Fridays .
If you have a car , you probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who do n't have a car , so they are used to going by bus and , for them , this way of travelling has become more convenient , because they have done it since they were children .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it 's cheaper and better for the environment . As for me , I think that cars are easier and an affordable way to travel between places , because cars are here anytime and so near to your home , unlike public transportation , which you have to walk to to reach in most countries . And also , cars are available all the time . You can go at 4 am and no one will say anything , because it 's yours , but most public transportation is available only for the daylight hours and a few hours at night , in an emergency situation for example , what will you do if you do not have your own car ? Your kid is sick , or your wife or your elderly parents . And , in general , the more we rely on ourselves , the more our government is able to help the poor and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community . We merely ask the government to improve the streets and the traffic light systems , and more petrol stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move around easily and safely and in a short amount of time .
Most people say that using a car is more convenient than using public transport .
Of course , private transport has a lot of advantages , like , you do n't need to wait for a bus at the stops or you can go everywhere you want at a time convenient for you .
Please respond at your earliest convenience ,
27-dresses is a romantic comic and funny film . It is recommended for all ages .
The plot is well constructed , it becomes quite gripping from the beginning .
The main characters are very young and enjoyable .
This story develops a mixture of themes such as courage , family values , friendship and love .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you should go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nowadays , we have a lot of environmental problems .
As a result , roads are overloaded and long traffic jams damage the air .
On the other hand , the government should think about some measures for protecting the environment .
For example , introducing several special dates in a year for using only public transport .
Also , another improving measure might be increasing green areas in cities and towns .
Unfortunately , many tourists do n't care about keeping personal spaces ( on the river bank or on the beach ) clean .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring for the environment must be very strict .
I often participate in friendly matches to keep my physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting a lot of stress on physical abilities , it goes without saying that the day can be tiring if one decides to play the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging as to how you will keep up your mental status .
It does require you to explore your brain while developing strategies against the opponents .
It becomes essential to create a spontaneous Plan B when Plan A did not work .
Above all , one has to learn to maintain sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated moments on the field .
In today 's world , television is very important .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negative way . Most people around the world can see any news live . Media is more helpful for people . Television is also used as a study resource , for example for smart classes ,
online courses etc . Television is a very important medium . We can improve our language with the help of the television . Now we can see
that so many films with the help of television and we can see other programs also . to the present world without television
no one can live as a human being so that we can say that television is more important .
Michael was a serious boy , he had the ability to behave in a good way , help his parents with daily activities .
Michael 's parents were absolutely poor , they hardly paid school fees for him , although they did their best to see him be educated .
One day , Michael was going to school for his final examination .
Your summer camp is the best place to demonstrate me .
If you walk at the seaside in the evening you can also have the possibility to see the sunset over the sea .... that 's great emotion ! I feel good in that way and even my soul can have a breath .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk . You just need a pair of comfortable shoes !
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is cheaper than public transport .
The main reason for people not liking to travel by public transport is overcrowding .
Travelling by train is very expensive nowadays .
People prefer the car rather than public transport due to sexual harassment .
I recommend this experience .
On the negative side are the labor conditions . The money is not enough to pay for the cost of living in London and in addition the money for " travel expenses " , in my case , did n't arrive until November !
Anyway , I recommend that you take the job for August , because I have heard that in that month the organization is better than in July .
I wish you luck and a good experience .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately that he had planned two weeks ago .
After that , the celebrations began and a lot of their friends came , each one presented a gift to Sara . She was really delighted and , suddenly , the doorbell been rang
Sara stood and stared at her for a few minuets and hugged her and bowed her for coming and thanked her . They had n't seen each other for several years since they had finished their studies . Really it was a great moment and they stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening , and agreed to visit their college at the weekend to recall the best memories . It was Peter who arranged this celebration and contacted Tia and prepared for all this to happen . Sara never forgot that day .
It 's much faster and much more convenient than using public transportation .
However , it seems that each day a new way of extracting fuels is being explored .
It was the capital of the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty , so it has a lot of ancient architecture , like Ming Tombs , the Summer Palace , The Temple of Heaven , the Forbidden City .
The Forbidden City , especially , is the largest architectural complex which is the best - kept in the current .
It . It represents the highest architectural achievement in ancient China .
These architecture also represents the culture of China .
Now Beijing is a large international city , it will inherit the elements of history and develop much better .
" The reality of transportation is that it is future oriented .
Transportation has a major role in a society as life revolves around motion .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety , then private transport is more likely to be considered .
Travelling privately makes one free of issues like harassment .
Public transport can cause problems for passengers due to increasing fares .
For instance , fuel - efficient , luxurious and economical cars are easily available .
With the advancement of the automobile industry , public transport will not be considered as the first choice in the coming years .
The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer , more convenient and comfortable way of travelling .
I studied at Al Qassim University and my major was Microbiology .
I like a lot of activities , such as travelling , reading , playing soccer and watching movies .
I still believe that public transport will be more popular in the future due to the benefits it provides for us . Travelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Travelling on public transport is cheaper .
Today , governments focus on how to improve public transport and they also increase their support .
So public transport is improved continuously .
I think it will be the favourite transportation for all of us .
My favorite sport is volleyball .
This sport causes fresh and jolly me and I think exercise will cause me to be healthy . If you start volleyball , you need a ball and a piece of ground that is separated by a net .
Shopping takes place the biggest part especially for women , but sometimes it is not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality that does n't like crowds of people walking around .
Human life has changed a lot in recent years , and it seems that this will happen faster every day . Technology advances and the changes in our way of thinking are adapting to a different kind of people with each human generation .
Technology advances way too fast and it is really difficult to guess what kind of stuff or artefacts there will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas , like flying cars , smartphones the size of a small piece of paper , really thin laptops like a quarter of an inch , clothes that clean themselves or change color and shape , healthier food , smarter domestic appliances .
All this will help people to live easily , but only to have more time to work , because the type of mind that reigns in that time will focus on companies and making money and spending it . This is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to home offices and the firms are giving more and more facilities for their employees to be more efficient .
Finally , the kind of life that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of life , but this will be only to make more money and consume more and more . Also , things will be faster of waste to make people change their possessions more often and stimulate consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of farmland , forest and wetland disappearing because of some long - term human activities , for instance housing and transport networks are built , destroying the balance of the environment .
Firstly , it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people . What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more space for living in .
In order to command the psychology of the user , it was necessary for me to know the new trends in UI
Therefore , with a good UI design , many people will have a good user experience .
A good user experience will be good for collecting data and be good for making decisions in commerce .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarrassed .
She moved to Kyiv , graduated from university , and started to work .
He was everything to her .
I took this time to command people who sacrifice their entire lives for the betterment of sportsmanship .
And also have my favorite players , Ronaldinho , Messi and Eto'o .
I know football does n't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best .
They always buy talented players that will make the club improve tactically . People always say this ; " Barcelona does n't buy players " , it 's not like they lack money .
We do essential purchasing of players to save more money .
I am writing about the international sports monthly magazine I have seen .
I enjoy this sport because it is comfortable and elegant and you never hurt yourself badly .
Furthermore , you also have a lot more confidence in yourself .
Most people who play tennis are always ready and proud of themselves .
It would be interesting to accompany your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
But we have concrete examples , which we should follow and which already demonstrate that nothing is impossible
, like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi . They are two people who succeeded in their sport but with perseverance and ambition .
They are passionate about what they do . More specifically , those people are in love with their job .
In conclusion , I do n't have a favorite sport . I like to do a little of everything and I do n't refuse anything .
Then , when she did n't return home , her parents reported the disappearance of their daughter .
The investigations were concentrated above all on the construction site of Mapello .
Three month after her disappearance , she was found dead in the stream .
Definitely , public transportation does n't have any future .
A good proportion of the population prefer to buy a car to go to school , the workplace , church in a faster and more comfortable way .
Probably the only opportunity to change this will be to mention to people the opportunity to save energy and reduce the environmental pollution if we use public transportation .
Television has many advantages .
It not only entertains , but also educates .
There are many educational programmes which we can get benefits from .
Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe . In fact , there are some important tournaments in which all important European teams participate . They are called the " Champions League " and the " Europa League " . Football is a team sport . In fact , everybody participates in this sport without excluding anybody .
That day , I had just finished helping a younger student to understand his math lesson . My friend Michael asked me to do the same and to give her an answer sheet for all the final exams . I was shocked that she wanted that from me . Anyway , I gathered up my courage and told her that was wrong and become to do that in college Better to start studying now and I 'd help her to study the hard lessons ( I was very sad to say no & that she asked me that ) . She became very angry and told me I should help her because we she was my best friend . Then I told her why I had told her NO and she said " I hate you . "
Pollution as a problem in the environment
Technology was not as advanced as it is now , so the amount of waste was small .
We should find new alternatives for getting around in our routines .
Rivers and seas are victims of modernization .
The government should introduce a new law to correct this damage .
As we can see , modernization is causing damage to rivers and seas .
Dear Grandmother ,
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and then we will travel around my country and we will become good workers .
This idea is fantastic , although it will be very complicated .
On the other hand , I do n't recommend travelling , because it is very expensive .
I was really comfortable in my bed and I could n't believe that someone had interrupted my calm .
I discovered Pilates 2 years ago and began with an old Bejar dancer .
He took time to explain each movement and made me understand the concept .
If I could give advice to new practitioners of Pilates , it would be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a good teacher .
In my school days , I did not participate in any programme , even sports .
Because school teachers never encouraged me to participate .
If they had told me to attend compulsorily I would have done so without any hesitation .
While I am in ANDRAPRADESH every year , we have a Christmas function in December . Although we are not interested in attending Drama , they would not let us not play even a simple character .
They gave me the part of THE GOD . At first I was n't aware of how to act and play this particular character .
Personally , I believe that those who do not participate in any activities should be encouraged to do so by teachers .Only then will they also know how talented they are .
My family live in the city center of Madrid but I do n't like living there because it is noisy and there is pollution , so I decided to move to the countryside two years ago .
Since that moment , my life changed and now I go everywhere with " Yango " . That 's the monkey 's name .
I saw the job advertisement in the local newspaper .
To start with , I would like to tell you that I have studied gastronomy at the Instituto Crandon , one of the most recognised institutes in Uruguay . Also , I have just finished a sports and health course at the Universidad de la Republica , on which I learned to work with people of all ages in the sports area .
These include many kinds of sports , such as wrestling , basketball , tennis , running , etc .
My favourite sports are basketball and martial arts .
First , basketball is a team sport , which means I need to understand the expressions of members of the team and keep in contact them . For example , my role is cutter but I need to do assister , blocker and guard when I play .
In particular , I like karate and Kung - fu .
These 2 sports improve basic human ability to reach the highest capability possible .
I suggest to other people to first understand yourself , such as what you like , what is possible , and then practice after every success .
They use a bat and a shuttlecock , which is like a bird 's feather .
In my awareness , I know the United States advocates free - style study and self - learning , so aside from study , they have diverse selections .
The lack of sleep often makes me unable to concentrate in class .
First , I want to say that people 's lives will change in the future , because the new technologies will change the lives of people .
I think this because the new technologies are created by people to improve our habits .
On the other hand , people make other inventions to improve the world and reduce pollution . For example , at this time we have created electric cars and organic food . These things will be very useful in the future , because we will need to reduce pollution .
Also , people will need to improve medicine to cure diseases and , for this , people need to create more inventions to resolve these problems .
He heard a bit of noise at the top of the stairs but he did n't go to investigate that noise .
The doorbell rang again and he opened the door again . His sister was with him and she was very scared , but there was nobody at the door again .... and this time , the noise at the top of the stairs was loader and he understood everything .
And just as I was becoming a professional football player , my right knee was injured .
It is not always easy for me to speak in another language constantly .
I am now studying Software Engineering .
Web Programming with my boyfriend .
I hate eating vegetables and I love eating chips .
Well , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor that I 've ever seen is Vin Deasel . He is an excellent professional and he starred in a great number of movies , like the saga of Fast and Furious , Ridic , Nannies , Bulletproof and other excellent films .
This is one of my favourite actors , because , when he is recording a film , he assumes his role passionately and that is really important for a good actor .
Another of my favourites is Will Smith . He appeared in the well - known film , Men in Black and other excellent films like I am Legend .
He is , for me and many people , an excellent actor because his personality is extroverted .
So Jenny , these are my two favourites film stars .
This topic is controversial these days . Should everyone take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university ?
A good percentage of people think that everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college .
Or the student can simply spend this time travelling .
It is better to finish studying first , then go to work or have relaxation with travel .
In my opinion , it greatly depends on an individual 's financial situation .
or you just have what is essential for education and university fees .
The technology and industry are developing very fast , so public transport has no future .
It must be Interesting that the development of transport even fits the times .
Congratulations on your wedding . I hope you will be as happy as you are now your whole life .
Anyway , congratulations to you and Jenny again .
For this sport , it is necessary to drink water , and eat fruit , vegetables and pasta .
Thank you for showing interest in my village 's concern about the environment .
The town , Lahori , is known for its practices to preserve nature . In our town , we conduct monthly meetings concerning waste management , as well as pesticides .
We are very appreciative of Dr. Manjot Baqri , who has taken it upon himself to lead these meetings and educate our village on health problems associated with improper disposal of waste . The village has dug pits to dispose of waste .
When you drive you must take precautions at all times because if you do n't you can cause an accident .
Some disadvantages are that you may not have the money to maintain a car , and always remember that the car should give you a service and not you to it , which is why you always keep it in line with the engine , so you do not fail .
One day I visited my friend Jimmy in New York city . He was a young man who was an expert on trains and tourism . He talked about how citizens and commuters move from one place to another . He told me that Grand Central Station was the largest terminus in the city . He showed me where the landmarks of the Big Apple were so sightseers could go there . He showed me the city and we went to different parts . First he took me to Columbus Circle in the south west corner of Central Park where there were the most expensive apartments . Then we went to the lake where the jogging tracks that circle the lake are popular with early - morning visitors . Then we went to the Museum of Natural History that was located near the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Then I got focal on the subway trains , so we went to Grand Central Station . When we arrived , I was amazed to see a lot of people going to work , so he told me that it was convenient for people to use the train because it is very fast and for the government it was a great economic business . Then he told me that one of the characteristics of
In the era of technological advancement , everything goes beyond one 's expectations .
There are mobile phones which have face - to - face communication , and transportation driven by solar energy .
In addition , the transportation system which is developing day - by - day performs in the most convenient and the fastest way it can .
Even though the personal car is used more and more because of its convenience , in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development will cause public transport to be more popular than travelling by car .
The number of people in the world is continually increasing .
Therefore , public transportation is deemed important to reducing congestion on the road ; the traffic .
In the first paragraph , I wrote that transportation development will never lose place for public transport .
Secondly , public transport proves itself to be more functional and helps support people .
For example , comfortable seats , system support for the handicapped or physical disability , time capture that helps people to know the fixed time when the bus will come , as well as security support that helps people to be more confident to travel .
Lastly , public transportation makes you sure to arrive on time .
Taking into account all this , public transport is much more useful and convenient , both for individuals and for businesses .
Similarly , summer vacation gives us more time to do meaningful things .
Only by constantly following my daily routine can I learn more information and become stronger .
In important meetings like the UN General Assembly or G77 , many leaders of powerful countries raise environmental problems as the most concerning problem in their internal policies .
Disasters in the environment not only cause many problems for humans but also to all the diversity of life .
Firstly , I sometimes use my mom 's bicycle to go to university , taking part in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions from my car .
Riding a bicycle is also a kind of eco - friendly mode of transportation .
Next step , I reduce using some of the cosmetic products that contribute to or are made from materials that cause the greenhouse effect .
There are also many related products which harm the environment .
Last week I saw a bike trip to the countryside and how about registering for that ?
I am interested in the vacancy in your cafe .
In your advertisement , you said that you need a person who can work at weekends in your cafe .
I was working in ABC restaurant until last year .

In conclusion , Counter Strike is the best game in the world .
I went to the Vatican and Rome . I saw their massive buildings , which were impressive , and their old houses .
The weather was fantastic . I love sunbathing and resting on the hot sand on the beach .
I currently work with children with disabilities and I love it !
I 'm good at improvising games for children , and I 'm a good cook too .
If you only give me the opportunity to work for the camp , I will not disappoint you .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Today is the big day , the day of his presentation about acid rain and its consequences on the environment .
Peter did a beautiful presentation and now his mother is very proud .
Health is an important part of our lives , so our priority in our city is the environment , and people consider keeping our environment clean and work together for the preservation of the environment .
Therefore , the municipality put in place regulations and instructions to take care of our village .
Firstly , organizing collecting garbage . for example , red box for medical rubbish , because it is dangerous , it is toxic materials , yellow box for plastic , white box for glass , and pink box for other trash .
This facilitates classification of garbage and transfers each sort of rubbish to a specific place .
Secondly , recycling waste . After collecting it , they then transport it to factories to recycle it into useful materials we can use again in all aspects of our lives .
Lastly , workshops about conservation of the environment to increase environmental awareness among people , to encourage them to take care of their city , and teach them how they can recycle some rubbish to make useful objects to use at home .
In addition , many residents in our town have launched initiatives which target cleaning up our village , and planting a lot of trees on the streets to keep the environment clean and protect our generation from pollution . In addition , to attract tourists to visit us . As a consequence , increasing the number of visitors to our town , and reducing pollution which causes various diseases .
Furthermore , this saves on the cost of treatment because of the decreasing number of patients .
In conclusion , we look forward to our village being free from pollution and keeping our health and enjoying fresh air where our children will grow up .
To achieve his goal , he trained a lot with one of his colleagues and he gave no importance to the judgements that people had about him and his ambitious desire for victory .
Either way , he had an enemy who was trying to extinguish his love of running and get him out of the competition .
The internet is the best means of communication .

In conclusion , the internet is making things better and easier ; life now is always connected to the Internet .

I have liked swimming since I was young , and when I grew up , I told my mum that I wanted to compete in competitions .
The first time , it 's difficult , like any other sport , because you do n't know and you have to improve by yourself , but if you like it , you will find it fascinating .
Also , I remember my first competitions . I did n't win . I came 4th , but I was n't sad because I thought that the next time I would do my best and probably I would win .
Last year I won the national competition in my country and that makes me feel so good , because it 's all I want .
These days , almost 80% of people have assured feel concerned about their bodies and their diet . Because of this , they promised me that they will try to improve their daily diet and they will do sport more frequently .
In Tampico City the most important landmarks are the squares in Tampico . The best shopping centres are mall Altama ubicate in Tampico center and the beach Madero . The most important parks are Carpenter 's lagoon and my favorite restaurant is Child 's in mall Altama .
In conclusion , I 'd like to offer my help if anything is necessary .
Myths and fables are always my favorite types of stories , because they can either be easy to understand or extend to deeper matters .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a story by discovering its background first , is n't it ?
Amount of tradition and legend nowadays somewhat refers its context , such as Homer 's " Odyssey " , the flood mentioned in the Bible , and especially Mesopotamian civilization .
Therefore , I am trying to find out more information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusion , I hope that Riyadh city will be more interested in traffic jams .
If the government pays attention to improving the streets , decreases the use of cars , provides other transportation , and controls traffic jams by using police , Riyadh will become a great city so the people wo n't worry about going out .
My name is Andreia . I am 27 years old . I am a very friendly person and I have experience in this area .
Last summer , I worked with children aged 10 years old for a month and I organised some activities on the beach , such as football games and gym classes .
I like cooking very much and I think that there are some activities that we could do in the kitchen , like baking cookies or making fresh bread .
For another think I can speak English very well , because I studied English at university although I am Portuguese .
I hope you consider my application and contact me ,
In the future , this tendency will continue and there will be more and more specific social networking sites between business and personal life .
In order for this to happen , looking out for new social networking sites designed for our particular goals .
Taking the place of general networks like you find on Facebook , you will find sites are specializing and aimed at individuals , businesses and society .
Using cars to fulfill our transportation needs within the city limits is a very good option for many of us . However , the necessity of travelling overseas or even outside of our suburban areas might require a different sort of transportation . Therefore , this is where public transportation should be focussed since long trips taking longer than a simple commute in the city would require it .
It has been a popular American tradition for many years now , since the mid-60s that we all use cars owned by private parties in order to meet our needs . Hence , it has been considered the " modus operandi " ever since .
A new thinking might help to address this issue : transportation itself , perhaps , is in need of evolution . That might be the use of public transportation , it has proven to be the best means to get to places the roads and geographical areas of which might happen to be unknown to the traveller .
You can see modern clothes while you eat in a restaurant and you can take photos of TV stars , because they shop in this shopping center and you feel like a star , because you see a famous person and you think that you are in a film .
The plot of the movie is set in a small town where everything has its own eyes and because of that you must be aware of your behaviour .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen , but to your surprise , it always turns out to be something unexpected .
Despite the fact that there is n't any Hollywood star , all the characters are played very believably and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
Sometimes I felt that the background songs did n't match with what was happening , but after all you are in expectations of next step so you would n't mind it .
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see unpredictable situations happening and likes the feeling of the unknown .
In toward to the modernization of life and technology , people believe in different perspectives of their way of life , but the majority of ones are totally utopian .
Everyone wants particular objects and individual life , as an egoistic human being . However , the real world hasn't got the capacity to support these ideas .
In the biggest cities around the world , the traffic is nonstop and increasing every day .
If public transport were of higher quality , faster and with lower fares , the majority of citizens would prefer it : it is calmer to relax and read a newspaper or a magazine during the journey on mass transport than in individual transport ; moreover , the time spent to go and come back would be reduced , because it promotes fewer carriages on the railway .
Thus , in the future , public transport will be more attractive than private and individual transport .
It has both advantages and disadvantages .
Also , the possibility of learning at home is a big advantage , especially for people who prefer peace and silence .
Then it 's better to concentrate on learning and we do n't feel any pressure or stress connected with questions and tests .
On the other hand , learning on the internet in the long term we could feel bored or lonely . School gives opportunities for learning in groups when students can help each other and solve problems .
Another disadvantage of learning on the Internet can be problems with the Internet connection .
He has lived in the shadow of his brother , the leader guitarist and one of the most important guitarists ever .
But why did I write this article about someone who seems to be a simple guitarist . The reason is just one : the life of this man who one day just disappeared from the fans ' sight .
On April 2014 he was unable to give a performance .
Live you only have one life , today . Perhaps tomorrow you will lose everything .
When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball .
It taught me the meaning of teamwork and leadership .
I kept playing basketball continuously for 4 years , till I went to secondary school .
My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never give up and always keep playing till the last minute .
Relationships can be very different .
Our family are people who will love us , and who do n't look at situations and who we are .
Television and other things invented by technology are part of our lives .
I think every family has got a television in their own home and , for example , I have 4 televisions in mine .
For me , television has advantages and disadvantages .
There are a lot of interesting TV programs where we can learn something and there are also intriguing television programs .
These are advantages , but we can also have disadvantages from them .
For example , we can become addicted to our television .
In general , I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and TV and other similar things are responsible for our problems with health and eyesight .
So , television has positive and negative aspects and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
I like cricket . It is the best of all the sports . Cricket is a good mind - refreshing game .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He picked up the phone and dialled the number of his girlfriend , Lisa .
They had a car accident , and fortunately he was n't injured , but his friend Sam was unconscious .
I live in the beautiful city of Siena , which is famous for its landscapes .
The museum of the Duomo is the best tourist attraction .
One of her favourite things to do is drawing . She has lots and lots of special pens , crayons , highlighters , paint .... As you see , she is good at drawing .
Some people usually do cycling for relaxation .
But when I understood how much happiness this game gives me , I started more running and training .
Before starting to talk about the members of my family and if they are my best friends or not , I just want to say that my family is the thing I love most in my life . I respect them , appreciate them also , and I think they are the best thing in my life .
Finally I want to talk about my cousins . I love most of them , especially the cousins of the same age . They are my friends . I love them so much , and also the rest of my family .
I would like to inform about correction of my family name in the result sheet .
My family name is WONGWATJANAKUL but the result sheet is WONGWATJANAKAKUL , which is incorrect .
Sport is very important for our bodies . It has many benefits to improve ourselves and give us self - confidence , so we should practise any sport we love because it can change our minds for the better .
About me . I like playing volleyball and I enjoy this sport when I play it because of its being useful for my body .
When he was just about crossing the finishing line , he got hurt and his muscles were dying and started to peel off a black matter . At that point , the guys in suits thought that he would n't be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running . They froze the time and ran after him . He stopped for a moment , but then he started running again and when he crossed the line he woke up in a red somber fluid . He was wiped from the matrix . He opened his eyes and saw a flying robot , suddenly he was in a wooden wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again . Despite that , he stood up and tried to walk again .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I like this game very much . It is a very useful game . It helps me to keep fit . I started playing basketball many years ago . I want to be a very famous basketball player .
basketball needs a person to be tall enough to play it . I like basketball because it makes me happy , fit , gives me self - confidence and makes me active . If someone wants to play basketball , he should do a lot of exercises and try to be able to play it , because everything is difficult at first , but he should n't give up .
There was an island that each year in a particular month suffered a hurricane . This island is located on the equator . People go to this island these days but they ca n't go when there is a hurricane , because they could die in the hurricane .
The island was flooded but the island had a levee that prevented flooding . Then after many years , an engineer started constructing a building to have more money than in the city . He put many advertisements on all things : balls , balloons , movies , etc .
The engineers needed help to construct the building . They called a professional to see what was wrong .
Then the professional said that the island has expose with the ocean .
Then the engineers called another sector to ensure the doubt about Atlantis . Then the professional said that the other professional was correct .
Then they drank a coffee that give them a lot of energy to construct the building faster . This coffee has an ingredient so that people can live all night .
But the engineer ignored this situation . Then a helicopter came to save the residents .
This helicopter had humid .Then the helicopter started to rotate in the whole island . Then the helicopter sank in the water . Then the hurricane ended and the engineers started to distribute food and medicine .
Then the engineers discovered that the eye of the hurricane was widespread all over the island and that the island was a hemisphere . Then in the city , qualify to the people that work in this building .
When I started to study here in Australia , I found the difference in curriculum compared to my home country .
In my home country , when I was at university , it has quite easy for me to follow the educational policies .
The learning style is a traditional learning style that is usual in my country .
In addition , the type of examination is more on memorization , that I can use my own language that help me to understand it easier .
" In particular , many international students are too teacher dependent and uncritical of material that have been thought , prone to role memorization , they misunderstand the cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack knowledge of the genres of academic writing " .
In contrast , in my present learning , it is absolutely crucial .
The academic style is more about critical thinking , and it is hard to cope , because I need to understand it using their language .
Clearly , multiple factors have had major influences on the nature of the student population attending universities and how this shift affects , and is affected by , university policy and practiced are important issues .
As an international learner , I embraced these changes in my learning strategies , primarily because these new learning strategies of academic style are important for my future course .
It has challenged me to adapt to a universal approach to the learning style back in my country .
It 's a bookseller called " A droga da obediência " whose author is Brazilian .
The story is about five friends that begin investigating drug trafficking happening inside a school .
However , one friend disappears , then the four friends decide to discover where he is .
It 's a mystery story with a moral , because to the reader 's surprise , the headmaster was the drug dealer that produced the drug in the classes .
The moral is about students not being naïve and being careful of unscrupulous men that sell drugs .
In Poland we have a lot of interesting places to visit .
Poland is an amazing and interesting country .
If you have experience of cooking , you will be the right person for this job .
However , I think that it is not an easy thing to achieve because of the limited information about scholarships .
In addition , I work as a civil servant who should follow the government rules .
Actually , I do n't give up and always look for opportunities .
In other words , it can change our paradigm and mindset to better perspectives .
Everything is possible as long as we make an effort .
Travelling is an essential in everybody 's life .
Although the number of cars is increasing day by day , most people travel via public transport . Their limited income restricts their ability to buy cars .
Also , the main drawback of cars is environmental pollution .
Therefore , public transport has its own importance .
In order to avoid environmental pollution , people should use public transport . That will not only help to reduce the pollution , but also the extra expenditure on petrol .
The government should focus on the improvement of public transport and must discourage individual cars .
It 's always great to hear from you and I hope that everything is going well .
In my country , weddings are celebrated from Spring to Autumn .
My advice for travelling in Spain is that there are several types of transport but the most economical is public transport , the most expensive transport is a taxi , for example .
My advice for finding work is a bit complicated because , nowadays , there are a lot of people without work .
He was very handsome and he sang a magnificent song for me .
This restaurant had received many awards in China before it opened in Jakarta .
The building of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if you compare it with the other restaurants in PIK .
Besides that , the public room is also clean and comfortable , but I recommend you to choose the private room to accommodate our farewell dinner .
Huang Ji Huang specialize in a stew pots menu , which will allow you to enjoy authentic Chinese food .
You can order a set menu that Huang Ji Huang offers or you can also choose the ingredients that you want for your stew pot , but you must choose 3 to 5 ingredients .
Mala Sauce is a spicy flavor and it is very authentic and you will rarely find this taste in another restaurant .
Every month , Huang Ji Huang always have a special offer for their customers , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give a 20% discount to customers who spend 500 IDR or more , for complete information you can check on the website or call the restaurant .
And I highly recommend you to make a reservation first if you decide to hold our dinner here , because this place is always crowded and we also need a private room .
And also we could n't choose programmes .
I guess every child wants to investigate the world .
Moreover , they think that controlling pollution is possible .
These kinds of weapons do not kill one or ten , but destroy a large town completely .
In my opinion , using nuclear power is important for the great development in human life . Countries have to establish this energy and other sources to secure power for people .
Yesterday , I was surfing the Internet and found an amazing site www.bargainstime.com .
There were so many trendy clothes at attractive prices .
Immediately , I did some shopping there . I bought a pair of skinny blue jeans and a tight black dress .
In 2009 , Michel lived in New York with his girlfriend , Ann , in their own apartment .
Everything was organized .
Another reason why travel by plane is my favourite is because it is more comfortable to sleep unless you have a loud person close to you .
A VERY GOOD RESTAURANT WHOSE SPECIALITY IS " TAPAS "
You can eat small pieces of different dishes and have dinner or lunch inexpensively .
For more than thirty years , in Nerja has been openend every day " Big Fish " , a traditional restaurant with the typical cuisine of the coast of Málaga .
This restaurant only has one little problem .
The rest of the dining room is exclusively for eating meals .
Discussions about genetic manipulation become heavy when a specific area is mentioned : genetically modified food or GM food .
For several decades , the population has been discussing arguments for and against GM food .
Improving human nutrition and agriculatural conditions are arguments of those who are in favour of manipulation .
In conclusion , we can see that sales went up every time except the third quarter when they were unchanged .
I enjoy playing it , particularly because it is a competitive sport and because you play with a team and not alone , and this , for me , is really important .
Some people think that football is a bad thing because the footballers are all stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , but it is n't like that .
OK , there are some fans who are n't good people , but the major football associations are trying to stop them and to abolish all bad things in football .
Like every year , on the twenty - third of April , the day of the book , in my school all the students in the fifth and sixth years of primary school do a short story competition and the winner gets a prize .
The prizes are usually a book and a ticket to the theme park in Madrid , and the children who have participated win a book .
I think my town really takes care of the environment , because there are a lot of parks in this town and they are very clean .
However , some people do not care about the environment . That means some people throw garbage away in the park .
I think after eating something in the park cleaning up after themselves is good .
However , not everyone does that , so how much the public authorities care about the environment is important and this town cares about that a lot .
There are many sports grounds , for example , tennis courts , football pitches and play equipment for children , so I think my town takes care of the environment . That means everyone will be able to the in be best condition in both mind and body a for long time .
In particular , there are a lot of green areas . These makes good health .
The town has to do that and I think in England there are so many green areas all around , so a lot of people take care of these and that creates a good environment .
This movie is based quote unquote on a " true story " , but obviously director Michael bay known for the transformers franchise puts a lot of Hollywood into this movie . It 's about a bodybuilder named Daniel Lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his property , which obviously is not a great plan that backfires on him , and eventually the police get him .
It 's a great funny movie , especially for someone like me who enjoys going to the gym and lifting some weights .
To get to Big Ben , we took the underground , but to get to the London Eye , a red bus .
My favourite sport is volleyball .
Generally , sports are growing our minds continuously .
I do n't find any difficulty doing it .
My favourite sport is basketball .
Usually I only play basketball at school .
Do you know why I enjoy my sport ? I will tell you why . Because when you play you have fun and interested .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our lives . Families definitely play an essential role in society . According to the experts , we ca n't create a successful society without creative families , and another specific part of our lives is good partners surrounding our daily activities .
One of the main advantages of family is the recognition you are given at a specific age . Children require special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family . For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education or job and not adapt to society .
Consequently , they probably fail to experience from their lives .
Moreover , families play an essential part in protecting their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflects on their performance toward country , leading to effective , creative and useful civilians .
Public transportation
I think nowadays it is more common that people use their car for their normal activities , but the statement that there is no future for public transportation it is not completely true . I think that a lot of people use public transportation because it is cheaper and some people do n't have enough money to buy a car .
Another reason is that , here in Mexico , in some cities , you ca n't use your car on specific days , so if you do not have another car , you have to use public transportation .
Well , my college has an organization called Enactus .
I 'm a member of it and its goal is to improve the positivity of our society by setting up projects that serve many people who really need our help .
We entered 2 national competitions in 2 years and won second place for one of our projects and gained 2 leagues for other ones .
We made our university proud , plus we helped people .
Now , there are over 180 members in this organization and the number is increasing .
We need more of this type of organization across the world and there are a lot of students ready to help and wishing for a chance to make our society a better place .
Does why , it is easy to believe that if things continue at this pace and transforming everything , in the near future , in 50 years , everything is going to be completely new and different .
The lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future .
Because of that , everything was kind of similar and static for many years .
But then industrialization came and , with that , technology , so ways of life started to change and everything started to go faster .
As I said before , because of technology , many things have become possible in less time , and with the passage of the years , this has tended to increase .
For example , sharing knowledge and experiences means that everybody can do or apply things and develop faster .
It also means that research can be shared easily or , for example , you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as well , so you can react faster and make some changes .
Another example of why lives are going to change completely in 50 years is because , also , that connection with other cultures makes people more concerned about their own health , their expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because every day it will be easier to see how much we are hurting the earth , so we will see faster the impacts that this has on our lives .
Last but not least , family perception , has been changed and for that time everything will be different because it will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kids .
I studied in Kuwaiti schools . After that I went to Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine . I graduated from it in 2008 with a very good grade , then I got the Master 's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university ( Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with an Excellent grade .
Now I 'm working in voluntary positions , like translation , editing in Wikipedia & others .
This premonition can not hold more true .
Traveling on public transport can be cumbersome and quite eventful .
You get the convenience of traveling at your own pace and stopping when you please .
This suggestion is controversial .
On the one hand , society is becoming increasingly fat and some kinds of warnings could be useful to remind them to eat healthily .
The companies who produce products with harmful ingredients are very powerful , so that this suggestion is very hard to enforce .
The aim of this report is to provide an assessment to relocate the current campus canteen to a location that would be more accessible for all the students . Hence , it will hopefully prove both the profitability of the canteen and the important role it plays for all the students on the campus .
Suddenly he understands that he has heard a noise so he decides to stay in the cave away from danger .
He decided to take the penknife that he had in his bag , and he was successful in killing the bird of prey .
After two long days , Jonas gets home safe and sound and tells everything about his experience .
As all of us know , today 's generation prefers everything to be their own .
It will automatically diminish its presence .
As our country is developing , there will be a time when each and every individual will be self - reliant and will definitely prefer having their own vehicle to commuting from one place to the other .
The police came with a big investigation .
the investigation accused them and investigate prison .
The policeman was sham feom the gues and he apologised .
television serves the dual purposes of entertaining and educating people . In order to cope with the competitive world and get recognized in the corporate world , one must strive hard , which in turn increases their stress levels .
Television has become one of the means to reduce stress levels . Besides providing entertainment , television has also become a source of information .
I have applied to your University and I am still waiting for an answer .
Also , I have not had an invitation to an interview yet .
I am sorry if I have not understood your previous e - mails .
Well , I 'm Sebastian Vega and I 'm studying engineering sustainable development .
Consequently , gorvernment has started to support and take care of public transport .
People are unpleasant because all of is is bad quality , so governments ought to update it with new technology which protects the environment .
Restaurant review
This restaurant is excellent !
They wear black and white clothing like the decoration of the establishment .
The atmosphere is very friendly .
This restaurant would be the best for our class .
The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the countryside with the lake .
In the summer around the lake there are so many concerts so you have difficulty finding the right one .
Nowadays , there is very little public transport . The general public prefer much faster and more convenient ways of traveling around . Though public transport is used in major cities to avoid traffic congestion , it is widely recognized that public transport is eco - friendly .
Some public transport like trains do not pollute as much as cars or motorbikes .
Many people say that public transport is not comfortable . That 's true . From my point of view , a bus is not so uncomfortable .
Many people like travelling by car , but it pollutes a lot more than going by public transport . Public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motorbike , it also pollutes less than them .
Public transport is also used by children like me who want to go to school , high school or to university .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some slight disadvantages . It 's also very useful for some people .
In the evening , I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them .
I would feel more energetic throughout the day If I had some busy or tight - scheduled work . I came across your advertisement for this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every respect , because I have a friendly rapport with people around me . I would be pleased to receive your positive reply .
My town tries to take care of the environment , but sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have any awareness of the need for a good environment .
Neither do they seem to take care of nature and everything around them .
However , that is n't protected by the government and its institutions .
Local Parliament haven't regulated principles or rules for the environment , so ecosystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminated and pollution has increased in my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions have allowed some foreign enterprises or corporations to take our own resources without demanding that they be careful with the environment .
This is clearly a symptom of how my town does n't care about any element of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade , some neighborhoods have become conscious of their context .
In this way , we can see that their population have so much control and they know that affects them .
Good management of the rubbish is a new trend in many neighborhoods of my town .
The recycling of plastic , paper , cardboard etc , by the population of the biggest neighborhoods in my town is a way to improve the environment .
In my opinion , this sport teaches us to be mature , because , in addition to setting up the person physically , it instructs the mind .
Most people prefer large colleges to small colleges for their many advantages .
In addition , they have a lot of facilities that serve students , like kindergartens that take care of the children of the employees , university housing , a hospital the students of medicine can be application in and it serves the people too , and a big library which has many books in various languages .
Besides that , they have some services like transport for students and faculty , some restaurants , and a mini - market .
In addition , the location of large a college is clear and in the center of the city , so that is it easily accessible .
In the end , large colleges admit larger numbers of students , so the students may establish more friendships with people of different nationalities . Also they serve the community by qualifying many students in various majors .
We visited the Tower of London , Buckingham Palace and the wax museum .
The organisation has reached its current position because of people like you .
We are looking forward to seeing your participation in the Organisation after six months .
My favorite sport is basketball .
Almost every weekend , I go to the playground to play basketball with my classmates .
Furthermore , I watch NBA matches on TV every day .
I am quite interested in how the stars are getting on .
Insufficient ESP teaching skills made teachers pull back to general English .
This should also become the ED UMM commitment .
A new substance , called CPH4 , destined to be distributed around Europe and the United States by which a full bag was put into her stomach by illegal clinical surgery .
But everything went out of control for the criminals when one of her captors kicked her in her abdomen . The substance spills through her body and she begins to experience a different state of consciousness in which she dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almost 100% of its capacity .
During this time , she contacts Samuel Norma , PhD , the Professor of a university , to ask him what happens if a person reaches 100% of their mental activity or IQ .
The government are opposed to investing in public infrastructure , because the benefits are lower every year .
The impact of this has huge consequences for climate change . In the future , the global pollution will increase according to the level of cars .
Travelling by car is very bad .
By using public transport we protect the environment .
On the other hand , public transport pollutes less than the car but the car is very comfortable and not be hour hard .
With a car , I feel more free as I do n't depend on other people to get to the destination .
The current system is not sustainable .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had to buy a present for his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sunday and all the stores were closed , so he had to find a solution .
Finally , he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend 's house .
If you do n't want to experience this situation , you must always do things on time .
I think public transport is better for the environment because going by public transport reduces the CO2 emissions and removes traffic from the streets .
It is a true statement about cars . Travelling by car is so much more convenient and the new technologies apply to the
Easy availability also tempts us to fast foods .
University education is good for students but they also need to learn industry - specific skills .
New skills like analytics and data management are in demand .
In my opinion , what is expected is a new role for teachers and not their disappearance from classrooms .
At university level , the availability of IT training , software and manuals provides an ever accessible source of information that otherwise would not be to hand .
For example , India has a high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embarrassment about being Indian .
Nowadays , the internet represents the whole of the knowledge that people have collected over the centuries .
So it provides a lot of interesting information , one example of which is about how different machines work , which can be found at www.howstuffworks.com .
Also , the ' internet ' nowadays helps to get information from all over the world , and if you wish to get involved , then go to www.bbc.co.uk . These sites are a free way to find the most relevant information about current events , both in society and technology .
When I arrived at home , I started to read the newspaper , so I found out from there that The International Student Magazine have organized a short story competition , and I decided to call Michael to tell him about this contest .
After I decided to go with him to the contest , I was thinking about going to that contest next year to participate in and win that contest , so this year I was wondering what the program was like .
When we arrived there , the emotions started to appear so definitely it was time to drink a hot coffee , before the contest started .
" Golem " , as we all know , are magical creatures made from mud and having black rocks for eyes which can be brought to life by an incantation .
These days , an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenience .
There are three main reasons for supporting my idea .
Firstly , for long - distance journeys , the car is not as convenient as airplanes ,
In contrast , travelling by airplane just takes you two hours , and you can get to your destination .
Secondly , owning a car is not a normal thing for most developing or undeveloped countries .
The great number of people using private cars leads to higher levels of air pollution , and public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing air pollution .
Nowadays , public transportation is available almost all around the planet . We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century , but due to globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in continuous transformation .
On the other hand we must mention how the plane sector has been growing . Currently it is the most common mode of transport for going away and that also means that shipping manufacture has decreased deeply , in order to let the plane market boom .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choices like cars , motorbikes , buses , trains , but also , as we were saying , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used mode of transport is the car as most families have one , but public transportation is getting more and more common for those who want to preserve the planet and develop other alternatives more respectful of the planet .
As we were saying , the new ecological movement is increasingly more powerful and charismatic . Due to that , bikes are also increasing their role in the new age . They are also linked to the new fashion of being a hipster .
In conclusion , we are seeing a new tend in transport . Increasingly , they are faster and more developed , with the latest technology included , but in contrast , we find also a contradiction , as we found another trend for traditional transport which avoids pollution in order to respect the Earth .
I agree that commuting by car is easier and faster than most public transportation . However , there are serious problems that come from it . The number of vehicles on the roads keeps increasing and causes congestion and pollution , which are far more severe than the inconvenience caused by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future of public transportation will be more prosperous .
Then , if you want , we could go to the restaurant in the city .
Also , I believe that lifeguard could be a good job , because , in summer , the people go to the beach and they need lifeguards .
If I were you , I would choose to be a lifeguard , because lifeguards earn more money than waiters .
If you want , we could go to the capital city of my country . We will go by car because a car is cheaper than the bus or train . We could eat in the famous restaurants of the city or we could go to the cinema . Also , if you want , we could visit the medieval wall .
Mobile phones are the most important thing in our daily lives . They are the most effective method for instantaneous communication .
Moreover , their concentration is reduced .
Another serious problem is people are creating relationships with unknown people , and this can lead to several issues including crimes .
Public transport is generally the transport system provided by the government for the general populace .
Alcoholism is a disease that affects many people in the world today .
Moreover , alcoholics should go to the doctor in order to get well .
In conclusion , alcoholism is a serious problem for all of society .
Interstellar is a new Christopher Nolan movie which has the participation of some Hollywood stars , such as Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon .
Public transport has a big role in transportation especially in large cities like the capital city of countries . Using a car sometimes causes traffic jams if everyone uses their own car . To avoid this , a good road network is needed . Also , the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation .
On the other hand , public transportation takes more time to get to the required destination , because public transport takes a long route to get to more places and as more people take advantage of it , public transport is usually crowded and is not on time .
For that reason , using your own car is more convenient than public transport . You can travel whenever you like and wherever you want .
On school days , I get up at 5 a.m. and go jogging in my neighbourhood for 15 minutes .
My favorite sport is basketball .
I know that I am not a professional player and I do n't belong to any team , but I like this game . Basketball is so simple play but it needs speed , concentration and the ability to determine distances . It consists of two teams of five players and each team tries to get a point by throwing the ball through the basket .
What I like most about this game is that the smallest number of players can play it , even two players . I recommend everyone to try it , especially with their friends or family .
Nowadays , people live in a very modern and fast society and try to have as convenient a life as it is possible .
One of the many possibilities for making our lives more convenient is to use cars rather than public transport .
From my point of view , the main disadvantages of public transport , which make our lives uncomfortable , are time and place limitations , sharing the space with others , lack of free seats .
On the other hand , people should think about the environment , pollution , global warming , which are all currently warning .
We should think of a better future and try to be environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge amount of pollution which is caused by cars and not think only of our comfort .
Suddenly , I thought my gift was gone . The students said they did n't take it , but I doubted them , so we quarrelled .
I offered an apology out of harm students , but fortunately they did n't get angry with me .
Personally , I agree with your parents .
In the future , you 'll have to pay a lot of money for university , a new home and so on , and I think you should start saving money . I should do it too , but it 's not easy , actually .
Everything seems so beautiful in the shops !
In fact , in some overdeveloped countries maybe it will disappear , because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
Collecting books is my favourite pastime .
The first item in my collection was an ABC book .
And now , I have a lot of books of all kinds : biology , chemistry , novels , dictionaries , etc .
Whenever I find an interesting book , I buy it immediately .
I classify them into different categories : manual , cookbook , biography , etc .
This is the first text I would like to write on this website . I think it is a good idea to contribute to English language research and improve my skills at the same time .
Public transport is more convenient than cars in many ways . When we use public transport that benefits in many ways .
Maintaining cars is expensive .
Travelling by car is convenient but there are disadvantage as well .
As our population is growing fast , in a family both husband and wife are working and children at university are able to drive , so you are looking at at least 3 cars per household , so imagine how busy our roads will be .
Stopping public transport is not going to gain anything , and the impact will be unpredictable .
I think sport is good exercise for people who need to exercise . I have a suggestion for people that want to have good health : choose an interesting sport and try to play it , let it be a regular thing , it will be fun and healthy for your physical constitution .
Michael had just realized that he had n't heard the alarm clock , so he got in a panic immediately : - I ca n't arrive late for work .
-Everything is in order , it seems that finally I 'll arrive on time .
Does basketball have the fame that it deserves ?
Nowadays , basketball is the sport which rules in the USA .
90% of Americans want to be a basketball star , with the dream of playing with Lebron James , Pau Gasol , Marc Gasol ...
According to the results of a questionnaire ( Houston inhabitants ) most of them play basketball to forget homework , problems and to relax in their free time .
Also , they think that the main reason for their preference instead of other sports which is more intense .
However they think that basketball is only a reason to meet all the family , friends ...
Furthermore , they give advice to all those novices at basketball " do n't ever lose the passion " , because if they give up , they wo n't play with the biggest players in the world .
In conclusion , the real objective of the questionnaire consists of what the people think about the king sport of the United States of America .
It gives me a sense of achievement . For these reasons , I would like to it do every day .
There is a good restaurant in my town and I think you will like it .
It is a friendly restaurant with a nice menu .
I like the people who serve there and the decoration is pretty .
Public transport has advantages and disadvantages . i will start with the disadvantages .
First , public transport is neither comfortable nor safe .
Public transport is very crowded , so you may not have a seat . I hate public transport because I was attacked by a madman once . also taxi is not a good mode of transport . I hope I have my own car soon to avoid public transport . Travelling in your car makes it easier and better .
The advantages might include that it has a low price and might rescue you if your car is not working .
I am writing with regard to your outsourcing service because I am currently having a problem with my accounted . For this reason , I am looking for a new service that can help me .
I would appreciate it if I could arrange an appointment with you to find out about your service .
I 'm a really sporty person . I love different sports . I think that it 's something that is great for your body and your metabolism , Did you know that doing exercise can reduce depression and increase the quality of your life ?
I think one of my favorite sports of all is athletics . I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself , you have to be better every day than you were yesterday . It forces you to improve every time . Also , it is an exercise that helps your whole body , especially the legs , because it gives them great strength , but also your hands , because they have to be in constant movement , and all the body in general , because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and helps you to have coordination .
I enjoy running a lot because it relaxes me . I let out all my worries and frustrations , so it makes me happy .
This is an introduction to how to make bank notes .
The first two step is to design them with background color artwork and security features and prepare metal plates using skilled machinists .
Then there are some requirements for printing sheets : color on both sides , special ink and images slightly raised .
The most essential and key process is manual inspection of printed sheets with three categories : good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets and bad sheets .
The acceptable and not damaged severely sheets are supposed to be packaged and distributed , which means they will be cut into separate bank notes , packed and then dispatched .
When I was a little girl I used to play volleyball and I really liked that .
Today I do not play volleyball anymore , but I really enjoy dancing . Now I can say that it is my favourite , it is all of .
The line graph shows the U.S. cigarette price in dollars related to cigarette consumption in billions of packs from 1970 to 2006 .
The hugest gap is in 1981 , when the cheapest price was combined with the highest expenditure on cigarette packs in the whole interval .
In approximately 1998 we can notice an equilibrium price at $ 2.75 and an equilibrium quantity at 23 billion packs .
I am very pleased to help organise sports activities .
The world is progressing rapidly . Day by day there are new modes of transportation , there is new technology .
From the beginning of the world till now , mankind has wanted a fast income and an easy way of life , so he tries more and more to find a solution to his problems by creating new ways of living more easily and more conveniently for him .
So , transportation is one of the most important issues facing mankind , because it is related to interaction between people , like trade and many other purposes .
Moreover , our capacity for learning more languages seems to be really adequate . Unfortunately , while there are a lot of teenagers that are working really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
I think it is probable that in some years the technology could have improved quite a lot , and this is a very powerful advantage for us , the young people .
Because we were born in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclusion , I 've got to say that now we do n't have to worry about the future , we just have to carry on in the present and do the best we can .
Nowadays the public transport system is running out of passengers due to heavy use of personal transport such as cars and bikes . In the early 1990s , the public transport systems were the most popular transport system across the world because , most people did not have their own vehicles . But in the late 1990s , most people were able to buy their own vehicle thanks to many financial institutions which have various loan facilities .
Today , many people use their own vehicle instead of public transport . The other thing is , it is an easy and convenient way to travel to work and any other personal work . , therefore , it can be seen that the demand for public transport is getting lower and lower .
In conclusion , it is true that the demand from the public is going down rapidly as they have their own vehicles .
I have seen the following announcement in International Sport Monthly magazine .
I had the opportunity to meet more about this sport .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream . Many ca n't get what they accomplished . Those players are very famous today .
Some people prefer playing together , but there are also competitions between players .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think that this class discussion ca n't be true .
Providing that we care about the environment .
My father is a businessman .
He works in real state investment .
My older brother is 30 years old and he is working as an accountant for a radio and television union in Cairo .
The last member is me . I 'm an aeronautical engineer in Qatar .
He is very helpful and collaborator .
My older brother helped us with studying , but he is older than me by 10 years , so the relationship between us is n't close .
The expansion of public transport is one of the keys to saving the planet , especially if the energy source used comes from clean sources .
Nowadays , the use of vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel is the main cause of air pollution in big cities around the world . Research shows that private cars are used , most often carrying a small number of people at a time , which makes it very inefficient considering the quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic substances emitted into the environment each time the engine is started .
From my point of view , the best thing the police can do with these people is send them to a reformatory until they can leave disciplined .
The flowchart provides an overview of the steps for making bank notes . It shows how bank notes are manufactured from design to a thing we can use .
First , should take some considerations in design , including background colour , artwork , security issues .
Next , skilled machinists is prepared , in which there are metal plates .
Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . Subsequently , the technical must be used specially for distinction , for example , the colour printed on both sides , special ink is used and images are slightly raised .
Depending on the quality of sheets , there will be two results . If the quality is good or the bank note is partially damaged but can be used , it will be cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and dispatched , while any bad sheets will be securely destroyed .
Describe a supermarket near your home
There are no very big supermarkets near my home , but there is a nice one .
There are some big shelves in the center of the supermarket that are divided into different parts for different kinds of goods , like dried fruit , nuts , flour , condiments , beans , grains , rice , etc .
Also , a section for detergents , tissues , perfumes , etc .
You can see some store fridges around the supermarket for drinks and dairy products like milk , yogurt , cheese , butter and cream . Also , chest freezers for ice creams . In one corner , they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find what they need .
I can understand how difficult this decision must be .
And I know which subject you 've always been interested in : music .
It is slow , inefficient and dangerous .
I prefer travelling in a car or by motorbike . I feel safe .
Comparing cars and buses , the car is more expensive than the bus , because the car is comfortable and faster .
I prefer travelling in the car .
He had a girlfriend called Sinha , who was a girl with a big heart but , unfortunately , a broken one .
One day , Michael decided to throw a surprise party for Sinha to make her happy and make her feel his love more , so he arranged everything and , to keep it a surprise for her , he was busy all the time and did not show off all week as usual . That made Sinha worried and she suspected that Michael did not love her any more and had met another girl , and she became extremely sad , and it got even worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to give her the surprise but he did not answer his phone after that .
When he came she started crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything . She started to cry louder and accused him of cheating . That made Michael astonished at how she did not trust in him , how she thought that about him , and he told her that he could not stand that anymore , he would break up with her , and he left . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
There 's no question which is my favourite restaurant in town : The Seaside . I will tell you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class , to have our last farewell dinner there .
Our class has changed over the years , with great classmates leaving and coming . We have always been welcoming , and not least towards the new ones .
I think the welcoming process in the beginning is crucial for this fellowship we have today and probably in 10 years too .
What I just said is what the restaurant , Seaside , means to me . Welcoming .
Fellowship .
-To begin this course , I want to be sure you know the meaning of art , so I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves , without any specific technique , only your imagination , and with this you will explain to me what art is .
After 4 days , they all came with spectacular pictures , portraits of people , large sculptures , apart from one student . Her name was Sandra . She arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , on which she had only written a name in a different style of letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing that everyone laughed at the work of his classmate , I can see that nobody understood the real meaning , since art is different for each person , each creates a different definition , so we must respect each person and understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art .
A student that really moved him , and reflect so apologetic , and went out of the room , closing the door , and Michael knew then that he had made a mistake .
Everyday I get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends . I exercise more and more to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world . I 'm a champion of my sport , so , I seek to put all my efforts into being the best in the world . Finally I did not have the encouragement of my family or my teachers .
I have to say that studying another language gives you more opportunities , because these days you need to know other languages to find a job and be more intelligent than your colleagues to get the work and that 's great .
And today it is necessary , because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversations with them , you need to know more than your native language , because in the rest of the world , and particularly in Europe , people know more than two languages and that 's great .
These days , most people feel comfortable travelling by car and so they believe that public transport is not going to continue for long .
However , I do not agree with them , because in most parts of the world mass transport systems are still popular and they are environmentally friendly and cost - efficient .
In most parts of Europe , people still prefer public buses instead of cars for travelling .
Secondly , public transport is environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicles .
Public buses prevent more cars from polluting the environment .
People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel to the same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , although the car is convenient for travelling , it is not enough to being an end to public transportation .
In the towns of the future , care for the environment will be one of the most important things .
People have conciencied themselves that they need to respect nature and the places where we live .
Human beings have destroyed our environment over time , and now the earth is in danger .
I have recently bought an electric car as a substitute for my traditional car .
An electric car is less harmful to the environment .
When I go out to the countryside , if I lunch there , I take care to clean the ground .
With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and makes people mature , whilst opponents claim that military service has effects on people 's studies and people should have freedom of choice .
If a war or other danger threatens the safety of a country they can not get help from other countries immediately .
In particular , some countries with small populations have a policy that people need to do military service to develop into a powerful country .
Secondly , it is important for people to become mature when they complete military service , which probably is a particular experience at 18 years old .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong . They seem to become mature earlier than other people who do not do military service .
Military service mainly improves physical fitness , but education might be completed better in school at that age because it has a professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere , people usually find it easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .
Additionally , critics argue that countries are able to allow people to have freedom of choice about military service .
Furthermore , it also can respect rights of people , especially women who are not able to adapt to the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people to improve themselves .
The best course of action would be for government to attempt to allow people to volunteer for it when they have completed their studies .
I really appreciate your encouraging us every time in class .
In our city , we have a billboard to urge people to pay attention to the environment .
In the schools , we set up a workshop to tell students how important the environment is to our lives .
So everyone brings the trash to the place permission .
In this hour , many people turn off the lights in their house to save energy and protect the environment .
I wish a lot of people around the world could see the importance of the environment .
I was in a museum in New York looking at all the beautiful paintings and sculptures , when I heared the museum alarm . Everyone was afraid , including me .
I carefully approached the window of the house and I saw two men with the paintings .
I located them instantly because I recognized their hats .
They threatened all the people cruelly , so all the sightseers were angry with them .
However , the layout of the terminal was unknown to me , so I was completely lost .
We got on a train . The ceiling was comfortable but everyone was complaining about the two men .
When we arrived , we were on the other side of the city of New York . The features were so common because it was a good economic and conveniently because it would attract more tourists .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had an interview to get a scholarship so that he could pursue his dream of studying medicine in Ireland .
After the bus arrived , he got on and half an hour later he arrived at the destination .
After waiting for an hour , the time came and , bravely , with a high confidence level , he walked into the office .
The interviewer who was sitting in front of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loved .
Peter , without hesitating , hugged the interviewer , who was a man about 40 years old .
I want the job at the summer camp . I will look after children between 8 - 12 years old . I will help to organise sports and evening activities and , if you want , I could work in the kitchen .
I want to do this course , because it will help me to enlarge my vocabulary .
Please , write me a list with the words that I need for technical conversation .
I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " The Crazy Cat " . It is a very good restaurant .
First , the restaurant has a wide variety of food .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed corn to start , beef medallion covered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts and the dessert is chocolate cake with cheese .
The atmosphere is also very good . It has live music with different bands .
The cost is reasonable .
Nowadays , it is the most important challenge for television .
People complain about how the information in different TV shows does n't contribute to the process of learning . That 's why many of these programmes are considered trash , because of the multiple shows such as reality shows , talk shows , or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people .
A good example of these shows are how people are paid to act in reality or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious family problems , where the only aim is to get a bigger audience .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that have appeared recently . This type of program is one where the information is often gossip about the personal lives of famous singers and actors without taking into account whether they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that only a few programs exist that try to educate people with the most up - to - date information through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help us to acquire more knowledge .
It is better for the people to be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person . I know some people , drivers , began haven't got work , but the public transport is free and is free because it is the government who pay . This money bacame do to make more work for others .
Not everything is good . Some people haven't got money and ca n't go to another place and the pollution is increasing . It is a serious problem and the solution is only for rich people . The solution is buying an electric car . The other solution , more economical , is for the government to give money to the people to buy an electric car .
Public transport is always crowded , so it is not comfortable to travel on .
In the end , only one person could be alive , even though those sacrificed tried to escape this horrible result .
Besides , the attractive storyline has a lot of climax , so that everyone can watch this film from the beginning to the end and this creates the billion box office to this film .
However , I think the props should be improved , such as the killer 's knife and the actors ' costumes . The knife looks as brittle as a handicraft , and I believe those are second - hand clothes . I think this is a pity in this movie .
I 'm studying medicine . This major is very challenging although stressful , because the self - study is every day and there is a lot of information .
This major involves everything . We always have to consider all the possibilities to complete homework , you have to know the maximum possible information to be able to complete it .
When you get the answer or solution , you can see that all the effort was worthwhile .
I have experience of going to the hospital and it was very interesting .
I could only oversee what they do to obtain visual experience and know what surgery was like .
Of course , studying in a foreign country also has disadvantages .
Even though there are lots of different possibilities and scholarships , not everybody can afford them .
It is a very useful experience in many ways .
I like travelling with my family and friends . I like travelling because I can get to know new people , places and cultures .
I do n't have a favourite subject , but l like English because we can communicate all over the world .
I like watching television , playing computer games and swimming .
My favourite types of film are science fiction , animation and historical .
My favourite types of games are adventure , war , historical and horror .
I prefer playing football to playing basketball .
I play basketball at school .
Carbohydrates are essential for a healthy diet .
Nutritionists recommend a quarter of a person 's diet should contain carbohydrates .
When your body takes in an insufficient amount of carbohydrates , the protein replaces the lack of carbohydrates to supply the body with energy .
Nowadays , I am studying for a degree in economics at the University of Barcelona .
I have some experience working with children aged between 5 and 17 years .
Now our company is going to do multidimensional operations , not just focus on furniture , but also on home appliances .
In addition , we will adjust the company 's management structure in each department depending on the market 's reaction and the environment .
And because we have our own factories and professional machines , we can easily avoid price competition .
For the factories , because the Chinese demographic dividends are not like before anymore , low price and undiversified products should become verity and premium goods .
Focus on user experience , inventive , unique and our core products
Therefore , we are reforming and making high - tech items , likes LEDs , photoelectric , vacuums , steam mops , etc .
Use this core technology to develop blow machine , air purifiers , irons , etc .
Besides , factories are keeping going on our professional items and service like , high glossy , auto painting and 4-side edge sealing , honeycomb board , etc .
All governments are increasing their policies and laws relating to this topic and they also promote new rules in the daily life of the population .
According to the general world laws about global warming , each country has considered its owns arguments about it .
These cities do n't allow people to drive in the city centre , and the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .
The town mayor has given the population a free bus .
I think , in conclusion , all people should have good behaviour and an open mind and they and myself also should take public transport more often .
The temperature was over 20 degrees .
After we came back , I told my family everything .
Environmental changes are really needed in the current situation .
People contribution is very important in this matter .
The report explains how my town 's people take care of their surroundings to preserve this planet in a better way .
Government policy changes help a lot with water preservation .
Many factories are following the regulations and not draining the harmful waste into the water .
People come forward and utilise these bins effectively instead of throwing rubbish away .
In addition to that , recyclable waste is sold and the money is given to the relevant person .
This gives motivation to the public and they can earn by using the right way to dispose of their waste .
Town council not only encourage people to plant trees or gardens , it subsidises their green improvements .
Example , free fertilizers , water pumps , and pesticides .
In summary , people take many initiatives and are moving forward to have a safe and attractive environment and surroundings .
This is an international sport because in all parts of world there are people that they play it .
Football is a famous sport . You can watch it on TV or you can see it live . There are a lot of level categories , the most famous category is the first .
Soccer is the best sport for me because you can get fit , meet other people and participate in competitions .
Because you are the best teacher in the whole world ! Many of our classmates really like you too ! We know that you are going to teach at Discovery - bay primary school . My English results are better since you taught me . I really love you , Ms Cumings ! Your friend Ms Decock told me that she is going to Australia , and I love you both . I hope you that you will come back sometimes !
The graph given shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream from two places at an English seaside resort from 2012 to 2014 . They are , respectively , an ice - cream van and an indoor public swimming pool .
In the case of the ice - cream van , it sold most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly reaching 5000 dollars and it was still slightly increasing year by year .
She put her cup of coffee on the windowsill , hooked up the brist on her beautiful little breasts , put right her colourful light - minded skirt , took her orange scarf and little red handbag and went to the door .
Nowadays , we constantly use means of transport to go everywhere so that our lifestyle .
We are used to travelling by car , and , in fact , every family has one .
Despite this , travelling by public transport can be a better option in so many cases .
Certainly , cities will be crowded in the future because the population is always increasing .
Unbearable traffic jams and no parking areas would be the main problems .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing too , and it is likely it will be so expensive that most people will not be able to afford a car .
In contrast , there will be cheaper alternatives like buses , trains or even planes for long distances .
On the other hand , many drivers enjoy travelling in their own vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free .
Finally , governments and society are concerned about the environment and I think that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emissions .
In my opinion , public transport will not disappear , even if cars are much more comfortable , faster and more evolved than now .
So we should be aware of the importance of time . I hope not to waste it and to make the best use of it to giving opportunity for rising . Those who waste it , will be left behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life .
The great men and successful guys became famous and rose through the suitable use of time . They a are guide and a source of inspiration for a new generation .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either helping you or against you , and the popular saying is right : " do n't put off the work of this day to the next day " because our work will accumulate . Then it will become harder to finish it . To ensure the best use of time in our lives , we need to be punctual . Punctuality avoids tension and trouble . Finally , even scientists have another vision of time . They have discovered that time is the fourth dimension through relativity theory , which exchange all concepts in science .
I love my town because , when I was a small girl , I went there , and I was with my grandparents , my cousins and my friends .
My best friend lives in Madrid , but we always used to be together in her house or in my grandparents ' house .
To begin with , the format of the bank notes needs to be designed . Factors for consideration include the background colour , the artwork and the security issues .
Secondly , equipment such as skilled machinists and metal plates have to be prepared for the next steps .
Thirdly , they print the sheets of bank notes ( 50 banks notes per sheet ) with special ink , where colour is considered on both sides and images will be slightly raised on the bank notes .
Most importantly , they manually inspect each printed sheet in case there should be damaged sheets .
Once damaged sheets are discovered , they individually separate them into good and bad ones and then burn the bad notes , making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality .
Good sheets are cut into separate bank notes , then packed and dispatched to other places , while the bad ones have to be destroyed securely .
The movie which I have chosen to write about is Microphone .
It is an Egyptian movie starring Khalen Aboelnaga and some young actors . The action of this film takes place in Alexandria , a city in Egypt , and it is about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they do n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of band is famous among young people and they call it " underground bands " . Their songs give a big concenet to the political and social situation in Egypt and they became famous after the 25 January Revolution . I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society . There is no chance for young people and if they find it , they face a lot of problems to save it and they do n't find time for other activities , and sometimes they work on something which they never learn from or love .
I live in a small town , and there are a few things that my town does for the environment : like recycling , for which we must know what material the things we throw away are made of , and put them in the right dumpster .
This is a small act for us , but if we all contribute , it will be a big help for the environment .
We can also use appliances that do not consume so much , if we can adopt sustainable electrical systems or buy organic products .
After six hours , we had lunch in a fast food restaurant in France .
It was interesting !
In the evening we had dinner in a particular restaurant and my friends and I took many photos of a famous sight .
I will never forget this experience !
It was a nice experience .
I hope it will be a good cat and a good experience for me .
my first job was as a babysitter .
I was the babysitter of those children for all that summer and I enjoyed myself so much with them .
This experience helped me a lot because I became much more responsible , not only with those boys , but also with my brothers and sister ( I have two brothers and one sister ) and I learned the meaning of working and earning money .
I did n't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful , and also because I had known them since they were born .
However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried her best to support my older brother , my older sister and me in completing our college studies . Of course , my uncle , younger brother of my mother lent a big hand to go through the hard times , so that made us often help each other in my family when a member was in difficulty .
In particular , I was the youngest member of the family , and I caused much more trouble when I was young .
I do really thank my mother and all the members of my family for being patient and exertion to me . Now we have a great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we have got not so easily .
So , are the members of my family my best friends?I'll answer you : there 's not much better answer than Yes !
How my town takes care of the environment
First of all , let me introduce my town . I live in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan .
This town is located in the central zone of Afghanistan with 4462(km² ) surface area , and has more than seven million inhabitants . The economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have a direct effect on how we care for the environment .
The most important factor in environmental improvement is the lack of the required knowledge among the local people .
Based on necessity , the people and government of this town together effectually take care of the environment .
The municipality of the town collects the garbage from the streets and roads and ships it to a
Fortunately , Kabul is surrounded by mountains and has a mountainous climate . This town has approximately 15 mm of rain per year . The remarkable agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect on Kabul 's environment and produces fresh air for the citizens of the town .
Doing sports is my hobby because I find it interesting and it makes me healthy .
Actually , there are a lot of kinds of sports that I like , but the most interesting sport for me is football .
I am interested in working with you .
This is an excellent opportunity for me because I want to work as an English teacher .
Later , I studied to be an English teacher at the university of Extremadura .
They learn and understand English very well .
I worked in the English holiday school this year and I have learned a lot through this experience .
I organized activities like sports , visits to cities , festivals , etc .
Yours Faithfully
There are so many sports in the world , like basketball , baseball , running , yoga , swimming , and so on .
volleyball .
First of all , exercising can make you
play it with someone , whether just for fun or for a competition , my body feels so hot in thirty minutes .
It seems to me a complete sport , because you can play it in pairs or in an individual way .
To be good at badminton you need to prepare yourself in a physical way but also the psychological part is very important .
Because if you are trying to win , you will lose the most important thing : discovering how wonderful playing a sport can be .
Nowadays , young people are influenced by the western culture , so they are getting more fashion - conscious . Youngsters are interested in wearing different stylish and colorful clothes . They are happy about wearing different color clothes . They do n't want to wear our traditional dress , such as sari , dhoti , choli and many more . They only like to wear shirts , pants , skirts , t - shirts and many more . Youngsters are influenced by watching different programmes on television .
Many classmates went to different sections of the sport .
After After one month , my instructor told me that I would enter the competition .
The day of the competition arrived and I went with others to show how I 'd practiced .
Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami . When I left I had a special feeling ; many people were looking and clapping .
I . I was very happy because it was my first competition .
After the end of the competition , we were all awarded medals and certificates .
Then as always , they played the Kazakhstan national anthem .
Sport has given me a boost of vitality , energy , and optimism and strengthened my immune system .
My most exciting day was June 8th 2014 ; an international competition in Belgium .
The day before , there were the qualifiers , which I passed .
The day of the finals , I was so nervous , but determined .
After the competition I was relaxed and happy , because I had done my job .
I am writing with regard to finding accounting services for my company .
I know that you have experience in searching got the best employees and you have quality .
I need my employees to be punctual and that they have responsibility in their job because we are talking about the money of the company .

Technologies are moving on at high speed .
As the technological world is moving fast , the automobile industry is also coming up with new types of cars & scooters that work in very economical way .
Buying cars and scooters is more convenient than in the last decade .
In a few decades , people 's earnings and lifestyles have also changed .
People now buy cars and scooters according to their convenience and pocket .
Previously , people used to use buses , taxis , autos for going to offices , schools , colleges , shopping etc .
Using private vehicles is more convenient for them than using public transport .
So public transport 's importance is decreasing every day .
If it so there will come a time when individual people will not be interested in public transport .
This has a tremendous impact on other aspects of life .
Fuel consumption has increased in a few years .
The number of cars and motorbikes is the reason for heavy traffic everywhere .
People do not even care about safety parameters while driving on the roads .
Public transport is a very useful resource . You can travel without polluting the atmosphere and it is very cheap .
Nowadays , we usually travel very often to many different places , so for us , it is more comfortable to travel in our cars , but for the atmosphere and for our wallets , it is n't .
It would be a great advance for people and for the atmosphere , and for countries as well , because we will save a lot of money .
I think that family members ca n't be friends because the relationship is very different .
Firstly , family is the basis of the relationship .
Secondly , although friendship and love are the most important feelings , the family structures the person and influences their behavior .
Although I have a good relationship with my parents , I could n't think of them as friends .
In conclusion , I think that the two relationships are different .
Perhaps I think that this statement is false because I think this statement should say that public transport is going to exist in the future because travelling by car is not so much more convenient .
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own seat and in the winter your car is hot and you can also listen to the radio .
On public transport , you do n't have your own seat , so sometimes you travel standing up , which is not very comfortable , and in winter you do n't have air conditioning , so if it 's cold outside , it 's cold inside too . Sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit the illness to you .
On the other hand , public transport does n't pollute , but the car pollutes , so , for us , travelling by car is better than travelling by public transport , but for the atmosphere , it is better to travel by public transport than to travel by car .
What makes me like learning new languages is how it helps me communicate with others easily . I also like traveling so much , as it makes me see new places and learn more about other countries around the world and their cultures and traditions . However , I do n't travel outside my country because I am a student and I do n't have my own money which I can spend on whatever I like .
About the pollution , technology , obesity and other things around the world .
But , these days , people think differently , and are starting to help the world and .
Also , TV , radio , the internet , big companies have advertisements about helping the planet .
Moreover , from kindergarten , schools are educating about taking care of the planet , simply by doing things like separating the garbage .
For example , the way of preparing food can be dangerous because a lot food has artificial things that are not good for us .
Technology has good thing and bad sides .
Technology is advancing very fast , in the best way . This is good for us because we will do a lot of things .
In conclusion , I think that we are on track for the next years .
No one can deny the importance of public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector transport .
And this importance of private transport is because private transportation provides a comfortable way to move from one place to another . Also , it helps to save time and reduce costs spent in public transportation .
Firstly , private transport provides a comfortable way to travel from one place to another without sharing with strange people and , by using this kind of transport , is also convenient because you are free to choose the time of a trip .
Secondly , it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting time waiting for a specific time to move or even waste time waiting for a public transportation vehicle to reach all the points it has to go to , but on the other hand , when you have your own transport or private transport , you get the right to choose the time of your trip or when you want to move or stay , and nowadays , we can not afford to waste our time taking public transport .
Finally , public transport involves more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , trains ) fares are increasing every year , and we do not face this problem with private transport .
In comparison with the Li Ren edition , the three children 's editions have some dissimilarities in plot , title , topic , character , language and so on .
We will discuss how to present the features in different aspects such as education , entertainment , literature and children .
Besides , an adaptation is connected with the Li Ren edition .
People from India and Pakistan coming to the UK significantly increased by around 10 times in 1970 , compared to 1940 .
Now I will talk about the Daruma , a Japanese restaurant that was a very good experience for me .
All the place was surrounded by a nice and warm atmosphere .
It was a sunny day , a special day in my life . the day was 29 October 2009 . That day I had a university admission test at Shajalaj university .
Before that day , I was frustrated , so it brings happiness to my mind .
There was no other option for me . I just wanted her . During the exam , I was thinking the whole time about how to communicate with her .
When the examination was over , again , I started to talk with her , asking her her exam was .
When I was returning from Syleth , I called the girl and talked to her and told her that I had got chance at university , but the girl said that she knew .
Please , give my congratulations to your cousin .
Well , weddings in my country are usually celebrated in a church .
The food is always in a big restaurant where we eat the best food in the city . I recommend you to come to a Spanish wedding .
Hello , I 'm Arnau and I am twelve years old . I live in Manresa ( Catalonia ) . I am very hardworking in high school and I 'm funny and very talkative and I 'm not freaky .
I 'm really into Ps3 , especially Fifa 15 , and a fan of riding a bike , but I do n't like computer games , they are very boring , but I like chatting on the internet with my friends . Sometimes I like playing on my Ipad .
I really want to meet boys and girls from different countries of the world . I 'm really interested in practicing English and I want to learn Chinese and Russian . I 'm really interested in learning languages .
Well , I will explain in this article about one museum that is considered " The Best in Mexico " , but why ?
In 1810 , there was a war for independence in Mexico and many people fought with other people . For example , Miguel Hidalgo is considered " The father of independence " and he fought with the Spanish monarchy .
The Museum is in Guanajuato , Guanajuato .
The museum is the most interesting place in my country because it describes the history of our country .
Being a two team sport makes the game competitive and interesting .
He is a good coach but he does n't like to buy experienced footballers .
Buying cheap footballers has wrecked the Arsenal team several times because of the lack of experience of the cheap players .
Coming to the infrastructure of badminton , it is all about the cock and the racquets .
At present , many people think that English is the world language and it is absolutely an essential skill to communicate with people from other countries .
For this reason , Taiwanese parents do not want their kids to be behind others . Therefore , many kindergartens have started to teach children English .
Everything seemed so fine , and nothing was wrong , anyway .
He loves music so much that he turned down other courses , just concentrating on music .
He learns how to compose and plays some kind of ancient instrument .
Television is one of the most useful inventions of the modern world .
It is a commodity which serves the dual purpose of both education and entertainment at one and the same time .
The TV shows broadcast on television play a vital role in shaping the thoughts of the viewers .
To tell the truth , shopping is so boring for men , particularly when they go to the store with women .
Shopping with women is nightmarish .
Nowadays , with technology , we have different ways to get around , like hoverboards , skateboards , and maybe it means there is no future for public transport .
Another point is that we have our own cars and it 's more comfortable . I do n't have to wait in line to buy tickets .
All that you need to become a runner is motivation and a plan .
That is what happened with me personally .
Motivation for me was a 15k race .
So to finish the competition with pleasure , I needed to work out a plan , which was a day - by - day diary of our jogging distance , time , and mood during our workout .
First of all , it is absolutely minimal . You just need boots for running !
My advice is : eat a lot of vegetables and fruit , drink plenty of water and run at least 3 times per week .
We can enjoy cricket with our friends by playing cricket and we can also have fun , entertainment .
Playing cricket gives relaxation and reduces stress .
I can give advice to people who are interested in playing cricket . They must know all the rules of cricket before playing it .
There are two desks with two computers , two chairs and two bookshelves with my brother 's school books and mine .
This sport is an individual sport , so you win alone and do n't beat a team , but if you play tournaments in pairs the one who wins is the team .
So you will become one of the most famous players in the world and you will win a lot of tennis tournaments , including the four slams : the Australian Open , the US open , the Roland Garros and Wimbledon .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
It is great when you are in a cup and go very far in the tournament .
When you play in a tournament you play a lot of football and you also spend a lot of time with your friends .
When you go far in a tournament , you have to play a lot of games .
If you are going to begin playing football , you need football boots . You also need protection for the legs .
I saw your advertisement in a newspaper .
I have also been a member of the association of tourism and ecology since I was 10 years old .
I have worked for a few different companies and associations in the past .
I really think that we should go to that new centre that you wrote about in your last email and do some of the activities .
But we could also try the climbing , but it would be better if we could climb outside , in the countryside .
Citizens want , at the same time , efficient and quick means of transportation , personalised solutions to meet their transportation needs , and the cheapest transportation costs .
This place has some restaurants and sports bar s where I can talk with Latinos and feel at home .
I think that public transport is much better for the environment than private transport .
I think that public transport is the future , because many countries will have to ban entrance to their towns for private cars to stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere , in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens .
So I do not agree with this affirmation . In my opinion , travelling by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than using public transport .
Maybe he is sorry she thought , but why if she is perfect , she is everything that a man could want . So what was happening .
-Are you ok ? - She says , a little bit afraid of his forthcoming word .
-I'm sorry - he repeats again , but more serious and with his normal face - It 's because , well it , was my first kiss OK ! ? I can fight with Bloutums , Dragons , Two - Headed snakes and everything that you can imagine .
Elizabeth seems to be a very sweet girl , but Jason is not convinced , because when he kissed her , he did n't feel anything , he did n't feel that the ground disappeared , and when his face turned red , he just put a face of horror and surprise , like she was very sorry for kissing him .
They stop in a dressmaker 's market .
- I 'm gon na give information to Lucresia .
- What kind of information ?
When they entered the dressmaker 's market , Lucresia was n't there .
-These dresses are made of textile fiber . Almost everything here is synthetic and wearable for everyone - explained Snow .
- Wow , everything is beautiful , it makes me feel like I am suspended in a dream or fairytale .
In the past , cars were only affordable for the upper classes , while for the middle class and lower there were not many choices for them besides walking and public transportation .
Once technology and the standard of living are improved , many people left the traditional habit of using public transportation and chose the car for several reasons .
As we know , public transportation is not a direct way to get to all our destinations and it forces us to stop at many stops first . Moreover we have to take another one to reach our destination , so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Secondly , public transportation is usually very crowded and makes us not feel safe , since there is an opportunity for us to be robbed .
Then , by car , we can enjoy the scenery , share a laugh , change our destination all of a sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted that people think a car is more comfortable to use rather than public transportation .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family can have more than one . That makes the number of cars grow rapidly , but they do not think about the negative side effects that a car has .
Firstly , it leads to global warming , since the concentration of pollution is higher in many countries , and actually it is not only leading to but also making global warming faster and can also threaten our health .
Then roads are more crowded right now and there is so much traffic , so people waste more time on the road , then it makes one of the positive points of using a car disappear and the importance of public transportation is needed .
While in the statement it says that public transportation will be abandoned by many people , in my opinion , the opposite is true - that public transportation is our future .
It can be proved now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher . Besides , it is not as costly as using a car , and the quality of public transportation has improved , so citizens have no worries about using it .
That is hardly surprising , it has been closed since 2005 .
Cause there was lots of damage , but they did n't take responsibility .
But you need to understand the main idea .
In other words , some professors , when teaching different topics , explain the concepts and it 's difficult to learn .
Anyway , if you read different books , you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's more important to learn the concept than to say something stupid ....
So , if you need techniques for learning , you need to analyse and create your own words , this way you will never forget this definition .
( It is my country place . ) I like it because it is near the water and we have a big lawn where we play football , volleyball and have fun .
My favourite subjects at school are mathematics , geography , and , of course , English .
The location of the restaurant is fantastic , right in the centre of the city , and with plenty of space for parking .
The decor is not too modern , but not too classic . It has a comfortable atmosphere .
The menu is very well constructed , and the food is based on local products .
I am writing this letter because we need to improve the facilities in the gym .
On those days , there are a lot of people and classes at the same time and sometimes we ca n't have the class comfortably .
And the solution to the second problem is that you should do maintenance once a year .
Yours sincerely , Maximiliano Khachaturyan .
I 'm so glad to hear from you and I also would like you to know that your idea for our new school project is really interesting .
I am excited about the idea of being with and interviewing other students from different parts of the world .
June 21st is impossible for me because I have an appointment with Mr Set , my dentist . Can we set the meeting for the next week ?
In the last year sales at Benton Electronics in the first quarter of the year were 500 and they increased to 620 in the second quarter . In the third quarter , sales stayed at 620 and in the last quarter of the year sales went down very quickly to 420 . As you can see , sales were very unstable .
It 's my pleasure to join you here . My major is actually not relevant to Social Sciences . I really want to learn more about the research methodology of social sciences .
My Life at University
Life at university involves a lot of difficult and interesting things .
Of course , everything always have two sides .
Now that I live at university , my life has changed a lot .
Secondly , studying at university , I have to live a long way from home , which makes me homesick , sad , and worried . I have to live in a dormitory with many strange people . They 're very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates .
It 's not convenient .
Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes . I have to spend a lot of time finishing everything before I start studying .
However , university life has many conveniences .
Living alone , I have to save money , because there are many situations which I have to deal with without family , and you can become a good person with many good characteristics , such as confidence , independence , friendliness .
Because my family always did everything for me when I lived with them , it 's very difficult to be independent .
For me , jogging is very stressless .
He had come to Agatha 's investigation office to ask her to look into some murders had that happened recently .
After the agreement , Agatha goes back home and immediately calls her friend Michael to tell him to come to her house .
When he arrives she tells him about the occurrence .
Accompanied by Michael , she goes to him and gives him all the documents she has found .
Unfortunately , Agatha ca n't find sufficient clues to identify the guilty party .
Irritated , John understands Agatha 's difficulties and , before going away , he calls Agatha without Michael to tell her another important thing .
One reason is that travelling by car is more comfortable .
For all these reasons , I think that travelling by car is better .
I have a lot of interests , but my favourite is volleyball .
Volleyball is a discipline which I have been practising for 6 years .
It 's very large and has special lights in the Greek performers ' room mainly .
This museum houses the historical collection of the Spanish royal family from many centuries ago to the present time .
I prefer walking , because the bus , helicopter , and metro are very polluting .
Suddenly , a man in black told us that we should plug the machine into the electricity .
He was very embarrassed .
Good morning everyone and welcome to your favorite program " You can also do so " . Today we 're going to learn how to make a cake for children 's birthdays , and Sofia will tell us what ingredients we are going to need to be able to make the cake .
It was like it was waiting for a terrifying event .
I looked through the windows and I could see a suspicious shadow .
When Michael saw me , he opened the door , but straightaway closed the door and at that moment knew he had make a mistake .
I am writing to you to apply for the position at a summer camp as advertised in the newspaper .
I am an architect . I have 5 years of professional experience .

Moreover , if you have good ability , you can compete in a competition to try your best . I am a member of a Badminton club in the city . If you 're interested in badminton , come and enjoy yourself .
Thanks for your letter asking about what the young people are interested in .
Also , the television programmes that they watch are reality shows .
These programmes are fashionable .
We were going to Gdańsk to see the new stadium that was built for the UEFA European Championship .
Bydgoszcz is my hometown and the destination of this journey .
Sadly our car broke down ... at a big and busy intersection !
This was n't some big , we still had four wheels and a motor , but the electronics in the car stopped working .
We did n't have a speedometer , blinkers and lights ; it was a very dangerous situation .
My father rang friends but unfortunately no one could help us .
In the car park in front of this building a very nice and crazy old man helped us and charged the accumulator in our car .
Fortunately , we returned home healthy and happy but very very tired .
To pursue a career which is relevant to the field of Mechanics and expect myself to contribute my experiences and knowledge with enthusiasm and I would love to have challenges and yearn for the sense of accomplishment .
Shopping facilities in Moral de Calatrava .
Traditional clothes : that kind of clothing can be expensive , but if you want to live like in the past , you can put on those clothes and you will have great fun although those clothes went out of style many years ago .
Something more fashionable : there are also a few clothes shop where you can find a lot of by fashionable Italian and Spanish designers .
If you need something for a special event like a wedding , you can go to three shops which are specialised in that .
Every Saturday morning , this village organizes a market where people can buy some natural vegetables or fruit which have been grown by local farmers .
-If you buy some clothes , assure yourself that they fit you and you like them enough to conservate .
My town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment . They provide us with good buses , which are friends to the environment , and offer the tickets for these buses at a cheap price . They also try to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by recycling . Also , people try all the time to find the best way to keep our village clean ; they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens . They also take care of the fuel in their cars to not be bad for the environment . So , it 's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment alongside the government .
There are many accidental problems encountered by international students studying in Australia .
Because of different cultural backgrounds , the speaking styles of international students who come from different countries are different .
For example , people always walk on the right of the road in China . However , Australian rules specify that citizens drive on the left of the road .
Secondly , loneliness can be a big problem when a person leaves their own country , going away from family members and close friends .
Thirdly , students may not be accustomed to western eating habits , like burgers , pizza and bread . Because of the unfamiliar environment , students may lack a sense of security .
The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which are held by students of the same nationality , so that they may not feel lonely . At the same time , they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information about Australian culture , in order to fit in quickly .
I have been thinking about some ideas to help you to organize some sports or evening activities .
I used to work in a restaurant in Salou and it was quite satisfying .
I think that I 'm a suitable person to look after them because I am quite responsible .
I 'm an energetic and responsible person .
My name is Margarita Varela and I 'm interested in the Summer camp Assistant 's position .
I am a responsible person who can cope in a crisis .
I took a First Aid course last year in order to know what to do in case of unexpected accidents .
My available time is on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays .
Then , I was wondering if food , accommodation and expenses are covered by you , or do you give any kind of help to your employees ? I would appreciate it a lot if you sent me this information .
But as this takes 5 days , many people do n't have time to watch this game and its losing its popularity with the younger generation .
Its popularity has spread all over the world too .
Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout this game .
2 . He should be disciplined .
3 . During his playing time , he must give his full concentration .
So . I need more information about eating customs in different countries .
In Korea , we usually use chopsticks when we eat meals and spoons as well .
Have you ever used chopsticks ?
So , I have to learn to use chopsticks to eat .
All thanks to new technologies , innovation in the field of medicine and new scientific discoveries .
To my mind , our lives have been improved in these years by smartphones , satnav , digital TV , the Internet ..
As far as I 'm concerned , we will be submerged by too many tools which will replace manpower and craft . In addition , globalization will destroy the cultural traditions of each country .
Apart from that , I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that take me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robots instead of waiters in a restaurant .
I have read the advertisement and I promise you that I am perfect for this post .
and I know how to take care of a camp . I 'm funny and cheerful , but I 'm also professional , so I know how to take care of children .
I am an experienced cook , so I can also cook for the children . I am also a good singer , so we can sing songs together with the children .
I can not agree with the statement that there is " no future for public transport " given that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , public transport is rather more convenient than a private car .
The accessibility is not just improving underground , but also on the ground and bridging .
The environment is becoming a more and more burning issue , , especially from many years to nowadays .
However , we can already fight this - waiting for the development of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable , sustainable energy . For example , taking advantage of public transport .
The best idea is still , obviously , valorizing the use of bicycles .
Polluting them is like endangering the life of the whole world .
In addition , what about domestic waste , which is our reality ? We should all learn to manage our waste , because each of us , in our own small way , is a great threat to the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is never too late to save our wonderful world .
But if you leave the city and travel about 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalls .
My favourite restaurant is in Modugno .
It 's located in a quiet street , so the restaurant is often very relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The restaurant looks very elegant and traditional .
Usually , there is no music in the restaurant .
In this way , customers can have the chance to have a conversation , without being annoyed by television or music .
I find it appreciable : I really love to talk to the people I 'm eating with .
Despite this , the restaurant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hung up on the walls .
I really like it , because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I 'm looking at .
Everything is delicious and very tasty , especially the pizzas : they dress them in many different ways . I try a different meal every time I go there .
The thoughts which people put in her mind were completely wrong . She ca n't deny that those thoughts affected her badly , brought her to the point that they made her hate herself .
The words they said to her were deadly ones , they colored her life black . till it 's the only time to prove to them that she can do anything , she 's good at everything like them all , that she just did n't want to do it like them all as she just hated the way
Being unsuccessful at studying is a horrible thing , it affects people badly .
That was me . I never liked studying , I never found myself in those subjects , but it was n't a big deal to me . I hated being seen as unsuccessful or a loser , as I was n't that . I knew that I was clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks , but they all did n't get that . They judged me for my marks , but marks do n't form brains or thoughts , marks are n't the only way that makes you great now or in the future .
Whatever . In high school , the senior year here in our country identifies your future ; the college you 'll spend your life studying in and working for its knowledge , so I got that I should do my best this year so my future would be better . And it happened . I showed them all that I can do whatever I want , even if the things I was n't like they see me , and that all my previous marks were n't my best . I got a high score and entered The faculty of Engineering , which was the top college .
Your thoughts are the only ones that will make the difference , so take care only of them and believe in yourself so you can achieve the prestige you 're looking for .
Do n't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up , and continue in a successful life . Fight .
I read this announcement today .
I am interested in the work .
Although I do n't have a teacher available there , the program helps a lot because the corrections appear at the same time as you check it .
Humans also want houses , and transport facilities .
Our flats and houses make the other animals lose their homes , and it leads to environmental deterioration .
We make the transport easy . However , we take away other animal s ' lives through carelessness .
THE REASON WHY I ADMIRE HIM IS BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED WHEN HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY MEDICINE IN RUSSIA . HE LIVED THERE FOR 7 YEARS .
How does the area take care of the environment ?
It builds a lot of facilities for residents .
But , fortunately , people living in this area all use these bikes carefully , so we do n't care so much about that .
It makes a father or mother 's life more convenient !
People living in Taiwan , no matter whether you are local people or not , can use all of these facilities .
And lots of city administrations advocate protecting animals .
I am Julia Timmerman from the Netherlands and I read your advertisement about working in summer camps in the USA .
Julia Timmerman , The Netherlands
It 's quite a strange sounds , because his father , grandfather , and great - grandfather had travelled in time .
This school is located in Marin , which is in northern Spain near Pontevedra .
The school is the Spanish institution in charge of training the Spanish navy officer class .
And it was established in 1943 . Moreover , there are not only the royal navy but also the royal marine corps .
Students have to study two parts , which are the engineering part and the military part .
In the engineering part , there are a lot of laboratories , which help us to easily understand about subjects such as Physics , Chemistry or even Economics .
For example , the planetarium in a navigation room for learning about the position of stars , four small boats used to practice leadership and navigation in the Pontevedra river , or even the simulation for creating situations which seldom arise .
On the other hand , five years in school are not superficial because now there are not only the military subjects but also the engineering subjects .
Today , on the roads there are a lot of cars , buses , motorcycles , and other kinds of transportation .
All people should use their own cars to go somewhere only when it 's necessary , because each car on the road is bad for our environment .
I know a good restaurant . Its name is " Moonlight " . It is located in Abbas elakad St.
It is large , clean and comfortable and has air conditioning and internet wifi .
It offers many kinds of delicious foods , like meat , chicken , seafood , and if you want something different , you will find it there . It is suitable for my class because it is different from any other restaurant .
One of the most famous buildings is the Churruca Earl Palace , which has a medieval tower with battlements ( the rest of the towers in the city do not have them because the Muslims took them out ) .
Nowadays , the Palace has a very good restaurant with a comfortable patio where you can taste the most exclusive products from Extremadura .
The present chapter aims to introduce audiovisual translation ( AVT ) - one of the most popular types of translation nowadays .
Audiovisual translation brings a lot of dilemmas and constraints over which translators must agonise .
But there are a variety of techniques which help to tackle these kinds of problems .
The chapter will also cover the definition of the notion of puns as a stylistic feature and how puns are transferred from one language into another .
As an extension of this , I will evaluate whether the effect of the pun in the original version is maintained in the dubbed version .
The people in my town take care of the environment .
The advance of technology in recent years has been awesome .
These days , computers are multifunctional .
I went to the beach and played volleyball with my brother and sister .
The car is a more comfortable mode of transport than public transport , but it is not sustainable , its cost is higher , and if all people travel by car , the cities will be very polluted .
Another mode of transport that could be commonly used in the future is the bike . This mode of transport is cheap and ecological . Also , more and more the cities are building a lot of bike lanes , so it is a good alternative .
For travelling to other cities or town , in my opinion , the car will remain the most used mode of transport , although new modes of transport could change this situation .
Finally , I think that the most used mode of transport in the cities in the future will be the bus , metro and bike , and for travelling between cities , the car will remain the most used .
I was especially delighted with the national music and Latin American dances .
I would like to invite you to the celebration of my birthday in two weeks .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
When they go to work or for other purposes , they choose to drive by themselves .
It is not only convenient , but also time - saving .
I am writing to you about the advertisement in the Mirror daily newspaper .
I am really very interested in the job on your summer camp . I have worked for seven months in Spain in a similar job .
by the time I have studied for a degree in journalism .
I am available to start to work immediately .
Your faithfully .
The dream of every person that plays this sport , is to make it a profession as well as a hobby , but very few people make it .
My undergraduate studies in Pharmacy at the University of Asia Pacific gave me a solid background in the health care sector and chemistry , as well as a strong theoretical framework , while allowing me to explore my personal interests in pharmaceutical technology .
This undergraduate work along with diversified professional experience helped shape the specific research interests that now drive me to pursue graduate work in the field of industrial pharmacology and gave me the opportunity to learn and work with the new medicines and delivery methods , ensuring their safety and quality academic and research opportunities for my interest in pharmaceuticals as a scientific career .
I am very grateful for your invitation to the interview .
I am glad to tell you that I am able to come on February 16th at 10:00am . I would appreciate it if you could reserve a parking space for me .
It has a lot of historical places .
The most historical place is the Pyramids . They were built more than 7000 years ago .
Many people think that parents are responsible for the bad behaviour of young people and they should be punished for that .
It is a time when children must choose which people are good or bad , and which way they will go in a difficult situation . For example , will they drink alcohol or will they have fun without any stimulants ?
The Great Wall is a great military construction in China , known as a miracle in the history of ancient human construction .
The existing Great Wall was mainly built in the 15th century of Ming . The Great Wall has a total length of 8851.8 kilometres .
It is a symbol of China , along with Tiannanmen Square and the Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses .
The development of each nation and their relationship is the key point to observing and understanding the area of the Great Wall .
This week was a little bit difficult because it was the beginning of classes . I got up early to be on time for my classes and to start with all the enthusiasm in the new semester .
The next day , Tuesday , it was hard for me to get up , but the simple fact of seeing my classmates meant it was so much easier .
Scientists try to make people 's lives easier , but that 's harmful for people 's health because that makes people not move and get more fat .
Renewable and new energy is clean and so cheap , we can use the sun 's rays to generate electricity for houses and cars .
Working as an ITC is very exciting because you need to program everything , it is like a challenge , although you can do different things . You can be on duty in your house and deal with your boss by cellphone , so do n't be alarmed if your children bother you .
It is a little stressful when you have a lot of work . I hope when I have my job I will be in charge of IT department security .
It 's a very worthwhile job .
There is no accounting for tastes and I can not answer for everyone .
I would like to tell you about this experience and how much I enjoyed working in there .
I was responsible for selling the movie tickets and having a good time .
I am writing in connection with the advertisement for a job in Green Pepper Cafe .
I have all the needed traits for this job : knowledge of cooking , politeness and diligence at work .
In addition , I want to say that I always try to do all my duties with responsibility .
I am looking forward to hearing from you if you are interested in my application .
However , Michael discovered that it was a bad wizard .
It was a hot , sunny day . Peter decided to go to the waterfront promenade and have a walk .
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to prevent her from committing suicide .
So he immediately contacted the police for help .
The person I most admire is called Ronaldinho , a football player who , in my opinion , is the best of all time .
The skills he has are wonderful . He knows everything about football , his passes were fantastic , he passed the ball even with his back !
My mom likes growing plants such as vegetables .
This book got me interested and I began reading more and more . The more I read , the more I loved it . At this time nothing mattered to me . I wanted to finish the book as soon as possible . I do not know the end , but I wanted the end of the book to be amazing , but at the same time , I did not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in .
In the end , a lady interrupted me and I was angry about the situation .
Nowadays our world is fighting every day against different problems . One day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmospheric conditions , or many other problems .
In my opinion , everyone 's life will see a great improvement , from the economic point of view , but also from the social and cultural one .
It is known that in the future there will come a day when any kind of unrenewable resource will run out .
But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources , such as electricity generated by the light of the sun 's rays .
Or in addition , we could use the energy generated by the environment , such as the wind or inorganic waste .
Maybe there will also be great new discoveries in medicine that will make all kinds of disease disappear .
To sum up , I think that we should expect a great future in which man will regain possession of his whole capability and , thanks to that , he will change everyone 's lives for the better .
Today I was at the university learning new things .
Jose is not at my university but we are good friends .
Last month I went to Machalilla National Park with my friends .
Los Frailes is in Machalilla National Park . It is a wonderful beach , the sand is very white .
I 'm interested in one sport ; football .
I think it 's a good idea if you buy some equipment for football and practise with your friends before matches at home or in the playground for two or three days .
Next , you can play with anyone with confidence and control .
I understand what you mean , because cars are so convenient , as you said .
You do n't need to worry about timetables .
The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was kept in a museum in Conecticut where she is visited by a priest who blesses her twice a month .
Unfortunatelly , in a horrible night , the couple 's house is invaded by a Satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them .
The aim of this report is to highlight how the citizens take care of the environment , in order to give suggestions to keep this area clean .
In the matter of that , information concerning what people do , or could do , is going to be shown .
Disadvantages :
If the majority of citizens , including the ones who live in the city centre , followed these ideas , this city would definitely be cleaner .
Unfortunately , deeper problems are linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants have respecting those principles .
Some think that volunteers should involve careless people in many projects to keep their city attractive and marvelous .
Nowadays , we can see that , increasingly , public transport needs to improve the quality of its services . People need this kind of transport daily to go to work , go to school and in general depend so much on public transport .
The government can improve public transport by making a great investment like changing the old vehicles for new and increasing the number of buses , trains and building more bus stops and trains stations . This kind of action will help a lot to improve the quality of public transport for the population and will make the life of the people easier .
However , if this situation does not change and if our government do not take providence about this important issue , it will be the end of transport public and it will be more convenient to use a car .
The second problem is about that some apparatus are not working well because the school hasn't done maintenance a since long time ago .
For the second problem , the solution , for me , is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the school 's machines .
I work as freelancer journalist , prepare reports dealing with the whole situation in the city of Jerusalem , and publish my reports on many of the websites .
I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for the newspaper supplement " The Voice of Women " which is published by the WATC ; the " Women 's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have a collaboration with Environment and Development , a magazine which is published by the Center for development work " Maan " , and other websites and news and media organizations .
The world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind . As a consequence , it caused global warming , which is the most important global problem . It does n't matter to more than three quarters of the world 's population .
Currently , we have got more than six different types of banks on our streets , but as far as I know , it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because , nowadays , we produce a lot of different materials , all of them overproduced and we only learn about this in our home , in our childhood . Accordingly , I am one of the few teenagers in the world worried about it , so I really do help the environment as far as I can .
First of all , at home we recycle plastic , glass , paper and cartons , oils , clothes , batteries , putting organic matter in a special composting bank so that we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials , and , finally , all the other things are sent to a special tip so that we avoid dropping them anywhere . Then , when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street putting their scraps in the wrong bank , I explain to them how they have to recycle and how important it is for our environment that we carefully recycle .
A couple of years ago , I could hardly see any bins in supermarkets and houses .
Nowadays , I see bins everywhere and even a small child of 3 being taught to put unwanted materials in the bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and how much progress my small village has made in 2 years .
However , separate bins for different categories of rubbish are not provided .
So , we can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin .
In spite of throwing rubbish in a bin , we also do some harm to the environment unknowingly .
As there are different kinds of materials , rubbish , some are recyclable and some are not .
In my opinion , in the next 50 years , the population will increase and there wo n't be resources enough for everybody .
Then , I suppose that in every country much more renewable energy will be used instead of nuclear energy to ensure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe everybody will use electric cars to reduce the atmospheric pollution .
I think that public transport has a future . Indeed , travelling in a car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
Perhaps in the future public transport could be more comfortable for the rest of the people who do n't have a car .
This has some advantages , such as it being more comfortable and faster .
When you travel by bus , you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car .
On the other hand , private transport is damaging for the planet and we must take care of the planet . We can help to prevent the pollution of the environment if we take public transport , which does n't pollute .
At the moment , there is more than one car per person . That is a problem for me because people do n't take care the of environment .
They prefer to be comfortable .
In conclusion , using public transport causes less damage to the environment and most people prefer .
He performs in many interesting movies and operas .
One of his interesting films is about a musician , and it was popular between 1980 and 2000 .
Life is unpredictable and unforeseen .
The immense possibilities of life give us the opportunity to explore life but sometimes it leads to threats and dangers to our life .
But insurance is also a necessity and indispensable for peace of mind . It gives us surety to live life securely .
The insurance for non - accidental death is known as general insurance and for life is known as life insurance .
The government should play a key role by providing trustworthy organizations , surveyors , loss assessors etc .
It gives competition to national companies . By virtue of which they work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders . People can always buy a nominal premium we should inform them about the types of insurance as well as the benefits of insurance .
Second , soccer is a very interesting game , because when I play soccer I feel very happy .
Recently , I read four great books about Shoah . They were very interesting . My favourite was : " The Book Thief " . I read it for school , but I had already seen the film of this book .
Nowadays , he treats me as botheration .
We had been told earlier that Abul kaka had got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from the office . Nonetheless , the performance of the vehicle was awful that day .
I do n't feel comfortable on highways for many reasons .
When I was a youngster , my father and I rode a motorcycle to visit our place using this road .
So we four were occupying the back seat uncomfortably .
I thought I should n't go because those benches were disgraceful for me .
My thoughts are unquestionably better than others ' .
It gave the impression that only going and coming back in a big car was the main purpose of the trip .
That was ridiculous .
We visited Nagar chak with much anticipation .
While I was listening to Noman , I was discerning that I should question more .
They prefer industrialization to nature .
A neverending argument took place and thus we reached Dhaka .
Travelling or moving from one place to another by car is much more convenient than public transport .
It is faster and cleaner and much more comfortable .
It 's convenient .
But , on the other hand , because , recently , the traffic has been terrifically unbearable : so many cars ; very noisy ; unclean air produced , public transport has become better for saving the planet .
All over the world , people always need advice to keep looking after their environments . First , the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students with tips that should help us to make our environment clean . Second , they should run awareness campaigns about the environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste paper baskets , which helps workers to recycle it easily . Finally , to stay healthy , we need a healthy environment .
I discovered a new world .
Krav maga teaches us how to handle ourselves in difficult situations .
The most exciting day of my life was when my sister and I discovered that we would spend one week on a cruise with our friends ! That was a very beautiful holiday !
Every evening we went to the restaurant on the cruiser .
My classmates and I along with our teachers and other classes went to the cinema to see the film " Fantastic Boccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema for my class and see a film about what I had studied in the Italian lesson and understand better the stories of Boccaccio , one of the most important Italian writers .
Watching the film , we had the possibility to see the characteristics of Boccaccio 's main characters and the different places where the stories took place .
In my opinion , the film was very well made : the registers of the film ( there are two ) tell us five novels with only one main protagonist : love in every situation .
It 's obvious that life nowadays is really different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can think of what in our lives is still inconvenient and could probably change .
Most of the work will probably be done by machines . People who lack academic qualifications might find it very hard to get a job . Knowledge might be in demand if people live in the future .
There are some issues that make me worried . The environment is getting worse . We have to come up with methods to solve this and save our Earth .
The relationships between countries are also significant , as we can see discord between countries , hoping that it will not lead to war .
Television entertains as well as educates people .
These days , people are educating themselves by watching the television .
Televison not only provides entertainment , it will also give lots of information about the events around the globe .
Channels like National Geographic and Animal Planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origins of species .
Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people .
With a great effort , he sat down on the grass , he felt tired , and had a slight sensation of pain in his chest , sitting there with many sounds in the air , he started to recall ... his face changed is dark , now he had a clear image of eveerything . When he opened the door of the house , his girlfriend was there dying on the floor . Michael remembered everything : the fight , the lies , the screams , the knife ... the blood ; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Diabetes is an increase of glucose in the blood , There are two types , first Diabetes Type 1 which is present in children , the patient needs insulin every day . Also , this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insulin released by the person 's immune system .
So it is necessary to eat vegetables and fruit and also to do exercise .
Many people think travelling by car is more comfortable for them .
However , they must understand travelling by car is not any kind of exercise .
Please record your message and send it to my email address f9u54t4g245@gmail.com before 24th evening .
This week , I went to the country . It was great fun because we went to the cinema and we ate in a lot of different restaurants .
Hi readers of international sports monthly magazine .
I am writing to sponsorize my favourite sport , the most beautiful sport in the world ;
basketball .
Basketball is a complete sport ; aerobic and anaerobic .
Some people say that basketball is only for tall guys ,
Nowadays , basketball is spreading around the world .
So let 's play basketball .
He is going to go to university next year .
At the weekend he usually plays football or basketball and this year he is learning how to rock climb .
We studied hard together to prepare for the university exam , shared our problems and almost things has relatived with us .
The first year of university , I revealed my love to him .
Unfortunately , he refused me .
During the rest of that boring week , I did a 1000-piece puzzle .
Also , my uncle , aunt , grandfather and cousins went with us .
I 'm sure you 'll agree that Pompei is the most important archeological site in the world .
Is n't it incredible ?
There is a unique atmosphere !
In particular , in urban areas , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who live there know the convenient public transport system called MRT ; it 's fast , cheaper and you do n't have to find a parking space .
Besides , it 's harmful and makes the earth 's environment worse because of the emission of so much carbon dioxide .
So , I think the government should have to draw up a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban areas and countryside .
And think deeply about the problem of protecting the environment .
My family members are very helpful and supportive .
Steve Ramsay works for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D and lives in Washington D.C. after the Battle of New York .
One day , a S.H.I.E.L.D agent was attacked by a ghost .
But he does n't know he is involved in a conspiracy .
He meets a strong opponent who is a winter soldier when he wants to find the wirepuller .
Besides being excellent exercise , it is also the most comfortable , because it allows me to concentrate , to be with myself , talking and praying to God with each step in the morning .
The graph below gives information about seasonal sales of ice - cream in different places : in an ice - cream van and an indoor swimming pool from Jan to Dec .
First , the graph showed an upward trend for the ice cream van and , in 2014,it had the largest percentage of sales at nearly 5500 dollars from Jul - Sep .
Maybe because in this period of time the weather was cold , the number of purchasers is greatly reduced .
Second , for the indoor swimming pool , it generally appears to be wavy falling , from 2500 dollars in 2012 to 2000 dollars in 2014 . We can infer , it will not rise sharply , and it is impossible for it to fall sharply .
Most people like to have their own car , because they think it is more comfortable and flexible .
But I think that public transport is the future . We need to preserve the environment , this is an imperative for our world , and the solution is to take the point that the governments invest more in public transport , so people do n't need to get a car to be able to have a job and do n't need it for the normal development of their lives .
Also , we have to promote people getting jobs close to their accommodation or getting accommodation close to their jobs , because we have too much pollution . And we could reward companies that hire staff close to the place of work , maybe in a radius of 4 kilometres , and we could reward people that change their accommodation to live near to their job or for going there by bicycle .
Summertime was first converted in 1900 .
I like spring and always wait for it and wait for the summer holidays with impatience .
However , I am stopped by recent tragic developments in foreign countries .
It 's the best , the most beautiful and the most comfortable resort in the South .
I have to start saying that I never imagined swimming as my favorite sport , because until my back injury , I did other sports . I mostly like extreme sports like downhill skiing , skateboarding , martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but because of my injury I had to start swimming and now I love it .
If you want to start swimming , I think you should look for a swimming teacher because if ca n't swim , you need one , and if you can swim but not well , if you are not in practice and know your swimming style is not the best , I recommend professional assistance .
More time that you do n't have that assistance , it is going to be more difficult to improve your style and enjoy swimming more , because if you really know how to swim you will have more resistance in the water .
She works at a language school at the local university .
Then , she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her , standing just beside the bed .
She tried screaming and calling me as I was sleeping peacefully beside her .
Even worse , two of them started whispering in her ears , die … die .. .
She reproached me for not waking her up despite the fact that she had been calling me so eagerly .
- experience it when they are very tired physically and very stressed .
- repeatedly dream again if they rarely awake themselves .
Some experience this very easily and often .
Hi ! My name is Cátia and I am a student of electrical engineering .
I am in the third year at university , I do n't know what the Master 's will be that I am going to do , but I want a Master 's related to programming .
I have many difficulties with programming , but I think that if I work hard I can overcome my difficulties .
In the last few days , I and my group did some experiments for our project .
We used some resistors and a source of two hundred and thirty volts to control the temperature of water .
Initially , we had some problems because the resistors did not increase the temperature enough to warm the water .
I want to write a review of my book about Nigeria and read another book about robots and their mechanisms .
I am going to try to read these books to improve my English , because in the future I intend to take the first certificate .
This is very important for me because when I work for a company I will need a certificate ! ! !
In my opinion , you must go to Madrid or Barcelona because they are the most attractive .
Also , Madrid is a nice city . You can to find everything that you need .
Spanish food is fantastic , there are a lot of restaurants for you to eat at and I think that the food is more expensive than in your country .
If you do n't like Spanish food , you can go to a restaurant with food from another country , but I know you love it .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I 'm so glad you are coming to my country . I 'll give you some suggestions , hoping that you can have a wonderful summer vacation !
If you want a short - term job , I think a restaurant is the best one for you .
You should be able to have a great experience .
When it comes to travelling , you must not miss the night markets .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I think that public transport is always going to be very important in our life , because not all people have the possibility to buy a car , and because public transport is less expensive than a car . So for that reason , public transport in the future could exist , because public transport is a necessity all over the world , not only because of money , but also for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport .
I went to the nature section , which is interesting as it is about natural aspects on earth like the elements , rocks and periods of life related to organisms .
The section was big and it presented a lot of information in a scientific manner , some sections had complete information while others had not .
It was a period of time in earth 's history when temperatures fell globally , causing ice sheets and glaciers to form far from the north and south poles .
He uses a rule for debates : proposition + result = positive or negative ( Why ? )
The hot spot helps to get more confidence .
The result depends on : confidence , volume of the voice , body posture and audience .
After an hour , the dog was vaccinated and taken home , but his mother needed a bottle of milk .
Unfortunately , Anne , his sister , had just taken the bike , so he was forced to walk to the nearest supermarket .
After an exhausting afternoon , Peter had a bit of luck . In fact , his father , Jack , had just come back from work , so he could go to get the milk and giving him a lift .
I am a young woman with a melancholy character .
If I am in public and want to give a presentation , I always get nervous .
An excessive amount of cars on the road is not an option as this could cause problems in most metropolitan areas .
There would be a tremendous amount of pollution and traffic jams .
As the population grows , you will see an increasing problem .
Therefore , public transportation is the future and more and more people will be using the metro , public buses etc .
I think that sport is important for discipline in life .
My favourite sport is football . It is a complete sport ; there are aggression , mentality and fun .
My favourite football club is Napoli . It is the heart club . For this team , I feel indescribable emotions ... when I see my team , I smile in moments of joy , I cry in moments of sadness and suffering and rejoice when they score and win the game .
Working in your own company is very challenging because you deal with a lot of areas , manage all departments and learn about business , management , economics , sales , engineering , technical support and other skills .
You are responsible for your workers and customer satisfaction . However , it is very satisfying to see how your own company is growing and your customers returning because they loved your work .
That work looks depressing , demanding and stressful , but it is very rewarding and if you like the challenges you will never be bored .
They are so kind , friendly , and stressed because they have a lot of problems nowadays . The level of poverty , the standard of living , the fixed cost is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing .
So , if you want to work in Egypt , you must have complete information about the job ( location , salary , incentives , allowances , work environment , position title , company type , policy , mission , vision )
Military service is when people are forced by the government to be a part of the army to serve and protect the country .
Thus , there is a source of agreement and another source of disagreement , which is freedom of choice and mental maturity .
Otherwise , when people are forced by the government , they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted .
If people do military service when they are just 18 , they may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who works in the military may request the soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
But after a period of time , people could develop their obedience , especially young people ; they are likely to become more independent people .
In my city , we do n't have a regular policy of care for the environment .
There have been many projects to improve the care for the environment .
In my country , you can make a lot of effort to take care of the environment , but the bad attitude of our people is a big problem .
We think that our authorities are responsible for these matters .
So , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
Consequently , the streets are always dirty .
Personally , I prefer to have a clean street .
If everyone demonstrated a better attitude , it would be possible to improve our environment .
Nowadays , we grow up with the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
This fact allows young people to do exercise and enjoy themselves at the same time .
The favorite sport of many people is football , whereas my favorite is basketball .
Also , I have met great friends who play basketball .
Every sport focuses on some parts of the body , but basketball is the most complete sport .
It is true that basketball requires a lot of physical activity , but a good mental attitude is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed because you do n't get a point or have a bad day , because the other players can sympathise with you .
Adolescence has always been the hardest part in anybody 's whole life .
Turning , in a fleeting glimpse , into an adult , perceiving the other side of life , how tough and complicated it is , trying to deal with its different circumstances .
However , here you are completely different , made of life lessons , preferring to keep a stiff upper lip , cowering in your own reality .
Yes , television entertains , but it can also educate .
Television can improve knowledge of current affairs .
Television helps us to find the fields that interest us , like music , sports , movies or nature .
These days , television allows us to see events all around the world .
However , there are quite a lot of disadvantages to television .
In particular , fake news spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how they make use of the opportunity .
TV was and is seen as entertainment , but have you ever questioned whether it is more than just entertainment ?
Are we subconsciously educating ourselves ?
Now that is an interesting question . We can watch anything from news to Catfish the TV show . In the name of entertainment , we are actually learning .
The truth is we are always learning , but how we learn is another matter . The main types of learners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV stimulates two learning styles , which are visual and auditory .
Some may argue that TV just does not have sufficient content for us to be able to learn . Others may argue that TV is an amazing source of learning , e.g. we learn about new technology via a mobile phone advert aired on TV .
I have personally picked up information I would not have come across otherwise . For example , I have been able to learn that the new BMW seven series , has ambient lighting , it can pull in and out of the garage at the touch of a button , it 's computerised system can read different road surfaces and adapt it s driving .
So , have you ever asked yourself whether television entertains , but can also educate ?
Electronic was born .
It made everything possible .
Then music changed to multimedia .
The circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanes , which makes it possible to achieve high speeds .
In my opinion , driving at high speed on the long straight could cause overheating of the cars ' engines and they can blow up .
The rugged kerbs could cause the suspension to crack .
I think cutting down the trees which are around the circuit and undercutting kerbs could reduce danger and technical problems on the track and we should reduce the long straights .
Global power and politics are now surprisingly centered on those which have an apex maturity of science .
Addiction to authoritative nature over other leads to the huge production of war weapons , converting the blessing nature of science into critics .
Despite all of the assistance of science in daily life , it is not without criticism in different areas .
There is no definition of happiness in scientism or how could it get through the scientific user manual ?
Very often , it has been criticized for changing indigenous cultures through so - called luxurious development that is contradictory to religious faith .
Science is concerned only with information about the world , whatever it is , and sometimes in unethical conclusions without considering morality .
But living in the 21st century , it 's difficult to blame science when we are benefited through its technological applications in our everyday life to an ever - greater extent .
In fact , they keep the woods clean and the owners send the loggers to remove dead trees now or those that could lead to hazards , but every time you remove a tree , it is immediately replaced with a young plant so that the environment does not undergo changes that will lead out balance the system .
For waste management across the country , even in the countryside , we have bins for recycling paper , plastic , glass and waste .
Travelling using any form of transport has become one of our needs . In the past , people used to spend hours waiting for public transport . Now , we can afford any of those modern cars at the dealership .
The main problem is bad service . For example , the drivers are not careful enough when driving , and that might be unsafe for passengers .
Another disadvantage is the unclean chairs on public transport .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children to do physical activity . That is the first step to doing exercise , then competing in sports will encourage competitors to make an extra effort .
Also , just for young children that are in the process of growth and development , physical exercise is essential , because they can have a healthier life .
Young children try to make an effort , and want to win at this age , and if they train , the results are better and that encourages them to keep training .
In psychic way , if you are adapated form relationships and make new friends .
In the future , adults that are able to obtain more achievements and be more responsible , and you can have a good social life if you compete in or do sports .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of competing , because competitors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
Finally , I think that competing in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when it is controlled there are some benefits that help you in your whole life .
For upcoming enhancement , I would like to inform you that there are no longer any public transportation services since travel by car is more convenient .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to outline what shopping facilities there are in our town and write some tips for tourists with different preferences .
Shopping facilities
Even though the shops are not large , there are remarkable goods . For example , nice running shoes or valuable books .
Possibility of the shops
If you have a small child , you can visit toy shops , which offer many cars and helicopters .
Conclusion
To sum up , I think our town offers many interesting shops .
Halloween is a traditional holiday in the USA but the original history came from the Celtic people .
The immigrants came with this religious culture and with time it has become part of American culture .
Today , this holiday is celebrated around the world and you can have fun with a party or dress up in a costume .
The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes .
First is to design the note , including background color , artwork and security issues .
Second is to prepare metal plates using qualified machinists .
Last is the key step ; inspection .
It is of great importance to inspect the printed sheets .
The issue of whether there is no future for public transport is a topic that has caused an ongoing argument . In my essay , i intend to discuss contravening viewpoint in more depth .
First , some people believe that public transport is a significant part of our life and it 's more difficult to rely only on our cars .
My favorite way to travel is by plane because I like to be fast and , in my life , I hate waiting . In my opinion , the plane is the best for me . For example , when you want to go somewhere you need to reach there so quickly , you do n't want to take a long time . And the plane is the best way of travelling in the world and is safer than other ways . You can see on the pollution of people who have had an accident , how often an accident happens by plane , so anyway if it has happened , I ca n't imagine it . Finally , I hope everyone who likes to travel is safe and sound and has a safe journey .
First of all , Television has less viewers nowadays .
Most people turn to Internet websites or applications like Netflix or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to those days when young people still watched television for entertainment .
There were a lot of programs on television .
Most people watched the news , movies , or TV shows on television .
As I remember , there were educational channels like Discovery and National Geographic .
Those channels always contained a lot of new technology .
Some people may think that only these kinds of channel can provide educational knowledge , and some people do n't consider watching these channels as entertainment .
But these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational .
So television entertains , but can it also educate ?
My studies at the Tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score worldwide , but also has so many good things . For example , we have a lot of exchanges all around the world . When you have the opportunity to do an exchange , you have to deal with the language and the culture of the other country . That means you have to be responsible for studying the basic things about that country , but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun .
I really enjoy it because it gives me a lot of relaxation and it helps me to be toned and satisfied with myself .
When I was fourteen years old , I won a championship because , in that period , I swam as a competitive athlete .
It was a real satisfaction and I was happy .

Introduction
The aim of the report is to write about how our town takes care of the environment .
Conclusion
We do everything to make our town more green . Our citizens always have new ideas that make a difference to our daily lives .
It is common that more and more people get overweight , because of too much fast food and an unhealthy lifestyle .
Now some scientists have suggested having warnings on some types of food and drink .
But is this idea a way to reduce the bad habit of consuming harmful foodstuffs ?
Everything has to happen fast .
First of all , we need to make people aware of the current environmental situation in order to take action to help the environment .
This action would decrease the amount of gas emitted into the environment .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it into the following types : metal , plastic , organic , glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman .
For example , organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer , the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory and so can the glass .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do not decide to play our part in dealing with this global problem .
As we 've seen , these days , the number of cars is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increase in the number of private cars .
Governments around the world have been talking a lot about the measures that should be taken to improve the quality of public transport .
No doubt travelling by car is quite a lot better than going by public bus .
Although Louis felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
I am struggling at school .
I will start with old vehicles . If we do n't do any maintenance , this type will be damaged and we will lose it .
But in some countries , you can use the underground ( metro ) . It is more advanced than old types , like bus or taxi . The underground is faster and cleaner and .
Michael is a 22-year - old man , he has studied for a degree in electrical engineering and now he wants to put his knowledge into practice .
He went to buy a newspaper to search for a job . He looked at all the advertisements but he never found the one he needed .
He prepared something to eat fast , brushed his teeth , he just picked up his mobile , keys and money , but he had n't noticed that he was forgetting his CV .
It is an interesting activity ! There is the Fifa World Cup too !
First , the teacher will train us in soccer techniques .
Next , we will have a soccer competition .
Soccer is an interesting sport but we need to be careful .
My father has many hobbies , he plays football , reads newspapers and listens to the radio .
The difficulty is that you rarely know if your best friend is a true friend .
Unfortunately , my best friend deceived me . I do n't know how she managed it , but she hurt me .
My cousins are very reliable , like my grandmother and my parents .
For all rules there are exceptions .
My city is Jaén . It 's in the east of Andalucia and is an important crossroads between the south and the center of Spain .
So an important historical place is St. Katherine 's castle .
It 's on top of a big hill with difficult slopes to climb up because the most important property is that it is impregnable .
In the reconquest age the stronghold never fell to a direct assault . Finally the Castellan 's army , after a long siege , forced the government to surrender it .
Then , in the 18th century , the Napoleonic army lived in it until the end of the Spanish war of independence .
I try to do all the activities in class .
I do n't have enough time to practise and do activities at home .
I need to speak and participate more in class .
We speak most of the time , so it is good to develop our confidence and fluency to converse .
Next , a boat is usually very big , so we can do many activities on it , such as dancing , drinking .
Therefore , I prefer a boat for travelling , instead of a train or a plane .
All in all , travelling on the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable , in addition , it is very safe .
Therefore , we went to join a sports centre which had taken over organising this amazing outdoor activity .
Rafting lets you burn all your adrenaline while you try to get down a river in a mini - boat .
In addition , you 'll enjoy the breathtaking landscapes around you and you 'll also see a vast range of wildlife on both sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clothes and to bring sun cream with you .
In my life I have had big experiences that have made me change and mature .
One of the most important experiences , I think , was coming to study in Tijuana .
I am studying Nutrition at the University . That is why I am living in Tijuana .
Before I came to live in Tijuana , I was really nervous because I had to leave everything and because it would be a change in my life .
Now I am so independent and I have learned how to live alone .
I live in a small village in countryside with only a few people .
Even if we are a small village , we take care of the environment through the use of photovoltaic systems on the roofs of many buildings , such as the nursery school and other buildings that have this system to produce energy .
The garbage truck picks up paper once a week , plastic two times per month and undifferentiated three times a week for all people who live in my country .
My district makes my village clean and it usually tries to make it attractive with new social initiatives for the community .
We have been friends since we started to talk , but our friendship has changed over time .
When we were 12 , we played in the garden with balls and with the other boys and girls , but when we were 12 years old , everything changed . We did n't want to play in the garden because we preferred cinema or watching TV .
For this reason , I think that friendship is such an important thing in life .
I think the opposite . I believe that public transportation has a really huge future .
It is true that there are a lot of users that want to use a car and that number is growing . There are also a lot of people that do n't have the possibility to have a car and some use public transportation for many reasons , like the price , because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than a car , or because of the traffic . Sometimes it is so exhausting for people to drive for many hours and even sometimes public transportation is faster .
The population is growing so fast , we need public transportation . It is important .
Public transportation is convenient for some people and some people think the car is more convenient . Finally , we will need public transportation in the future .
In our opinion , globalization is a good thing that is happening to us , allowing us to interact with the whole world , so we can get to know cultures , monuments , etc .
It brings us a lot of opportunities to change and , in some cases , to get a better life in other countries and find a job with the highest salary .
However , we need to change some things in the world , more than these is to change a lot of things in third world countries , because it is not acceptable that in the twenty - first century a person has to live on less than a dollar per day .
Firstly , the city of Vancouver has a programme called Go Green Vancouver that will protect the environment by separating the rubbish by containers . At the same time , there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provide 3 containers for each house ; one for paper one for bottles , and the last one for rubbish materials .
Secondly , there is a programme with the water company to cut down on the use of water by 50% using a recycling water treatment and recirculating to the house without dumping the waste and so saving our planet .
Finally , every city hall is improving the care of the environment because there is an incentive programme from the government , such that if they cut the of every house by 50% , city halls will get more money from central government .
I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element for speaking English . If you know grammar , you only know certain rules for writing , but I think that speaking is more important than writing , because when you go to any place in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you . In this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you wo n't understand anything . But here is another topic . Whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to understand what the person is trying to say .
With reference to your e - mail , we discovered that the price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .
Please be advised of the right amount on the settlement date .
It is clear that technology has provided us with several options for communication .
Another way this change is evident is that social networking or applications such as Skype , FaceTime and Facebook are widely used to stay in touch with family , friends and relatives
My favourite sport is basketball .
When I 'm playing this sport I have great moments and I learn more and I will have more experience in the future .
Basketball is recognized by people all over the world .
I am writing to apply for the job advertised on your webpage .
Yours faithfully
I am writing to apply for the job in a summer camp advertised on February 9th in the local newspaper .
Now I want to utilize my summer to help children in different activities .
I have experience of arranging different sports activities for children .
Yours faithfully
And there is good communication between us .
In my opinion , every family must have good communication , because I think communication is one of the most important things in our life .
We use communication all the time .
Because people have to use many communication techniques to communicate with other people .
However , families that do n't have good communication do n't have a good life .
If we want to have a good life , we must have good communication in our families .
Now , when I swim in the open pool , I am overwhelmed by positive emotions .
Nowadays , the option of broadening the mind while traveling is very common .
Apart from that , you see new places and you have fun . You also learn about other cultures , historical facts , you also learn to respect other people and their customs .
In conclusion , I think that it is the best way to open your mind . Not the only way , but yes , the best way .
Many countries have truly started to be concerned about the environment and worried about globe warming . In schools , teachers are doing their best to educate children in how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy . Also , they teach them in how to plant trees in the public gardens of their towns .
Although the government strict so many laws and taxes on the people who do not pay their taxes to the council for removal of the rubbish from towns and villages , in the biggest polluted city in the world , people have started to use bicycles and cycle instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city . Also , they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive .
For example , if we completely rely on using cars it is going to increase the use of gasoline .
Apparently , it is going to cause more pollution and more global warming issues .
Public transport is really important and it has a lot of advantages to help humanity .
For instance , San Francisco is a great example of an incredible city . The variety of choices of public transport is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilities , it is going to be expensive , but it is necessary .
In conclusion , governments should work on that , because people need public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car .
First of all , nowadays , wherever we go we can find Italian restaurants easily .
but I think Italian restaurants are getting famous .
On the other hand , it could be complicated , but nobody complains .
I think that 's why this city can maintain a safe environment .
It attracts many fashionable people .
During the voyage , we disembarked in the Bahamas and CoCo kay , which is a private island belonging to the cruise . We went to the beach and played so many games .
To sum up , this trip was the best experience we have had in our lives , because we made friends , visited a new country and we had a lot of fun .
I love horses and I do horse riding at Djursholms ridklubb .
My grandpa lives in Spain with my stepgrandma , but she is like my grandma .
My stepmother 's mom is also like my grandma .
But let me tell you it was a concert by the Lala Band and I have taken and I especially , I was the cameraman .
I heard that you really have a lot of work activities now .
The main character is so cool , charismatic , and patient .
The movie is already a success , opening at the box office with a $ 36 million endorsement .
I am very excited about seeing Kevin Heart and Will Ferrell 's characters come together .
I hope that you consider my application and contact me about the job .
I checked connections between Warsaw and Berlin and she will be at Berlin Ostbf station at 11.10 .
To put it simply , the new generation has decided to take their driving licence and I have seen this around me , with my colleagues , my friends , my family .
This affirmation : travelling by car is so much more convenient , says everything . For example , if we think of the time we spend on waiting for a bus to arrive at our destination , and the traffic is one of a lot of things that makes everyone prefer to buy a car . It is more practical and faster .
We can stop and do some mental arithmetic and we can see the large amount of money we spend each year .
I am part of the new generation who in the future will use cars and the public transport will disappear .
Varese has many attractions among which there is the lake , where I like to go .
In the argument , the author asserted that the city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza .
The author claimed that the business dropping is caused by the increasing number of skateboard users .
Likewise , the skateboard users brought a lot of garbage that affects the stores in the plaza .
Based on the author 's two concerns , the statement that came to the conclusion that to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , there is a contradiction in the argument .
If more skateboard users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
From this point view , the decrease in business must be caused by other factors , but not skateboard users .
Furthermore , the products for sale in the stores might not meet customers ' needs .
Second , the author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboard users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems suggest that there is not sufficient security in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboard users taking over pedestrian walking space .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and separate the different spaces for walking and skateboarding .
To sum up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboard users would bring more potential to improve business in Central Plaza .
On the other hand , the author should provide profound discussion why people who come to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
To strengthen the author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above into the argument .
Finally , the consequence of cocaine is death . If you inhale cocaine all the time or a lot , you will die prematurely .
In conclusion , cocaine is the most dangerous addiction , because you die prematurely and your body is destroyed by the cocaine .
There is an increasing trend towards private transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future .
Ultimately , public transport will be negligible in the future .
The main one is that nowadays people are incredibly busy with their day to day life , so that they do n't like to spend their valuable time waiting for regular transport . Also , public transport causes lots of pollution which is harmful for human beings .
For example , lunchtime travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emissions of carbon mon oxide , which affects red blood cells and irritates the respiratory system . As a result , they prefer private transport systems to prevent such hazards .
To illustrate , if teenage girls travel by public transport every day who will interact with society beyond the limitation.so it is a big challenge for them .
I am writing this e - mail because we want to hire your company to do the accounting for our company .
Principally , we need to have the Financial States , so we need them as fast as you can because , if not , we will have legal problems .
We enjoyed swimming in the sea , sunbathing , having a barbecue and seeing the sunset .
The line which represents the indoor swimming pool remains fairly steady , from approximately 1800 to 2500 , the period of every year from April to June and October to December has the highest outstanding achievement , whilst the sales are downwards overall .
However , compared to the line for the indoor swimming pool , the difference of seasonal achievement of the ice - cream van is considerably larger .
Overall , the achievement of the ice - cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool , from about 1100 to 5500 .
The discrepancy between these two places is great .
The best sales achievement of the van is 4500 , 5000 , 5500 respectively .
But there was no one , absolutely no one . I was scared , I yelled and screamed , looked and looked , but I had no success .
Public transport was created to relieve the traffic in big town centres and also to facilitate workers ' commutes .
I particularly decided to drive to do my day - to - day tasks such as , shopping , visiting friends , church and so on .
I 'm a great people person and have great knowledge of computers , organising activities for children and also I 'm a jr . chef .
I hope you can grant me the opportunity to have a meeting .
Mario Monteagudo
What a nice poem , at least mention the name of a proficient poet too .
I also hope to meet a group of old friends once again to revive the wonderful and unforgettable shared memories of student life .
If it is unspeakably for public readings , thus mention it in the email .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work . You have to understand each other .
He is a Polish basketball player .
He is really tall , he is 202 centimeters .
My history of basketball was very short .
To begin , everything is very difficult here .
Television plays an essential part in our life ; we turn it on nearly every day , since it can make life more interesting .
Television entertains us , it can also educate .
For one , a show broadcast on television may enlighten us and give us some enlightenment .
So , why ca n't television educate us ?
For another , there are many different types of programs which can broaden our views ; they give details of education , plus other meaningful information , such as documentaries , talk shows and so on .
Television is just like a kaleidoscope , there are various materials provided for us .
To sum up , television entertains ; it can also educate .
Syria has a lot of good restaurants .
The Damascus restaurant at the centre of the city is quite a nice place to have a meal .
This restaurant also has games for children , which they can spend their time playing with .
It 's a very nice restaurant which I like the most .
At those times , a car is convenient to use .
Ever increasing crowds in cities and traffic problems are increasing .
The future houses will be different not in terms of architecture , but in terms of functionality .
Different people will need different functions , options and functionality in the future house .
The progress of technology is very fast .
From : horses , steam vehicle , first petrol and gas car to future cars when the fuel will be electricity .
The film tells us the story of Monica ( Scarlett Johansson ) and her routine life on " Cretacro " , an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean . The problems start when Monica falls in love with Martin .
Martin was a solitary and quiet guy who moved to Cretacro to relax , but he changed when he met Monica in the main restaurant .
One of my main responsibilities is preparing something by 7.30 am so I get up at 6 every morning and I leave home for work at 6.45 am .
I really like to read everything I can catch and I will have a look in every book to see what it is about .
Often , I like to read biographies , history books and novels , and I really like Jane Austen 's books .
I have all her collected works at home and I enjoy a lot having a trip with her characters in Bath and all around . I like to read children 's books and I had lots of fun with Beatrix Potter books and all her little animals ; with Peter and all of them .
When I need a book for my English classes , I go to Waterstone or to Amazon .
A few months ago , I read Les Miserables , by Victor Hugo . I read this book when I was in high school , but I did n't think about the subject .
Nowadays , there are many modes of public transportation , such as underground , buses , etc . , but it is a reality that people prefer to travel by car .
Currently , traveling by car is more useful than public transport ; you can move around the city and reduce the time it takes . Sometimes you can share your car with friends or family and this way of travelling is cheaper .
Teacher , I know travelling by car is the most convenient .
Nevertheless , I believe that technology will make progress in the future .
On the other hand , we should know that every means of transportation may be changed in 50 years .
For all these reasons , I think that we should be prudent when we assess means of transportation .
According to Wordsworth , a poet is not an ordinary man , he has a greater sensitivity and knowledge .
The power of imagination makes him become a teacher : he has to show men how to understand their feelings and the nature that surrounds them .
He is the only one who can produce poetry in a simple language , thanks to imagination and memory .
I live in a big city and I have the opportunity to see a lot of tourists during the year .
Sometimes I give them some information about the names of streets or where the main monuments are .
I have no particular problem helping them , but I often have some doubts about suggesting a place to go shopping .
The reason is that in my city there are a lot of good shopping facilities for tourists .
An example could be to have free entry to the Campidoglio museum if you buy a local newspaper .
As you see , there are a lot of opportunities for tourists to spend their money in my city .
Hello , I really want this job , because I 'm a happy person who enjoys nature , travelling around the world , and having a lot of friends .
My town makes great efforts to take care of the environment . They have put many bins in the streets to keep it clean and they prevent private transport on many days to keep the air clean . They plant trees to absorb co2 and release oxygen , they build factories away from the houses of citizens to prevent the respiratory diseases which are a result of air pollution from factories . So , not only my country itself but also individuals follow a proper procedure to keep the environment clean .
Football is my favourite sport and I enjoy it because it is an aggressive game and fun .
At first , the police detectives thought one of the special gangs had stolen the painting .
Then , researchers found out that Pal Enger , the most famous art thief in Norway , was the person who had stolen the painting .
3 months ago , he wanted 1 million dollars for the painting , but the Norwegian government said no .
Finally , the Norwegian police got the painting back thanks to a police investigation .
I have developed organizational and time management skills through my work with different companies .
In particular , I am highly skilled at welcoming and directing customers .
About my personality , I am outgoing and enthusiastic .
In my previous job , I was paid the compliment that
I can provide extraordinary service with a smile , even if I was in an unexpected situation .
With these qualifications and personality , I believe that they will prove me to be an ideal candidate for 5-star Cabin Crew at Qatar Airways .

I think that there is a future for public transport , because there are still people who can not afford to buy a car , even though travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to consider that people need to earn sufficient money to support their families and be able to buy a car .
I 'm interested in this job because at the moment I haven't got a job .
In the workplace I 'm a responsible person , I am never late .
Also , I always work with children and I have a teaching qualification . I'm a friendly person and I have a good CV .
My experience of this job is extensive .
I like to do sports activities and educational activities .
My favourite activities are out in the open air .
I like to prepare my activities a week before , then when I have to do this activity it is quicker .
In terms of making bank notes , the picture below demonstrates the process of making them .
There are mainly 4 steps : design , preparation , printing and inspecting .
Firstly , personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the security features on the bank notes , which is also done in process of other card , such , such as notes for supermarkets .
Then , in the preparation process , skilled machinists prepare metal plates for printing .
After sheets of bank notes are printed , there are differences and specials for it , it uses special ink , and prints colors on both sides , and images are slightly raised .
Finally , inspectors at the bank manually check all printing sheets and divide them into three categories : " bad sheets " are sent for disposal , where things are securely destroyed ; " Good quality sheets " will go for packaging and distribution , where sheets are cut , packed and dispatched .
My favourite sport is football . I like it so much . It means a lot to me . It means partnership , teamwork , entertainment , exercise .
I advise anyone who dreams of being a member of the most famous teams to work on himself a lot and play football a lot to be professional in this sport and show a lot of matches & followed by captain supervised on him
This issue is not clear - cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding on a career in our life .
I think that , on balance , it is more important to try to get satisfaction .
We work eight hours a day , so if we submerge in a bloody pond for a long time , we could definitely make ourselves frustrated .
I would choose a job with satisfaction .
Customer satisfaction brings me happiness .
Also , the satisfaction of the customers pushes me to work harder and be better at my job .
Job satisfaction could make us to purchase perfection .
As a result , job satisfaction is a good way to get paid better .
I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customers a fabulous dish .
They also have a playground where children can play and moms can sit on benches and gray when grandparents accompany their grandchildren and a red deck painted with some dolls that say ,
Possibly , we will live in space or underground .
In the future , everything could change .
A variety of negative impacts appear as a result of rapid urbanization .
Not only the growing proportion of impervious surfaces , but also the " false " green infrastructure contributes to it .
Mountains of studies have demonstrated that green infrastructure is an economical , beautiful and effective strategy to control stormwater .
However , urban flooding keeps raging , even when the amount of green infrastructure fulfils the stormwater - control needs in some areas .
What is the obstacle that stopped these green infrastructures from providing the ecosystem service of mitigating and eliminating urban flooding ?
Most girls do n't like this . I think that it brings us energy , we need to do exercise , have a reasonable diet ... and so on .
This article is about what I think about the efficiency of public transport .
When I lived for more than 12 years in the countryside , I was dependent on buses and trains .
Spontaneous activities were impossible as you always had to plan in advance .
I do agree television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed for several reasons .
First , this kind of advertisement should be forbidden on account of the fact that young children are still very vulnerable .
For instance , when I was three years old , I used to be captivated by all the toys which were presented in TV commercials just because of the way they were presented .
Secondly , I am also opposed to the allowance of this advertising because of the severe consequences it has on the parents ' and child 's relationships .
It is common to see parents having issues with their kids because of this kind of commercial .
Many parents have an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrecked relationship , with their kids .
One day , Sophia got really excited about an advertisement for a barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy .
Unfortunately , my cousin did not have enough money to buy it , but her daughter - a three - year - old kid - did not understand it and got angry with Patricia , not speaking to her for three weeks !
In conclusion , I am strongly in favour of this statement . Advertisements for young kids , not only upto 5 but upto 8 years old should be forbidden because of the kid 's vulnerability and the risk to their parents ' relationships with them .
Finally , if the advertisements are still broadcast , it is essential some educational politics comes with them , valorizing and teaching kids about understanding their parents .
I read your advertisement in my newspaper last week .
I did a one - week internship in a restaurant in my village .
I 'm really interested in that job .
By the way , I live near to the cafe , so I have a short duty stroke and will come punctually every time .
I am writing in response to your advertisement which I saw in " The Daily Magazine " last week .
I would like to be considered for work in your cafe during the weekends .
I consider myself to be a responsible and enthusiastic person .
I am really interested in different kinds of food and I love to cook .
I have some experience in this kind of job as I worked in a restaurant for two years .
If you need any further information , please do not hesitate in contact me .
Yours faithfully ,
Tanta will be an attractive city and it will be an important tourist destination in the future .
The reason can be attributed to increased consumerism and lack of awareness about waste management .
In the following paragraphs , I am going to analyze these issues in a detailed way to provide a solution .
I fully understand why it is so difficult to decide which activity is more important for you .
However , sometimes we need to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
As you know , I am a person who likes sport and music , but if I had to decide which of those activities is more important , then I would choose sport .
In conclusion , I think you should give up your music classes .
Nowadays , cars are more affordable than ever .
With the development of technology , people will use other means of transport .
Bearing in mind that society is also changing , people will tend to choose a place of work which is near their home and wo n't need to spend time travelling .
We are witnessing a great development in working from home these days , which will also lead to fewer people using public transport .
Three Suggestions to be a Doctor
People are not interested in physical exercise & healthy food . Instead they are very interested in earning money .
If people live the same way as now , in the future , people will be considered as working robots instead of human beings .
When I was a junior high school student , I enjoyed playing basketball with my classmates .
For several reasons , I really liked to play basketball . First , playing basketball can train your muscles and make the body healthier . Second , my classmates and I all know how to win a game from basketball because basketball is a team sport .
If you play basketball and enjoy the game , you just go to the basketball court with a basketball , and try to throw the ball into the basket again and again .
Three paradigms result from the attempt to characterize Spanish tourism research epistemologically through the study of the AECIT Conference proceedings .
They are distinguished mainly by the disciplines from which they come : marketing and management , economics and geography .
Also , for low income families , who could n't afford to buy new cars , public transposition will help them to survive .
I 'm a very happy person and very interested in cooking and all things about the kitchen . It 's cool . My dream job is cook .
Currently , I am in Syntagma square in Athens and it 's tremendously hot weather ! The sun is literally burning ! I 'm going to have a meeting with other international volunteers here in an hour .
I am getting in touch with you to inform you that from November 1 different activities will be carried out in Caceres to attract numerous tourists from different places .
There will be leaflets , cartels at its disposal , in which it will be possible to find museums , churches , exhibitions .
Also , this year Caceres is the gastronomic capital . Therefore , they will find typical menus with products from Extremadura in its restaurants .
A comparison between people who like to use public transport and private transport shows that the former can save money and time but they are also much more relaxed than people who use private transport .

In the modern growing world , the basic needs of the general public are increasing day by day and their expectations of quality of life have taken on new dimensions .
But today , things are changing and technology plays a significant role in our lives . The automobile industry increased its vertical and having a car has become a necessity rather than a luxury .
We can see nowadays , more and more people would prefer to use their own car instead of buses or taxis because they feel comfortable and mobile in it .
I believe that as soon as the automobile industry develops new technology in cars , people will be more keen to use their own vehicle instead of public transport .
There are many reasons responsible for a better understanding between parents and child .
The first reason is none other than the generation gap .
As far as I know , how to better understanding between parent and child .

The actors ' performances are sublime , and they make you feel afraid throughout the film .

At Easter time , the important thing is to consecrate Christian tradition . In contrast , the pagan spring festival does n't focus on consecration but rather on celebration .
My town takes care of the environment , because the people of my town try to plant as many trees and plants as they can .
The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or anywhere that is too polluted , so they try to keep the air at recommended levels . In the morning , a lot of people go on foot to work or to school , or ride a bike , or they take the bus .
Travelling by car is convenient , but for most people , public transport is very important and much needed .
Not all people can afford to make journeys by car . A car is easy and cozy also , but public transport is fair and is very affordable for all classes of people .
Why do cultural differences sometimes cause the division of a country ?
Recently , Scotland really has ' Hit the world ' because some of the Scotch have tried their best for the Scotland referendum .
- It goes without saying that cars are much more convenient than late trains , but I can not agree with the overall statement , although I do abhor using public transport .
I have been travelling with both for years , and I reckon everyone ends up needing public transport one day or another .
I would be a tad oblivious thinking vehicle ownership is granted beforehand when younger .
As a grown - up now , I know full well how much more affordable public transport is , albeit less than before .

Compared with the past when we uses horses for transportation .
The reason why we have such improvement is that the technology and innovation have changed our life .
Cars replaced the horse , and even planes have replaced the cars for long distance transportation .
So I think there will be a future for public transportation , and this may be because of updated technologies .
Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexing problem . So her mom told her that they came out of the park at 9:00pm . It was still late but not too late , so they were on the street and the police arrived because the police thought that she had a globe of wine , and her mother told the police that she did n't have alcohol or wine in her car , and the police did n't believe her and they took them to the police station so they could check her car , and after about 10 minutes , they told her that she did n't have anything . So they went from there to their house and it was late , so that 's the reason .

If I told you to choose between travelling in a car or by bus , which one would you pick ?
But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going ? that 's because of people changing their minds . They started to like having their own way of travelling . Privacy is also an important reason . People need to have a private means of transportation .
I remember those years and I would like my children to practise it when they are older . It is an interesting sport .
Nowadays , I like to do other sports : tennis , basketball , ... but I prefer playing football with my mates on weekends , and then we drink some beers in the pub to celebrate the victory or the defeat .
I am here to write a composition about public transportation in Somalia , especially the capital city , Mogadishu , where there is little public transport compared to our neighboring countries . There is a scarcity of public transport and there is one type and model , which is the van , and very distracted roads , which may cause collateral damage .
Sometimes , passengers and drivers face risks and road blocks , which usually happen when the Somali government leaders are travelling across the city and even abroad .
So , having a good infrastructure helps a lot and constant peace and the people of Somalia will not suffer any more .
1 . Is it possible to go without a compression machine ?
2 . I 've noticed that the machine 's cost is higher than it was previously .
As for public transport , you can save fuel as well as reduce pollution , but it takes more time to reach the destination ,
while if you have your own conveyance , you can save time and , moreover , it is safe .
But keeping in view of the environment , we should choose to use public transport .

I live in Bhubaneswar with my family .
It is a clean and environmentally friendly city .
The city has its own public transportation system and waste management system .
People who live here take care of the city 's environment , so the city is a clean and green place .
The parks are full of greenery ; these parks are also used as playgrounds for children .
Trees in the parks are not sufficient according to the requirements of our city .
Everybody got interested in the project .
Our city has a well equipped waste management system .
Each house in the city has two types of dustbin to keep recyclable and non - recyclable items separate .
In the morning , a waste collection truck comes and it takes this waste away .
These waste materials are processed in an environmentally friendly way .

I do not agree with what journalists do , because , to me , if I were a movie star , a famous man who had done many performances , I would not like to be pursued by journalists every hour of the day .
In addition , everyone wants to have a moment of privacy and because of journalists , paparazzi , they can not have a moment to relax , tutoring for children or dependent on what else you want to do , and you can not because of journalists .
Sometimes they abuse the right to be a journalist with all sorts of questions , with no response , or have a partial response to these famous people can say that journalists have a stressful job for some people .
And finally , I would like to say yes , I am against these people , or they might still change their style and everything would be OK !
Even though I always thought that doing any task with family was pointless , after my marriage I understood the importance of a family who always want to make me happy .
In the past , I did not care so much in respect of having good amount of stock , I always enquired about availability and loved to get anything new for my sweet home .
You sent me a lot of information , but the most important was about the culture .
Nowadays , the number of endangered species has increased .
But a lot of people say that a zoo can protect endangered species from illegal poachers .
people to watch animals in their natural environment , and most importantly , will allow
our future generations .
Nowdays , the number of endangered species has increased .
people to watch animals in their natural environment , and most importantly , will allow
our next generations .
My town is called Assuit . The People here have no knowledge of how to deal with their rubbish . people throw their rubbish everywhere . On the other hand , we haven't any kind of law that can limit that action . I mean rubbish throwing .
So , if we still do n't do anything new , our country will still be unattractive .
Public transport is a bit uncomfortable .
Because if everyone uses his / her car , pollution will increase and that will eventually affect every living being .
The " Casa Alvaro restaurant " is a restaurant situated in Valença , a small city in the north of Portugal .
The restaurant won a Michelin star in 2013 .
The restaurant is very well situated with a big car park and beautiful landscaping .
As you enter the place , you are welcomed by a magnificent setting , a lot of photographs of the restaurant 's story and you have a wonderful view of the kitchen where you can see the chefs working , so you can see the quality of the food .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients and the service is great .

I have good abilities , such as , organizing activities and helping the kids to keep their rooms tidy .
The charts below give information about the most important reasons for studying among students of different age groups and the amount of support they received from employers .
But there are two places that I meant at the beginning . They are a big zoo called Kolmorden and the biggest aquapark in Scandinavia , which is called Rusha .
As a student at a local school , I would like to say that to cancelling the field trips
Furthermore , going on field trips gives students a chance to try things for themselves .
In addition , field trips are an important part of our school activities .
Unfortunately , I saw you last many days ago .
As you can imagine , I visited a lot of monuments and cathedrals which I could see and find out something new about them .
As I discovered , the river Danube is the loveliest of rivers .
It 's what we call the Mediterranean diet .
It includes vegetables , meat , fish and olive oil .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
So , I think my favorite sport is going walking in the countryside .
I love it when the temperature is a little bit cold , but not too much .
And sometimes I take my camera with me , because I love photography and there are so many great motifs .
Restaurant .
But there 's a difference between eating a good meal , and eating by the way .
In this opportunity I 'm going to talk about different cool restaurants we could choose for going out at the end of classes .
The reason is , three days ago , he had been working when a girl at his work asked him whether he had a girlfriend and he said " I had one , come on , you know my ex - girlfriend " , then she just walked away without saying anything .
He remembered two years ago when he had been working and he decided to return home early . While he was on his way home , he saw his girlfriend with another guy . They were hugging .
He arrived home and he just thought and thought all night . It was the second time that she had been unfaithful . Since then , he has been alone .
This girl was an acquaintance of his .
They were talking about their lives and he remembered how he met her on the bus . Maybe she had always been the woman of his life . He looked at her eyes and smile he wanted to ask her whether if it was not too late to start to get to know her . But he decided to leave the pub . He walked to the exit .
I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year , because Norovirus infected me ! At first , I had a high fever , but I thought if I took some medicine I would be fine .

We will review their performance in 6 months and , accordingly , will decide on any upward / downward revision in their salary .

My living room is the best room in my house because it is big , comfortable and beautiful .
There are three sofas around the coffee table and it is so comfortable .
In addition , there is a small blackboard for my little brother because my mother wants my brother to learn Arabic and English letters .
When this phenomenon occurs , most of the migrants need to learn the new language to adapt to the new environment .
As a consequence , they forget their first language .
Another important point is the necessity of approval by some indigenous groups or people that emigrate from the countryside to the city in order to get a better lifestyle .
We are facing a crucial moment due to the extinction of most of the indigenous languages .
Public transport will be worse in the future than travelling by car because it is uncomfortable and slow .
In Spain many people will travel in their own car or by car with their colleagues or friends . This mode of transport is quick , but it is much more expensive .
The apartments in the cities are much more expensive and people prefer to travel in their car .
I think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
This is convenient in terms of the cost of travelling , because every cost is divided between the participants and it is an opportunity to meet other people .
My country is a very interesting place . We have a lot of ancient and mystical places .
You can travel to Samarkand , Bukhara , Khiva and other historical cities .
I think you could n't work in my country , because it 's illegal for foreigners .
We meet near a fast food restaurant and after that we decide where to go .
We like it because the cafe has a beautiful design and tasty food . After that , we went for a walk on embankment .
First of all , thank you professor for teaching me in the meantime . The entire course really benefited me , especially at the first meeting , about British English . I still did not really understand , it makes me frustrated , but gradually , later I found the beauty of the language in British English . I think it 's all because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's easy to learn , and you are really very careful and very humorous . You 're always careful in pronunciation correction for each student , and using a variety of reading skills lets us immerse ourselves in reading .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really hard to study , because we all learn American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opportunity to in be contact with British English , it 's full - of - tone cadence always feels particularly charming , and British culture exudes noble temperament , so the British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance .
And the strengths and weaknesses of both segmental and suprasegmental , I think it 's maybe the learning habit . When I hear sentences , I use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again . Therefore , I can easily interpret illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missed a few notes , such as -d , I did not notice this because when I deliberately stressed -d , I found the tone and mood more likely to become very weird . This is the biggest problem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm not teaching English in my new school , but in the future , if there is the chance , I will definitely give it a try . especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , the biggest gain this course is to read picture books to read and record , because that and English proficiency is not just training , but will note that strengthen their pronunciation and intonation , and then each time peer feedback also completed the listening exercises .
If I have an opportunity to go back to teaching English , I think I will try this skill to get my students to do the recordings heard training , then make their English better and better .
My village is in the north of the region of the Extremadura .
The population of my village is about sixteen hundred people .
The town hall put containers for trash in the streets and the workers from the town hall clean the streets .
To begin with , nowadays more and more people prefer travelling by car rather than by bus or train .
Certainly , it is more comfortable to travel in your own transport with your family or your friends . You can stop and have a rest wherever you want .
To differentiate between old computers and computers today , we would first have to describe each type of machine .
I start by describing the old computers which we saw in the video , which were a few simple machines ( at the time they were created ) and they filled an enormous room .
These were experimental models .
Currently , in the 21st century , computers have had a very long technology advance which range from the software and the size of the internal memory ( bigger than old computers ) , the size of the computer ( which is varied , but smaller than the computers of the past ) and their shape , the weight of them ( they are more lightweight ) and variations in the colors of the screen ( visually ) .
Finally , I can say that with the passage of time we change the way we see the world , evolution comes into play , not only of technology , but also of society , religion , etc . ,
Sometimes famous people want to be alone without any journalists .
Journalists follow you and they do n't allow you to live like normal people .
My opinion is the opposite of the one expressed in this composition title .
I live in a city , and for many people like me , the most convenient transport is public transport .
There is heavy traffic and difficulty finding a parking space .
Every day , the population spends a lot of time in traffic congestion .
A representative to carry out an investigation so that the town takes care of the environment .
One thousand people of eighteen years and over were questioned in my town about their ways of taking
care of the environment .
The investigation reveals that youngsters are more than ever power to
In this case , a representative put all times the published in the train , the bus and the school
In addition , the investigation can bring within company in
There is a service representative whose occupied the rubbish shared planning of day .
According to the enquiry , a representative works with a recycling company .
It 's in AL - Sulaymanyiah district .
Also , it is near Bandati Minimarket and AL - Shafa Hospital .
It has some disadvantages like , it hasn't a private parking lot .
Finally , my apartment is very beautiful , and it has a lot more advantages than its disadvantages .
An Unforgettable Lesson
There are various kinds of different things that happen in people 's lives , some may be normal and nothing special , while others may be so meaningful and unforgettable that you will remember them for a long time .
Have you ever had this kind of experience ?
When I was in elementary school , I took part in a speaking contest , but I failed , and I was broken - hearted .
Eventually , I was third in the contest .
Through this time , I learnt that winning and losing are not the most significant thing .
Resolve/ determine / insistence
My country has witnessed a tremendous change in the last ten years .
But now , I feel uncomfortable without food every day .
Currently we usually do less exercise than before , because we use our cars to go everywhere .
On the other hand , children are used to eating only what they want , because in general , they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruit , fish ...
They like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sweets and , what 's more , they do n't do any exercise .
So it 's very important to give them a healthy upbringing .
That 's the reason why we have to do more exercise , eat less fat and more vegetables , and teach our children to eat better and healthier than they are used to doing .
My opinion of self - employment
My dad and my grandfather ran their own business for more than 20 years .
Nowadays , the number of car owners has been increasing in many countries , especially in developed countries , due to the convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some people claim that the social trend tends to reduce the popularity of travelling by public transport .
As a result , this development is highly controversial in positive and negative ways .
The lifestyle , technological equipment and the design of cars and houses keep changing annually .
We can not stop changing , but we can guide changes to provide special benefit which makes life easier and more comfortable .
Using the changing method would improve the education system in many ways , especially for people with obstruction .
In conclusion , the changing of our life can help us to explore different benefits of changing every decade .
It service the education and entertainment aspects of our lives .
The ecological problems have been very bad for the last few years .
The urban authorities can not change the situation cardinally .
But there is active construction of new roads , road junctions and improving of roads .
All rubbish is taken away without separation .
But people are interested in it and this year I saw announcements about days for receiving separate rubbish .
But I hope one day to go to a tournament , travel to Spain and watch my favourite player , who is Rafael Nadal from Spain .
Once in a while , I enjoy watching tennis when there is a competition or tournament , besides watching and enjoying it , I can also learn how real the game is , what its rules were or what happens when they yell at the umpire for no reason . You can learn all these details and wait for a future day to put them into practice , or helping the players is one of the things that I want to make real .
Travelling by car is much more convenient .
Riding a horse is an old - fashioned way but still interesting .
Public transportation is excellent ; you save money , take care of the environment and make friends .
Nowadays , Easter is associated more with spring 's arrival than with religious rituals .
People are more likely to take care of the gardening or shopping than participate in the celebration of Good Friday , which makes the author connect Easter with a pagan spring festival .
Flamengo was champion in 2009 . In 2009 Flamengo had a great team with good players , but now it is struggling to finish the competition in the first 4 teams of the championship .
It must be the aftereffect of whatever those clowns in masks have done to me . I want to shut down all the noises around me , especially those whispered shouts coming from behind .
She 's incredible ; she is like the sister I never had .
It is a really beautiful place and has a lot of attractions scenery , such as the great beaches beside rows of trees , the obviously regularly weather ... Therefore , taking care of the environment there is a vitally important mission of my town 's state .
When receiving an alarm about the pollution of water or land ... by the town 's inhabitants , the authorities must reposibile for this cause .
Finally , the government usually encourages on the radio , television etc .
If it is very cold outside , I put a jacket on , but if it is very hot , I wear shorts , sandals , a lighweight vest and sunglasses .
In your message , you said that you needed to find a famous person in my country and needed some suggestions from me .
In modern life , we rely on transport to get to work or travel everywhere .
It is convenient to travel by private car everyone can afford it , so that everyone has a private car nowadays . Some people suggest private cars are going to replace public transport .
Not to mention , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travelling on holidays .
Secondly , private cars are the main reason for air pollution . We should consider the protection of the environment for the future of humanity , not only care about the convenience we can see for now .
On the contrary , we need more public transport to improve our traffic system and find a better way to protect the environment .
It was 11 pm and her boyfriend was n't in their house . She started getting confused and temerously .
She was terrified . She started thinking about the possibility of death .
She got into her car and looked for her husband all over their small city , Pentonville . After half an hour , she saw him sleeping in a square .
The statement " public transport is our future " has been an interesting political discussion for years .
In conclusion , public transport is very good and if it disappears it will be a big problem . It is true that sometimes you need private transport , but apart from that , public transport is used a lot by people of all ages .
Transportation is very important in cities and villages as well as in sub - lines .
Any Anyway , in some cases , a car is very useful to reach the destination very fast .
Public transport provides all the information about routes they follow and give an idea to passengers about the place .
I 'm a committed , responsible , and organized person .
I like new challenges to improve myself .
I think that I have enough experience for the job .
My skills and accomplishments speak for me , because I 'm qualified for this job , I have the requirements that are requested to apply to work here .
If you choose me , I comitted with myself to comply with everything , working in a timely manner , because that is how I am .
The most important thing for me is to have more work experience and surpass my achievements that I gained long ago .
I would like to advise children who are taking their first steps in this sport , that it is with perseverance and effort that you can achieve great treasures .
They 're healthy activities .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so much more convenient , most people will always travel by train , railway , bus and other types of public transport .
In my opinion , people will travel by public transport more frequently , because this type of transport is less expensive , more reliable and even more environmentally friendly than travelling by car .
On the other hand , we can say that it is really uncomfortable to travel by public transport , but can improve even this in the future .
We can discover new ways of travelling , take more care of our public transport and modernise it , so people will be motivated to travel on it .
My trust in future technology is so enormous that I hope there will be new environmentally friendly and cheaper ways to travel around our world .
If this happens , people will be more social and empatic , not only about people 's emotions , but also about our environment , and they will treasure it .
To illustrate this , when we use renewable energy , we reduce emissions , so , our natural resources will be conserved for our future and our children 's future .
For example , by using wind energy or solar energy for electricity generation , we will use less fuel , which is implicated in emissions .
Secondly , we should improve our regulations that impose rules on people to reduce the use of things that cause a lot of pollution such as using big vehicles or building big facilities such as big factories .
As a result , ways to cut down on pollution . For instance , when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same , that causes a lot of pollution . Because of that , we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars to cut down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improving our regulations are two ways to cut down on pollution for a better future .
Secondly , do more cooperation between countries .
For example , people should cooperate in intervening to bring peace to the world , to stop war in many areas like the United Nations is doing .
For example , the United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . In brief , knowing each other and more cooperation between countries are two ways to avoid war for a better future .
For that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars to cut down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improving our regulations are two ways to cut down on pollution for a better future .
My most terrifying day was January 23rd last year .
At 2 p.m. my mum decided to go to the hospital because I could n't understand anything and I could n't talk .
Currently , a very significant problem for its social and economic impact is the chaotic public transport in Lima .
To solve this problem , Lima has been making long - term strategies .
We do not respect traffic rules and drive only with the intention of going as fast as possible to our destination . This often causes traffic accidents and congestion .
For this reason , people are becoming aware of the terrible problem and are learning and teaching vial culture to new generations .
In addition , public institutions are promoting this and also private companies create advertising to increase awareness .
This is due to the fact that Lima , in the beginning , did not have a plan to design its public roads and highways , and it has only been improvising to build them without any criteria to transport its population .
Currently , this issue is so important that governments are investing and working to create solutions , such a metro .
I think we have really become aware of the chaos of public transport and we have begun to design and implement strategies that , in 20 years , will improve our reality .
Maybe travelling by car is so much more convenient , but there are a lot of cars and those cars produce a lot of fumes and the natural world is dying . If we do nothing , the natural world will disappear .
I would like people to take public transport for travelling , so we will be able to rescue the countryside .
I usually take public transport to go to the University , because public transport is cheaper than a car .
With respect to the international dispute over the Diaoyutai Islands , the Republic of China should consistently express willingness to resolve the issue in a peaceful manner in line with the principles of the UN Charter and international law .
To this end , it proposed the East China Sea Peace Initiative in 2013 , which called upon all parties concerned to take the steps outlined below :
( 1 ) exercise restraint and refrain from taking any antagonistic .
( 2 ) shelve controversies and set up dialogue .
( 3 ) observe international law and resolve disputes through peaceful means .
( 5 ) establish a mechanism in collaboratively exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea .

My neighbourhood is a very pleasant area , it is quite big and it is so green .
The population is estimated at around ten thousand people .
My neighbourhood is surrounded by a large range of mountains which have scenic views .

The purpose of this proposal is to provide details about shopping facilities in my hometown , Vung Tau , and give some recommendations for tourists .
They have a long tradition dating back to the 18th century when Vungtau was a small commercial port .
Not only are they well - known for their long tradition , but they are also famous for the hospitality of the inhabitants living here , which attracts domestic and foreign tourists who come here to see the famous sights as well as shop for souvenirs .
They offer a wide range of choices , from souvenir items such as pictures and jewellery to local specialities , at a reasonable price to suit the interests of different people .
I assure you that there should be high - quality and varied products there satisfying your needs .
It is conveniently situated in the town centre , which takes 5 minutes to walk to as the crow flies .
A lot of products , such as consumer electronics , foods , and souvenirs are sold here .

I highly recommend local shops to our tourists for their cheap prices and the hospitable manners of residents here .
Dear Mrs. Weber and Mrs. Schnappauf ,
To be more precise , I am in the graduating class .
My hobbies are meeting Friends and hanging out with them or playing basketball in my spare time .
I 'm easily excited and nervous because this oral examination will determine whether I can do my A -level at the college of further education in Bamberg , which is what I really want .
There is a grass surface , but it 's also played on artificial grass .
From the point of view of the environment , this is a bad idea , because it uses a lot of gas per person .
A new problem is in the small towns , because they are not designed to accommodate a lot of cars .
I think that the main problem with public transport is the communications between villages and small towns , because they only exists between the big cities .
Some countries have a good communications network and people use then mainly because public transport is cheaper than the car and quicker .
My name is Afsaneh . I 'm from IRAN . I came to London 4 months ago and I want to talk about the Iranian celebration of new year .
We have 3 special days during the celebration of our new year .
1- chaharshanbeh soori
3- sizdehbedar
chahrshanbeh soori :
Sizdehbedar :
It means thirteenth day of spring . On this day , people go on a picnic and spend the day out of their homes in nature because they believe that the number thirteen brings bad luck for them .
The television can entertain , and also educate people .
There are so many educational programs , like Animal Planet , and so many others .
Sometimes , some TV shows are so great that they help you in certain classes , for example , Animal Planet can help you in biology . The History Channel can help in history , etc ... In my opinion , television can be as good as books , and can also be a form of learning as good as only reading books , because TV is something fun , so you can learn and have fun at the same time .
Last year I saw a movie called ' ' Side by Side '' , and it talked a little about life in ancient history , and by coincidence I was doing this subject in school , so it helped me a lot .
In my opinion , television can entertain and it can educate people in different ways .
I am writing in response to your advertisment for SUMMER CAMPS .
I am very interested in the job , because I would like to work for you this summer .
I worked as an assistant chef in a Lagunak Restaurant last summer . I worked in another restaurant in London , but I would like to look after children , because I have studied to be a teacher .
Also , for me , the salary is not a problem , because my motivation is to learn .
Yours faithfully .
In the future , I really want my grandchildren to be happy . That is all I ask for . I may be young , but I think I do n't see myself living on earth in the next 50 years . I mean dreaming does not hurt .
Public transport would have more of a future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use public transport more and I hardly ever use private transport .
Baja California is bigger than Aguascalientes for the beaches and tourist cities .
The transportation is practical because not all places are search , use cars , trucks and sometimes boats more .
Baja California 's weather is not as cold as Chihuahua 's .
The last few days when I was in Baja California I got very little time for shopping and going to the beach .
I think the car is more convenient than public transport .
And without getting stuck in the city because of delays by drivers . On public transport there is the possibility that you 're standing for the whole trip , there is always a lot of people , it is cold in the winter and in the summer it 's too hot .
A terrible explosion resulting from carelessness followed .
In my opinion , all of us should be careful with all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , all human beings should stop fighting and devote themselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Last but not least , we should do everything according to our conscience .
Frankly , it seems that the town that I have been living in has not taken care of the environment .
In general , we do n't care about anything ; water , recyclable things , even our air conditioning .
This is such a chronic problem throughout my country .
Here in Brazil , it is very difficult care about it because it demands serious action and skills from our government , which unfortunately wo n't happen soon .
Our government prefer to keep our population without information , because it is easier to manipulate their minds .
And why am I talking about it ? I am talking about it because the foundation of environmental protection is our mindset . Just with knowledge and information , we will be able to manage actions to save , protect and improve the environment , and instead we have the current result .
but these things are not important if there is not a comfortable atmosphere .
In this report I am going to talk about how my town takes care of the environment .
n the town , he tries to make people aware of the situation and they take care of the environment .
The " green " organisations want to believe the problem is serious and that radical political solutions are needed .
In my opinion , we should be conscientious and stop it . If we do n't stop it , after , it will be too late .
I do lots of activities with them ..
For example : we go to the restaurant , we go to see my brother 's football matches , we eat or stay at home all together .
I do n't argue with only one member of my family .. I sometimes argue with my brother about television channels , but we make up immediately .
I 'll talk about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , and Riyadh City in particular .
It has a lot of beautiful things , like an old church from the 15th Century . This church is in ruins , but the new church is also very beautiful and comfortable .
Another interesting place in my village is the square with its spring .
Also , there are the supermarket , bar and restaurants .
Let us examine the advantages and disadvantages
Also , for some people , it could be cheaper to travel by bus , especially for a tourist from a foreign country .
The bus is a democratic form of transport , which is used by students , kids , adults , rich and poor people .
When you are travelling with a big company , it is the best decision to travel by bus .
Using your own car , you can take the decision of what timetable is more convenient and what route you are going to use .
It 's more comfortable to go anywhere in your own car . The problem is the pollution that this life brings us , and also the parking problems .
Also , travelling by car is so much more convenient because you do n't have to stop in each town , so using your own car saves time .
In my opinion , the most important is thing enjoying your work because we spend an average of nine hours in the office or in whatever work that we do . As a result , if you do n't feel comfortable , your life could be hell .
The truth is , that the ideal would be that all people could work in their dream jobs and , of course , make a lot of money , like for example , Hollywood actors or football players . But that is almost impossible .
Ecotourism Bacalar Quintana Roo .
There are cabins where you can have a good time in front of a bonfire and sleep in a beautiful room made of ecological materials .
On the trip you can do many activities , like climbing , swimming , paddling , rafting and enjoying the place .
I think I am the right person for this job because I have a lot of motivation and a good level of English .
I would also like to get this job because I love the USA and I often do babysitting , so the company of children does not frighten me .
When I was younger , I went to summer camp in France . Consequently , I know which activities I can propose to children .
I love English but there is an interesting subject I want to study and it 's Mathematics .
This subject is beautiful and incredible . like it very much .
The day began as usual and there were no signs of trouble , but when she woke up and went downstairs she saw a dog but the dog was an unusual color .
Firstly , Django Unchained reminds us of the hard life suffered by black people in the past through a great introduction without dialogues , where black people were unchained while they came back to be sold to an owner farm . This was matched with an amazing soundtrack as identity Tarantino 's films .
Nowadays , in many countries , young people are looking for doing sports to be fit and very active and there are many sports to participate in .
On the one hand , there are some arguments for sport , especially volleyball .
When I play volleyball , I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing but volleyball and the intensity of the game . This is a game I like to play .
In addition to this , it pushes me to keep on trying so that I can get everything right .
On the other hand , there are a lot of famous players of volleyball who have had knee ligament injuries .The most frequent cause of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone .
In my opinion , volleyball must then be considered among high - risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings . My advice for someone who is starting this sport is that you will be refreshed after you play this game and it makes you do your work in a relaxed way .
I believe there are numerous possibilities for public transport because cars and public transport play completely different roles in our society .
In Japan , which has one of the largest populations over 60 , many senior citizens prefer using buses to cars .
In addition , a new generation is growing up and they do n't own their own cars because there are few opportunities to travel and because of the high cost of having a car of their own .
Second , public transport provides a quick and easy way to visit unfamiliar places .
It is not necessary for us to know in advance how to get to the destination when we are using public transport .
When it comes to our environment , the use of public transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
It is beyond doubt the taking care of the environment is regarded as a turning point in our life .
It is upstream that irrigates our economic life , and there is no doubt that negligence has the ability to destroy many good aspects of our lives , and our government is doing its best to put an end to negligence ,
but we also must cooperate to save our town . On the one hand , we must Presentation an awareness program for all people ,
and we must not throw rubbish in the street to keep the area clean , and we must Maintain clean trees to keep the area attractive . Thus , we can improve the national income by attracting many people from other towns . And we must teach children that cleanliness is necessary for their health and at their school they should throw rubbish in the waste baskets and anyone who throws it on the ground will be punished . In conclusion , we ca n't do without cleanliness in our town .
The natural environment is being destroyed . That is a problem people focus on frequently .
Building more large buildings can destroy people 's and animals ' living environment and some animals may become extinct .
Governments should take some measures to deal with building more buildings . We will destroy the natural environment .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
I do not agree with this statement because in big cities there are a lot of cars . If all the people in a city use their own car at the same time , there will be a huge traffic jam , so travelling by car is n't much more convenient in this situation .
We are taking part in a championship this year .

Consequently , I need to swim often .
You can go to a swimming club . That is a way to meet people with interesting of same .
I started with three kilometers for one jog .
Now my average jog is 8 - 10 kilometers and going on 40 - 50 minutes .
After rehabilitation , I continued to feel pain in my foot and I still limped .
After these moments , you start doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable .
My recommendations for beginners .
2 ) Work systematically .

I have experience of working in a cafe .
I think I am good at dealing with people , particularly in the food sector .
I look forward to new challenges and tasks .
I am an open , hard - working and responsible student .
In conclusion , Physical Education is necessary in schools because sports improve our health and make us feel good and healthy .
