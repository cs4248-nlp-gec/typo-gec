When I was younger , I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a saleswoman and even a butcher . I do n't know why .
I would like to study Psychology , because one day I would like to open my own psychology clinic and help people .
I consider it more convenient to drive a car , because you carry more things in your own car than when travelling by car .
In my experience , when I did n't have a car I used to use the bus to go to school and go back to my house .
In my opinion , a car is n't necessary when you have crashed in the street . At that moment , you realize the importance of public transport .
Depending on the distance and time to the desired destination , the mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
But generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
Since , we have the option to stop anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train or plane ) .
In addition to that , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
For the above - mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
I love children , and I enjoy looking after them . Also , I organized many sports activities before at my school .
My favourite sport is volleyball because I love playing with my friends .
Volleyball is a sport that is played everywhere . When I am on the beach I like playing with my sister in the sand and then we go in the sea .
When I was young I liked playing with a ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a volleyball net .
How are you ? I 'm writing to give you some advice on travelling and working in my country .
My best friend if looking for a responsible person to look after her sister .
Would you be interested in this job ?
Because public transport is a more cost - effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
But can use a cheaper way of going to their destination , especially if it is far away from home .
For example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane for travelling to another country .
In my opinion , public transport is going to continue to be used in the future because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used , so public transport will continue to have a future but people are going to use cars more than buses or the underground .
If we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for it like we wait for the bus or underground , but on the other hand , cars cost more money than public transport .
In a car , we can just be by ourselves , which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unknown , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family , so both modes of transport are good , and cars do n't need necessarily to bring an end to public transport .
If I had to choose between both forms of transportation , I think I would probably choose the car because it is better for me to go by car than to go by bus .
In my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
At some strategic points in the building , we have special trashcans to separate the garbage into organic , paper and cardboard , cans and plastic bottles and they also give talks and presentations about the earth 's problems , like global warming , pollution , etc .
All these initiatives have made us all , over the years , a recognised ecological community .
My favorite sport is football . Why do I choose it ? Well , football is an international sport . People around the world love it so much ! Barclay Premier League , Liga Premier , Fifa World Cup and so on .
I believe that everything will delight us .
By the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United . They are brilliant . They have amazing football players , and they are awesome .
He went to university to study medicine because he thought that that profession was the most similar to being a super hero .
After some years at university he met a girl called Kate and he fell in love with her and she fell in love with him .
Kate was attending university to study fashion .
Michael and Kate were so happy , until one day Michael told her about his dream of being a super hero . Kate got so agitated , saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid 's dream and that Michael was only dreaming and that would never happen and that super heroes did n't exist .
Public transportation is an important invention in human history . It brings a number of benefits in our life .
It is true that travelling by car is more convenient than taking public transportation . However , it will cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
Giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
If there is no public transportation , traffic jams will be more serious than before .
The car is convenient for humans , but it brings damage for humans too .
It causes global warming , which threatens our environment and harms our daily life .
We can see that there are lots of serious and frequent weather - related disasters happening in recent decades , such as typhoons , hurricanes , wild fires and mud slides .
What other precautions are usually taken ?
The NG Office is notified by the photographer when the film was shipped .
If the film does n't arrive on time , it immediately .
Every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what 's the best way to do an international trip ?
If you are looking for comfort and relaxation , obviously , you have to take a boat .
There is n't any comparison with watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the route that you are taking and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
The pleasure of travelling is travel itself .
Transportation is one of the most important things in life , so we have many of kinds of transportation . Now we travel by car , but in the near future there will be other comfortable and easy ways to travel , like fast trains and planes that can transport you from north to south in less than an hour . This will make businessmen happy and comfortable , because of saving a lot of time and effort , so we hope that the government can achieve this as soon as possible .
Big projects could not be finished without cooperation .
Friends can communicate and exchange ideas , feelings and funny things that happen around us .
More importantly , parents give us life and they teach us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
First of all , we can learn lots of skills from parents based on their own experience .
For example , we can learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we can also learn how to make a meal from parents .
If difficulties are shared with family members , ideas will come up to your family members and they will communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
Computing Technology has been advancing a great deal in recent years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better , and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new invention .
Old computers only let you do math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing video games , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve Computing Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousands of them .
One of the greatest achievements of new computing is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via Ethernet cable or Wireless Connection ( Wi - Fi ) .
As I did n't find anything , I went to the place where he lived and started to look for some information about his life and find people who he cared about . So as I continued to go to his house , I noticed he would always go to the same house , s I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl . She might be his girlfriend , so I finally got an idea . I would drive him crazy just as he did me . That way she would think he had problems with his mind and leave him . But soon i thought about it again and realized that if I did that she would try to help him and they will be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy , almost to the brink of death , just as he did with me !
But wait a minute , am I really sufficiently angry to do this ?
I screamed . My anger had dominated my mind . I did n't have any control over my actions . I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control myself and the only thing I could think of was him suffering a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revenge . The best revenge .
But I was so mad at him and so anxious to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and greater . I had made a decision and I was going to do it . If he dedicated 4 years of his life to torturing me and not wanting me to be happy , the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I wo n't stop until I have accomplished my goal .
I do not agree with this idea completely .
On the one hand , travel by car is really much more convenient , as it gives you the chance to be independent .
On the other hand , huge traffic jams are a big issue when travelling by car .
For me , football is everything in my life .
When I watch football on television I dream of playing in a big team and in a big championship like the Barclays Premier League , Ligue 1 or Liga BBVA .
I play football for a Portuguese club called Valenciano and we won a lot of games this season .
I dream of winning a lot of leagues in football and winning the best championship , the Uefa Champions League , and the best scorer of all time in Uefa Champions League is Cristiano Ronaldo , my favourite player .
I graduated from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology .
I am interested in looking after children and playing with children .
I have experience of holding basketball competitions when I was a student .
I planned many interesting activities for views to make competitions come alive .
My personality is cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
Public transportation has been used by people more and over the years it has been kind of becoming cheaper and also safer , but some people prefer cars . To what extent do we agree with this and what are our reasons for that ? That is what we are going to demonstrate in this essay .
About 40 years ago , there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars , so in those years there were not even good facilities to move from one place to another and that is because there were no companies to build cars . After about 10 years , car trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans . At the beginning , they faced a lot of problems , but they were able to solve them in the end .
Nowadays all modes of transport are more convenient , from cars to buses , even trains and planes . Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it cheaper sometimes , but from another point of view , public transportation is very cheap and even faster . But when it comes to traveling , a lot of people prefer driving their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves more by avoiding crowded places .
To summarise , it is different from some oneis opinion to another . I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more , and that in the end , cars will disappear and will no longer be used .
The topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
This conclusion becomes more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and the exponential growth in their sales figures and , with low budget private cars in the picture , the scenario has drastically changed in the past 10 years .
Development of the biodiesel industry can make a contribution to productivity growth .
A large scale of investment was brought to biofuel development .
Meanwhile , it boosted economic growth and job opportunities , thereby enhancing Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
If you live in a big town or a small one , it does n't matter , but one thing that should be taken care of by the people and organisers of the town , is the environment .
Governments should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
Active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment for their people .
Recycling items can be a good step to start with for a clean and safe environment , which is perfectly and promptly taken care of by my city .
Everyone has to plant a tree in front of their home according to a rule of the provincial government .
People do not realize that cutting down a tree can reduce the production of oxygen in the atmosphere .
Eventually , humans will have no more fresh air to breathe .
Additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public areas and under 18 years old and provides a free session of talks or presentations to increase the awareness of the importance of a clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
In conclusion , I would suggest our neighbour cities take part in cleaning the environment so one day it can be seen in the whole country .
Usually , I play football with my classmates .
Before training , I run 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get power and my body gets energy .
Our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us about how to improve our football skills .
I can say that this coach is an experienced person .
Not so long ago , we had a competition .
You regret that you were n't there with me . I 'll try to describe everything precisely , because I know that you very
I have seen your advertisement in the academy newspaper and I 'm quite interested . I have no plans for this summer , so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
All members congratulated me , as well .
You should know that I 'm a very responsible , kind and funny person .
I hope you consider my candidature , because wo n't disappoint you .
The local council does n't have a project for the environment .
There are orange trees , a large lake and Etna in the background .
But when I was a teenager , I began to experience situations that I did not like , for instance , girls said bad things to me or they talked unkindly about me .
I remember , when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one schoolmate wanted to come to my party . I think that that day was one of the worst days of my life .
To sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
A busy life always compels us to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation systems lag behind motor cars .
This advertisement for a job has been read by a suitable person .
I am interested in this work because I enjoy travelling and I am a teacher , so I like working with children .
Yes , I started my lessons last month and it 's very interesting .
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am interested in applying for .
I can speak English and I am a lovely , energetic and hardworking person . In addition , I have a reference from
I hope you are interested in my application .

Technology has changed people 's lives a lot . In fact , we can think how different our life is compared to either our parents ' or our grandparents ' lives . For example , my parents did n't watch TV , because there was n't any TV in the world when they were young . But that is n't the only difference : we can think about the mobile phone , the computer and finally the internet . Our grandparents could n't have imagined a strange machine like the computer in their lives .
Despite the fact that personal vehicles like the car are now popular , in the future , the existence of public transport will still be absolutely crucial .
Nowadays , people use fossil fuels as the most important source of energy for travelling and manufacturing . This source of energy does n't always remain at a constant level , and someday it will run out .
People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear power and wind power . Public transportation such as the electric metro use this kind of energy .
As a result , governments will invest more in researching the use of these new types of energy , and travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than a using private car .
The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , and it will become much more convenient .
Commuting and travelling using public services will be the first priority .
In addition , the population is increasing rapidly . In the near future , most cities in the world will become overcrowded . This will lead to many other problems that will need to be solved . For example , traffic jams and air pollution .
People will realise that using their own car is just wasting their time in traffic jams or gradually killing themselves by breathing polluted air .
In conclusion , investments in developing public transport will be increased considerably . Public transport services have a bright future and their existence in the future ca n't be replaced .
If you are interested , meet me at 8 o ' clock near the cinema entrance .
In conclusion , it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects a and stable environment for the younger generation to grow up in .
The effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs . Economic stability is affected as a result of a lack of people contributing to the economy .
The cause of brain - drain should be tackled at international and national levels on a broader dimensions and more rational pattern , because it is a global issue .
In this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting the infrastructure and law enforcement to support the public in a positive way .
My friends and I like TV programs , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I like everything .
Jason is my friend , he is drunk and he also dances with his girlfriend .
My life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
The best advice I can give to someone who is starting running is to start slowly and not to try to run too fast , but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little further and a little faster and then , after 20 years , you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
In my opinion , television can be educational . Whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One .
Of course , it 's important to choose the right television shows .
If you 're watching Tom & Jerry , it will hardly have any educational value .
A friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie apocalypse should happen , he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
It is a job with a lot of interesting aspects .
It is dynamic , stimulating and , even if it is not well remunerated , I feel satisfied .
In the last few years , forensic biology has developed many aspects like better sensitivity , robustness of results and less time required for analyzing a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change has happened .
Television seems to be a controversial tool .
Here there is one : does television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
From my experience , I believe television has both entertainment and educational functions .
It notes how many educational programmes broaden young children 's horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learns different basics from a great number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
It also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
Apart from educational content , there is so much bad content , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n't be able to tell right from wrong .
However , I believe the educational programmes on TV still play a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think the best restaurant we can go to is " The Sailor 's Restaurant " .
The atmosphere reminds one of the sea . In fact , the walls are decorated with a lot of shells and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it 's a great idea !
Public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so it has a future .
Currently , most people are used to using their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to it being more comfortable .
But cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to climate change .
On the other hand , with public transport , you only have to pay for the ticket , you do n't have to drive , and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use breaks down , it is n't your responsibility .
In conclusion , I think public transport has a future , and the more people use it , the more future it will have .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students , completing summer homework , correcting homework , diligently assisting the instructor , helped the instructor organize handouts , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also cleaning the classroom , very hard work , but I have nothing to complain about .
I think that the government should help the public transport , for example buses , trains , the metro and more , for a single reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
Travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying to search for parking spaces and because of the cost of fuel , and also maintenance costs .
Conversely , in small towns , it ca n't be good in the same way , because , for the transport companies , it 's not convenient to invest money in transport , because fewer people would use it .
Tom was so sad because Becky did n't to talk to him , so Tom went on a trip with Huck and disappeared for weeks .
The next day , Huck went to Tom 's house to tell him that there was an abandoned house up the hill , so the two boys considered like an adventure .
So they went to the mysterious house and when they were inside they heard voices , so Tom and Huck hid and they saw that Injuin Joe was the one that was talking .
As for your questions , I think that you should work in a Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese " ryotei " and " izakaya " .
By improving their Japanese skills in Japan , they have the opportunity to get a job .
My school has a unique reputation for its friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
I do n't have friends who like swimming . Most like football or similar team sports , so I always go alone . It is n't boring for me . Furthermore , I prefer going alone because nobody bothers me and I do n't have to wait for anybody .
Swimming is relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n't many people in the pool . But sometimes there are children and I do n't like that so much because they like disturbing me . But sometimes it is amusing , too .
I would recommended people who do not know to how swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that they will like it and later they can stop swimming .
I think that dance is a means of self - expression .
When I 'm dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that do n't understand anything .
If dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you 'll keep practising all day until you can .
If you love dance , you 'll understand me .
I love my family , especially my little sister . She is sixteen years old . I consider her my best friend because I usually tell her everything about my life .
Our relationship is not good because she is so different to me .
Also , I have a brother whose name is Jose Luis . He is twenty years old , his personality is dynamic and funny .
In 30 years , we will have changed our anatomy . Also , we will be eating fast food . On the other hand , the North Pole will have melted completely .
The temperature will have become crazy because of global warming , so some people will die because natural disasters will be more aggressive .
Technology will have advanced and maybe cars will fly above streets and computers will have totally changed .
Friendship is something very important in my life .
Communication is the most important point when you 're going to make friends .
If your friendship is real , you will always find a point between your opinion and your friend 's one .
My name is Fouad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , volleyball , one of the most beautiful sports ever and I have been playing this sport 3 times a week since 1980 . The reasons for my enjoyment of this sport are as follows :
As citizens of this village , we really care about the environment of our village .
Every Sunday , we do a mutual cooperation where anyone can treat rubbish as well as they treat themselves .
What we believe , as Muslims , is that we were created by one who does n't have any other with him ; the one who created our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) , and they were in Paradise and instructed not to eat from the tree , but Satan deceived them , so they came to this life and generations came from them and sent the prophet and messengers ( Moses , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who worshipped the same one ) with Miracles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who will follow the truth which will guide them to Paradise and who follow other paths , which will guide them to hell . So , because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
Transportation is the heart of any city , whether it is public or private .
public transportation . Day by day folk are more crazy about their own vehicles which leads to a dark future for public transportation .
First , I agree with the given statement that there will be a tough time for public transportation in the near future , because people want privacy as well as freedom , which is quite impossible on public transportation .
Secondly , this mode of transportation covers
as much as possible of the city or town which mismanaged routine for people who travel by public transportation . As a consequence , generally , people avoid travelling by public transportation . Finally , I can say that there are various modes of transportation available
to compete with public transportation .
Nowadays , people have numerous options for travelling , like many private companies
which play an important role in giving tough competition to the government . As a result of this , the consumer gets more benefits , like lower fairs , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . In addition , many automobile companies launch new cars at affordable prices , which encourages people to use more and more private vehicles .
But some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
Family is the most important institution in society .
Every member has his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , has to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have in life .
Usually there are generational problems ; sons do n't understand parents and vice versa , but by talking and listening to emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
A mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone makes his contribution to family duties .
If you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
I do n't think that this movie is for all the family , because it is hard for little kids to understand . In my opinion it is more of a teen movie .
Apart from that , Karate is not just a sport , it is also a discipline . It teaches you respect , balance , even culture .
For someone who is starting Karate , it is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
Technology is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
Today 's topic is Technology .
Nowadays , we use technology for everything , from education to making clothes . We use technology every day and everywhere .
Technology is always being upgraded and it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but today 's generation is influenced by technology to such an extent that they have stopped doing other activities .
Last year , my friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition . He liked the idea , so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fee in order to enter the competition . He had no money . Fortunately , he has a lot of friends that can lend him some .
He phoned me and asked me to lend him some money to register for the competition .
He took the money the next day , he finished the registration and started writing the story . After spending a long time writing and doing a good job , he went to give his story to the international student magazine office . He found out there was a notice on the door saying that the competition was canceled . He came back very sad and told me what had happened . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Travelling by car is n't much more convenient unless it is much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution of our planet .
Travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n't sit down because there are n't any seats for me .
Another type of public transport is the taxi . Like the car , it is more comfortable too , but it is more expensive than a bus or train .
In conclusion , in the future we should have more comfortable buses .
Unfortunately , when we tell somebody not to draw on the walls , they do not hear us .
As a rule , after the final exams , they do n't know what university to choose .
In view of this , the idea of a year off between leaving school and starting further education is very reasonable .
Secondly , such a year off would give future students a chance to try themselves out in new professional spheres .
Also , they would have an opportunity to be involved in volunteer work .
This year - long holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and getting new energy for further education .
I live in San Miguel Almoloyan . This is a village in the municipality of Almoloya de Juarez in the State of Mexico . Caring for the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions to care for it .
I am interested in improving my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
Secondly , I do n't live in Cork , so it would be great if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer on this course .
Yours faithfully .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately after listening to the conversations of his new neighbours .
He called the police and informed them about his neighbours ' robbery plan .
I believe that there is no future for public transport , using trains is more convenient and less expensive , so to decrease the carbon gases which are affecting the ozone layer , people should be aware of the effect of using public transportation on the economy and environment . Governments should encourage people to use other modes of transport . This subject should be issuesd in all media to teach and encourage people to use the right mode of transport .
The name of the waterfall was Chorrituelo .
It was spectacular .
The wedding was in the morning , and in the afternoon we ate in a restaurant with other people .
English is an international language which has become important for the modern world .
Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
That 's a good phenomenon , because English is essential nowadays .
In my opinion , though English has great significance , English is , after all , a foreign language .
Only by characters Chinese can literature send off its brilliance .
To learn about a country 's culture , especially its classical culture , the first thing is to learn its language .
Last month I was at a fantastic restaurant , Woolypools .
It is small but comfortable and famous for its big burguers .
Woolypools is a specialist of meal , it 's a meal restaurant .
In my opinion , the restaurant could be better , with respect to meat , but it is perfect for having dinner with your friends .
The problem with the restaurant is the location . It is far from people and cities , and the space , which is very small for lots of people .
For example , a present or a gift , especially if it is from your best friend .
In my town we have created a small organization for a more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . The citizens of the town must participate in this . The citizens take responsibility for a specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish in the correct place and clean trees and plant more of them .
I agree with the opinion that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Nevertheless , the journalists are all the time taking photos , all the time , when they are eating , drinking , happy , sad , how is their love life and who they spend time with , if stay with something important or what they buy .
So politicians and film stars will have to put up with it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have a reward in what they earn .
He hated being like that because most of the ants made fun of him , until one day something horrible and inevitable happened .
It was a dark night and it was raining when a big volcanic eruption buried them underground .
People just started to evacuate rapidly until it started a big earthquake ...
One day , Penny discovered it and went to tell it to his queen . The queen , on hearing that , got very confused but at the same time she got mad and she wanted revenge .
I 'm keen on playing basketball the most . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball every day for around at least thirty minutes per day .
After a hard day at university , I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
Basketball has many benefits , not just for me but also for everyone .
When I have spare time , I often gather together my friends to watch basketball matches on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
That 's the reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
With the sweeping progress of development and the booming of populations , a lot of agricultural land , forest and ocean has been used or destroyed to build more buildings and transport networks .
From my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even to humans and animals .
Convincing arguments support the fact that the root cause is that almost all the present - day cities are already packed with places of residence , commercial premises and recreation facilities and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
Additionally , people now continue to destroy more agricultural land and forest in order to satisfy all their needs , which will destroy the ecosystem , diversity and biodiversity , especially the endangered species .
In light of the problems mentioned above , there are various approaches that governments should adopt to deal with this problem . First of all , reducing building construction from now on , and planting more trees instead .
Sustainable development should be awaness to all human beings and start to protect the environment and preserve the animals .
To sum up , this unpleasant phenomenon and its problems should be worked on to resolve them before things get worse , and the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
Nowadays , languages are very important , English in particular .
I took that decision because I was tired of trying to learn English and I did not have the level that I wanted , so when I heard about that opportunity , I said yes .
Nowadays in developed cities there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc . These options are more economical than the car . The problem with the car is that , normally , the car is occupied by one person , when the car is designed to carry four or five people .
This situation creates a lot of pollution for the environment , so we have to be more concerned about the planet 's health .
First reason : the grammar that teachers or institutes teach is like the Spanish language , my native language .
I want to say that it is very difficult to understand the conjugation of the verbs in Spanish , so just imagine the same but not in your native language .

All residents take great care of the environment .
All residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers .
Thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , and in order to not jeopardize our various diseases .

Travelling in your own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride on public transportation . There are several reason to consider .
Finally , there is a risk of becoming a victim of theft and pickpocketing .
However , public transportation is much cheaper than buying a new car and , for the adventurer who wants to have an exciting journey for then to see more action .
Like looking outside or sightseeing , mingling and meeting different people .
In addition to this , I also admire the bullet train in Japan which I consider the fastest and safest public vehicle I 've experienced .
To sum up , I still consider having your own car way more safe and convenient .
Public future unless they have plans to at least lessen the journey times and prioritize the safety of their passengers .
As far as I 'm concerned , I tend to disagree with mineral extraction .
More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
To begin with , extracting the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
However , it will probably disappear if the developing equipment were being set .
Next , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely lead to air pollution .
There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
Last but not least , mineral extraction will turn out to have a profound effect , especially , on our offspring .
One problem is that some people will consider the job opportunities that it might bring us .
Due to mineral extraction , many people in our hometown will probably earn much more money than before .
Nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of vacancies .
In addition , money is not more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
In a nutshell , based on the reasons and examples above , the disadvantages of extracting valuable minerals outweigh the advantages .
Limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearance of poo .
Global warming is a serious issue ; higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
I do n't agree with it , especially while cars are not flying .

At school , I like to play volleyball and I 'm an excellent player .
We usually organise competitions and tournaments with other school .

Contemporary Art is a very controversial subject nowadays .
It is well known that many art curators and artists believe that contemporary art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based on their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the time this is unintelligible .
Nowadays , a lot of empty artworks are being sold at auctions around the world for extraordinarily high prices .
Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
Humanity has reached a level of differences that it will not be possible to stop .
So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available at any given time .
The athletic representative pasted the torch and we sang the anthem .
After that , the sports day began officially .
So I knew that there was someone whose name was pronounced the same as mine .
When I was running , I heard my housemates cheering and felt the wind passing my face .
My house was number two temporarily .
On the second day , my classmates called me to take part in the inter - class relay race .
We had a difference of 0.5 seconds between us and the winner of the race .
I prevented my class from winning the championship .
I hope my house will win the championship next year .
" There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
We should use public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and , unfortunately , we are harming the environment and the world .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
It is commonly debated that tourism has greatly influenced not only the aspects of a country , but of the whole world .
Alongside its development , the ability to travel has become easier to such an extent that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
The existence of multinationals is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as to the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not just a citizen of his own country , but a global citizen .
Secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growth from an economic point of view .
There are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies completely on tourism .
If tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment , and if it influences the environment , it influences transport . How ? people become more careful at their historical sites , thereby preserving them . Transport is developed both on a small and a large scale .
On a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently .
Through the development of tourism cruises and train vacations were born .
They died when John was too little to remember and he never knew what happened , so he went everywhere to look for them . He even walked and walked even at reverse , but he never found them .
The second daughter was named Elizabeth and was a leopard She . was the intelligent one of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
Other animals gave them rewards or bonus because she discovered that water was liquid .
Maybe I found something for you : when I was on the bus returning home I read a newspaper with some advertisements .
My current job is as a nurse at the local hospital and l can do everything that a doctor can .
So , if the kids hurt themselves , then l can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries .
Congratulations from your sister on your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n't a lot of competitions of this kind . If I had the possibility of going , I 'd already buy the tickets .
At the beginning I went to the kindergarten and they taught me to ski .
When I was older , I was able to get better . My dream was:"SNOWBOARDING " , but I had to learn to ski perfectly like my parents .
I took every free minute to go snowboarding .
That is the story of why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you are going down the piste .
That is everything I want to have and I 'm lucky .
Snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for anyone who wants to come to other thoughts .
Also , you spend all the time in the countryside and if you are lucky , you can see animals .
Everything was dark .
She started to take consciousness , although she could n't remember how she got there .
The problem was , the last thing she remembered was that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened because of the wind .
This situation was really frustrating , not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
She knew her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of times , especially the last few weeks .
The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
In the case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century , we have various options , like planes that can fly in the clouds , trains that are fast and big enough to carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of miles an hour and boats that are much bigger and faster than in ancient times .
The first reason is its speed compared to both other means of transportation . It can travel faster .
The plane is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
In conclusion , I will say that the plane will be my first choice out of all three means of transportation .
Everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel . It would be the best award for a student who has attended high school .
Young people want to discover the world and travelling reaches places which would be unreachable otherwise .
Will we see public transport on our roads in 5 or even 10 years ? That is really such an interesting question .
I think that it all depends on the development .
Now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
Yes , I agree , if you planned the journey for a faraway destination and for a long time you would prefer to do it by car , because , firstly , you 'll spend less time , your journey will be comfortable , you 'll have the possibility to stop any where and for a long time , as you need to .
But if we are talking about travelling across your city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the question for everyone , and there ca n't be one answer for all , because one person can use public transport , and save in this way not only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use p.t . because they spend more time travelling or they simply do n't like to travel with other people .
So , in my opinion , even in 10 years , public transport will be passing on our streets with a reasonable number of passengers .
My village is the place where I live , so I am trying to keep its environment non - polluted and suitable for life .
In order to attain this goal , I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows :
guide people and give them information , details and guidelines about pollution .
I 'd like to tell you about my favorite restaurant . It 's name is " Lemon " . I go there every week . It has different food to other restaurants . I like crispy chicken with garlic sauce . It 's an excellent choice for me . And my favorite appetizer is sausage and in order that dessert I like " Vadge " cake with chocolate sauce . I feel at ease when I go there . I enjoy classical music while having lunch . About the service : it 's very good and all the staff are respectable . I ca n't imagine one week without going there . That would drive me nuts . I advise everyone to go there and enjoy their time there . Also , this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really . It 's excellent . The striking thing for anyone , is that despite all of these advantages , the prices are not expensive .
Volleyball is one of the most difficult sports in the world . You have to put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game .
I have been playing volleyball for twelve years and because of that I have got to know a lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life .
When I was 10 , I chose to play with a group of girls older than me . They were good , and I could n't believe the experience .
Volleyball is my favorite sport because when I am playing with my team , I am in another world in which I can be free and happy . Apart from this , when I am feeling bad , this is a distraction from university .
In the newspaper , he read an interesting notice .
The notice was about a competition .
The competition was about writing stories .
Also there are a lot of educational channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new things about the past .
There are many discussions about the future of public transport .
People like to have the freedom to travel comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
Public transport is usually restricted because of the timetables and you can only use transport at the time that the timetable lets you .
On the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than using your own car .
