My town is a medium - sized city with eighty thousand inhabitants .
It has a high - density population because of its small territory .
Although it is an industrial city , there are many shops and department stores .
I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the center of the city which is surrounded by a park .
There is a commercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kinds of businesses : banks , bars , chemists , cinemas , pet shops , restaurants , fast food restaurants , grocers , travel agencies , supermarkets and others .
The quality of the products and services is quite good , because there is huge competition . However , I recommend you be careful of fakes or cheats .
I have my own plan too , but I do n't want to be the same as them . I want to become a journalist .
Working as a journalist is very exciting for many reasons .
First , I will have an opportunity to live abroad .
Next , I will have a chance to attend big parties or events and I can make friends with famous people . It 's interesting !
Finally , I will have a high salary when I am a journalist .
To be a journalist , I must study very hard , so I 'll try to learn in order to make my dream come true .
In the future , I 'll become a journalist .
Before , it was really convenient to go by bus or by train , but with the new economy , the fares are more expensive and a big difference from the past is that it is less expensive to go long - distance than short journeys .
Furthermore , the biggest group of positive feeling students in the present is live with various nationalities .
The possible reason is these international students can not speak English fluently .
In order to give a good image and show the national parenting , our respondents tend to have a great pardon to other nationalities .
First , I tried it with a rental bike in the area of Aznalcazar .
The main reason why I wanted to try it was to lose weight ( I was a bit overweight ) .
Consequently , I realized that although cycling outside helped me to improve my fitness , really I enjoyed most breathing fresh air and taking pleasure in the countryside .
If someone wants to take up this sport , first of all , I would recommended him or her to look for a good mountain bike .
It 's important to avoid accidents , be comfortable and have a good journey .
Secondly , he or she should buy a good helmet and , of course , appropriate clothing .
because it 's difficult to understand ; for example , the characters are ,
The movie is about Lucy 's family , who move into a farmhouse that is mysterious and
Also reflects a comparison of Lucy 's family , and characters
The story actually takes place in a camp and a farmhouse , mysteriously
It 's interesting because Lucy 's mom discovered a wall in their farm , that
In the summer around the lake , there are so many concerts that you have difficulty finding the right one .
In the following decades , revolution and civil wars smote many of the Powers of Europe , and new nations were born .
There was an unparalleled expansion of the English - Speaking Peoples both by birth and emigration .
I a very good experience .
We went there because the university orchestra from UAZ invited us to go there and play with them .
We went to to Acapulco to play , to an event where universities from Mexico go and present cultural activities .
Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there . That was an incredible experience that I will never forget .
Really , I think it 's a very beautiful , interesting and breathtaking kind of sport .
Sometimes the weather conditions are not comfortable for guys . For example : wind , light fog or freezing temperatures . All of these are very difficult conditions .
And also most of them are very attractive . A big advantage for girls , who like nice pictures .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Using public transport can be difficult , because we have a strict time and , normally , we do not have a place to sit and that can be extremely uncomfortable .
Sometimes the staff go on strike and we customers do not know in time . As a result , we can not get to work on time . That is one of the disadvantages of using public transport .
One argument for not using the car is that petrol is very expensive , but public transport tickets are also increasing , so that advantage is not so good , actually .
People usually tell me I 'm a cinema enthusiast , and they are right . I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film , especially when it is a thriller , rather than doing sport ,
If you want to see a good thriller , " Regression " will be your best option . I have seen it recently and , in my opinion , it should be seen by everyone , because I believe people would like it for many reasons .
First of all , the director , who was Alejandro Amenábar , did a great job because the viewers were waiting with bated breath to find out what the ending of this film would be .
What 's more , the plot is easy to understand .
The story took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by doctors and scientists .
However , the soundtrack was awful ; it did n't get having a scared .
In conclusion , my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thriller , which must be seen if you want to have a good time , given that it achieves keeping you in suspense until the end and it does n't be afraid .
In addition , you wo n't have a better opportunity to see it than this week , because just now in Spain the cinema festival is taking place .
In my opinion , public transport in my country will never improve , because my country is so poor and , besides , it is considered one of the Third World countries . And another thing that must be taken into consideration is that the politicians are horrible . They have destroyed my country .
When we ask ourselves how we can take care of the environment ,
Perhaps when we are shopping in the supermarket or other shops we are doing something bad , because we ask the assistant for a bag or something similar to carry this food or other things home .
But we should n't forget the pollution cause by cars . We should use a bicycle or public transportation more .
Also , in the same way , we should walk to our destination .
The governments are also important for taking care of the environment .
They should have healthy habits and , by their example , they can improve the habits of the population .
I love sports but I do not get many opportunities to play a sport . I was born in a village in India . My parents are farmers like most other villagers .
We bought a television in 1888 . After that , I became a fan of cricket .
Sachin and Ganguly were my favorite cricketers . I love their batting .
It was the summer holidays and Michael 's family were at the airport waiting impatiently for their flight to Mexico .
The flight to Mexico was incredible , and very funny .
When Michael got up in the morning , he realized that his kittten had disappeared , and he found Tom 's dog with some white hair in his mouth .
One of the best restaurants I 've ever been to is Spizharka .
The waitresses are helpful and smiling .
Warm candlelight and small tables with patterned table cloths create a friendly atmosphere .
So , my favourite sport at the present time is street workout . I have been doing this sport for a long time already .
I like to exercise on the street even in the season when the temperature outside is below zero .
If it is very cold and wind outside , I do n't worry about it and I exercise at home .
For those people who want to start to do the street workout , I advise you to start with basic exercises such as pull ups , push ups , dips and squats .
These are all basic exercises and they will help you make a good start .
In contrast , his wife respected and loved his mother and never complained to her husband about these bad situations .
Because of this , he always defended his mother and always said the wife was the one responsible .
She was shocked and apologized for a mistake she did not commit .
Edison is said to have created the first commercially practical incandescent light .
He was neither the first nor the only person trying to invent an incandescent light bulb .
Some historians claim there were 20 other inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison 's version , but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors : " an effective incandescent material , a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable . "
( taken from www.bulbs.com )
Edison began serious research into the incandescent light bulb in October of 1878 , and his original design was in 1879 .
Edison and his research team made his discovery commercially and create a company called " Edison Electric Light Company " .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Tom , a friend of Peter 's suddenly fainted and fell down in the class room . I did n't know what to do immediately . First , I calmed myself down and I checked his pulse . It was okay . Then I knew that he was out of danger , so I called my classmates . Everyone came rushing to the spot , but still he was not moving , so we decided to take him to the hospital or call an ambulance . Finally we called an ambulance without delay .
We were waiting patiently . Finally , the ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital immediately .
Recently I saw a very interesting announcement in International Sports Monthly magazine .
I was interested in whether I could write such an article and win a prize .
It 's ordinary bodybuilding .
I live in São Carlos , in the countryside of São Paulo , in Brazil .
In my city , protecting the environment is so difficult .
First of all , we have an extinction area of cerrado close to the Federal University of São Carlos , but sometimes , the area is used to construct a new university building .
Secondly , the council does n't care about the environment ; for example , the council stopped the garbage collection when the new mayor took over the council .
It demonstrated that the effort that was made in the last 10 years was over because of the new political position of the mayor .
It is so stupid because the environment needs to be more important than political positions .
Instead of using selective collection of garbage , or recycling of materials , or a sanitary landfill , we have used a dumpfill that is contaminating the soil .
Finally , the population , most of the time , does n't matter to throw away garbage on the street or in a prohibited area .
In conclusion , in my city , concern for the environment 's protection is not working as it should for the protection of soil , environment and health .
The environment is our surroundings . There is no awareness in our locality . They are busy with their own work . No one focuses on or sees what is happening in our town . They usually speak about how hot it is today , but they do n't know what makes it this hot . I am interested in planting trees and making our surroundings clean . Some people used to burn the forest as if the forest is useless . Man is greedy because all the things we get from the forests are free .
They do n't care about the environment because it does n't give anything to them .
Management accounting practice is very important for an organization for making decisions about human resources , sales , marketing and potential customers .
Most organizations know how management accounting practice affects their work . Therefore , they choose good programmes and employees .
I was in the USA last year , first in order to look for a job as a pharmacist , but also , having a lot of time to explore a new world .
The environment is always a hurting problem in the world .
To take care of the environment , each of us has to do something such as propaganda to the people in the country . About my village , we use banana leaves instead of nylon , dispose of garbage sensibly ... and so on .
I live in Saudi Arabia(Riyadh ) , and I 'm in grade nine .
Are you studying mathematics for your exam ?
I have just finished my lunch break , and before preparing everything to go to work , I was thinking of you and I wanted to give you a little surprise with these fantastic photos . I hope you like them .
I would like to apply for the job that you have advertised .
I have worked in many kitchens before , and I have gained a lot of experience there .
We got there at five o'clock . We had not yet reached many people , so we took the opportunity to give the gift , which was a washing machine the finished clothing to reach the store , and apparently they were in need of a new one , as the bride loved .
Half an hour after we arrived , everybody started arriving , there were many greetings , thanks , hugs , kisses , and then we all went to the table , which was magnificently stocked , with plenty of food of all kinds , drinks , but we were all waiting for the main course . Also , the food was magnificent , but the best part was when the couple went to the pool . We were lucky they had an amazing wedding planner who arranged magnificent and fun activities . He said to the bride and groom that they should each get into an inflatable ball and try walking on the water for as long as they could , and the bride won because the groom slipped and fell after them , out of the ball , fell into the water , and kissed .
In my country people make a lot of mistakes and have a lot of bad habits concerning their attitude towards rubbish . They are always throwing their old things and rubbish away in public places . The government also can not do their role towards their people and their bad behaviour .
Once upon a time , there was a monster in a city called " Michenstain " .
Michenstain was a very tiny city . That was one bad thing for them ; the other bad thing was that in the city , there was a monster called " Monsteration " .
Monsteration was a very lively monster . He always migrated to the north every Monday .
In the day , he was a mild monster , he was very visible ( because he was big ) ; but in the night , he was the opposite . He killed people , destroyed complete cities ; he smashed all the architecture of the city , and did a lot of bad things .
One day , Monsteration 's next destination was the city of Michenstain .
But when he arrived in Michenstain , all the people went : " DAHMMMMMMMMMM " .
It was in the middle of the night when he arrived , so he was eager to destroy everything .
He was spoiling all the people 's crops , he was destroying all the vehicles , and he destroyed a vast area .
The next day , he was a very attractive monster . In other words , he was undercover in another monster 's body .
He was completely different ; it was impressive the way he was acting .
The thing that he ( the monster ) did n't know about was that he had a spectacular infection ( literally spectacular ) that I think had no cure . It was called " The Monsteration Infections " .
( In those times , there were diverse monsters , but none of them was like him ; he was the number 1 of the monsters at destroying things . )
Scientists were trying to find a cure for the Monsteration Infections , but they still do n't have it .
In their laboratories , they had a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country , but they used them .
Some scientists did n't care about the infection ; they were playing ultimate team on their iPods .
The scientists that were making the formula had a lot of tension , but finally , they did it and they said : " Magnificent " .
Well I 'd like to talk to you about my experiences as an English student for many years .
I have needed to use English a lot of times during my professional activities . For that reason I took some English lessons many years ago .
I can tell you that I feel I can understand over 90% when I 'm listening and when I 'm reading , but my main problem with English is , of course , when I have to speak . I fee terrible and without confidence . I think that I 'm always thinking in Spanish and then doing the translation into English . Maybe at this moment , while I 'm writing this composition , I 'm making the same mistake . I know that learning English is a long process , but I must follow that process because I 'd like to be an excellent bilingual person .
Currently , I 'm working as a teacher at the university and teaching in English is my goal .
I 'm writing now without using a dictionary and doing this composition without translating from Spanish ( I hope hahaha )
I hope you can help me understand more about how to improve my English level and develop my skills .
It is impossible not to love doing sports activity in the fresh air .
On the weekend I stayed at home . I started reading " Eleanor & Park " ; it was amazing . I laughed a lot because of the things that the characters said .
The day before I started school , I did an investigation for literature class .
The Metro is even good for the health of the people as there is no pollution because it runs on electricity and it also connects most of the city . As Delhi has a wide area span of Metro that is really awesome .
Jiu - Tian Folk Arts Group is a group of people who are good at our traditional performance , which is " imitating the faces and posing as gods " .
Because all people like money , for example , many people do n't buy a car with expensive tax , so people have to use public transportation , such as buses , the subway , etc .
Public transportation will rich , so we can build more stations for suburban and more public car to carry this .
I am 29 years old , and originally from Brazil .
I am an English student and I have been studying for five years , and recently , I passed the FCE , which is a well recognised certificate .
In 2010 , I graduated in electronic engineering .
From June to September of 2013 , I worked for a tourism company . My position involved looking after groups of people going to England . This previous experience makes me suitable for the job advertised .
In addition to this , personally I am really helpful , exciting , cheerful and committed .
I do sports such as football , basketball and chess , and with these skills , I could help children have fun while teaching them all the benefits of doing sport .
In applying for the job offered , I am willing to work in all different sorts of jobs . I do not mind which , as long as I have the opportunity of being in the USA , as English is my passion .
To sum up , I feel rather confident to assume this position and thank you for considering my application .
Yours faithfully ,
Alessandro Costa .
I am really overwhelmed to be the third member of my small family- Peter , Maria , both of whom are my parents of 45 years of age and my little brother , Patrick-14 years old in a mischievous manner .
Nowadays a person 's worth seems to be judged according to social status and material possessions . This mostly happens in high class families , as they focus on achievements like power , political influence etc . On the other hand , for middle class families the old - fashioned values are still important as they are inherited from our ancestors in terms of values like honesty , kindness , loyalty , etc .
The metro is the most comfortable means of transportation in Moscow .
Using overground transportation is not comfortable because of the traffic .
There is no difference if you use a car or the bus .
That 's my dream " when I joined the faculty of languages and translation I was very happy because I had achieved my dream .
all of the answers were , " you have to listen and read so you can write and speak well " . I said okay I have to depend on myself . I began to join groups on Facebook where I found some of the people shared their knowledge with others . I followed them immediately .
to teach children and adults in my country good English , and I want to avoid traditional education .
The best thing that can encourage me to open this center is that I have 5 friends in my country who study in the faculty of languages and translation and I think that they will be very happy about joining me in my center .
One day in October , Michael , a boy who was studying architecture discovered a box with a message . While he was opening the box , he heard a door open .
Michael was very agitated and confused because he did n't understand anything .
This situation was impossible because his father was dead and , at that moment , he ran and opened the door and his father said " You must stay here , because I must speak with you more and explain why I can speak with you " . But Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Today we received a shipment from Visual service center under our old account number . It could be a mistake by the service center as a notice regarding major organizational restructure has already been sent to service centers .
In the issued notice , it clearly states that all defective parts should be sent to Slovakia with effect from 01/06/2015 .
If any more shipments are returned using our old TNT account number , there is no option other than to invoice the service center for not following instructions .
Many doctors recommend the practicing of sport , because it is very healthy for our bodies and for our minds .
Every day , there are many articles and news items that talk about the benefits that you get if you practise sport .
Even if you do n't lose weight , you can gain endurance and flexibility .
In conclusion , sport is absolutely necessary and useful for you to be able to improve your life .
I like everything from pop , electronic , hip - hop to calm music .
I like the restaurant we ate at when we were on a ski - vacation in Champoluc .
A flat world is created by the internet .
This is the power of information technology .
The social networks , such as Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google plus ... are connecting us to more and more friends , companies , public figures , books , films , social organizations ... . We really have a lot of things to see , to think , to " like " , to " comment " on and dozens of other ways that we can make an action to interact with others . So , maybe it is true that we have less time to think about ourselves , to take care of our health .
They help us to communication with the world and we have only twenty hours a day . We know more things but we lose more time for many other interesting things .
But it just happen in the information technology and related fields such as : communication .
On the other hand , we still have a lot of other technologies to create a lot of useful machines , on - side services to make our life better and better day by day .
Transportation helps us go abroad more quickly , even go into space on a tour .
We feel more happy , comfortable and refreshed after something like that .
Biotechnology gives us more food .
Yes , we are solving many problems with our technology for our feeling , our health and our finances , too .
You take the world in your hands with technology to make your life better and better actually , but it is not full that it will good , let keep it with your needs , your time and your money too .
How can I help the environment ?
How can a group of friends help the environment ?
Egypt has a lot of historical places , such as the pyramids , and is the one of the empirical in the world and a lot of people from around the world come to see these pyramids . the wold think about how the Egyptian people made these buildings maybe a thousand years and they still stand without change and a lot of tourists come to take photos in the pyramids and study the stone and how the old Egyptians made them without modern tools such as cranes and other modern machines . A lot of scientific teams come from all over the world to study these buildings and conduct Egyptian science in a lot of universities around the world , to study how the air goes inside these buildings and how it keeps the food inside it and how these big stones were taken from distant places and brought to this place and how this building kept the bodies of people after they had died and how these people live inside the buildings and why these buildings are like this and what the benefit of these buildings is and how to make kike this building .
Public transport has improved regional development in the past decade . It 's convenient and necessary for city life .
But when it comes to travelling , it 'll be more convenient if you have a car , because you will not want to go where everybody goes .
And , there 's really enough development on our planet . It would be better if we could leave some place empty , we do n't need so much convenient transportation , and we can still live well .
Today we have cleverer cricketers and more famous umpires than other countries .
But those countries are very developed and they have many facilities .
But Sri Lanka is a developing country still .
We have no facilities like other countries .
It is very important opportunities in our country .
But cricket is very famous and we know many cricketers .
We have a lot of shopping facilities , that is the good thing about living in a big city like Madrid , because we have a lot of different shops including clothes shops , pet shops , food shops , shoe shops , accessory shops , toy shops , present shops and any more types of shops that now I can not remember , but you can find almost all you want or you need . Is n't it incredible ?
But for some of them you have to search very thoroughly because some of the shops are unique and some others are very well hidden , but for that you have specialized transport that will take you to wherever you want or you need to go .
It was such a great experience for me .
I enjoyed working with a soundmaster so far .
It was quite stressful but at the end of the concert the atmosphere was amazing .
It 's the heart of Poland and you will learn everything about work , education and people here .
We appreciate kind and hard - working people .
Last year I celebrated my fifteen party and I loved it very much , ( I want to celebrate it again ) .
I also went to piriapolis with my family and all the days .
I like English because it is very important to know other languages to communicate with other people and if I go to another country it is very important to know English .
I think that it is very interesting and I like it .
I am very well and everything is all right .
I had a really nice experience working in a cinema . I would n't have done it if my friend Lucy had n't encouraged me .
The staff were really interesting and helped me all the time and the customers were kind all the time .
First , as everybody knows , the cost of fuel is increasing more and more . Adding to that the bills that owning a car will bring , it becomes immediately clear that it is cheaper to get around by public transport .
Why then are there still so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of sitting comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ?
Secondly , the environment would improve . As far as I can see , the pollution caused by traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy , the same is true as far as waste of time is concerned . Obviously , the fewer cars there are around , the quicker you can get where you want to go .
In conclusion , I would really like politicians who care about public transport to improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and get around much more easily .
The problem is that if everyone thinks that traveling by car is convenient , absolutely everyone will go everywhere by car , and the roads will become chockablock .
I have been playing basketball on weekends since I was little .
I play basketball and baseball like there is no tomorrow .
I play with them in the playground .
The most people travel by car , because the public transport is not convenient for people to use .
The general transport facilities can be divided into three types .
On the sea , including the and port facilities .
In the sky , including airplane flights and airport facilities .
Transport facilities and economic development have a close relationship , and utilized of land is more important .
The development of the railroad and highway are easy to pulished , but the construction of seaports and airports must with congenital condition .
When integration of the economy and land planning are accomplished , the public transport facilities will be convenient for people to use .
Some years ago , we did n't use technology to get in touch with friends and family , but nowadays it 's the most important thing for
There will be more advantages in general and it will give us a lot of good things , but maybe some bad things too .
I am not saying that we should always play chess , as physical activities are also important .
The reason why I would recommend someone this sport is that children who are not interested in their studies or would not be able to study .
In that case , chess would help him . It would make the child 's mind sharp and he would not get distracted by his surroundings .
Local transportation is one of the most serious problems in our area .
The local transportation has become difficult and expensive ,
so the government must take action to make it easier .
Public media also must educate people in the importance of local transport and how they can preserve it .
The government must save gasoline and jazz to solve the problem .
The government must maintain the public transportation and make it safe .
I thought that writing an article on my favourite sport would be interesting for the readers . Above all , and regardless of the sport you have chosen , it is paramount to do some sport , whatever sport you choose , such as spinning . That is my favourite sport .
My piece of advice for taking up a hobby , in this case a physical hobby , which is good for your health .
If you want to start doing some sport , first of all , think about how much time you are willing to spend on it , then try once and if you have a good time , go ahead and make the most of your time enjoying the sport . Nevertheless , be careful and go slowly because you might be injured .
The advantages they get are the following : they do n't have to look for parking possibilities , they can leave the bus or the train and a few minutes after they can begin to work .
These people also help to protect the environment by saving natural resources like petrol .
To conclude , in bigger cities like Bern or Zurich there is no doubt that the public transport system would be less inconvenient than travelling by car .
The process for making bank notes can be outlined in six consecutive steps .
First , the bank notes are considered how to design , including background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then , they are prepared by skilled machinists .
Subsequently , the sheets of bank notes are printed on the metal plates .
If the sheets are good , those sheets are then cut into separate bank notes and packed into cars in order to be dispatched all over the city .
Public transport offers a possible solution to the problem , because many people can be transported in one vehicle .
The government has a responsibility to encourage the public to use buses and the underground more .
However , there are a number of changes that need to be considered .
The government should raise taxes to pay for the service .
I believe that using your car has a lot of advantages or benefits . It is more comfortable and less expensive .
I do yoga to aid relaxation .
Yoga is a very convenient sport .
After doing it skillfully , you can do it at home or any place .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years . Equipment and tools have evolved since the beginning of human history .
In recent decades , however , developments have been particularly groundbreaking . Man has been able to invent machines which have been put to work . Automation is a great help to mankind , because it significantly increases the standard of living and frees people from hard work .
The disadvantage , however , is that , because of the machines , many people have lost their jobs .
Nowadays , people are constantly on the move .
Well , ecologists say that getting around using public transport is more beneficial for the environment than using a car or motorbike .
In recent years , the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot , in comparison with ten years ago .
It 's more comfortable , faster and preferable to having to run to catch a bus , wait for a train , etc .
Also , it has to be said that maybe in the future , technology will create a car that does n't pollute the air , and then , using public transport wo n't be necessary .
The Indonesian government itself does n't seem to give a damn about their country 's cleanliness , and do neither the citizens .
This has caused our river some big problems , such as disease , unpleasant smells , floods , etc .
I myself , seeing the river filled with garbage , always seem to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant appearance of the garbage .
And also , besides the river , the road in the city is also polluted by garbage .
Garbage everywhere .
And the amount of the city 's parks does n't match the amount of the population and pollution in the city .
I wonder if the citizens in my country and town could make a better environment by throwing garbage away in the correct place and trying using eco - friendly transportation .
And government , please do n't be so flabby with your own citizen .
I think it 's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizens to be more responsible for what they do . And I think that 's enough from me .
I suppose the government have also studied this situation .
I hope the Indonesian government take action regarding this situation because , if it continues , then Indonesia will be the most unclean country over the other countries .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She was very enthusiastic and telling them that Juan , the boy who she had fallen in love with , had written a letter to her .
She read the letter with a lot of passion , because it was obvious that Juan was interested in Alison too .
The boy felt very embarrassed , so he carried on on his way and he did not say anything to her .
I think that there is a future for public transport , because over time the gasoline prices and the cost of the repairs to vehicles increase .
Like with other things , prices increase , from food to clothes and home supplies , gas , water , electricity . Then people choose public transport in the future .
Nowadays , I usually go swimming twice a week and I really enjoy swimming because I can chill out and disconnect my mind .
Moreover , it is said to be healthy and improves problems with the back , so going swimming is really beneficial for me .
Recently , I found a gadget to listen to music while I am swimming and it is marvellous because I also love listening to music .
Furthermore , it is necessary to wear glasses .
There are lots of kinds of transportation like buses , cars , subways , trains or taixs .
May Maybe they are comfortable , terrible , , dangerous or average .
I remember that my childhood was very quiet and happy around dinner at grandmother 's house .
My " private menu " included fresh food like salad , fish , fruit and vegetables - many options and healthy food .
Why does everything look more difficult and harder than it was before ?
Ten years showed me that I can do everything for myself if it is enough for me ....
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She turned her head and saw him . " He was following me " , she thought . " Well , I should ask him what he is doing here " .
From this moment , they will have maturity and responsibility .
So , a lot of parents and students have the opportunity to travel for a year .
When you are travelling around the world by yourself , you gain a lot of knowledge , culture , discoveries and , with all of this , you gain personal experience .
Sometimes , this can change a person , making her or him have a new perception of the world .
However , some students do n't have this opportunity to travel ; they start to work .
The job provides , like the trip , responsibility and experience .
The consequences are n't good as the reasons , for instance , they may have the career prejudicate , or they spend so many years travelling that they are too old to study at a university .
Besides that , they have different points of view on many subjects , that is why they may not like the fun and the conversation in the social life with other students .
Finally , to make a decision to not go to a university when you finish high school is n't the easiest action to take .
It is a big decision , that brings great consequences and great experiences .
If in a city people use public transport more than their own private vehicle , then it will help to protect the environment and ease traffic as well .
But nowadays , automobile companies are more focused on the improvement of cars so that they can be more environmentally friendly and traffic friendly .
The future of public transport will be measured on the basis of the advancement of the private vehicle .
Sometimes people get offended because of the crowd and the inconvenience caused by some people while using public transport .
But the main concern will be technology .
Technology is becoming more advanced .
As an example , if a student needs to recuperate a subject or has to get a good mark , they ca n't go to do a sport because there is no time .
In contrast , doing a sport is very important because we can make new friends or we can start to take responsibility , but the most important thing is that we are always active so our body can get good results .
To sum up , doing sports is very important for teenagers , whose bodies are growing , and doing it regularly is a commitment that we should make . In my opinion , however , doing a mandatory sport is not educational because we must do a sport with enthusiasm , not bothered or out of obligation .
I saw it a couple of days ago and I was going to buy it , but it has disappeared from your

They would consider you as an independent person .
Accordingly , you would take responsibility for what you did .
Next , they do n't believe my skills are good .
I do everything , but nothing .
It is ridiculous that my parents do n't believe in my ability .
I am overwhelmed with grief , living with them .
A good example of this is the large amount of informative news which we are allowed to get .
To sum up , TV viewing is not just entertaining at all ; It is definitely also educating .
Meanwhile , if an individual wants to learn from TV ,
Life is changing very fast as the days on the calendar are going by , the flow of life continuously revolving with the world every person has .
It depends on how you deal with what you have in the present to be prepared for the forthcoming changes in the future .
Everybody has the right one for a change , but it should be for the better and not for the worse .
With the simultaneous growing inventions of technologies , way of living go through with it .
A complicated ways from before , advanced technologies make it easy and simple now , what else more could we expect ?
The digital age has been a big problem for the music industry because the new technologies and the internet have helped music piracy .
" Piracy is destroying the music industry " as it is a violation of copyright .
I think that people should be more responsible and respect the work of others so that society evolves in a healthy way and without conflicts .
This perspective on life is inspired by counter - culture movements and some people call these people " alternative " , but they are more common each day and this creates an inclusive and diverse society .
it 's r is n't clear completely , but I suppose it depends on changing life habits in the development process of our society .
But a good change in our habits is the attention to calories and healthy food , because of getting information on the internet and other media that are easily accessible for all people these days .
I am a programmer who wants to write about programming languages and skills .
The truth of the matter is I think I 'm full of ideas but , unfortunately , I ca n't describe my knowledge and experiences in English .
On Friday , we went on an incredible sightseeing tour , but the guide told me not to take pictures because I had to buy them .
On Saturday night , we went to a formal restaurant to eat pasta .
About one month before departure , they researched on the internet the places that might interest them .
There were Padang Matsirat , Cable Car , Mahsuri Tomb , small islands , Duck tour , beaches , shopping centre and , the most exciting thing was buying chocolates .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately but he had forgotten what he had to do . After thinking , he remembered that he had to visit his grandmother as she was ill and his mother told him that his grandmother wanted to see her doctor and wanted him to take her in his car as the doctor 's clinic was far away from her house . Peter decided to go and he drove his car to his grandmother 's house in the next street . After he arrived , he saw his grandmother was waiting for him on the street . He apologized to her and asked her to get into the car . " Never mind " she said and got in the car beside him .
Peter drove his car to the doctor 's clinic and after half an hour he arrived and he and his grandmother went up the stairs to reach the doctor 's clinic . After they arrived , they found that they had to wait a period of time to take their turn . They waited and then their turn came . They entered the doctor 's surgery and the doctor was very kind . He welcomed them and after checking Peter 's grandmother , said
I am not different in that . There is a backstairs influence in my life . He is none other than my father .
His means of making a livelihood is the simplest .
He always honors the oldest and taught us to avoid telling a lie . As far as I remember , one day he was advising me when suddenly an old man entered the conversation and gave a foolish speech .
Nevertheless , my father did n't tell him arrogantly but he made him know the right thing politely .
Travelling by car plays an important role in our lives .
However , travelling by bus or tram never get away from our daily routine . Travelling by bus is not as convenient as getting in a car , but you can never know what might happen with your car , where it might get stuck in traffic or some other accident might happen .
This fact gives the government the opportunity to manage the traffic on the roads in cities or towns .
Private transport gives us traffic jams , a lot of accidents and stressful situations .
We get nervous because we are responsible not only for our lives but for other people 's , too .
And , also , we have to understand that using public transport is cheaper than using a car .
Why do we think that only convenience can be the main point of using a car ?
What can we say about our ecological awareness ?
Let 's take a bicycle to travel to our school or job instead of using any public or private transport .
Public transport will have no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
It is more fun when we travel by car .
I will get some information for you if you are interested in that .
Let me explain my reasons . When you drive your car , you can take it from your garage or outside the main door of your house and it gets you to wherever you want . But on the other hand , if you take public transport , it will be much more inconvenient because you have to catch the bus at a bus stop ... Where is your nearest bus stop ?
Then you have to take the subway to your destination , so that means a waste of time . On the other hand , it is cheaper , but what happens if you do n't have any coins to pay the bus driver ? Here comes the problem .
Obviously , you are late for work , even if you have an appointment to have an interview for a job .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
I would recommend this film because it is funny , entertaining and you can learn principles .
So I do not have the opportunity to practise English , because most of my colleagues speak French .
It is bewildering !
Yes , we can say that the car is much more convenient . But not every person can afford a car .
after that last point We can not go everywhere we would like using a car .
There are also limitations there .
That fact behind sense because the maintenance of public transport is not the responsibility of the traveler .
You can get there by metro ( Teatralnaya Station ) .
From Red Square , you can easily see the Moscow Kremlin , St. Basil 's Cathedral , the State Historical Museum and Gum Department Store .
If you are dying of hunger , you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at restaurant # 57 , which is on the third floor of Gum .
It 's the capital 's central park where you 'll find lots of interesting things .

So , if you want to have a memorable holiday , the capital of Russia is the most attractive place .

We did n't have a lot of money , but I went to a private elementary school .
I was too fat , too much fat .. I looked at my health booklet one month ago , and I saw that I have been overweight since I was four years old .
People speak differently , but with a basic level , they understand English .
It is difficult to go to an unknown place with different people , but it is a good experience to learn .
Everyone could speak and understand each other .
Because of her suggestions , I learned how to control my temper while I was dealing with failures and kept telling myself that it was n't a big shame because I had tried my best .
Sometimes , I feel tired of walking , especially on sunny days with high temperatures , but that ca n't make me stop doing this sport .
The ordinary result of the big effort I had made at my university to have a good job in my specialization , as a lawyer .

We generally use the word " stress " when we feel that everything seems to have become too much - we are overloaded and wonder whether we really can cope with the pressures placed upon us .
We can change everything that harms us if we need to , if we have the will .
The reasons for stress are more diverse ; perhaps because we have an exam period , family problems or because we think in a negative way , or we have destroyed ourselves through long hours of working and canceld our needs for enough comfort , and lots of reasons to stress ...
In my opinion , the main course needs improvement .
Firstly , I am a vegetarian and I do n't have much choice of vegetables .
Some people in my college are vegetarian , Muslim , vegan etc . and they do not have a lot of varieties of food to choose , from like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals .
It is thought that you should change the type of food regularly .
Yours faithfully
I 'm writing to you regarding an advertisement I saw on my way home calling for candidates to fill a vacancy on your cafe staff .
For that reason , this job is perfectly suitable for me and , besides , it showed up as a good opportunity for me to improve my income , helping me to pay my bills .
I actually liked it quite a lot . I just loved all the suspense and the parts where they leave you hanging . It 's just really interesting . The movie is about the American government , who annually give 12 hours when all crimes , even murder , are legal , and there are no medical services during that long period of what they call " the purge " and anyone can join in . You can kill whoever you want .
The diagrams illustrate the process of producing bank notes .
At the beginning , bank notes should be well - designed , considering the colour matching and artwork , including issues relating to security .
After designing them , metal plates are prepared with the help of experienced machinists .
Most importantly , before distribution , printed sheets with 50 bank notes per sheet have to be checked to see whether they are of perfect quality or not .
They can only be packed and distributed if they are of good quality .
In other words , both bad sheets and the ones which are separated badly need destroying in a safe way which can stop them from getting into the market .
Many people believe that nowadays there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient , but others continue with the thought that they do help , for example , with travelling long distances .
Firstly , there are plenty of people who ca n't buy a car , and so , the only option they have is to travel by these modes of transport .
Secondly , public transport is more efficient for travelling long distance than cars and people would n't have to purchase fuel .
When people need to travel to other continents or far away , they may need a plane , which is a form of public transport , to complete the journey because they have to cross oceans and complicated distances that have different landforms .
In addition , you have to share with people you absolutely do n't know and probably wo n't see again .
Consequently , you can be robbed or get sick .
But , by observing all these people , you can enrich yourself with the different cultures and manners the others have and incorporate new topics .
Public transport is useful but sometimes inconvenient and cheaper . You can get to know new people and different cultures .
After 4 hours sitting on an uncomfortable seat , we arrived at the train station and then my parents and I went to the hotel .
It will be more appropriate for us .
All villages have a bus stop where the bus stops to pick up or drop off passengers .
And some buses drive at night to transport passengers .
However , there are some disadvantages with public transport . They cause many traffic jams . This is because the buses are large and difficult to control .
The bus will not drop off the passengers where they want to go , because they have to drop them off at the bus stop .
We met each other near Oxford Street , when I was going to a supermarket .
She went with me and we talk about everything !
She is a very interesting and wise person , but the best thing is her humor .
Nowadays , using public transport is considered to be the most convenient
It provides citizens with the freedom to relax and disconnect while going home or to work .
You also asked about the leisure activities in Spain .
For me , the most interesting one is sightseeing around the city and discovering its monuments and landmarks .
However , there is also an endless of leisure activities , such as going shopping or going to museums , to cinemas or to beautiful parks .
If that is not enough , you will be able to enjoy the amazing atmosphere of our nightlife , going to restaurants , to clubs or lounge bars .
In my town people are very educated and very aware of the environment , they know very well that if we take care of the environment then it will be useful for us only , so they are always careful about rubbish and try to clean the village .
D. Perhaps bilingual school creation might be a good idea for Colombian education improvement , but it would be appropriate to be aware that Colombia actually has public schools with a basic education where English is considered as another academic subject , in contrast with the private ones .
It depends on five main steps , which include design , preparation of metal plates , printing , inspection , packaging and destruction or disposal depending on whether the fourth step is good or bad .
Above all , the design is the most important step we should know , which involves considering the background color and artwork .
Secondly , we need preparation of metal plates that subsidiarize with skilled machinists .
And then we need printing and inspection .
Eventually , the most essential part comes . We need to inspect the quality of the sheets .
If it 's good , they go to packing and distribution , whereas the others should be destroyed as well .
In conclusion , the whole process is an unreversed schedule .
Nevertheless , in my opinion , the most precious of the revolution is the modern security measure through such a muti - developed society .
To begin with is design , we have to consider background colour , artwork , and security issues , and then we are supposed to prepare metal plates , using skilled machinists .
Secondly , printing -- including sheets of bank notes , are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . There are some requirements -- colour on both sides , special ink , slightly raised images .
The most important step is inspection . The printed sheets should be manually inspected .
Finally , if it is a good sheet , the procedure is packaging and distribution , including cutting into separate bank notes , packing , dispatching .
Back in the 40 's , Cairo was considered as one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly city in the world , Even cleaner than Paris or other cities in Europe .
Nowadays , Cairo can be considered as one of the - if not the most - dirtiest cities in the world .
Rubbish is everywhere , people finish their food and throw empty bags in the streets instead of keeping it until they find a bin .
It is a fact that , on the one hand , you have the opportunity to buy dangerous weapons nowadays , but on the other hand , we are unable to manage this situation correctly .
Max and his family had been on their holidays for two weeks now . This year they had decided to do a safari as a new experience .
Unfortunately , Max was not as excited as his family ; he had never really been into animals .
He only enjoyed staying at the hotel watching television .
Today , for some reason , he had this feeling that something interesting was going to happend .
Max spent the rest of the day thinking about that lion until he went into his room . " What an amazing day ! " ,
Not long ago , I won first prize in math competitions at school .
The presidential election will begin in Taiwan next year .
My goal is admission to National University .
Unfortunately , my previous studies were in Arabic .
As part of my plan to improve my English skills , I decided to search on the internet for any free program which could help me with the plan to improve my English writing .
there are many differences between old computers and the new ones .
For example , new computers are smaller in size than the old computers , they are also faster and more efficient , they have better resolution and a bigger memory to save files and other stuff like apps .
We have diversified harvest like in the rest of the world , not only in the houses but also in every public building .
For example , in our school there is the possibility to collect paper and plastic in different boxes .
So the environmental impact is very attractive .
There are n't boxes for rubbish in every condominium , and we do n't have the harvest of the dampness that is present in many other towns in Italy .
In other countries it would be impossible , because if someone wanted to do this , he 'd have a fine to pay .
I think it is important that , not only in the family , but also in school , we could raise a new generation sensitive to the ecological problems of the earth .
In this way , we would have the possibility to change .
I usually go two days a week but next month I am going to go three or four days a week because I hope to enter a local competition .
Jerry read the email and decided to go to the shopping centre immediately .
The man was professional and gave him useful pieces of advice .
Jerry said that he would be honoured .
I like skiing because it is a sport that I also did when I was small . I like high speeds and lower living at high altitudes and enjoying great landscapes .
I like climbing , but it is a sport that I have just started ... but I want to keep practising it and keep learning new things .
The issue of taking care of the environment is very topical in the modern world .
The amount of garbage is increasing at the same time as the number of humans is increasing .
The growth of consumption in developing countries leads to increasing consumption of energy , water and other resources .
Pollution of the ecosystems is increasing in these countries too , as a result .
It is going to build several modern combustion plants , and some programmes for discrete rubbish collection are being implemented .
There are a lot of citizens movement except official activities .
People organise common action for cleaning areas near houses .
These activities take place especially in spring and in autumn .
I hope that most of the big businesses , plants and stations will be taken outside of the city boundaries .
These days , transportation has become so crowded . We have a lot of cars in the streets .
if everybody knew that there is a punishment for what they do and nobody can escape from what he did , I guess we would have fewer traffic accidents .
The bank notes are designed carefully . Workers need to design their background colour and artwork .
A new pieces of bank notes is printed completely .
The rest of them will be disposed of .
In Cádiz , in summer , there are a lot of opportunities to work .
Since I was seven years old I have been on my city 's basketball team , and I have no doubt that playing basketball is one of the things that I enjoy the most in my life .
I like basketball because , besides the benefit that it brings to your health and physical well - being , it is also a really good hobby .
You also get to meet a lot of people at tournaments or even at normal games .
Nowadays , people are becoming more independent , and more than this problem , society now needs to show others this independence and control of their own lives , which includes cars , houses and materials .
On the one hand , travelling by car can be an excellent way to get to where you want to go , without going on foot to find your bus stop and becomes less important if you live in the centre of your town or in the suburbs .
Another advantage of travelling by car is that you do n't have to spend time waiting for your other transport , and you can avoid the crowds of people that are in the subway stations every morning to get in the line if you want to arrive at work on time .
On the other hand , public transport is the only resource some people have to get around , and more than excellent for the environment , it 's also a good way to avoid traffic and spending money on petrol , since it 's cheaper if you catch a bus .
Another disadvantage is that using the car can be problematic in some situations , like if you go to a football game by car , you probably wo n't have a place to park it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let public transport be forgotten , since as well as providing the only way some people have to travel , cars are n't so convenient for some situations .
I think you should go to a large school in a town because there you can have more friends and you can do a lot of other things that you can not do in the countryside .
I really want to go to a big school in a town , because here in the countryside , I can not go out with my friends or go shopping with them .
In a town you can do everything fun .
You can go to the shopping mall , to the halfpipes , to the skate parks and you can do a lot of other cool things with your friends , but in the countryside you ca n't .
As we know , nowadays , everything is possible .
We have so many advantages that make our lives easier .
In general , people have the possibility to study in libraries or using computers .
Personally , I think studying on a computer is a better choice .
Studying using a computer offers you the possibility to be more relaxed when you do it .
If I were a student that usually studies in a library , I would definitely try studying on a computer .
If somebody says that there is no future for public transport , I mind immediately . Today there are too many vehicles on our streets .
The roads are chock a block . Everybody has a private car .
People are thinking about a comfortable life instead of the environment and saving money .
Mainly , the environment will change .
The members of my family are certainly my real best friends , who I can trust and ask anything without shame or regrets .
I think they are our first friends and our first confidants .
I would like to understand the benefits of an MBA at IMD and how it would help me in my career .
Watching our national team 's games , I came to the conclusion that we have no need to check our heart condition .
The Brazil and Netherlands games were a real test of our health .
I appreciate your support .
According to the reality , a lot of young people are n't very communicated in their life .
Most teenagers ca n't understand that , and they think that the job of their parents is not difficult .
But most young people are not interested in this type of music .
That makes them happy and additionally makes loud .
Usually , they watch crime series because it 's very interesting and really mysterious .
Because it 's very comfortable .
In conclusion , the life of young people is not very easy .
Hi , my name is Adrian . I am 17 years old and I am a footballer . I was born to be a footballer .
I played so well that everyone congratulated me . But that 's not all . One of the best teams in the world wanted to take me on .
I definitely agree with that .
Already , in only 20 years , a lot of things have changed because of the technology .
And I think that it 's not technology that will change , but the people and their characters .
Unfortunately , for this generation , there wo n't be real relationships , all relationships will become virtual relationships .
The good news is the people who can take advantage of technology can save a lot of time because they might have a sophisticated robot that can help at home .
According to my experience , if we do n't exaggerate the way we use technology like the internet , phone , satellite .
In some people 's lives , the most important thing is to wear fashionable clothes .
On the one hand , I think it is important to look good , but sometimes the latest fashion is not the best choice to feel happy and comfortable .
On the other hand , the personality is more important and determinative than an expensive dress . It is a fact .
In conclusion , my opinion is that the personality is more important than the clothes we wear , but everybody has her own life and the choice to decide what she wants .
Transportation is one of the most essential parts of our day to day life ; whether it is public or private , transport takes the same priority in each person 's life from the very early days .
In the age before industrialisation came into existence , people also used various alternatives to travel from one place to another .
Then the technology improved gradually towards mechanical engines to make the transport more convenient .
But in this modern era of globalisation , global warming is one of the prime concerns of the earth .
And when we look at the modern technologies of transportation , it seems there is no future for public transport .
It is inevitably true that excessive use of public transport leads to higher levels of pollution .
So , it would be better to go for any other alternative of green technology for future use to make this world a better place .
Yesterday , I had a wonderful day . In the morning I went to a Galician basketball training session with a Spanish selection coach . When I finished I went with my parents to a hotel to eat and spend time with some friends . After the food . we met up with friends of my parents and went to a theme park and we rode on a roller coaster , it was very exciting , and we ate a chocolate ice cream . It was delicious . In the evening , we went to a Spanish basketball league game , Obradoiro versus Real Madrid , and that match beat the team of Real Madrid and then I went home to sleep .
When I find myself in London , I 'll go to Buckingham Palace , which is located in the City of Westminster and I 'll visit your art gallery and tourist attractions of the British monarchy .
Continuing my visit to London , I will visit the largest park in London , Hyde Park , which has a full day of guided outdoor games and activities for the preservation of the park .
Later , I 'll take the London Underground , which is a public fast transit system . I 'll travel on it .
When I leave the underground at Wembley Park station , I will go to Wembley Stadium , where I will enjoy an evening of football . The match starts at 8:00pm .
My favorite band is " cbjr " ; it 's a Brazilian band . The type of music is rock and rap . Their music is very easy to single .
I really like , in the moments when I am listening , to turn up the radio , but the singles are dead .
However , I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in classes , but it is also related to the quality of education in schools .
Education plays a crucial role in society and its future and by improving the standard of the education system , students can learn more effectively throughout their entire educational life and their career , but also their skills will be improved by this process .
Nowadays , unfortunately , students can not get enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries .
On the other hand , by building a more effective learning system which will be provided by local authorities , students will be encouraged to learn more efficiently .
Besides , by employing these kinds of procedures , students will also gain more respect towards their studies and their jobs .
Hopefully , they will not only earn more money in their entire life , but also , society will have a more developed shape in any other developed countries .
It is true that coeducation can motivate students while they work with other sex students , we ought to also bear in mind , this is not the only solution to get the best result .
In a nutshell , based on the above - mentioned points , such as the quality of the education system not only interests with mixed education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that were mentioned .
It is concluded that these kinds of developments will be put into action for all schools shortly .
I appreciate him a lot , because he stayed with me and my sister and his life changed completely .
He invested in our education and today he has a lot of admiration for our lives and our decisions .
How are you ? Hope everything 's fine .
It 'll be the second time I 've visited the UK , and I do n't want to do the same excursions , so would you mind telling me some good activities to do or some places to visit there ?
Our world is very polluted by public transport so we think about what will happen in the future . Public transport causes many problems in our environment , such as difficulty getting to the nearest destination , pollution , and disease .
We must think of alternative solutions to this problem .
We face difficulty reaching our own destination .
Nowadays , there are some vehicles that run on electricity . We can decrease pollution by using electricity .
Finally , we hope for a healthy future for our future generations . We want to reach our destination on time and live a safe life without diseases and pollution .
My favourite sport is volleyball . I have been playing it since 2006 . My favourite position is number 2 . I usually play it in the faculty of engineering ? . It makes me fit and tall .
We won 1st place and got the cup . If anyone intends to play this game , he should practise hard to be able to play it professionally .
I am looking for an organizational development course .
Could you put in me contact with any of your customers for more information ?
I am looking forward your to reply .
When I was a child , about four or five years old , my father taught me what football was , and I loved it , but , I really liked the goalkeepers . Why have I liked football since my childhood ?
I think football gives you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy football because it is a way to forget problems and enjoy yourself a bit , because when you are playing football , you are n't thinking about other stuff , you only concentrate on the game .
Football is a sport where anything can happen . the best teams do n't always win and it is unpredictable . There is n't a dream team .
Football is a good way to do exercise because it is interesting and fun .
The most important invention is the mobile , because you can do whatever you want with only one communication device .
Not only do children have one , grandparents have one too .
You can do a lot of things using your mobile , like call someone , text , take photos , listen to music , watch movies , play games , be woken up ( alarm clock ) , access the internet , check your e - mails , pay your bills , access social media , learn how to cook ... there are many more unimaginable things we can do .
And one consequence of this is that they have health problems .
In the future , we will probably be able to do almost everything using a mobile , but we must pay attention to how this affects our lives .
The pie charts illustrate the amount of household earnings allocation within regular families in two different years ( 2000 and 2010 ) .
Overall , in both years , the amount of earnings allocation was predominantly for housing , then followed by food / clothes .
There was a significant rise in the amount of budget allocated to both categories ( housing and food / clothes ) in 2000 and 2010 .
Regarding the pie charts , there was a significant increase in the amount of earnings allocated to housing and food / clothes , from about 35% and 25% in 2000 to about 50% and 35% in 2010 , respectively .
However , the allocation of household budget for misc , which was the lowest compared with other categories in 2010 ( around 15% ) , fell by 10% in 2010 from around 15% to approximately 5% .
Furthermore , there was a slight decrease in vacations / leisure allocation from 25% in 2000 to around 10% in 2010 .
Governments haven't been giving good ideas to improve public transport .
Firstly , the failure to construct more railway lines is one reason .
Consequently , people prefer to travel in their own car .
The first is , the government could create a new plan of construction for trains .
As a result , we could have more comfortable public transport .
In my opinion , public transport could have a future if we all collaborate to improve it .
Some people would suggest that learning new languages before secondary school discourages students ' usual learning and that their understanding of other subjects would suffer .
However , I personally believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages .
Confronting challenges . Primary students struggle with the difference between first language and the one they are learning .
Nonetheless , I would contend that learning foreign languages at primary school brings countless benefits for children .
Not only is there less study burden when compared with secondary school , but they are able to communicate with foreigners as well as extend their social network during this period and in later life .
Rather than being concerned about the challenges , children would deal with them . It is particularly advantageous for them to grasp foreign languages during elementary school .
By way of conclusion , I once again reaffirm my position that the advantages of learning foreign languages at primary school far outweigh the drawbacks .
Given that those children would have better development in the future , as well as more free time .
In my opinion , people 's lives will change dramatically in 50 years or so , because the world is changing all the time , and we have a lot of technology and things to do .
To sum up , I think it is inevitable .
He knew that she was inside , waiting for the last conversation about the life of Rose .
As you well know , Rose 's life is in your hands " she said , and kept talking : " ... You are the only one that can save her life , but before , that you must keep your promise " . " I know " , he replied with a sad tone .
For this reason , we left with our new friend for Marseilles , where there was less traffic .
My mum says that I do n't eat fruits and vegetables , so I will eat more fruits and vegetables .
One of my favorite books is The Power of Your Subconscious mind .
Letter written to report on the awful environmental situation in my city !
So my proposition is to post some informative letters and posters around the city , and give bigger punishments for littering ! Also , the government should increase the number of rubbish bins and facility staff members .

Public transport is very inconvenient .
It takes you a very long time to get to your destination .
If you have a car you can get to your destination in a short time .
Our town takes care of the environment of our neighbourhood very seriously .
At these sites there are different kinds of containers for all sorts of rubbish which you can collect at home .
Like glass , plastic or paper containers .
The centre of our town , where the supermarket is , does also have a site for dumping your rubbish .
In the supermarket , you can find a container for batteries .
Not only the supermarket has these containers . They are also in the schools of the neighbourhood .
In my opinion , this gives a good example of the involvement of the local government .
This makes our neighbourhood a pleasant place to be .
Finally , I can say that they not only put containers for all your rubbish , but even special containers in the parks for the dogs ' ' pooh ' .
It is not easy to adapt to a new learning environment ; the language is the biggest difficulty .
Students have to do assignments in another language and use a different way of thinking .
The culture shock is what international students need to overcome .
Lastly , the problem is from students themselves .
They have left their comfort zone , and everything is fresh .
Besides , attempting open mind .
Getting along with international friends is a great way to expand your horizons .
We always go to the beach , which is very nice , and when it 's sunny and warm it is better than the Mediterranean .
I do n't know what I 'm proud of , but when I score a nice goal , I am proud because it feels good , especially when it 's an important goal that maybe will change the game .
I asked my parents and they said ambitious , curious and considerate .
My favourite restaurant must have good meat and be really nice .
Subject : Shopping facilities
Report on the shopping facilities in Katowice
Introduction
The aim of this report is to describe and assess shops which could be interesting for tourists .
Fortunately , visitors will find all of that in the Tourist Information Office and in shops on the outskirts .
Watching football is also a wonderful experience .
My favorite international league is the English premier league .
The environment is an important part of our life , contributing in a positive way to our part of life without even concern about important parts for us to survive .
Humans can easily damage the environment just by throwing their waste away without recycling or ruining the places where animals live .
I notice that , in supermarkets , they use so much plastic just to cover a small thing or use a lot of plastic bags without even thinking about how harmful this is to the environment .
I lived for a short time in a place where the word " recycle " was completely unknown , but they used to do it because they were n't so rich .
Where I live now , I have noticed that we have the opportunity to recycle waste because it is a posh area .
In my opinion , the government should take care of all areas , whether an area is rich or poor .
Pollution has a negative effect on the environment . I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban areas .
To keep all of nature alive , we must contribute everyone of us for future generations .
Travelling by car is more comfortable than public transport , easier and faster .
The aim today is to provide you with a description of my best friend .
Moving on to the physical description , I want to say that Kike is a really tall man ; his height is 1.95 meters .
He has a strong voice that , with his appearance , makes him look impressive .
Concerning his personality , he is very friendly , generous , optimistic , playful and sensitive .
So , he is hard - working . He is a lawyer and always helps me with all my professional problems .
every evening , he takes the bike and rides along some paths for more than forty kilometers per day , so he is a very good cyclist and it 's quite hard to cycle with him .
I met her at university 20 years ago . She is 4 years younger than me .
She is very kind , sensitive and quiet . She also has an attractive personality and a big heart , but she is very nervous .
Young people are most interested in fashion and computer games .
Teenagers are interested in music too .
People who are in fan clubs are interested in touring with their idols .
At this age , people like being better than their friends and they like to distinguish themselves .
I have already worked in summer camps in France and in Italy with children aged 7 - 13 . I am cheerful , energetic and hardworking .
Moreover , I am willing to help organize sports or evening activities .
Last night , I went to a restaurant with my family .
l love the place , and the nice decoration of the restaurant .
This report is about how my city takes care of the environment .
However , a few years ago , the government has paid more attention to the environment of our country . For example , they did a lot of advertising on television , in newspapers and on the internet to explain that rubbish is not good for our world .
In the future , we must make an effort to improve our environment because we will want to give the same world or , if it is possible , a better world than before to our children .
Nobody can deny that transportation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can live without transportation as it 's the real means of connection with each other .
Cars are much more convenient , but this does not mean that all other means of transportation are not important .
Other people prefer to travel by train as it 's faster and more comfortable than cars .
Many people like to travel by bike in order to decrease the pollution which is caused by car exhaust . From my point of view , I prefer travelling by car , which is more comfortable .
Now in every country we have a lot of means of transport , such as planes , trains , undergrounds , cars , ships , and rockets .
Public transportation is the main way to deliver people everywhere in a short time . In the past , they had to use camels to travel , which wasted a lot of time and caused tiredness .
Everybody thinks public transport is not comfortable for us , but environmentally , public transport is good for decreasing pollution and our energy sources are also decreasing .
It was built as a foundation of King Casimir the Great .
This museum has monuments of the superiority .
In my opinion , it 's one of the most fascinating places in Poland and the most wonderful site in Lublin . I think that everyone should visit this castle .
The restaurant that I will talk is Woody Pool .
This restaurant has a good atmosphere because there are always people laughing and talking about funny things .
The food in this restaurant is very good and has a larger than normal size because it is much bigger than the usual food .
The famous dish of this restaurant is a huge hamburger .
This restaurant will be an amazing place to the call meet there because , like I said before , the atmosphere and food are amazing .
In my opinion , public transport will become more and more important in the future . Travelling by car may be convenient , but it also brings air pollution and traffic jams .
If there were only cars in a city , the city would n't have enough parking spaces and roads , all the cars would jam the city , and people would n't get to their destinations .
Public transport will have a bright future ; in contrast , travelling by car will vanish from our lives .
So , train is an intermidiate way to travel .
I started leading trener in the competition and I love this sport .
My favourite boxer is Floyd Mayweather .
I think is a better idea that people use public transportation instead of using private cars or motorcycles .
Accordingly , people do not have to spend lots of money on the gas that they have to fill the tank with .
Therefore , these are the reasons why I agree with the form to reduce congestion and air pollution by encouraging people to use private cars less and turn to using more public transportation and other forms for transportation .
It was a cold night when I was at home watching my favourite programme on telly , called " Dare to Win " . I was with my brother when we decided to call . The programme is about questions for the contestants that must be answered in time , and there are different things for the winner .
A few minutes later , we were listening to ourselves on the programme . We were so nervous , but it was exciting for us . Our goal on the programme was to get a free ticket to the most popular electronic party in the world .
I am writing to apply for the job in the USA published in an advertisement last Monday .
In order to help organise sports and evening activities , I am a young person of 12 years old .
Additionally , because public transport is expensive and does not have a comprehensive coverage of most cities , private cars are more attractive for most people .
Some people say that a trip by car is more convenient than by public transport , but that statement has a lot of issues if we think about the limitations .
It is true that when travelling to a nearby place from your city , it is more comfortable getting there by car , because of the ease of having your car to get wherever you want without spending money and time taking cabs .
But public transport has a future for a lot of reasons . First , time . If the place you want to reach is really far , the different types of vehicles of public transport will get you there faster than your car . Also , the complications about the field , like if you want to go from America to Europe , there is no highway that crosses the ocean . You need an airplane and , unless you have one , you will not be able to achieve travel between continents with your car . A different reason is politics , because if you want to go from anywhere in the USA to Alaska , you will not need to pass through Canada . Comfort is a really important reason , because driving for 8 hours is exhausting and it will also be unsafe . Economics is a factor too , because the wear and tear on your car will be more than in normal use and the price of food and extra stops that you will need to do . It will be more expensive than on public transport .
In conclusion , for me , it is a lie that public transport has no future . However , they have to make improvements to this , like the use of better types of fuel or energy . One way is using renewable sources of energy , such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hydraulic(water),Also , there are biodiesel and gasoline extracted from seaweed .
And public transport will be more important in a few years from now .
My brother lives in Barcelona with his girlfriend and he is very happy with her .
Nowadays , it is possible to find any kind of TV programme you want and , yes , I consider that there is a lot of sport on television , but not too much .
When somebody gets home , he wants only to relax in front of the television .
Besides this , TV companies have understood sports provide this relaxing moment , mainly for men .
So they put on more and more sports programmes on television .
In conclusion , I think that TV companies only want to sell their product and the people want to have their relaxing moment with the sports programmes .
Last summer , we went to Córdoba to attend a very important dance competition ...
When the day came , we performed an amazing choreography and we went back home with 3 gold medals .
We really enjoyed this experience , just because we shared it as friends and we took dance lessons with the most professional and prestigious dance teachers in the world .
The album , with eleven tracks that reached number one , won gold and silver awards for the best - selling in various countries , such as the USA , Canada and the UK .
I agree with the statement that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next years , for previsible reasons that I will explain in the following text .
Firstly , the biggest reason that people 's lives will dramatically change in the future is because of technology .
Technology is increasing throughout the world .
New technology has improve systems in many areas of society , mainly in information systems .
Information via the Internet had beem more quickly each day and it is reaching all parts of the world .
Furthermore , things and processes are evolving .
People 's lives are getting easier and more comfortable .
In industry , big machines are making new products for our benefit .
However , the advancement of technology , besides bringing advantages for everyone , will also cause disadvantages , such as unemployment , because machines will do the same work or work better than humans .
That 's why I agree that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
USA Summer Camp , I am interested in he vacancy at the summer camp .
I 'm a cheerful , diligent and organized person .
I am accustomed to working with children because the last two summers I worked in summer camps and I have two little sisters that I love and who I spend a lot of time taking care of .
I am a hardworking and committed person in all respects .
For example , I learned about organization , how to control big groups of children , and entertaining activities for children .
I hope you are interested in my application .
As we know , the privilege of having a journey by car is more convenient than by public transport .
We can stop anywhere we want to stop .
We can visit every place with no time limitations .
My teacher said that public transport has no future in our society , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . Nevertheless , I disagree with her opinion because if we use public transport we will pollute less .
No one can deny the importance of travelling .
Without travelling , people would be very bored , life would be very monotonous .
So , in the future we will dispense with types of transportation .
There are a few people who use public transport , like students and people who have a low income . In my view , I can say the public transport might be going to e close because nobody is going to beclose
The best thing I saw was the Valley of the Temples , because there were a lot of ancient temples and monuments and ruins and they were really beautiful and , also , the view was amazing !
That day , we had a great time and it was sunny and hot . I took a lot of photos and I learned new information about those important buildings .
People are interested in everything unknown , mysterious and incredible .
They look for new experiences .
universe is expanding and we still know little about it .
In addition , more and more scientists agree that aliens really exist .
He is an important person because he is the president of the government in Spain .
He studied a degree in law at university .
When Aznar was president of the government before him , he was like a minister .
I have been playing this sport since twelve years ago . This sport has taught me to respect others and not to assault them.there is the only reason that makes me choose this sport is that I do n't want to be weak . I would n't like to be nothing in this country that has a rule : the strong dominate the weak . When I step foot in the gym , I forget everything : school , home ... . Therefore , I enjoy it .
I ca n't imagine my life without taekwondo . It is in my blood , my soul . Taekwondo is not a violent sport as many people say , but what you have to know is what is in the brain and the heart of players .
I just got the 1st degree international black belt and I would like to tell anyone just starting this sport to use their abilities and skills for the right things .
The little boy more and more sadly , tears rolled down from his eyes . My brother felt sorry for him . He gave the little boy his smartphone and put on some good music . The little boy stopped crying and started to smiled .
The surgery was successful .
It is very important because this was a city and a very important ceremonial center .
There are other areas like " El juego de pelota " , which means the Ball Game . There is also a very important " Cenote " where they used to sacrifice pretty young girls to their gods .
It is true that every day we have new innovations which help people and make their lives easier .
But from life 's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human beings is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life .
To illustrate .
There is a categorisation of countries ; there are developed countries , emerging ones and countries on the way to development .
Who classified those countries like this ?
These questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for a convenient answer .
In addition , a general view of human innovation shows that the majority of people 's creations have a bad effect . This effect exists even in people 's lives or in themselves .
And unfortunately , this bad impact exists in almost all areas of life .
Therefore , The aforementioned information above shows that our future could be worse than our present .
To summarize , people 's lives see fast change and development , but generally , this evolution affects people .
The restaurant I 'm going to review is called Tintos y Rubias and is located in downtown Montevideo .
It specializes in barbecue , beers and wines .
The building is quite wide and at the front you can see a huge welcome sign .
The restaurant has a rustic design and it has outdoor tables .
The service provided by the restaurant is exceptional . For example , the waiting time is very short .
In terms of food quality , the standard is extraordinary . They are well known for their roast meat .
We can produce electricity by creating wind wheels and water wheels .
There is a hotly debated issue relating to whether students should take at least one year to work or travel before they go to university .
And the topic of people 's views can be approached from different angles due to its complexity .
After carefully considering this issue , I also develop my own points of view .
I favor the former statement . That is , I think students should have a gap year before they go to university , based on n1 , n2 .
Every day , the fuel that we use in our cars is more expensive than using public transport .
Thus , people could spend their free time travelling and having a good time .
Although traveling by car is really interesting , using public transport still has its advantages . By using public transport you 're saving effort . When driving a car for a long distance , you will get tired . Some people do n't have enough money to buy their own car .
Furthermore , your abuse of the cat has violated not only ethics but also the law .
As long as you are determined , you will be able to become a good master .
Design is the first stage , which includes three parts : background , artwork and security issues .
After the preparing of metal plates by skilled machinists , they take sheets of bank notes . There are three requirements for this : colour on both sides , special ink and images that are slightly raised .
The most important step is inspection : printed sheets are manually inspected .
Because I really love to work with people of all ages , and I would like to have this post and I 'm an energetic and hardworking person .
Therefore , looking after children aged 8 - 12 years is n't an easy task , but as a father or parent you must always give them good care in terms of your responsibilities .
There is no future for public transport . That is true , but I think that people are very comfortable and do n't think about the environment .
Secondly , you can drive your car everywhere . It does n't matter what time it is or where you would like to go . Travelling by car is much more convenient and comfortable than travelling by bus , by subway or by train .
These aspects or advantages are all that I can say about this topic .
My name is Anna . I am a very cheerful person and I have a creative personality , so I enjoy planning activities or organising sport events in a special and colorful way .
I really love children and taking care of them . I also have experience of working in summer camps and had a good experience making delicious food because I already did these things in other camps .
I chose this invention that I think helped humanity to communicate more easily .
After that , with the new technology they could invent new and better dispositives for the needs of users

When we arrived , there were a lot of Matias ' friends in our house listening to loud music , playing games and drinking .
We told them that they had to leave our house immediately .
When everyone was out , we told Matias off because he organised a party without our permission .
He told us that he was really embarrassed about what had happened and he apologised for his attitude .
These cars will use alternative energy , for example energy from the Sun .
According , for a boy or girl , having strong muscles can make them look more attractive .
Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
He had been taking care of her , so he was prevented from going to university .
The environment is a combination of the air , earth , water and forest and all these things are interlinked with each other .
Most importantly , all species of animals and human beings are a part of this ecosystem .
The human being is the most wise and intelligent of all of these .
However , he is mainly responsible for disturbing this ecosystem through various activities .
Let 's talk about one of them , which is ' cleanliness ' . Nowadays , we all know that we are spreading garbage near our houses and offices .
This may be due to people not being aware of the consequences of this bad habit - spreading the rubbish .
But , these days , with education , people are becoming more sensitive and responsible towards the environment .
They collect and segregate the rubbish into separate containers .
For example , they collect plastic waste in a yellow dustbin , while liquid and solid , degradable waste goes in a red container .
This makes it easy and convenient to identify the waste types .
To conclude , I would like to say that , nowadays , people are becoming more aware and environment - conscious through education .
Today in my class there was a discussion on television and education .
Television is an object that helps people to know the news in real time .
There are advantages and disadvantages ; television can also cause a dependence , cartoons and " stupid " programs can harm young people most .
Today , there are many children that have a dependence on television , they prefer to stay at home to watch the various children 's TV programs , while once our parents preferred hanging out with their friends .
Television can be a useful instrument if it is used with caution . Therefore , I recommend using it less to prevent damage to the mind .
In order to help reduce pollution , I take action using the three " Rs " : reduce , reuse and recycle , so I am more and more eco - friendly .
I reduce the use of unnecesary power at home . In other words , I turn on a light that I need while I use it ; I take cooler showers ; I heat only the necessary rooms .
In order to reuse , I convert all things reusable , for example , a plastic bottle as a plant pot ; a glass bottle as a food container . I take my reusable shopping bag and refuse to use a plastic shopping bag if a salesman offers me one .
Today , we have more items to recycle as long as we clean them properly and put them in the proper bin , which will be used by specialized factories to make them into other items .
As long as I try to keep doing things in an eco - friendly way , I realize that I am giving a little from my side and I feel I am caring for my environment .
Hello ! ! How are you ! ?
I am going to Spain to visit my grandparents .Then I am going to Paris to look forward my aunt .
In my opinion , it is a good idea to spend some time travelling , because you will have an opportunity to think about your future , but in my city , because of the crisis , there is very little work for anyone .
You have to come here because Holy Week in Linares is nice and the show is spectacular and if you want to have fun , I like the bulls .
I agree with this affirmation because public transport is more expensive than a car , is slow and is less economical .
A car is less expensive , more comfortable , faster and safer .
In my opinion , the car is more advantageous than the car and the car is more useful .
First of all , travelling by car is very expensive .
For example , travelling by train is cheaper and travelling by plane is faster .
Secondly , it 's not comfortable , because you drive every day instead of relaxing and enjoying the environment .
Using public transport has certain advantages and also , disadvantages .
Public transport has plenty of advantages .
Some people ca n't afford to buy a car or to pay for petrol , as the price is constantly rising , so using public transport is an economical way to travel .
The reason is they are tired of using public transport and they would get everywhere faster .
The picture illustrate the process of making notes .
It is the first step that costs troublesome , some . Some things must be included in the considerations , such as background colour , artwork , security issues .
Then , preparation of the metal plates and skilled machinists are needed .
The last step is the inspection . Sheets are manually inspected .
The inspection always has three results : the good quality sheets , the bad sheets and the partially damaged sheets .
If the printed sheets are good quality , they will be packed and distributed . Some partially damaged sheets will be cut into separate or packed or dispatched . The bad sheets will be disposed on . The destruction will be secure .
Television is one of the most important AV media in the world .
You can use it for many purposes , according to your needs . There are a lot of channels playing many roles . For instance , education , movies , songs , sports , news and so on . Television is not only for entertainment , but also for education . Television can entertain you through it s entertainment channels , and television can educate you through it s educational channels .
In this day and age , most people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation .
It is also convenient for people who are rushing to work , meetings and so on .
Public transport is cheap and friendly to the environment .
They can use the money in a more useful or meaningful way , such as for investment in property .
Although public transport is slow , it also does not take a long time for people to reach their destination , because public transport nowadays is faster and enough .
In conclusion , public transport is needed by everybody in a necessary time .
It can always make us save money and make the environment more natural and fresh .
Some kinds of animals will move to the urban areas , steal food from us and sleep on the streets or in the underground .
On the other hand , the expansion of a city increases pollution and all kinds of garbage . The air pollution is much more serious now , and seeing blue sky is almost impossible in some big cities .
Although the medical skills are getting better , the percentage of people who get cancer is still increasing .
In conclusion , large - scale building projects take the living resources from animals , increase the possibility of getting cancer , and so on .
Only if the government develop more technical property , pay , pay more attention to environmental protection , such as planting more trees and grass in the cities , and bringing in a special law for those missed animals will we help decrease the harm that building projects do to us .
I also have experience with teenagers through my sisters and I will look after them as I take care of my sisters .
Additionally , I am a hard worker and an active person .

But if you land early in the morning , the most convenient and fast transport is taxi , which does n't cost much to my house .
In the spring there is mild weather , approximately 20 - 25 degrees .
There is the possibility of rain .
So you can bring light and waterproof clothes .
You can only get to ' A Fervenza ' by walking or riding a bike , but it is impossible to get there by any other ways .

My favourite sport is volleyball .
This sport can help your health and anyone can learn to play volleyball .
In Italy , volleyball is very common , especially in my region .

My favorite movie is " The fault in our Stars " , because it 's very good and I really like the characters and the story .

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this report is to make people more aware of the importance of taking care of the environment in order to eradicate this problem which has serious consequences nowadays .
ADVANTAGES
On the other hand , we help to improve and clear up the environment if we throw away the rubbish in the green points of the town .
MEASURES IN FAVOUR OF TAKING CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
The council is carrying out a project in order to eradicate rubbish from my town .
This project is focused on separating the rubbish at green points of the city and they also have to keep the neighbourhood as as as is possible .
CONCLUSION
To sum up , taking care of the environment should be an obligatory task for us .
The main reason for this is , provided that we bear in mind that we must collaborate with all arounds , we will keep the world on our hands .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for work with children this summer in summer camps . I have looked after children aged 5 - 10 and it was a fantastic experience . I have worked at a school in North Africa as a volunteer and learnt a lot about children . I think that I 'm a suitable person for the job because I am an energetic and cheerful person and very hardworking , I love working with children and I like organising different types of activities . I 'm not very good at cooking , but I can learn very fast .
Combating the destruction of the environment , this is a serious problem throughout the world .
Nowadays , many trees and grassland areas are damaged in many countries , lots of building are constructed .
There is no denying that the environment is changed by the behavior of people and animals .
Another factor is that the animals do not control themselves and eat the plants leading to the destruction of the ecosystem .
Nowadays , the transportation has become more perfect , and the people 's lives have become more convenient .
It would really be helpful if the government made tighter restrictions . In today 's world , there are lots of construction companies and factories are not admission , they are destroying the forest , farmland and wetland , discharging waste water and emitting greenhouse gas . It leads to a serious environmental problem .
So the government should oversee these companies , and if companies do not obey the rules or laws , they should be fined and closed down .
Second , the government should publicize the awareness of protection
Taking the train is more cost effective than taking a car to work , as petrol is costly and the new transportation office has reduced the cost of tickets to assist with the daily living expenses we encounter .
The other benefit of taking public transport is fewer people are taking cars , reducing the amount of toxic gases released into the environment .
Furthermore , abortion is very dangerous and a great number of women have died because of this .
1- Inflation in the population ; the roads will not be able to bear or endure huge numbers of cars .
2- I think in the future transport and roads will be more organized , more than these days .
4- Transport will be more economical than private cars .
They should immerse themselves in daily exercise as well as eat healthy meals to keep them active . for instance , it 's advised to eat large amounts of fruits and fresh vegetables because they contain a lot of vitamins that the body needs to work properly .
Basketball is my second favourite sport .
My congratulations .
Sports are very beneficial for our health .
I like to play football because it 's a very exciting game . It takes only 90 minutes . Whenever I get the opportunity , I play football .
In contrast , some people hate getting caught in a traffic jam , so they prefer public transport . Some other reasons might be rising gas prices , car crashes or hating driving !
For example , in our country , " Shinkansen " which means bullet train , is famous and very fast .
" Blue train " , which has many beds on the train and we can sleep comfortably on the train .
Thus , not only to ride but also to watch trains is very interesting for me .
Second , travelling by train is safe and reasonable compared to planes .
Travelling by train is cheep and getting a ticket is easy for us in our country .
Compared to the plane , the train is relatively safe because it can only move on the land .
These reasons are why I think traveling by train is best .
I prefer to watch films at the cinema because there are n't any distractions or noises and the quality of films is better .
There are several efforts that we can make in order to save the environment .
Plastics are non - biodegradable materials which decompose after 1000 years .
Non - biodegradable plastics could actually pile up in the landfill and cause the land on our earth to be occupied .
This causes their reproductive systems to be destroyed .
Hence , we should bring our own recycling bag or basket every time we go shopping and resist the temptation to get plastic from the shops .
In addition , we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emissions into the environment .
If the distance to the destination is short , we could replace driving with walking or cycling .
That 's the decent way to reduce the adverse environmental impact and we will be able to protect our Earth .
Since GM crop technology started to be implemented it has implied in favourable socioeconomic changes .
This technique makes weed control easier , resulting in cost savings and yield gains , leading to increased global production of crops such as corn , cotton , canola and soybeans .

There was also a cup in it . It said " do n't give up on your dream , keep going!go!we stand by you ! come on "
Tom loved it . " Thanks mom , thanks dad ! " Today is the best day of my life . Thank you ! "
My name is Anna . I am one of many new students at Ton Duv Thang university .
I 'm nineteen years old and from this city but living in a dormitory at Ton Duc Thang university .
I love Ton Duc Thang university so much .
These days people care about privacy and hence a personal car not only provides privacy but also convenience .
So the need for buses has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time - consuming .
We can see the future of transportation by comparing the numbers of cars and buses .
So I think the future of public transportation is gloomy .
Its very interesting sport .
In India , cricket is worshipped and players are lord .
I was very interested in making my career through this , but due to my studies , I ca n't make an effort toward this goal .
My friend went there . She talked to me about it so much .
When I stay with you I would like to go to a Spanish restaurant .
Now I have lived in Badajoz for ten years . We moved here to go to the beach every day . I like the beach and the sun , especially in summer when the sun is in the sky .
I like dancing and singing too . I 'm very happy singing on the beach , especially if you are with me .
As time goes by , technology is rapidly improving .
More and more gadgets are invented , such as televisions , smartphones and so on .
There are lots of pros if we watch the television properly .
Using will not only get entertainment but also acquire knowledge .
It is a good time to turn to the entertaining programs , when we feel bored and gaze at the wall all day .
Television provides a variety of educational channels as well .
We . We can learn how the different animals feed themselves .
Above The above statements can ensure a rich and abundant life .
I hope that in the future we will live peacefully and happily .
Hi , I am Amy . I would like to spend two months studying in England , two months doing volunteering in a children 's charity and the last two months travelling in the UK . What do you think of my plan ? I will not only improve my English skills but also devote myself to getting along with children .
I would like to invite you to join the road trip with me . it will be an amazing experience if we are together for this trip .
I usually run in the morning , when my roommates are still sleeping . I get up and run in the playground .
I started running because I suffered from neck pain and my left leg was not comfortable when I sat all day .
Furthermore , I wanted to reduce my weight as well .
If you want to start running , first , you need comfortable shoes and clothes , and secondly , to make a plan , like how long should I run today . Remember , appropriate rest is necessary .
Do n't set a goal that you ca n't achieve , or you will lose your confidence soon .
Of course the answer is no ! Everyone knows that " Earth is our home . " It is bigger than a house .
Besides , some people destroy farmland to build houses , but if one day there is no farmland , then what should we eat ? Nothing at that time . We could n't eat anything!So what should we do ?
So my idea is that all the countries and all the people stop using farmland , forests and wetland to build houses , grow more trees , protect our world , our home star !
The lecturer disagrees with the paragraph suggesting that the mentioned test developed by Alan Turing does not answer the main question : Can a computer think ?
First , the lecturer talks about " Saran " , who proposed a challenge to prove that Turing 's test was not conclusive , and that he created a paradox .
He selected people to go into a Chinese room . There was a computer in the Chinese language with different symbols . The Americans showed different behavior . They did not understand what was on the computer screen .
This was different to the original test mentioned in the text , where all the participants were American and native speakers of that language . It was really easy to understand what was on the computer screen .
For example , for young people in college , their studies are more important , as well as books , seminars , travelling , etc .
I agree , for many people , travelling by car is much more convenient . However , in my opinion , there is still a long future for public transport .
My grandmother is going to visit me in July , so I would prefer to see you in August .
Science , I just remember I have always liked motor racing , but one of my favourites is Formula 1 .
He decided to write a short essay about capital market abuse , so he considered travelling to Italy and picking up some financial data from the Italian central bank .
The key idea of this essay was the following : Italy in the time of Berlusconi almost went bankrupt , but Michael is trying to prevent the Italian economy condition simply because he likes Berlusconi too much .
He received a lot of criticism simply because many economists and econometricians in the world do not trust the source that he used in his essay . Moreover , they thought that he received money from the Italian government .
Two years after his essay was released , he would understand that his essay was wrong . Moreover , Michael would want to apologise to many people who read his essay , so , Michael now goes home , takes a cup of tea , and goes to bed . Thus , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
One day , a man and his wife were trying to find a place that was shallow and without pollution to cultivate . They were poor ; they did n't have the necessary resources , but the husband worked so hard because his wife had had an accident . It happened one day that his wife was working on a campaign for the conservation of endangered animals . She went to a place in search of animals . She heard a sound in a dark place in the jungle , so she went to investigate what that was . A creature that had never been seen attacked her . Her partner only heard a shout and they found Lucy , the wife of the man , on the floor . They asked her if she was OK , but she did n't answer , so her partner took her to the doctor . There , the doctor said that she was OK but she would never hear again unless she paid 1 , 000 dollars for an operation .
One day , the son of Lucy and her husband went to carve holes in the dirt to make a game , he made five holes and in the last one he found a brilliant jewel that had belonged to generations of gods . So he started throwing that for fun . One time that he took the jewel , it consumed the mind of the little guy and that made the jewel emit some sounds that only giants could hear , so a mountain stood up that was the face of a giant and he perceived negative vibes , so he killed the guy because he had the most important relic of the gods .
It is very easy to spend hours being entertained by television .
I have learned a lot from television .
There are excellent examples of good quality television on the BBC .
What 's more , there are countries around the world that lack teachers to go to remote areas to teach that rely on television to teach .
I am writing to suggest a few things that our college can do for the environment .
In order to reduce energy consumption , we should arrange things so that , as much as possible , lectures take place in the daytime .
In order to improve the sorting , there should be litter bins for each of the mentioned materials in classrooms , corridors and outside .
Furthermore , the students and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport , cycling or walking .
Finally , all the students should be taught about the environment .

Hongdae is most appropriate to feel a free and vibrant local area in Seoul .
There are a lot of clubs , pubs and bars , cafes , and karaoke , bars and it has more facilities which you will be able to enjoy .
Late at night in Hongdae , lots of people drink with their friends and walk around the streets in a drunken condition .
. You can experience 19th century Korean imperial architecture and Korean traditional customs .
Have you ever been mountain climbing ? That is incredible and amazing . Do you like your school ? your city ?
In conclusion , before I read the article I had never realized the importance of using drama in an English class .
For sure , I will apply those strategies in my professional life , because drama gives students the opportunity of not just learning something in the classroom . More than that , it is the opportunity to use their knowledge in educational and social life .
With reference to the recent advertisement about ' USA CAMP SUMMER ' , I would like to express my interest in the position in the camp .
I am a hardworking person and a fun girl .
Recently , I worked babysitting for one year at a school .
I like doing activities with them and I feed them .
I think I am a suitable candidate for this job , because I like children and I have experience of babysitting . Also , I work very well at making food .
I will wait a for phone call from you to discuss the possibility of arranging an interview .
I choose the wheel because it is the most useful invention ever because , thanks to it , human work is made easier , for example a way to move heavy objects , compared to some of the fancy gadgets that we have today . The wheel was invented at a relatively late point in human history ; the oldest known wheel found in an archaeological excavation is from Mesopotamia .
The wheel was found in a settlement built on stilts over wetland , indicating that the settlement had some sort of link to dry land .
( Taken from http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-technology/revolutionary-invention-wheel-001713 )
Added to what I know , that makes it attractive .
In conclusion , members of your family play an important role in your life !
In the last edition of Pur Plus , there was an important discussion about the next plan for cities .
It was presented by a politician , an economist and two environmentalists .
The result will be the pollution of the environment .
So , we will stop traffic jams and as a consequence the environmental problems .
But we should not forget , that these options do not alloy the environment .
Introduction
Teens should not drink under the legal drinking age because they could get into trouble with the law , they could cause harm to themselves and others and could have a higher risk of alcohol dependency later in their lives .
This is an interesting question because I believe that my family are my best friends , but at the same time , they are not my friends .
The two maps show the changes which took place in the town of Shipsmouth between 1995 and 2010 .
First of all , in 1995 , Shipsmouth was a green residential city with two forests .
Squash can also be played individually , as two players together , or in a team of 4 players . squash is one of the very nice attractive sports .
I have practised swimming for 3 years . I am a good swimmer and I have competed in different swimming tournaments .
I want to compete in the United States in the most important tournament . The best swimmers in the world participate in this competition .
Some swimmers are Michael Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Peter Van de Hoogenband and others .
Although public transport is cheap and more environmentally friendly , it is not as flexible or comfortable as the car .
In the diagrams below , the manufacturing process of bank notes is shown clearly .
In the first step , the bank notes have to be designed considering some , like background color , artwork and security issues . After the design has been prepared , skilled machinists prepare metal plates in the second step .
It is the most important step during the whole processing .
Other ones , which are bad sheets and bad bank notes , which are damaged apparently , are destroyed securely .
The most healthy sports are swimming , playing basketball , playing football or running , but I prefer to play tennis .
I enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport that requires skills , concentration and speed .
They will have to concentrate on the game and enjoy it .
In today 's class , we were discussing whether or not we agree with the often enormous salaries of football players .
For me , as a passionate soccer player , it is a good point to consider .
For instance Christiano Ronaldo .
What influences do these salaries have on the clubs is quite simple .
For example , the restaurant business and the technology industry are totally different in Taiwan .
That is why many businessmen want to win this competition , so they have created so many special offers , like if you go to places , you can buy one get one free .
Apparently , the restaurant business is creative and marketing - oriented in Taiwan .
In contrast , there are two different types of company in the technology industry .
One is original equipment manufacturers , like Foxconn . Workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executives at Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung .
The other one is original brand manufacturers , like htc . They produce a lot of new smartphones and sell them .
So , htc has become more energetic and bold in making innovation .
Finally , Taiwan is still suffering an economic slump , but we have so many businesses that like to innovate and market their products , and customers like to buy them .
One evening , it was a blisteringly hot day but I still had to attend one of my friends ' wedding ceremony .
Consequently , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking for my friend , the bride .
It was ridiculous that I did n't have a girlfriend .
However , I still did n't have a girlfriend .
I was overwhelmed with grief .
I could not stand looking at them , celebrating .
As a result , I drifted away from the party , going home alone .
I fell asleep immediately .
I 'm Patricia Agüero . I have seen the advertisement for work in your cafe and I 'm very interested , because I need work to pay for my studies .
Also , I 'm used to working long hours . As a matter of fact , in the holidays I have worked in many restaurants .
It 's a kind of socializing .
I know that I am a suitable person for this job , and I can say that nobody is better than me for this incredible job , because I have travelled all over the world and during this experience , I have seen the necessity of work to finance my journey , so then I have dedicated myself to working on summer camps , and I have a lot of experience of this .
I have other qualities like , cooking like a super chef or even better than that . I am the most organized person in this country , and I love to work with children because it is a way to teach everything you know to other people and help them to improve as a person .
So , in conclusion , I think that if you contract me , you will get an excellent person and an excellent worker .
I think it is true that there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more comfortable .
In my opinion , public transport is more expensive and it is less comfortable than a car , because a car is faster than public transport .
Public transport stops more times than a car , whereas a car goes direct to its destination .
Today , the people use the app " blah blah car " .
It is an app that people use to save gas and money .
I believe that people in the future will begin to travel in shared cars more often and they will use less public transport , like the train , the bus , the underground , etc .
Positive things about online learning are that you are more mobile with your smartphone and you do n't have to carry so much paper with you . Also , you 're on your own and at your own learning speed , which makes it more specific to the user themself . Maybe you 're more comfortable on your Smartphone than with paper .
Negatives about online learning are that you 're not listening to much from a real person and more from a Computer . If pyou do n't have any listening things in the app you do n't learn how to pronounce the words . In my personal opinion , its better to learn from a teacher not only because you learn to pronounce the words correctly , but you also learn from a person , which is , in my opinion , way better . I think we spend enough time on smartphones , so I do n't think it 's the best if we use them to learn as well .
The show seems difficult , the characters always have to face situations which are not easy to solve , but practically , this show is a soap opera in a hospital .
Today 's television is really good .
The advertisements are a bit tricky because they know exactly when children watch , for example , after school .
So , at a special time there is a special advertisement for this age group .
Advertising is important for the economy .
I would say if you know how and when to use a TV , it is good , but especially for young people who think it is good entertainment to watch the whole day .
The attitude of Colombians to the education system is disappointing in some areas and optimistic in others .
In the same way , Australians have a different attitude to their education system .
However , the attitude of the Colombian and Australian people is different in many ways .
Similarly , Australians have a different attitude to the education system .
This attitude is based more on the backgrounds of the people rather than on the system itself .
Recently , there is a growing country whose environment is destroyed by building houses , which accour for some debate .
Many would argue that its disadvantages have already outweighed the advantages , and many others disagree with this view .
With the tremendous thriving and growth of both the economy and cultural diversity , the need is increasing for resource which are used for building much - needed housing and transport networks .
Apparently , it is a good thing , because it is a significant symbol of the development of a country ; however , on the other hand , doing large - scale building projects may bring a galaxy of problems .
In the first place , the environment is destroyed , because there are some trees and flowers before the house is built .
What is worse , the space taken up by the house is where some animals lived before , so they lost their homes , which become the houses of people . Nevertheless , the earth does not only belong to the human race .
Secondly , building more houses is not so much because of living by people , but more because of the economy , which is used for building speculation and the price of a house is too expensive for the ordinary person .
Therefore , no longer on the acts go unheeded , and the governments have to deal with these problems . We should forbid the acts by imposing certain laws .
In a word , the government should appeal to people in some way , that we should protect the earth rather than only focus on personal profit .
Using public transport is " healthier " than using a car for the environment because twenty - three humans can travel on a bus and it is only one vehicle , but it would be twenty cars .
Also , people think that travelling in cars is faster than on public transport and I agree with that , because the bus or the underground is always stopping at the different stations , so in this way , the car is better .
I will use public transport , not always , but more than the car , although you travel slower , because I want to save our planet so that the coming generations can live in good conditions .
There are just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but you .
In contrast , for a tennis match you need just one , and it does n't matter if it is a man or a woman .
But , despite all these advantages , the tennis player has to take care in some dangerous situations .
It happened to me once and was very uncomfortable .
With reference to your advertisement , I would like to apply for the position to work in AMERICAN SUMMER CAMPS . I am John from the capital city of a southern state of India .
I worked in a secondary school for about 2 years , where I gained experience which would be suitable for the current position .
As I worked in a restaurant kitchen as a part - time job , I gained knowledge of basic cooking methods , and hope it might be helpful now .
Herewith I enclose my current CV , which you can see in the attachment .
I am interested in working a in new work environment , kindly reply .
This was a very cool experience for me .
They explained all the procedures .
I could not cope with the responsibilities .
In work , I am confident in work . I have money and satisfaction .
I was the boy behind the curtain , I dealt with the sound of the concert due to my experience with professional music equipment .
I encountered small problems during the concert , but we fixed them very easily thanks to the team with whom I worked .
The experience is unforgettable and I hope that I feel the same soon at the next concert .
Nobody ever heard any arguing .
Michael was a very intelligent boy .
She always told Michael to never disrespect when people are at the door and always be polite .
The building was initially planned as the Federal Legislative Palace during the regime of Porfirio Díaz , because society was governed and supported by the president .
In later times , society felt the need for change because of iniquities that were committed in the country and the Mexican Revolution explotes , the building was abandoned because the government and country did n't have money for construction , to the point that the building 's metal structure was used for weapons .
After the revolution , construction will be used to represent the success of the revolution .
It is so much more convenient .
When I was a university student , I wanted to swim well but I could n't swim , because I did n't have to swim in my life .
First , I registered at a swimming pool , then I went back to the swimming pool every day early in the morning .
I think swimming is the best sport in my life because you can use your your whole body .
The report was discussed at our meeting , and we wish to congratulate you on completing this audit and providing the details and evidence on improving the outcomes from students ' results this year .
One straight observation was the low number of students that have taken the math course .
We wondered if some work needs to be done to increase the student attendance on the math courses .
The diagram gives information about various stages in the process of making bank notes .
It is true that there are five stages in the whole process . We can see that the processes begin with design and end at packaging and distribution .
Looking at the information in more detail .
Initially , bank notes should be considered in terms of the design such as background colour , artwork , and security issues . Then , the preparation of metal plates is the next stage . note should be skilled machinists . Thereafter , the next stage is printing . worker should pay attention to colour on both sides , special ink , and slightly raised images .
Subsequently , the next step is the most important . The bank notes should be inspected . The bank notes are separated into good and bad . If they get good quality sheets , the next stage is packaging and distribution . At this stage , sheets should be cut into separate bank notes , packed , and dispatched . If they get bad sheets , the next stage is disposal . The bad sheets and bank notes are securely destroyed .
First , the bank notes are designed by considering background colour , artwork , and security issues .
Then , the metal plates are prepared by skilled machinists .
Third , this is the most important step : printed sheets are manually inspected , and these sheets are classified into three categories .
The first is called good quality sheets . They will be packed and dispatched .
These pictures show us what detailed steps are taken by the bank to produce paper money into the application .
Before the production , they have to think about the design , including background color , artwork and codes which make them different from the illegal ones , then put them into the printing machines to create them .
The most important step is the inspection by hand . That is to say , they should be separated into good ones , which are to be cut into bank notes and delivered to the banks , and the bad ones , which ca n't be utilised and are burnt securely in the last stage .
In a word , the process of making money for banks is very creative and serious , even rigid .
We are architects of our own destruction .
Consequently , you ca n't enjoy travelling .
Therefore , I think we need public transport .
I think that members of our family ca n't be our best friends , because maybe we do not have the same trust that we have in our friends .
I 'm studying Business Administration , I think my major is so busy .
Actually , I realize that business is not for the major , everybody knows Tec is very demanding and if you want to be there , you must work hard .
I dream of being a Business Administrator when I 'm older . First , I want to work for a sports company like UA and then I may have a little variety on works .
Compared to our classmates or co - workers , the members of our family know us best .
Families understand our minds so much . However , our classmates or colleagues ca n't achieve that because they do n't stay with us all the time .
In conclusion , only family members know who we are most deeply .
Tennis . Tennis is not just a sport anyone can play , but it 's a professional sport and it needs more hard training and more time to be perfect at it . First , why did I choose tennis ? Seriously , in 2003 it was my first time watching the game on TV when I saw Roger Federer play . I think he is the one that made me love this sport , due to his professional movement when playing the ball . From that time , I was interested in this game and watching all the championships , so more time , time and time it is my favourite sport .
She 's from Morocco , so she has Arabian features . For example , she is n't very tall , around 1,57 metres , she has long dark wavy hair and big black expressive eyes .
She is tanned and has a slim build .
First of all , although travelling by car has become more convenient , the growing population means personal vehicles are hard to manage .
Cities such as Beijing , a metropolis in China , face the salient bad traffic . As such , the government had to encourage citizens to go to work by public transport such as bus and subway .
Apparently , this measure has made a great contribution to the traffic in Beijing .
So , public transport plays an important role in our daily life . It has indispensable effects on society .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform the committee about the attractions of this town .
In the town center there are the most attractions as well as one of the best bars in the region ; " the Albastirca " .
Many visitors come to it but there are more attractions than just one bar .
Another good thing about the town is that it is n't lacking in shopping facilities .
It has a big mall that has recently been opened , and it contains everything the visitors might need .
On the other hand , the mall lacks a cinema or some restaurants as it has recently been opened .
Conclusions
To sum up , I strongly suggest that visitors stay as long as possible in this town as it has almost everything that a man needs .
Some people say there is no future for public transportation , but I do n't think so .
Moreover , it is more appropriate to start constructing roads which are convenient for the majority .
First my favorite sport is football and I like it for many reasons . For example , while you are watching a match , you feel excited and entertained . Besides that , football has the best football player ever , which is Leo Mesy . He 's the best and he 's able to do awesome stuff when he 's playing .
One of them was intercepted by a man on a motorcycle . He seemed to be 28 years old .
He was furious because the American did n't understand what he said .
Then he was arrested and charged with the robbery before a magistrate , and is waiting for his sentence .
It is hard for an eastern girl to do what she likes because of her society 's traditions and customs .
Let 's take me as an example . I am a 25-year - old girl who graduated from the faculty of engineering and wants to travel to Germany to complete my studies , but I am not able to do this because my family will not allow me to travel alone .
Today , because of the progress of industry , we have caused so many environmental problems that did n't arise before .
For example , lack of clean water , shortage of electricity , climate change , natural resource depletion , etc .
The problems were n't very significant so we overlooked them , but now they have become serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
Anyway , we will make mistakes if we do the new challenges and new tasks .
Introducion :
The aim of this report , is to show how my town takes care of the environment .
The mayor , in collaboration with Lipor , distributed leaflets with information on " How to deal with household rubbish " . Each leaflet explains how to separate the household rubbish .
The company responsible for rubbish collection collects the garbage , already separated by the families , and afterwards does the recycling .
How the town treats the environment :
As well as the informative sessions about the environment organized by the Mayor for all of the residents , it also has lots of staff that clean the streets , take care of the city gardens and collect the garbage .
In conclusion , I would like to say that the city where I live keeps the city clean and attractive , for people that live there and for those who visit the city .
I do believe that the members of my family are my best friends for many reasons . First of all , we had the same education as we grew up together , so we know each other .
First , the trend of environmentally friendliness has grown since the shortage awareness of fuel , taking public transport can decrease the air pollution created by cars , and more governments have built public transport systems , including subways , buses etc .
Transport in the city is n't inconvenient as it was years ago .
The other reason is , travelling by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts . Most famous resorts lack parking lots , travelers may spend hours trying to park .
To summarize , because the development of public transport is more and more complete , the advantages of travelling by car have been replaced gradually by public transport . The future of public transport is bright .
I am not a professional player .
Sometimes , if I would like to play football but it 's raining , I can watch football on television .
If I play football with my best friends , I am a goalkeeper .
In football , my favourite position is goalkeeper .
In Somalia , people usually throw the rubbish and garbage everywhere , and there is no a cycle which is intended to keep it .
The city council are dealing with how they can keep the city clean , and each and every morning there are employees whose job is to collect rubbish and keep the environment clean .
Many of the main roads of Mogadishu are getting more attractive by the day and the people have begun to make their city clean .
Swimming is my favorite sport , I usually swim 2 or 3 times a week . Swimming is a good sport , especially in summer .
Studies say the cool water will cool the body temperature down and that means it will burn the body fat faster than the other sports .
By the way , some people do n't like to swim because they have difficulty finding a swimming pool . I think that is just an excuse to be lazy . The Internet will help you to find one . Let 's go swimming .
FOOTBALL - MY FAVORITE SPORT
Nowadays , there are many choices for spending our free time , such as going shopping , travelling , listening to music , reading , etc ..
I have relationships with people who play football with me .
They not only help me in every match , but also share everything with me in daily life .
Eating a balanced diet is very important for everyone , especially for pregnant women , children and old people as their bodies need more nutrition than younger people .
Although a balanced diet will offer energy and vitality , that 's not all . Exercising is important too , in addition to a balanced diet .
My favourite sport is football . I love it so much . When I was young , I used to watch football and my favorite team is Barcelona . I used to play with my friends in the street and we were so happy doing that , and after that , we played on a football pitch like in real football . I love Cristiano Ronaldo so much . He is the best player in the world . A few people have told me that Messi is the best player , but I feel angry when I hear that , because that is not true . So I am looking forward to meeting my favourite player one day . It 's like a dream for me .

If you want to visit me , you have to do it in the next month because I have a football tournament , and I must participate .
So what about next month , 12th of December ? I would like to suggest a dish named " Bloody Liver " .
If you want to visit a restaurant , I would suggest the Dagi .
To answer your question , I can not attend the party because I do not like those kinds of parties , but I wish you good luck ! Almos
We , the management of The Arch London Hotel , received your email and wish to let you know that you should make known to us the position you desire to work in via return email along with a scanned copy of your signed contract of agreement to enable us to make all the necessary corrections .
When it comes to public transport , the future is relatively dark according to the prospection .
Indeed , all the indicators show that human behavior will not change , at least in the coming decades .
On the other hand , governments are not able to change transportation policies to enhance public transport 's level of service .
Malaga is a town that takes care of the environment .
Around the city , there are a lot of containers for rubbish , pieces , plastic and crystal .
So , Malaga is responsible towards the environment and towards people in need .
These companies must take care of the environment or they will have to pay a big fine to the council .
So , in general , I think Malaga is very responsible towards the environment and acts appropriately .
The way of living changes every day : if we think about our grandparents ' , but also about our parents ' lives , we notice many differences .
Above all , they talked more . We live in the era of telecommunication and no one could live without their mobile phone or their computer .
Moreover , also , simple things have changed . For example , the food we eat . Some time ago , everything was natural , healthy ... but now everyone always eats " junk food " and things like that , which are completely unhealthy !
About food , I imagine a future society in which restaurants wo n't exist . People will eat only junk food and food which has been prepared before , food in tins ... so all unhealthy things , which will cause many problems .
For this reason , I also imagine that in the future doctors and scientists will have too much to do !
A lot of people are afraid of catastrophic events even thought it 's very improbable that the same thing will happen to us .
Some fears are instinctive and it 's positive because it protects us from real danger , it 's a good response .
But phobias are fears which we experience that are life - threatening and they can disrupt everyday life , but people can get over them with the right sort of therapy .
So if we want to live a life which is n't controlled by our fears , we must try to be more objective and pay more attention to real dangers .
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote his story " The War of the Worlds " , so it was inevitable . People began to see space creatures everywhere .
They will have three eyes , antennae on their heads , and guns firing green extraction .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
tube and train , but is there a future for them or not ? I am going to answer this question by discussing disadvantages and advantages and , finally , I will give my personal opinion .
To begin with , public transport is not as convenient as using our own vehicle . Every day , above all in the morning , it is usually crowded , due to people going to work .
Although I have written some disadvantages , public transport is better than private transport .
Secondly , public transport is more ecological and less polluting for the environment , because it produces less polluting emissions , and many public vehicles use green energy , such as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , from my point of view , public transport is more necessary now than ever before . Cities contain more automobiles and the pollution is worse .We need to change our way of thinking , and try to use public transport as an alternative to improve the environment of our cities .
Last week , my class and I went to Sicily on a school trip .
I enjoyed all the cities we visited but the best , in my opinion , was Siracusa . In particular , I liked Ortigia , which is the oldest part of the city .
Public transport nowadays has become a bit uncomfortable because we can not think of availability of seat .
It takes more time to travel by public transport than by personal vehicle . There is a scarcity of buses and the timings too are not fixed .
Traveling by car or any other personal vehicle is much more convenient because it takes much less time and it takes us directly to the place where we want to go .
These days , private transport is more convenient than public transportation . Although public transport like buses , trains , ferries and intercity rail take less time and energy , sometimes it creates problems .
On public transport , people are obliged to share transport with strangers and we also have to follow company policy or regulations , but with our own transport , we do n't have to bother about these things . We travel when we want and when we have time .
So we can say that travelling in our own transportation is more convenient .
It 's true driving a car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wait for a bus .
They can travel to another place irrespective of the time .
Some buses have special and preferential seats for old people .
This is interesting because people practise solidarity .
This mode of transport is better for the population and means that we do n't have traffic in the city .
5- It gives me a lot of time to think about all my life without any disturbance from anybody .
Travelling by car is more convenient in my opinion .
Secondly , you might feel uncomfortable .
To sum up , in my opinion , travelling by car is better .
Unfortunately , it is very sad to say that people in my town do not care about the environment .
We need to start doing something to avoid pollution .
There are so many little things we could do to care for the environment .
I suppose their lifestyle is intolerable , resteless and I really sympathise with them . The majority of outstanding and appreciated people are frustrated .
That is a pitiless trial for celebrities but , through thick and thin , they go on .They achieve the goals made exceptionally for the sake of money and vanity .
I 'm writing you a letter because I have made a short film with my friends , and I want to tell you what the film is about and what the experience was like .
The experience with the film was amazing , because we laughed all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea .
In itself , the film did n't have an special topic , but I can describe it as a friends film , as there is a lot of laughs , jokes , and it shows that friendship is the greatest thing that exists .
I started running to lose weight and it ended up being a life - changing experience .
Running is cheap and everyone can take up running , no experience required . After all , it is just one step after the other .
But public transport has advantages : If we use it is an essential mode of transport for travelling .
Therefore , the environment will be improved .
The public transport is unsafe because of an increase in thefts and the kidnapping of users .
Also , that the cameras transmit immediately the images of robbers to other buses to ensure that they are alert , and that the drivers receive training and sanctions for driving badly .
It 's economically and practically more expensive .
In olden times luxuries were not considered as compared to health , but now everyone prefers to save time and maintain privacy , which one can only afford by using her / his own private transport , so gradually , public transport is losing its charm .
I think it 's very important as it reduces the problems of both pollution and crowding . We use fewer vehicles as it is big and carries a lot of people .
The underground , trains and buses . These means of transport are cheap , so it helps the poor to save some money .
Governments should take care of public transport . They should save means of entertainment . People should keep them clean and safe . If they use them carelessly they will be useless . Now there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars are faster than public transport , so cars are more convenient than public transport . They are easier , faster and more comfortable , especially for long distances . So , governments should improve public transport as not all people have cars .
Nowadays , travelling has made it easier for humans to move all over the world .
Many people have got used to using their own vehicle as their means of transport , where they can reach their destination on time .
In the following paragraphs , I present my view on this controversial issue .
Firstly , we have different modes of transport , among these is road transport .
As the automotive industry is huge , most householders prefer to buy a car rather than use any other motor vehicle . They can move easily from departure point to destination in no time .
As private transport is increasing day by day , it 's that there may not be any public transport in the future .
Secondly , if private transportation is increasing faster , traffic is also going to create a major problem , which causes global warming .
And the income that is gained through this transport service will automatically decrease , which will create a problem for the economy of the country .
Another issue we can see here is unemployment .
Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as public transportation , like bus service , cab service , auto service .... etc , in order to fulfil their basic needs .
More unemployed people may also lead to a higher crime rate .
I hope giving equal priority to both public and private transportation makes us healthy .
And we can see that controlling the traffic is not going out of the hands .
On the one hand , I like to have things that are typical in each country , apart from the fact that they are delicious , because when you 've got the opportunity to travel , you can go and experience the food too .
Public transport is the best way to save the planet and have a better atmosphere . Also , we save money and can meet people .
It is true a car is more comfortable , but it uses a lot of mineral resources like petrol which can pollute the atmosphere .
Public transport is very complicated nowadays .
Day by day , the number of people is increasing in Mumbai .
The Internet is a useful tool for everyone , so we are communicating with distant friends , and we look for important information when we are studying or entertaining ourselves .
First of all , I am going to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this topic .
The first advantage is that the Internet is very fast . For example , when you want information about something .
As for disadvantages , at present , children are always playing with their computer games and mobile phones .
Both computer games and mobile phones have got the internet . As a result , they have not got time for other traditional games .
Another disadvantage is that people do not meet with friends , since they speak on Internet websites , so every time there is unless relationship , the people are not sociable .
To sum up , the Internet is the most important advance in the world , but there are a lot disadvantages and advantages .
From my point of view , the Internet is useful for everyone , but we should not abuse it , and should carry out other activities .
Anyways , I would n't want to ruin the ending but I would definitely recommend you to see what happens next !
I really appreciate your card that you sent me .
It made me speechless !
I celebrated my birthday without any complications .
I want to be an accountant .
Here is a description of my phone - model iphone 6 , gray color and there were scratches on the back .
I am interested in your advertisement you posted in an English language magazine .
I am working in the daytime , so nighttime , 6 pm to 9 pm , or anytime on weekends would be good for me , except on Mondays and Wednesdays when I play basketball as a hobby .
I am good at speaking and listening but not confident at writing , especially essay writing . I 've never studied writing in my life , so I want to focus on this writing part more than others .
Travelling by car is much more convenient but we all know really there is no future for public transport .
When we talk about public transport , there are many people and everyone travels but I think we do not feel relaxed there and if we talk about travelling by car .
It is the best or much more convenient for us .
I think there is a big future for public transport , because a lot of people want to use it and , more than anything else , it is convenient .
In particular , some people do n't have a car and some elderly people find it difficult to drive a car by themselves , so public transport helps them a lot .
Already , public transport has been improved and that makes it comfortable to go on a trip , but I think it will be able to be better and better quality , because so many people expectation .
I like the car as well , but when I have to drive a car , I have to think about parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meeting other people to talk while I am travelling , so public transport is making connections between human beings .
The explanation of those who support the second answer is that everyone is born equal in terms of duties and rights .
Is it convenient to take a year off between leaving school and starting the university ?
I think it is not necessary and not recommendable because you have the possibility to earn money and it is difficult once you get used to earning money , you want to study again .
Furthermore , you do n't study during this period and when you want to start university , you wo n't be able to remember some important things
Convenience is not the only consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of people choose public transport for travelling because it 's cheaper , easier , more relaxed and sometimes faster than driving a car .
In recent years , governments have encouraged people to take public transport because of the fuel crisis .
Some governments invest a lot of money in constructing public transport networks to make travelling by public transport more convenient .
It 's basketball .
Basketball is a perfect sport because you can develop your reflections and your relationships with people .
I enjoy playing basketball because I relax when I play it and I can meet new people and travel around my city or my country . That is the best , because you can visit cities .
I can give you some advice to start doing this sport .
This is a sport that improves your friendships and it 's so good for your health .
A river passes by the city and , occasionally , there were floods in the place .
I absolutely disagree with this statement .
There are 7 billion people in the world , and the number is increasing rapidly .
Besides , it 's also an environmental problem ; exhaust fumes engulf the earth . The more the car is used , the more exhaust gases are released . We are killing our mother earth .
An automobile is a luxury in some countries , like mine .
In conclusion , public transport is our future means of transport . I mean for most citizens .
Not car , though it 's convenient .
My favourite sport is swimming . It makes me feel comfortable and leaves me in a good mood . I go swimming twice a week , and my advice to anyone wanting to start swimming is to enjoy every moment of it .
I think it is just a coincidence that the sheep looks like a human .
Life is a long journey . Every day , we gain more and more experience .
We become not only older , but also wiser . We learn , but the most useful thing to learn is to get a lot of experiences and , for sure , to make mistakes . But we have to be honest with ourselves and admit our mistakes to avoid them in the future .
I am in Kyoto eating Yatsuhashi .
As you know , my grandmother currently lives in France with my cousin John . Unfortunately , he has to do a three - month course outside of the country . John needs to leave France next weekend , but it is not possible . I have to go and look after her because none of my family can spend three months over there .

Nowadays , technology is more modern than in the past and people are always developing their inventions to make them more useful .
We as humans living in these days , rely on technology . Every aspect of our lives is supported by technology .
One example is television . In the past , we used it only for watching the news and movies , but as time goes by and the technology develops , now television has other functions .
Television can be used tor many things . Usually we watch television for entertainment , but we can also use it for education too .
These are the proofs that television can also educate .
First , television has many programs which can be used for education .
Many programs consist of lessons for kids to learn . For kids who still want to learn to speak and know the words , it is very useful , because many programs are very suitable for them to help them learn faster by watching television .
Besides that , we can also use television to make us become knowledgeable , by watching news programs .
Second , these days , television has become modern and that means television can be connected with the internet .
By that advantage , now we can easily search and get information from the internet by using a television .
In conclusion , television can entertain and also educate , because television programs do it in an interesting way .
But we are too interested .
I 'm not good at playing it , and I prefer to play volleyball , but I like to watch the games .
The emotions the only try if you 're a fan of any team , and you know the happiness that you feel when it wins , it 's indescribable .
I like to watch the games at home with my father , but always go to the stadium with my dad . You feel indescribable emotions . And my father was to convey this passion .
The future of public transport should be taken seriously . In my opinion , public transport is the best option for solving the problems with traffic congestion because , when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people are travelling from one place to other in just one vehicle .
When we use a car , in general , one person is the only person who is accustomed to using their own car , so this is not exploiting the potential of the car .
It 's for this reason that I think public transport is a great benefit to society , and a good way for us to move from one place to another . I suggest that the government should invest more money for the purpose of improving public transport .
George 's restaurant is a very pleasant place with many tasty recipes from all around the world to enjoy your dinner alone or with company .

You ca n't disagree that our world become urbanization in the future , can you ?
Today 's television !
The big deal is entertainment , and quality is part of it .
You should consider that large and being untouchable TV is what you must find in one .
In conclusion , enjoy watching movies on your own TV considering price and quality . Some TV brings you the experience of enjoying your favourite movies in other scenery . Will you try ?
Whether people who reach 18 should do military service is an issue . The supporters suggest that it is helpful for 18-year - olds to train their physical fitness and psychological qualities , whilst opponents point out that it is harmful to human rights and affects the development of a country .
Considering both views , it can be concluded that the government should respect human rights and set up a new department which can be used by people who want to apply to do military service .
You just have to think that 50 years ago we did n't know what a smartphone or a laptop was , in schools we used books of paper and not tablets or iPads , and now technology is part of our lives .
I think and hope that maybe in 50 years scientists will find a cure for many diseases and that will change our lives , because we could live for longer .
I want thank you for the invitation but I ca n't come to the party because it is my sister 's s burradas .
I am currently a doing Master 's but I can devote myself to the Fellowship , especially since I have finished the Pre - Masters and now I need only follow up from time to time with my supervisor . So I have the time for the Fellowship .
First of all , I would like to tell you about the atmosphere of the film .
That slow - motion action is so impressive that I have watched it all day .
In particular , I would like to point out Mathew McConnahy 's role .
The philosophy of this hero is so different to what we used to think every day that I have taken a look at my life from another point of view .
I work in advertising . I 'm an account .
This report aims to give a clear idea about preserving the environment in my town .
First of all , the local council organised a competition promoting ecological awareness and encouraging the local community to preserve the environment .
Second , new rules were legislated condemning any person intending to harm the environment in any way .
Third , supporting recycling by inventing three types of rubbish bins for hard waste , for liquids , and the third for clothes .
Football is considered to be the most watched and followed sport worldwide .
I would like to look at this sport from different perspectives .
Firstly , football plays a vital role in unifying people locally and internationally . For example , it helps the US and China to normalize their relations .
Although I have been playing football for years , I am still not a professional player . This may be because I am not talented .
We will learn today some information about Islam . Islam is a great religion that comes from the Arabian Peninsula and it was founded 1436 years ago .
Mohammed was a kindly prophet born in a small city called Mekka and he travelled to another city close to Mekka called Almadina because the people of Mekka were very aggressive and they did not accept the new invitation to the new religion .
I think the principal things in our talk are the internet , computers , technology and communications .
Education will not be in schools and universities , but it will be on the internet by many methods like : Self Education , E - learning education , on many websites like : EDX and Coursera and distance education .
I 'm writing to you because I 'm interested in applying for the job in summer camps .
I saw the advertisement last week in the newspaper and I think that I 'm the right person for the job .

Second is the preparation of the metal plates .
It 's done by skilled machinists .
When printing is finished , they have to be inspected .
They will package and distribute the sheets which are good .
At this point , they first cut the sheets into separate bank notes . Second , they pack the sheets and dispatch them .
Why not ? Firstly , what 's education for you ? It 's very clear to me that education is creating the conditions to make your thinking grow .
The other reason for my opinion is that almost all people prefer using the eyes and ears to other people , rather than write and listen to understand new things .
That 's why I think that it 's a good moment to see things in a new way and that can be a very good opportunity .
Definitely , it does not always depend on the kind of programme , but I think that nowadays , a lot of television offers help for people to develop more effectively .
I am communicating with you with the purpose of letting you know that we are going to set up a meeting at my office with the purpose of discussing how we could use social media to improve the communication with our suppliers . I think a great time for the meeting would be next Monday at 4:00 p.m

The purpose of this letter is to notify you about some complaints that some citizens have . This is related to why only boys have to be in the draft for military service , and girls do not have to .
Yes , I have a favourite restaurant .
When I go to the restaurant , I always eat Mexican food such as tacos or fajitas .
However , I just go to the restaurant on special occasions , such as my birthday or when I pass an exam .
This diagram is used to illustrate the process of making bank notes , covering seven main stages .
First of all , we should think of a design and decide the background colour and artwork , or even security issues .
And then , for the preparation of metal plates , skilled machinists are used .
Next , printing . Sheets of bank notes are printed ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) with colour on both sides , and specWell , the . Well , the most important step is inspection , printed sheets should be manually inspected .

It is located between neighborhoods with aesthetic characters in the Alhijaz design area .
And conservation mechanism followed in this house encouraged students to become a part of it .
Finally , if you want to rest and have good companionship , go to this house .
The pyramids were not made by machines or computers and that is from the secrets of the ancient Egyptians of how they could build a great building like that about 7,000 years ago and it is still strong now . People from all over the world come to Egypt to see it s great civilization . Around 2 million people come to the pyramids yearly . You can be one of them .
Come visit the land of peace and civilization .
First of all , I would like to present some background information about myself . My name is Said Ahmed .
The reason for choosing the English language specifically next September I would like to get to know more information about an English language course .
Our school is organizing a funfair .
This activity is really interesting and you should n't miss it .
You will gain a sense of satisfaction .
It is meaningful enough that you can raise money for the poor or help meet somebody 's needs by buying things .
Also , there are some performances after the funfair .
If these reasons why you should take part in the event haven't whetted your appetite , you might try searching for some information about the event last year .
It is hoped that the successful funfair or other student s ' experiences will encourage you to participate in the funfair .
It is believed that the fun fair will be held successfully this year too .
Sometimes we have a presentation and competition .
Effective teachers have clear and consistent communication and management skills .
The teacher uses lesson time effectively .
Classroom management is good .
Students must take a serious assessment about himself .
This city is located in the north of Extremadura .
In Cáceres , we take care of the environment .
The people recycle the rubbish and they throw away the rubbish in different containers .
Sagrada Familia , also called Gaudi 's Cathedral , is a very touristic Roman Catholic church located in Barcelona which is still under construction .
Antoni Gaudi was the Catalan architect who designed it in 1798 and in 1882 its construction got started .
Nowadays , due to the current economic crisis , its construction has been stopped until an undetermined date .
It is interesting because it has
When I was ten years old , I really liked to play football very much . I joined a football team which is near to my home . I prefer this team because my family is not rich , they can not provide for my transportation fees to go to do exercise at a stadium .
In my life , many dreams have existed in my mind which are sweet , incredible , magical or horrible .
Constantly , I just walked like without terminal contest .
Nowadays we see an enormous improvement in infrastructure .
Nevertheless , travel by car is easier for commuters , for example , because they can choose a personal timetable without the terrible discomfort of buses . In addition , there is a fair chance that by the end of this century dwellers will stop travelling by public transport , especially if the government invested their money in green energy and we could discover a new green car , which in turn , would revolutionise our lives .
Well , the way that we use television depends on each one of us .
We will have people that use the television as fun , most of the time ; but we also have other people that use television for research .
For example , the channel '' Animal Planet '' has a lot of information about animals and how they live .
In my opinion , people use television for distraction .
The television is being more and more utilized by people , so we are getting more problems with vision .
It looks like a kind of addiction ... We need to use the technology on our behalf .
The capitalist world makes us increasingly become us updated .
Nowadays , everybody has the ability to buy a television , so the numbers of TV viewers is going up ; even if you are poor or rich ; most can watch a movie , or a documentary .
There are no excuses not to be an informed person .
Shopping online is also not , from my experience , a good way of shopping .
Socializing online helps us to contact our friends in an easy way in different places and this way does n't cost us money .
Socializing does not cost us money , but we need one place to contact each other .
Now , public transport is not the future , because travelling by car is much more convenient .
People who do n't use public transport , think that travelling by car is much better .
Maybe it will be a really good opportunity for people to be more healthy too .
Compared with local bookstores , publishers or media such as newspapers considering the Internet market , public transportation has a much better future .
The first reason is that public transportation carries humans .
Even though people try to develop drones to reduce logistical costs , it is difficult to apply technology to carrying humans .
The second reason is that automatic driving technology needs some more time for development .
Also , automatic driving technology is already applied to trains .
Following your letter , I want to tell you about the apartment . It is very beautiful , not big or small , but medium - sized with two rooms inside , a bathroom and a dining room and an external director categorize overlooking a beautiful view . I am sure he will like it . to come and Tri condo b soon , n the end , I would say that I miss you so much and I hope to see you soon .
I like talking to friends and I can communicate with other people .
I ca n't pronounce well .
Michael was a little boy . He was 10 years old . He went with his parents to his grandfather 's home .
The home was on the shore . There was a tunnel and it 's hole was in the deep . At first he used to be polite and obey the other orders .
Micheal was afraid . He waited for Sara to get out . He went to the shore to see if she came from the other side , but he found no footprints . His mother called him and he went home still thinking about Sarah . It was night and he was afraid to go there again . He went to sleep . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
A clean and healthy environment is always acceptable to all kinds people .
Also , they obey the rules and regulations of the city authorities .
First , the waste management system of our area is more effective than before .
Our authorities now follow the scientific method for rubbish control ; recycle , reuse , galvanization .
As a result , the city - dwellers are now enjoying a more healthy environment .
It is a more expected criteria , why the authority step up many organizations working for waste management .
In most cases , not only my family members but also our neighbors like to avoid carbon - level - increasing products that are responsible for temperature increases .
Many organizations work to raise the environmental awareness of pupils , so people are more concerned about environmental pollution .
Now , the government is working to decrease smoke emissions from the mills and industry .
Scientists and researchers jointly work to reduce carbon emissions .
Some progress has been made already ; it s implementation also runs at full speed .
Last but not least , the strict rules and regulations have a more effective impact on making a good town .
Our authorities are more careful about the rules and regulations ; hence no - one can disobey the rules .
The job announcement on your webpage immediately grabbed my attention , as it has always been my dream to work for the German - Norwegian Youth Forum and the requirements are just the skills that I can provide you with .
Influenced by it , I started to look for universities in Scandinavia .
Since 2013 , I have been studying English and Marketing Communication at University College Syddanmark .
Furthermore , even if you just buy something you can afford , you may also waste much more money .
Travelling by car is certainly much more convenient than travelling by trams or trolleybuses , which only follow the lines of their routes .
But thinking about the environment , traffic jams and sometimes the absence of parking spaces makes me change the statement .
HOW CAN YOU BEST LOOK AFTER YOUR ENVIRONMENT ?
I have a few easy recepts , how you can be a well off £ 100 and how you can help the environment .
Firstly , I will describe how I can help my local environment and what I do that is useful for it .
I am interested in natural ways we can help in the local area .
I am a serious fan of the environment .
Secondly , I save water and electricity , because the costs are quite expensive .
So , my bills for water are inexpensive , because I have swapped having a bath to taking a shower .
Next point is an issue , that if I am not at home , I switch off the heating .
We learn to really segregate waste and , in the future , how we could , for example , use the same glass a second time .
Finally , we are obligated to care about the environment , because it 's our duty .
I think it is true , because a lot of people like travelling by car .
Some years ago when the weather was colder here people ate more meat with wine . In fact , growing vegetables was not possible because of the weather .
In fact , today people are interested in drinking wine when attending parties or meeting with friends .
Our commitments cause us to forget ourselves and our health .
It may cause increasing weight or reducing the number of necessary vitamins which our body needs .
In conclusion , if we make a decision to live longer , following a suitable diet is crucial and unavoidable .
You see , I do not see members of one 's family as one 's best friends because , personally , I did n't and still do n't have a great relationship with anyone in my biological family .
And this may have affected my way of thinking and acting in different situations .
So no , the members of my biological family are n't my best friends .
Thank you for giving me the chance to pass on this information as per your request .
In my town , there are many regulations that are enforced by the municipality and the environment ministry , such as preventing animals like sheep , horses , cows .. etc , from being in the town and in the populated areas .
As we are fully dependant on individual generators , these are causing multiple problems with the weather due to their smoke , oil and gas left behind , in addition to noise , of course , because they are the main source of the 18 continuous hours of noise .
People , especially generator owners , have started using Canaopies , using very long pipes to get rid of as much as they can of the pollution .
Other residential areas , using their potential to maintain the environment by planting trees , roses , have numerous green spaces .
Also , recycling the trushes is a very intelligent way to keep the town clean and get multiple uses out of the products in industry lines .
on the other hand , the eldest people in our city have many social responsibilities and are encouraging the youngest people to participate in the annual gardening festival for the indoor and outdoor gardens .
Although each household can make a real difference by taking good care of the area in front of their houses and keeping it clean .
Hope that this information is useful
Michael and Marcuangolo were friends , but in school they were enemies . They had amazing battles in the playground .
One day , at the end of classes , Marcuangolo wanted to hit Michael , and Michael ran away .
Marcuangolo fell in the street .
A car crashed into him and Marcuangolo started bleeding .
They took Marcuangolo to a room and put the boy in a bed .
Michael understood that he must take away .
As soon as I came to university , my life changed .
Before I started university , I had n't a lot of friends and I was so lonely , but after I started to study at Ton Duc Thang university , I became more happy , comfortable and sociable .
I'll have a friend at university because I scared strangers .
The first day I studied at the university , I made a lot of friends .
It was a wonderful experience for me .
We were talking about the last match . We were discussing our faults , when suddenly we heard a loud noise .
Some passengers were hurt and weak .
I like the Indian restaurants in the city . In addition , the infrastructure and roads are well organised .
obeying to the statement above , it 's necessary to say that this is a very interesting topic , because it 's closely related to actual problems , such as problems with the environment .
That is to say , that most cars are not green , namely ; current cars are not designed to have a good impact on the environment .
Regarding the reason for the described situation , it is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies , which are aimed at getting as much money as possible , regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals .
Thus , the question is , travelling by car is so much more convenient for whom ?
For multinationals maybe ?
, even though , when the public transport gets so crowded , it is indeed less harmful , in terms of the impact on the environment , because it means more individuals in the same place , whereas each new car means increasing pollution .
Travelling by public transport would be more convenient with a good conscience of protect the planet .
The idea of banning cars from the centre of all major cities has advantages and disadvantages .
The good things about not allowing cars in city centres are that the traffic will be reduced , trips will be faster and the pollution will be reduced .
On the other hand , the bad things are that you have to park outside of the city centre and these areas will be crowded , you ca n't visit places with your car and people with physical problems could have difficulties with public transport .
In my opinion , it is a good idea , but perhaps the restriction could have exceptions for certain people and certain days and times , or if you need to visit a particular place with your car , you could ask for special permission .
In the village where I live , there is a lot of vegetation . For that reason , we try to protect the environment . One of the things we do is to do maintenance every week to the vegetation zone , checking if there is any garbage . To avoid this , we teach the younger generation environmentalist actions so they do n't throw cans , paper , or candies on the floor . They can also help the older people . There are cases where a person throws garbage on the street or on the vegetation . To avoid that happening again , we have a punishment that is to pay some money . If they do n't , they wo n't be allowed to enter the village park and zoo again , unless they are visitors . In that case , we tell him or her the way we live in the village and , we give him or her advice to keep a beautiful place without garbage .
Another environmentalist action we use is to protect the wildlife by taking care of them . For that we have a care centre and , other additional institutions . We also make environmental protection centers where people can visit and learn about this . To sum up , our village is very focussed on taking care of the natural world that surrounds us .
I am one of the students at Telemark University College .
I am studying on the Literature and Language bachelor programme .
I am so interested in this major .
In my country there are many interesting places to visit and it is a country to improve with your job , also , also , it is easy to find a job . There are many jobs and many different types of jobs .
This country has many interesting places to visit . If you want to have an adventure , you have to go to the aconcagua in Mendoza .
If you want to have fun , you can go to Parque de la Costa . There are many interesting rollercoasters .
In my opinion , public transportation is the most convenient way to travel . The air pollution is one reason that I prefer public transportation .
When I was born , I weighed 3650 grams and I was 52 centimeters tall .
Public transport is not convenient for most the people because every person wants to arrive at his destination on time , but when using public transport it is very difficult to arrive on time .
It all began in 1981 when Freddy Fazbear 's Pizza opened . The establishment is a pizza restaurant but this pizza restaurant had robots . In 1981 there were four animatronics and their names were Chica , Foxy , Bonnie and Freddy .
Three robots at a specific hour perform a show with instruments like a band .
Foxy the pirate performs a show on her own in her pirate cove . The children love Foxy because he plays with the kids , answering questions about the pirates and telling a pirate story .
When Freddy began to sing , the kids screamed and they sang with Freddy the famous Freddy Fazbear 's Song . Bonny played the drums and Chica served the pizza to the children , This year the establishment closed because they found the body of a dead child .
In 1983 , the pizza restaurant reopened with more security and robots with a more friendly appearance .
The establishment sought a security guard who had to guard the pizza restaurant at night . I am the security man .
When I saw the advertisement for the job , in that time , I thought that it would be very easy . I called the number , they give me the information , and I accepted .
The rules are simple : just look at the laptop , watch the animatronics , wait until 6:00am and close the doors if you need to . I said OK .
My second and third nights were very strange because on the cameras the animatronics moved as if they wanted to get to my room and do something to me .
The fourth and fifth nights were the worst because the animatronics were very active , they closed and opened the doors because they were trying to get into my room .
This holiday I am in Barcelona with my girlfriend .
Rosetta becomes first spacecraft to orbit .
NASA replied that it was a really amazing achievement that Rosetta left the solar system .
NASA replied that Rosetta will keep on its journey travelling across the Universe .
Travelling by car is becoming a comfortable factor nowadays because we can stop and go whenever we want , we can start at our desired time .
People 's lives will not change if they do n't change themselves . Everyone wants to improve his life to make it better but how can we do that without doing anything ? We must start with education and health , which are the most important things to be better .
After the Second World War , they improved themselves in 50 years and became one of the most developed countries .
It is easier and more convenient .
There are plants everywhere .
There is another issue that is due to heavy traffic but few roads that are wide enough so that most people are distributed due to these issues .
Your position will be manager of Green Pepper cafe , so you will be responsible for managing all levels and use your experience in order to improve our cafe .

My name is Alejandro Martín . I 'm 30 years old . I have heard about your organization and I would like to work for you .
I ask myself If I had the possibility to change the world , would I try to do all that in your hands .
My favorite sports/ hobbies are windsurfing and sailing .
The best place I have ever been is on an island in the east archipelago in Sweden .
A very big weakness I have is that I can forget nearly everything , especially homework and other school stuff .
happy , funny and sometimes bothersome .
My favorite restaurant is TGI Fridays .
If you have a car , you probably think that travelling by car is better than by bus , but there are a lot of people who do n't have a car , so they are used to going by bus and , for them , this way of travelling has become more convenient , because they have done it since they were children .
Most people say that using public transport is better than using cars , and they say that it 's cheaper and better for the environment . As for me , I think that cars are easier and an affordable way to travel between places , because cars are here anytime and so near to your home , unlike public transportation , which you have to walk to to reach in most countries . And also , cars are available all the time . You can go at 4 am and no one will say anything , because it 's yours , but most public transportation is available only for the daylight hours and a few hours at night , in an emergency situation for example , what will you do if you do not have your own car ? Your kid is sick , or your wife or your elderly parents . And , in general , the more we rely on ourselves , the more our government is able to help the poor and homeless people out there , who really need more help and aid from the public community . We merely ask the government to improve the streets and the traffic light systems , and more petrol stations and parking in the streets , to be able to drive and move around easily and safely and in a short amount of time .
Most people say that using a car is more convenient than using public transport .
Of course , private transport has a lot of advantages , like , you do n't need to wait for a bus at the stops or you can go everywhere you want at a time convenient for you .
Please respond at your earliest convenience ,
27-dresses is a romantic comic and funny film . It is recommended for all ages .
The plot is well constructed , it becomes quite gripping from the beginning .
The main characters are very young and enjoyable .
In conclusion , if you want to have a good time , you should go to the cinema to see this film with your family , because it is an interesting and emotional film .
Nowadays , we have a lot of environmental problems .
As a result , roads are overloaded and long traffic jams damage the air .
On the other hand , the government should think about some measures for protecting the environment .
Also , another improving measure might be increasing green areas in cities and towns .
Unfortunately , many tourists do n't care about keeping personal spaces ( on the river bank or on the beach ) clean .
Secondly , rules for tourists about caring for the environment must be very strict .
I often participate in friendly matches to keep my physical abilities up to the mark .
While putting a lot of stress on physical abilities , it goes without saying that the day can be tiring if one decides to play the longer version of the game , but it is equally challenging as to how you will keep up your mental status .
It does require you to explore your brain while developing strategies against the opponents .
It becomes essential to create a spontaneous Plan B when Plan A did not work .
Above all , one has to learn to maintain sportsmanship , irrespective of the result or heated moments on the field .
In today 's world , television is very important .
But sometimes it can also affect us in a negative way . Most people around the world can see any news live . Media is more helpful for people . Television is also used as a study resource , for example for smart classes ,
online courses etc . Television is a very important medium . We can improve our language with the help of the television . Now we can see
that so many films with the help of television and we can see other programs also . to the present world without television
no one can live as a human being so that we can say that television is more important .
Michael was a serious boy , he had the ability to behave in a good way , help his parents with daily activities .
One day , Michael was going to school for his final examination .
Your summer camp is the best place to demonstrate me .
If you walk at the seaside in the evening you can also have the possibility to see the sunset over the sea .... that 's great emotion ! I feel good in that way and even my soul can have a breath .
I suggest everybody should have the same evening walk . You just need a pair of comfortable shoes !
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is cheaper than public transport .
The main reason for people not liking to travel by public transport is overcrowding .
People prefer the car rather than public transport due to sexual harassment .
I recommend this experience .
On the negative side are the labor conditions . The money is not enough to pay for the cost of living in London and in addition the money for " travel expenses " , in my case , did n't arrive until November !
Anyway , I recommend that you take the job for August , because I have heard that in that month the organization is better than in July .
I wish you luck and a good experience .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately that he had planned two weeks ago .
After that , the celebrations began and a lot of their friends came , each one presented a gift to Sara . She was really delighted and , suddenly , the doorbell been rang
Sara stood and stared at her for a few minuets and hugged her and bowed her for coming and thanked her . They had n't seen each other for several years since they had finished their studies . Really it was a great moment and they stay speaking together about many things and call the best moment that collect them together , stay speaking until the evening , and agreed to visit their college at the weekend to recall the best memories . It was Peter who arranged this celebration and contacted Tia and prepared for all this to happen . Sara never forgot that day .
It 's much faster and much more convenient than using public transportation .
The only drawback that comes along with using cars is limited fuel resources .
However , it seems that each day a new way of extracting fuels is being explored .
Beijing is the capital of China , it is the political , economic and cultural center , but also a city with a long history .
It was the capital of the Ming dynasty and Qing dynasty , so it has a lot of ancient architecture , like Ming Tombs , the Summer Palace , The Temple of Heaven , the Forbidden City .
The Forbidden City , especially , is the largest architectural complex which is the best - kept in the current .
It . It represents the highest architectural achievement in ancient China .
These architecture also represents the culture of China .
Now Beijing is a large international city , it will inherit the elements of history and develop much better .
" The reality of transportation is that it is future oriented .
Transportation has a major role in a society as life revolves around motion .
When we talk about convenience , comfort and safety , then private transport is more likely to be considered .
Travelling privately makes one free of issues like harassment .
Public transport can cause problems for passengers due to increasing fares .
For instance , fuel - efficient , luxurious and economical cars are easily available .
With the advancement of the automobile industry , public transport will not be considered as the first choice in the coming years .
The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer , more convenient and comfortable way of travelling .
I studied at Al Qassim University and my major was Microbiology .
I like a lot of activities , such as travelling , reading , playing soccer and watching movies .
I still believe that public transport will be more popular in the future due to the benefits it provides for us . Travelling by car is more convenient but expensive .
Travelling on public transport is cheaper .
Today , governments focus on how to improve public transport and they also increase their support .
So public transport is improved continuously .
I think it will be the favourite transportation for all of us .
My favorite sport is volleyball .
This sport causes fresh and jolly me and I think exercise will cause me to be healthy . If you start volleyball , you need a ball and a piece of ground that is separated by a net .
Shopping takes place the biggest part especially for women , but sometimes it is not so enjoyable and I agree with this statement .
First of all , shopping is not satisfying when you are tired , or you are hungry , or maybe it is just your personality that does n't like crowds of people walking around .
Human life has changed a lot in recent years , and it seems that this will happen faster every day . Technology advances and the changes in our way of thinking are adapting to a different kind of people with each human generation .
Technology advances way too fast and it is really difficult to guess what kind of stuff or artefacts there will be fifty years from now , but we can guess some ideas , like flying cars , smartphones the size of a small piece of paper , really thin laptops like a quarter of an inch , clothes that clean themselves or change color and shape , healthier food , smarter domestic appliances .
All this will help people to live easily , but only to have more time to work , because the type of mind that reigns in that time will focus on companies and making money and spending it . This is the reason why a lot of jobs are changing to home offices and the firms are giving more and more facilities for their employees to be more efficient .
Finally , the kind of life that we will see in fifty years from now will have a lot of stuff to help people to have a more comfortable , easier and faster way of life , but this will be only to make more money and consume more and more . Also , things will be faster of waste to make people change their possessions more often and stimulate consumerism .
Nowadays , an increasing number of people are concerned about the phenomenon of farmland , forest and wetland disappearing because of some long - term human activities , for instance housing and transport networks are built , destroying the balance of the environment .
Firstly , it is clear that more houses and transport networks are convenient for our people . What is known to us is that the population growth is a big problem which creates a need for more space for living in .
And building more transport networks is also a benefit for us , for example , the high - speed rail can shorten the time spent on traveling , while the animals may not welcome it .
In order to command the psychology of the user , it was necessary for me to know the new trends in UI
Therefore , with a good UI design , many people will have a good user experience .
A good user experience will be good for collecting data and be good for making decisions in commerce .
She was very shy , sensitive and embarrassed .
She moved to Kyiv , graduated from university , and started to work .
He was everything to her .
I took this time to command people who sacrifice their entire lives for the betterment of sportsmanship .
And also have my favorite players , Ronaldinho , Messi and Eto'o .
I know football does n't go by sentiments but the love of choice and what desire you the best .
They always buy talented players that will make the club improve tactically . People always say this ; " Barcelona does n't buy players " , it 's not like they lack money .
We do essential purchasing of players to save more money .
As normal human beings , you have to know how to spend money , where , when to spend it . It 's not because you have more money then you lavish it .
I am writing about the international sports monthly magazine I have seen .
I enjoy this sport because it is comfortable and elegant and you never hurt yourself badly .
Furthermore , you also have a lot more confidence in yourself .
Most people who play tennis are always ready and proud of themselves .
My favourite sport at the moment is walking , and I prefer walking in the morning and before sundown .
I also like walking in public streets , gardens , clubs and on the shore . When I want to go anywhere , I do my best to go on foot .
It would be interesting to accompany your best friend or your beloved to enjoy your time .
I advise any people who suffer from laziness and obesity to try to walk for at least one hour and after that they will like this sport .
But we have concrete examples , which we should follow and which already demonstrate that nothing is impossible
, like Nadia Comaneci or Gica Hagi . They are two people who succeeded in their sport but with perseverance and ambition .
They are passionate about what they do . More specifically , those people are in love with their job .
In conclusion , I do n't have a favorite sport . I like to do a little of everything and I do n't refuse anything .
Her parents , within half an hour of the training 's end , became worried .
The investigations were concentrated above all on the construction site of Mapello .
Three month after her disappearance , she was found dead in the stream .
Definitely , public transportation does n't have any future .
A good proportion of the population prefer to buy a car to go to school , the workplace , church in a faster and more comfortable way .
Probably the only opportunity to change this will be to mention to people the opportunity to save energy and reduce the environmental pollution if we use public transportation .
Television has many advantages .
It not only entertains , but also educates .
There are many educational programmes which we can get benefits from .
Football is the most popular sport followed in Italy and in Europe . In fact , there are some important tournaments in which all important European teams participate . They are called the " Champions League " and the " Europa League " . Football is a team sport . In fact , everybody participates in this sport without excluding anybody .
People start to play football on a regular pitch . After some time , they will be tired , but it is normal because their muscles are not strong enough for running around the pitch many times .
That day , I had just finished helping a younger student to understand his math lesson . My friend Michael asked me to do the same and to give her an answer sheet for all the final exams . I was shocked that she wanted that from me . Anyway , I gathered up my courage and told her that was wrong and become to do that in college Better to start studying now and I 'd help her to study the hard lessons ( I was very sad to say no & that she asked me that ) . She became very angry and told me I should help her because we she was my best friend . Then I told her why I had told her NO and she said " I hate you . "
Pollution as a problem in the environment
Years ago , pollution was not a big problem to deal with .
Technology was not as advanced as it is now , so the amount of waste was small .
Nowadays , pollution is a problem that we have to solve before it gets worse .
We should find new alternatives for getting around in our routines .
Rivers and seas are victims of modernization .
The government should introduce a new law to correct this damage .
As we can see , modernization is causing damage to rivers and seas .
In my opinion , pollution is a problem in the entire world , not only in modern countries , so we should try to recycle more . Any kind of help is necessary .
Dear Grandmother ,
While you are with me , you will do curriculum vitae and then we will travel around my country and we will become good workers .
This idea is fantastic , although it will be very complicated .
I was really comfortable in my bed and I could n't believe that someone had interrupted my calm .
I discovered Pilates 2 years ago and began with an old Bejar dancer .
He took time to explain each movement and made me understand the concept .
If I could give advice to new practitioners of Pilates , it would be to read a book about this method and to take time choosing a good teacher .
A few years ago I took part in a programme called Christmas Drama .
In my school days , I did not participate in any programme , even sports .
Because school teachers never encouraged me to participate .
If they had told me to attend compulsorily I would have done so without any hesitation .
While I am in ANDRAPRADESH every year , we have a Christmas function in December . Although we are not interested in attending Drama , they would not let us not play even a simple character .
They gave me the part of THE GOD . At first I was n't aware of how to act and play this particular character .
And from October to December we practised every day after our study hour until eleven " O"CLOCK . DAY BY DAY I learnt and finally I played my role well .
Personally , I believe that those who do not participate in any activities should be encouraged to do so by teachers .Only then will they also know how talented they are .
I did n't use to believe that people would do anything for advantage , even betray family and friends .
I strongly believed people would rather have love in their heart than anything .
My family live in the city center of Madrid but I do n't like living there because it is noisy and there is pollution , so I decided to move to the countryside two years ago .
I saw the job advertisement in the local newspaper .
To start with , I would like to tell you that I have studied gastronomy at the Instituto Crandon , one of the most recognised institutes in Uruguay . Also , I have just finished a sports and health course at the Universidad de la Republica , on which I learned to work with people of all ages in the sports area .
These include many kinds of sports , such as wrestling , basketball , tennis , running , etc .
My favourite sports are basketball and martial arts .
First , basketball is a team sport , which means I need to understand the expressions of members of the team and keep in contact them . For example , my role is cutter but I need to do assister , blocker and guard when I play .
It is not just fighting . These sports give people endurance , speed and power .
In particular , I like karate and Kung - fu .
These 2 sports improve basic human ability to reach the highest capability possible .
I suggest to other people to first understand yourself , such as what you like , what is possible , and then practice after every success .
They use a bat and a shuttlecock , which is like a bird 's feather .
According to this form , we know learning knowledge takes a lot of time in one day .
In my awareness , I know the United States advocates free - style study and self - learning , so aside from study , they have diverse selections .
The lack of sleep often makes me unable to concentrate in class .
First , I want to say that people 's lives will change in the future , because the new technologies will change the lives of people .
I think this because the new technologies are created by people to improve our habits .
On the other hand , people make other inventions to improve the world and reduce pollution . For example , at this time we have created electric cars and organic food . These things will be very useful in the future , because we will need to reduce pollution .
Also , people will need to improve medicine to cure diseases and , for this , people need to create more inventions to resolve these problems .
The doorbell rang again and he opened the door again . His sister was with him and she was very scared , but there was nobody at the door again .... and this time , the noise at the top of the stairs was loader and he understood everything .
And just as I was becoming a professional football player , my right knee was injured .
It is not always easy for me to speak in another language constantly .
I am blonde ,
I am now studying Software Engineering .
Web Programming with my boyfriend .
I hate eating vegetables and I love eating chips .
Well , as you asked me Jenny , the most brilliant actor that I 've ever seen is Vin Deasel . He is an excellent professional and he starred in a great number of movies , like the saga of Fast and Furious , Ridic , Nannies , Bulletproof and other excellent films .
This is one of my favourite actors , because , when he is recording a film , he assumes his role passionately and that is really important for a good actor .
Another of my favourites is Will Smith . He appeared in the well - known film , Men in Black and other excellent films like I am Legend .
He is , for me and many people , an excellent actor because his personality is extroverted .
So Jenny , these are my two favourites film stars .
This topic is controversial these days . Should everyone take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university ?
A good percentage of people think that everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college .
Or the student can simply spend this time travelling .
It is better to finish studying first , then go to work or have relaxation with travel .
In my opinion , it greatly depends on an individual 's financial situation .
or you just have what is essential for education and university fees .
The technology and industry are developing very fast , so public transport has no future .
It must be Interesting that the development of transport even fits the times .
Congratulations on your wedding . I hope you will be as happy as you are now your whole life .
Anyway , congratulations to you and Jenny again .
For this sport , it is necessary to drink water , and eat fruit , vegetables and pasta .
Thank you for showing interest in my village 's concern about the environment .
The town , Lahori , is known for its practices to preserve nature . In our town , we conduct monthly meetings concerning waste management , as well as pesticides .
We are very appreciative of Dr. Manjot Baqri , who has taken it upon himself to lead these meetings and educate our village on health problems associated with improper disposal of waste . The village has dug pits to dispose of waste .
When you drive you must take precautions at all times because if you do n't you can cause an accident .
Some disadvantages are that you may not have the money to maintain a car , and always remember that the car should give you a service and not you to it , which is why you always keep it in line with the engine , so you do not fail .
One day I visited my friend Jimmy in New York city . He was a young man who was an expert on trains and tourism . He talked about how citizens and commuters move from one place to another . He told me that Grand Central Station was the largest terminus in the city . He showed me where the landmarks of the Big Apple were so sightseers could go there . He showed me the city and we went to different parts . First he took me to Columbus Circle in the south west corner of Central Park where there were the most expensive apartments . Then we went to the lake where the jogging tracks that circle the lake are popular with early - morning visitors . Then we went to the Museum of Natural History that was located near the Metropolitan Museum of Art . Then I got focal on the subway trains , so we went to Grand Central Station . When we arrived , I was amazed to see a lot of people going to work , so he told me that it was convenient for people to use the train because it is very fast and for the government it was a great economic business . Then he told me that one of the characteristics of
In the era of technological advancement , everything goes beyond one 's expectations .
There are mobile phones which have face - to - face communication , and transportation driven by solar energy .
In addition , the transportation system which is developing day - by - day performs in the most convenient and the fastest way it can .
Even though the personal car is used more and more because of its convenience , in my opinion , unstoppable transportation development will cause public transport to be more popular than travelling by car .
The number of people in the world is continually increasing .
Imagine if everyone had private cars . Would we walk on the top of the car to meet our neighbour next door ?
Therefore , public transportation is deemed important to reducing congestion on the road ; the traffic .
In the first paragraph , I wrote that transportation development will never lose place for public transport .
Secondly , public transport proves itself to be more functional and helps support people .
For example , comfortable seats , system support for the handicapped or physical disability , time capture that helps people to know the fixed time when the bus will come , as well as security support that helps people to be more confident to travel .
Lastly , public transportation makes you sure to arrive on time .
Taking into account all this , public transport is much more useful and convenient , both for individuals and for businesses .
Similarly , summer vacation gives us more time to do meaningful things .
Only by constantly following my daily routine can I learn more information and become stronger .
In important meetings like the UN General Assembly or G77 , many leaders of powerful countries raise environmental problems as the most concerning problem in their internal policies .
Disasters in the environment not only cause many problems for humans but also to all the diversity of life .
Firstly , I sometimes use my mom 's bicycle to go to university , taking part in reducing the carbon dioxide emissions from my car .
Riding a bicycle is also a kind of eco - friendly mode of transportation .
Next step , I reduce using some of the cosmetic products that contribute to or are made from materials that cause the greenhouse effect .
There are also many related products which harm the environment .
Last week I saw a bike trip to the countryside and how about registering for that ?
I am interested in the vacancy in your cafe .
In your advertisement , you said that you need a person who can work at weekends in your cafe .
I was working in ABC restaurant until last year .
For more information about my qualifications please see the attachment .
In conclusion , Counter Strike is the best game in the world .
I went to the Vatican and Rome . I saw their massive buildings , which were impressive , and their old houses .
One of my passions in this world is helping people , any kind of people ; old , disabled , poor people and kids .
I currently work with children with disabilities and I love it !
I 'm good at improvising games for children , and I 'm a good cook too .
If you only give me the opportunity to work for the camp , I will not disappoint you .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Today is the big day , the day of his presentation about acid rain and its consequences on the environment .
Peter did a beautiful presentation and now his mother is very proud .
Health is an important part of our lives , so our priority in our city is the environment , and people consider keeping our environment clean and work together for the preservation of the environment .
Therefore , the municipality put in place regulations and instructions to take care of our village .
Firstly , organizing collecting garbage . for example , red box for medical rubbish , because it is dangerous , it is toxic materials , yellow box for plastic , white box for glass , and pink box for other trash .
This facilitates classification of garbage and transfers each sort of rubbish to a specific place .
Secondly , recycling waste . After collecting it , they then transport it to factories to recycle it into useful materials we can use again in all aspects of our lives .
Lastly , workshops about conservation of the environment to increase environmental awareness among people , to encourage them to take care of their city , and teach them how they can recycle some rubbish to make useful objects to use at home .
In addition , many residents in our town have launched initiatives which target cleaning up our village , and planting a lot of trees on the streets to keep the environment clean and protect our generation from pollution . In addition , to attract tourists to visit us . As a consequence , increasing the number of visitors to our town , and reducing pollution which causes various diseases .
Furthermore , this saves on the cost of treatment because of the decreasing number of patients .
In conclusion , we look forward to our village being free from pollution and keeping our health and enjoying fresh air where our children will grow up .
To achieve his goal , he trained a lot with one of his colleagues and he gave no importance to the judgements that people had about him and his ambitious desire for victory .
Either way , he had an enemy who was trying to extinguish his love of running and get him out of the competition .
At the end , he continues running . Thanks to this , he achieved his goals .

In conclusion , the internet is making things better and easier ; life now is always connected to the Internet .

I have liked swimming since I was young , and when I grew up , I told my mum that I wanted to compete in competitions .
The first time , it 's difficult , like any other sport , because you do n't know and you have to improve by yourself , but if you like it , you will find it fascinating .
Also , I remember my first competitions . I did n't win . I came 4th , but I was n't sad because I thought that the next time I would do my best and probably I would win .
Last year I won the national competition in my country and that makes me feel so good , because it 's all I want .
These days , almost 80% of people have assured feel concerned about their bodies and their diet . Because of this , they promised me that they will try to improve their daily diet and they will do sport more frequently .
In Tampico City the most important landmarks are the squares in Tampico . The best shopping centres are mall Altama ubicate in Tampico center and the beach Madero . The most important parks are Carpenter 's lagoon and my favorite restaurant is Child 's in mall Altama .
In conclusion , I 'd like to offer my help if anything is necessary .
Myths and fables are always my favorite types of stories , because they can either be easy to understand or extend to deeper matters .
Sometimes it is interesting to know a story by discovering its background first , is n't it ?
Amount of tradition and legend nowadays somewhat refers its context , such as Homer 's " Odyssey " , the flood mentioned in the Bible , and especially Mesopotamian civilization .
Therefore , I am trying to find out more information about " The Epic of Gilgamesh " in order to understand it completely .
In conclusion , I hope that Riyadh city will be more interested in traffic jams .
If the government pays attention to improving the streets , decreases the use of cars , provides other transportation , and controls traffic jams by using police , Riyadh will become a great city so the people wo n't worry about going out .
My name is Andreia . I am 27 years old . I am a very friendly person and I have experience in this area .
Last summer , I worked with children aged 10 years old for a month and I organised some activities on the beach , such as football games and gym classes .
I like cooking very much and I think that there are some activities that we could do in the kitchen , like baking cookies or making fresh bread .
For another think I can speak English very well , because I studied English at university although I am Portuguese .
I hope you consider my application and contact me ,
In the future , this tendency will continue and there will be more and more specific social networking sites between business and personal life .
In order for this to happen , looking out for new social networking sites designed for our particular goals .
Taking the place of general networks like you find on Facebook , you will find sites are specializing and aimed at individuals , businesses and society .
Using cars to fulfill our transportation needs within the city limits is a very good option for many of us . However , the necessity of travelling overseas or even outside of our suburban areas might require a different sort of transportation . Therefore , this is where public transportation should be focussed since long trips taking longer than a simple commute in the city would require it .
It has been a popular American tradition for many years now , since the mid-60s that we all use cars owned by private parties in order to meet our needs . Hence , it has been considered the " modus operandi " ever since .
A new thinking might help to address this issue : transportation itself , perhaps , is in need of evolution . That might be the use of public transportation , it has proven to be the best means to get to places the roads and geographical areas of which might happen to be unknown to the traveller .
You can see modern clothes while you eat in a restaurant and you can take photos of TV stars , because they shop in this shopping center and you feel like a star , because you see a famous person and you think that you are in a film .
The plot of the movie is set in a small town where everything has its own eyes and because of that you must be aware of your behaviour .
What I liked most was that you think you know what is going to happen , but to your surprise , it always turns out to be something unexpected .
Despite the fact that there is n't any Hollywood star , all the characters are played very believably and some scenes wo n't let you sleep .
Sometimes I felt that the background songs did n't match with what was happening , but after all you are in expectations of next step so you would n't mind it .
I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see unpredictable situations happening and likes the feeling of the unknown .
In toward to the modernization of life and technology , people believe in different perspectives of their way of life , but the majority of ones are totally utopian .
Everyone wants particular objects and individual life , as an egoistic human being . However , the real world hasn't got the capacity to support these ideas .
Actually , we have a lot of problems with traffic : lots of carriages on the railway and they are n't running ; the number of cars in the street causes pollution ; crowded railways cause a late arrival .
We discover , in this context , special diseases caused by traffic : stress , violence , pollution , lack of safety , and so on .
If public transport were of higher quality , faster and with lower fares , the majority of citizens would prefer it : it is calmer to relax and read a newspaper or a magazine during the journey on mass transport than in individual transport ; moreover , the time spent to go and come back would be reduced , because it promotes fewer carriages on the railway .
Thus , in the future , public transport will be more attractive than private and individual transport .
It has both advantages and disadvantages .
Also , the possibility of learning at home is a big advantage , especially for people who prefer peace and silence .
Then it 's better to concentrate on learning and we do n't feel any pressure or stress connected with questions and tests .
On the other hand , learning on the internet in the long term we could feel bored or lonely . School gives opportunities for learning in groups when students can help each other and solve problems .
Another disadvantage of learning on the Internet can be problems with the Internet connection .

When I was young , I enjoyed playing basketball .
It taught me the meaning of teamwork and leadership .
I kept playing basketball continuously for 4 years , till I went to secondary school .
My advice to anyone starting basketball is to never give up and always keep playing till the last minute .
Relationships can be very different .
Our family are people who will love us , and who do n't look at situations and who we are .
Television and other things invented by technology are part of our lives .
I think every family has got a television in their own home and , for example , I have 4 televisions in mine .
For me , television has advantages and disadvantages .
There are a lot of interesting TV programs where we can learn something and there are also intriguing television programs .
These are advantages , but we can also have disadvantages from them .
For example , we can become addicted to our television .
In general , I think our technology is not the best thing for our health and TV and other similar things are responsible for our problems with health and eyesight .
So , television has positive and negative aspects and it 's up to us how to behave with it .
I like cricket . It is the best of all the sports . Cricket is a good mind - refreshing game .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He picked up the phone and dialled the number of his girlfriend , Lisa .

I live in the beautiful city of Siena , which is famous for its landscapes .
The museum of the Duomo is the best tourist attraction .
One of her favourite things to do is drawing . She has lots and lots of special pens , crayons , highlighters , paint .... As you see , she is good at drawing .
But when I understood how much happiness this game gives me , I started more running and training .
Before starting to talk about the members of my family and if they are my best friends or not , I just want to say that my family is the thing I love most in my life . I respect them , appreciate them also , and I think they are the best thing in my life .
Finally I want to talk about my cousins . I love most of them , especially the cousins of the same age . They are my friends . I love them so much , and also the rest of my family .
I would like to inform about correction of my family name in the result sheet .
My family name is WONGWATJANAKUL but the result sheet is WONGWATJANAKAKUL , which is incorrect .
Could you please correct my family name .
Sport is very important for our bodies . It has many benefits to improve ourselves and give us self - confidence , so we should practise any sport we love because it can change our minds for the better .
Look for a sport to make you feel good and your brain will always be refreshed , so that you can begin your day with any sport to make fresh and after that you can do any job with a refreshed mind .
When he was just about crossing the finishing line , he got hurt and his muscles were dying and started to peel off a black matter . At that point , the guys in suits thought that he would n't be able to cross the line , but when they saw that he kept running . They froze the time and ran after him . He stopped for a moment , but then he started running again and when he crossed the line he woke up in a red somber fluid . He was wiped from the matrix . He opened his eyes and saw a flying robot , suddenly he was in a wooden wheelchair and they said that he would never be able to walk again . Despite that , he stood up and tried to walk again .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I like this game very much . It is a very useful game . It helps me to keep fit . I started playing basketball many years ago . I want to be a very famous basketball player .
basketball needs a person to be tall enough to play it . I like basketball because it makes me happy , fit , gives me self - confidence and makes me active . If someone wants to play basketball , he should do a lot of exercises and try to be able to play it , because everything is difficult at first , but he should n't give up .
The island was flooded but the island had a levee that prevented flooding . Then after many years , an engineer started constructing a building to have more money than in the city . He put many advertisements on all things : balls , balloons , movies , etc .
The engineers needed help to construct the building . They called a professional to see what was wrong .
Then the professional said that the island has expose with the ocean .
Then the engineers called another sector to ensure the doubt about Atlantis . Then the professional said that the other professional was correct .
Then they drank a coffee that give them a lot of energy to construct the building faster . This coffee has an ingredient so that people can live all night .
But the engineer ignored this situation . Then a helicopter came to save the residents .
This helicopter had humid .Then the helicopter started to rotate in the whole island . Then the helicopter sank in the water . Then the hurricane ended and the engineers started to distribute food and medicine .
Then the engineers discovered that the eye of the hurricane was widespread all over the island and that the island was a hemisphere . Then in the city , qualify to the people that work in this building .
When I started to study here in Australia , I found the difference in curriculum compared to my home country .
In my home country , when I was at university , it has quite easy for me to follow the educational policies .
The learning style is a traditional learning style that is usual in my country .
In addition , the type of examination is more on memorization , that I can use my own language that help me to understand it easier .
" In particular , many international students are too teacher dependent and uncritical of material that have been thought , prone to role memorization , they misunderstand the cardinal sin of plagiarism , and lack knowledge of the genres of academic writing " .
The academic style is more about critical thinking , and it is hard to cope , because I need to understand it using their language .
Clearly , multiple factors have had major influences on the nature of the student population attending universities and how this shift affects , and is affected by , university policy and practiced are important issues .
As an international learner , I embraced these changes in my learning strategies , primarily because these new learning strategies of academic style are important for my future course .
It has challenged me to adapt to a universal approach to the learning style back in my country .
It 's a bookseller called " A droga da obediência " whose author is Brazilian .
The story is about five friends that begin investigating drug trafficking happening inside a school .
However , one friend disappears , then the four friends decide to discover where he is .
The moral is about students not being naïve and being careful of unscrupulous men that sell drugs .
In Poland we have a lot of interesting places to visit .
Poland is an amazing and interesting country .
If you have experience of cooking , you will be the right person for this job .
However , I think that it is not an easy thing to achieve because of the limited information about scholarships .
In addition , I work as a civil servant who should follow the government rules .
Actually , I do n't give up and always look for opportunities .
In other words , it can change our paradigm and mindset to better perspectives .
In the broader capacity , it can help my nation 's position in the world .
Everything is possible as long as we make an effort .
Travelling is an essential in everybody 's life .
Although the number of cars is increasing day by day , most people travel via public transport . Their limited income restricts their ability to buy cars .
Also , the main drawback of cars is environmental pollution .
Therefore , public transport has its own importance .
In order to avoid environmental pollution , people should use public transport . That will not only help to reduce the pollution , but also the extra expenditure on petrol .
The government should focus on the improvement of public transport and must discourage individual cars .
It 's always great to hear from you and I hope that everything is going well .
In my country , weddings are celebrated from Spring to Autumn .
My advice for finding work is a bit complicated because , nowadays , there are a lot of people without work .
This restaurant had received many awards in China before it opened in Jakarta .
The building of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if you compare it with the other restaurants in PIK .
Besides that , the public room is also clean and comfortable , but I recommend you to choose the private room to accommodate our farewell dinner .
Huang Ji Huang specialize in a stew pots menu , which will allow you to enjoy authentic Chinese food .
You can order a set menu that Huang Ji Huang offers or you can also choose the ingredients that you want for your stew pot , but you must choose 3 to 5 ingredients .
Mala Sauce is a spicy flavor and it is very authentic and you will rarely find this taste in another restaurant .
Every month , Huang Ji Huang always have a special offer for their customers , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give a 20% discount to customers who spend 500 IDR or more , for complete information you can check on the website or call the restaurant .
And I highly recommend you to make a reservation first if you decide to hold our dinner here , because this place is always crowded and we also need a private room .
And also we could n't choose programmes .
I guess every child wants to investigate the world .
Moreover , they think that controlling pollution is possible .
These kinds of weapons do not kill one or ten , but destroy a large town completely .
In my opinion , using nuclear power is important for the great development in human life . Countries have to establish this energy and other sources to secure power for people .
Yesterday , I was surfing the Internet and found an amazing site www.bargainstime.com .
There were so many trendy clothes at attractive prices .
Immediately , I did some shopping there . I bought a pair of skinny blue jeans and a tight black dress .
In 2009 , Michel lived in New York with his girlfriend , Ann , in their own apartment .
Everything was organized .
Ann decided that she 'd try on her wedding dress
Another reason why travel by plane is my favourite is because it is more comfortable to sleep unless you have a loud person close to you .
A VERY GOOD RESTAURANT WHOSE SPECIALITY IS " TAPAS "
You can eat small pieces of different dishes and have dinner or lunch inexpensively .
For more than thirty years , in Nerja has been openend every day " Big Fish " , a traditional restaurant with the typical cuisine of the coast of Málaga .
This restaurant only has one little problem .
The rest of the dining room is exclusively for eating meals .
Discussions about genetic manipulation become heavy when a specific area is mentioned : genetically modified food or GM food .
For several decades , the population has been discussing arguments for and against GM food .
Improving human nutrition and agriculatural conditions are arguments of those who are in favour of manipulation .
In conclusion , we can see that sales went up every time except the third quarter when they were unchanged .
I enjoy playing it , particularly because it is a competitive sport and because you play with a team and not alone , and this , for me , is really important .
Some people think that football is a bad thing because the footballers are all stupid and the fans are all violent and disrespectful , but it is n't like that .
OK , there are some fans who are n't good people , but the major football associations are trying to stop them and to abolish all bad things in football .
Like every year , on the twenty - third of April , the day of the book , in my school all the students in the fifth and sixth years of primary school do a short story competition and the winner gets a prize .
The prizes are usually a book and a ticket to the theme park in Madrid , and the children who have participated win a book .
I think my town really takes care of the environment , because there are a lot of parks in this town and they are very clean .
However , some people do not care about the environment . That means some people throw garbage away in the park .
I think after eating something in the park cleaning up after themselves is good .
However , not everyone does that , so how much the public authorities care about the environment is important and this town cares about that a lot .
Every morning , some people come the to park and clean . up That makes us feel really grateful .
When I am walking around here I can see a lot of beautiful gardens and the roads are clean , so I think many people care about the town as well .
There are many sports grounds , for example , tennis courts , football pitches and play equipment for children , so I think my town takes care of the environment . That means everyone will be able to the in be best condition in both mind and body a for long time .
The town has to do that and I think in England there are so many green areas all around , so a lot of people take care of these and that creates a good environment .
This movie is based quote unquote on a " true story " , but obviously director Michael bay known for the transformers franchise puts a lot of Hollywood into this movie . It 's about a bodybuilder named Daniel Lugo who decides to kidnap a rich guy and make him sign away all of his property , which obviously is not a great plan that backfires on him , and eventually the police get him .
It 's a great funny movie , especially for someone like me who enjoys going to the gym and lifting some weights .
To get to Big Ben , we took the underground , but to get to the London Eye , a red bus .
My favourite sport is volleyball .
I play it with my friends .
Generally , sports are growing our minds continuously .
I do n't find any difficulty doing it .
My favourite sport is basketball .
Usually I only play basketball at school .
Do you know why I enjoy my sport ? I will tell you why . Because when you play you have fun and interested .
It is very difficult to deny the importance of family in our lives . Families definitely play an essential role in society . According to the experts , we ca n't create a successful society without creative families , and another specific part of our lives is good partners surrounding our daily activities .
One of the main advantages of family is the recognition you are given at a specific age . Children require special attention to grow up well , and that can only be given by family . For instance , homeless children are more likely to fail in their education or job and not adapt to society .
Consequently , they probably fail to experience from their lives .
Moreover , families play an essential part in protecting their members from bad atmosphere , and it probably reflects on their performance toward country , leading to effective , creative and useful civilians .
At the end , the intruders turn out to be ghosts that
Public transportation
I think nowadays it is more common that people use their car for their normal activities , but the statement that there is no future for public transportation it is not completely true . I think that a lot of people use public transportation because it is cheaper and some people do n't have enough money to buy a car .
Another reason is that , here in Mexico , in some cities , you ca n't use your car on specific days , so if you do not have another car , you have to use public transportation .
Well , my college has an organization called Enactus .
I 'm a member of it and its goal is to improve the positivity of our society by setting up projects that serve many people who really need our help .
We entered 2 national competitions in 2 years and won second place for one of our projects and gained 2 leagues for other ones .
We made our university proud , plus we helped people .
Now , there are over 180 members in this organization and the number is increasing .
We need more of this type of organization across the world and there are a lot of students ready to help and wishing for a chance to make our society a better place .
Does why , it is easy to believe that if things continue at this pace and transforming everything , in the near future , in 50 years , everything is going to be completely new and different .
In the past , people used to live in the moment without concern about the future .
The lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future .
Because of that , everything was kind of similar and static for many years .
But then industrialization came and , with that , technology , so ways of life started to change and everything started to go faster .
As I said before , because of technology , many things have become possible in less time , and with the passage of the years , this has tended to increase .
For example , sharing knowledge and experiences means that everybody can do or apply things and develop faster .
It also means that research can be shared easily or , for example , you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as well , so you can react faster and make some changes .
Another example of why lives are going to change completely in 50 years is because , also , that connection with other cultures makes people more concerned about their own health , their expectations of life and the way they want to live it , because every day it will be easier to see how much we are hurting the earth , so we will see faster the impacts that this has on our lives .
Last but not least , family perception , has been changed and for that time everything will be different because it will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kids .
I studied in Kuwaiti schools . After that I went to Damascus university , the faculty of human medicine . I graduated from it in 2008 with a very good grade , then I got the Master 's degree in laboratory medicine from the same university ( Ministry of Higher Education ) in 2013 with an Excellent grade .
Now I 'm working in voluntary positions , like translation , editing in Wikipedia & others .
This premonition can not hold more true .
Traveling on public transport can be cumbersome and quite eventful .
You get the convenience of traveling at your own pace and stopping when you please .
This suggestion is controversial .
On the one hand , society is becoming increasingly fat and some kinds of warnings could be useful to remind them to eat healthily .
The companies who produce products with harmful ingredients are very powerful , so that this suggestion is very hard to enforce .
The aim of this report is to provide an assessment to relocate the current campus canteen to a location that would be more accessible for all the students . Hence , it will hopefully prove both the profitability of the canteen and the important role it plays for all the students on the campus .
Suddenly he understands that he has heard a noise so he decides to stay in the cave away from danger .
He decided to take the penknife that he had in his bag , and he was successful in killing the bird of prey .
After two long days , Jonas gets home safe and sound and tells everything about his experience .
As all of us know , today 's generation prefers everything to be their own .
It will automatically diminish its presence .
As our country is developing , there will be a time when each and every individual will be self - reliant and will definitely prefer having their own vehicle to commuting from one place to the other .
The police came with a big investigation .
the investigation accused them and investigate prison .
television serves the dual purposes of entertaining and educating people . In order to cope with the competitive world and get recognized in the corporate world , one must strive hard , which in turn increases their stress levels .
Television has become one of the means to reduce stress levels . Besides providing entertainment , television has also become a source of information .
I have applied to your University and I am still waiting for an answer .
Also , I have not had an invitation to an interview yet .
I am sorry if I have not understood your previous e - mails .
Well , I 'm Sebastian Vega and I 'm studying engineering sustainable development .
Nowadays , public transport is hardly necessary to our life .
However , a lot of cities have a problem with traffic because of this . The problem is that citizens do n't use public transport , such as buses , taxis , or even the metro .
Consequently , gorvernment has started to support and take care of public transport .
How can we revive public transport ?
People are unpleasant because all of is is bad quality , so governments ought to update it with new technology which protects the environment .
Restaurant review
This restaurant is excellent !
They wear black and white clothing like the decoration of the establishment .
The atmosphere is very friendly .
This restaurant would be the best for our class .
The best place for young people in our area is without doubt the countryside with the lake .
In the summer around the lake there are so many concerts so you have difficulty finding the right one .
Nowadays , there is very little public transport . The general public prefer much faster and more convenient ways of traveling around . Though public transport is used in major cities to avoid traffic congestion , it is widely recognized that public transport is eco - friendly .
Some public transport like trains do not pollute as much as cars or motorbikes .
Many people say that public transport is not comfortable . That 's true . From my point of view , a bus is not so uncomfortable .
Many people like travelling by car , but it pollutes a lot more than going by public transport . Public transport is cheaper than buying a car or motorbike , it also pollutes less than them .
Finally , I think public transport has a very good future , because it has very good advantages but also some slight disadvantages . It 's also very useful for some people .
In the evening , I would like to spend some time with those kids by organising some indoor and outdoor games for them .
I would feel more energetic throughout the day If I had some busy or tight - scheduled work . I came across your advertisement for this job and I really think that I would suit this job in every respect , because I have a friendly rapport with people around me . I would be pleased to receive your positive reply .
My town tries to take care of the environment , but sometimes it is not possible .
Some people do n't have any awareness of the need for a good environment .
However , that is n't protected by the government and its institutions .
Local Parliament haven't regulated principles or rules for the environment , so ecosystems have been destroyed , rivers are contaminated and pollution has increased in my town .
Besides , my town 's institutions have allowed some foreign enterprises or corporations to take our own resources without demanding that they be careful with the environment .
This is clearly a symptom of how my town does n't care about any element of the environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade , some neighborhoods have become conscious of their context .
In this way , we can see that their population have so much control and they know that affects them .
Good management of the rubbish is a new trend in many neighborhoods of my town .
The recycling of plastic , paper , cardboard etc , by the population of the biggest neighborhoods in my town is a way to improve the environment .
In my opinion , this sport teaches us to be mature , because , in addition to setting up the person physically , it instructs the mind .
Most people prefer large colleges to small colleges for their many advantages .
In addition , they have a lot of facilities that serve students , like kindergartens that take care of the children of the employees , university housing , a hospital the students of medicine can be application in and it serves the people too , and a big library which has many books in various languages .
Besides that , they have some services like transport for students and faculty , some restaurants , and a mini - market .
In addition , the location of large a college is clear and in the center of the city , so that is it easily accessible .
In the end , large colleges admit larger numbers of students , so the students may establish more friendships with people of different nationalities . Also they serve the community by qualifying many students in various majors .
He rushed from his bed to the street and walked to his way to see what he did every morning . When he was walking after the strange man , he noticed that he stopped at every trash can in the street to take a look before going to the next one . And , guess what ? He saw Michael and ran away and Michael was afraid .
We visited the Tower of London , Buckingham Palace and the wax museum .
The organisation has reached its current position because of people like you .
We are looking forward to seeing your participation in the Organisation after six months .
My favorite sport is basketball .
Almost every weekend , I go to the playground to play basketball with my classmates .
I am quite interested in how the stars are getting on .
Insufficient ESP teaching skills made teachers pull back to general English .
This should also become the ED UMM commitment .
A new substance , called CPH4 , destined to be distributed around Europe and the United States by which a full bag was put into her stomach by illegal clinical surgery .
But everything went out of control for the criminals when one of her captors kicked her in her abdomen . The substance spills through her body and she begins to experience a different state of consciousness in which she dizzily enhanced her IQ from 2% to almost 100% of its capacity .
During this time , she contacts Samuel Norma , PhD , the Professor of a university , to ask him what happens if a person reaches 100% of their mental activity or IQ .
People are getting used to driving their own cars ; it provides more comfort , and is more practical .
The government are opposed to investing in public infrastructure , because the benefits are lower every year .
They prefer to invest in public roads and motorways .
The impact of this has huge consequences for climate change . In the future , the global pollution will increase according to the level of cars .
Travelling by car is very bad .
By using public transport we protect the environment .
On the other hand , public transport pollutes less than the car but the car is very comfortable and not be hour hard .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had to buy a present for his girlfriend 's birthday but it was Sunday and all the stores were closed , so he had to find a solution .
Finally , he had found the present and before the end of the day he ran quickly to his girlfriend 's house .
I think public transport is better for the environment because going by public transport reduces the CO2 emissions and removes traffic from the streets .
It is a true statement about cars . Travelling by car is so much more convenient and the new technologies apply to the
People should eat less fast food and do regular exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle .
Easy availability also tempts us to fast foods .
University education is good for students but they also need to learn industry - specific skills .
New skills like analytics and data management are in demand .
In my opinion , what is expected is a new role for teachers and not their disappearance from classrooms .
At university level , the availability of IT training , software and manuals provides an ever accessible source of information that otherwise would not be to hand .
For example , India has a high rate of unemployment , hunger , poverty which leads to an immense embarrassment about being Indian .
Nowadays , the internet represents the whole of the knowledge that people have collected over the centuries .
So it provides a lot of interesting information , one example of which is about how different machines work , which can be found at www.howstuffworks.com .
Also , the ' internet ' nowadays helps to get information from all over the world , and if you wish to get involved , then go to www.bbc.co.uk . These sites are a free way to find the most relevant information about current events , both in society and technology .
When I arrived at home , I started to read the newspaper , so I found out from there that The International Student Magazine have organized a short story competition , and I decided to call Michael to tell him about this contest .
After I decided to go with him to the contest , I was thinking about going to that contest next year to participate in and win that contest , so this year I was wondering what the program was like .
When we arrived there , the emotions started to appear so definitely it was time to drink a hot coffee , before the contest started .
" Golem " , as we all know , are magical creatures made from mud and having black rocks for eyes which can be brought to life by an incantation .
These days , an increasing number of people try to travel by car for convenience .
There are three main reasons for supporting my idea .
Firstly , for long - distance journeys , the car is not as convenient as airplanes ,
In contrast , travelling by airplane just takes you two hours , and you can get to your destination .
Secondly , owning a car is not a normal thing for most developing or undeveloped countries .
The great number of people using private cars leads to higher levels of air pollution , and public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing air pollution .
Nowadays , public transportation is available almost all around the planet . We can admit that the transport revolution has been plave in the last century , but due to globalization and technological development , the transport sector is always in continuous transformation .
Talking about local transport , we have a lot of choices like cars , motorbikes , buses , trains , but also , as we were saying , planes .
According to the information donne , the most used mode of transport is the car as most families have one , but public transportation is getting more and more common for those who want to preserve the planet and develop other alternatives more respectful of the planet .
As we were saying , the new ecological movement is increasingly more powerful and charismatic . Due to that , bikes are also increasing their role in the new age . They are also linked to the new fashion of being a hipster .
In conclusion , we are seeing a new tend in transport . Increasingly , they are faster and more developed , with the latest technology included , but in contrast , we find also a contradiction , as we found another trend for traditional transport which avoids pollution in order to respect the Earth .
I agree that commuting by car is easier and faster than most public transportation . However , there are serious problems that come from it . The number of vehicles on the roads keeps increasing and causes congestion and pollution , which are far more severe than the inconvenience caused by public transportation .
Thus , I think the future of public transportation will be more prosperous .
Then , if you want , we could go to the restaurant in the city .
If you want , we could go to the capital city of my country . We will go by car because a car is cheaper than the bus or train . We could eat in the famous restaurants of the city or we could go to the cinema . Also , if you want , we could visit the medieval wall .
Mobile phones are the most important thing in our daily lives . They are the most effective method for instantaneous communication .
To begin with , nowadays people are addicted to mobiles . For example , young people waste their valuable time on mobiles .
Moreover , their concentration is reduced .
Another serious problem is people are creating relationships with unknown people , and this can lead to several issues including crimes .
Public transport is generally the transport system provided by the government for the general populace .
Alcoholism is a disease that affects many people in the world today .
Moreover , alcoholics should go to the doctor in order to get well .
In conclusion , alcoholism is a serious problem for all of society .
I 'm a big fan of science fiction movies . Although this kind of movie is actually sometimes a little bad , in the last weeks a new one has been released , and I was totally surprised by this one .
Interstellar is a new Christopher Nolan movie which has the participation of some Hollywood stars , such as Matthew McConaughey , Anne Hathaway and Matt Damon .
Public transport has a big role in transportation especially in large cities like the capital city of countries . Using a car sometimes causes traffic jams if everyone uses their own car . To avoid this , a good road network is needed . Also , the cost of public transportation is lower than private transportation .
On the other hand , public transportation takes more time to get to the required destination , because public transport takes a long route to get to more places and as more people take advantage of it , public transport is usually crowded and is not on time .
For that reason , using your own car is more convenient than public transport . You can travel whenever you like and wherever you want .
On school days , I get up at 5 a.m. and go jogging in my neighbourhood for 15 minutes .
In the rainy season , it is boring to do practice as nobody is on the field .
My favorite sport is basketball .
I know that I am not a professional player and I do n't belong to any team , but I like this game . Basketball is so simple play but it needs speed , concentration and the ability to determine distances . It consists of two teams of five players and each team tries to get a point by throwing the ball through the basket .
What I like most about this game is that the smallest number of players can play it , even two players . I recommend everyone to try it , especially with their friends or family .
Nowadays , people live in a very modern and fast society and try to have as convenient a life as it is possible .
One of the many possibilities for making our lives more convenient is to use cars rather than public transport .
From my point of view , the main disadvantages of public transport , which make our lives uncomfortable , are time and place limitations , sharing the space with others , lack of free seats .
On the other hand , people should think about the environment , pollution , global warming , which are all currently warning .
We should think of a better future and try to be environmentally friendly - try to avoid the huge amount of pollution which is caused by cars and not think only of our comfort .
The next day , I was reluctant to get up and go to class .
I offered an apology out of harm students , but fortunately they did n't get angry with me .
Personally , I agree with your parents .
I think you should save money for the future , because you may have to buy something important with your own money .
In the future , you 'll have to pay a lot of money for university , a new home and so on , and I think you should start saving money . I should do it too , but it 's not easy , actually .
Everything seems so beautiful in the shops !
In fact , in some overdeveloped countries maybe it will disappear , because I suppose travelling by car is much cheaper and faster .
Collecting books is my favourite pastime .
The first item in my collection was an ABC book .
And now , I have a lot of books of all kinds : biology , chemistry , novels , dictionaries , etc .
Whenever I find an interesting book , I buy it immediately .
I classify them into different categories : manual , cookbook , biography , etc .
This is the first text I would like to write on this website . I think it is a good idea to contribute to English language research and improve my skills at the same time .
Public transport is more convenient than cars in many ways . When we use public transport that benefits in many ways .
Travelling by car is convenient but there are disadvantage as well .
As our population is growing fast , in a family both husband and wife are working and children at university are able to drive , so you are looking at at least 3 cars per household , so imagine how busy our roads will be .
Stopping public transport is not going to gain anything , and the impact will be unpredictable .
I think sport is good exercise for people who need to exercise . I have a suggestion for people that want to have good health : choose an interesting sport and try to play it , let it be a regular thing , it will be fun and healthy for your physical constitution .
Michael had just realized that he had n't heard the alarm clock , so he got in a panic immediately : - I ca n't arrive late for work .
He jumped out of bed and had a quick shower . There was no time for breakfast so he decided to buy something to eat near the office .
-Everything is in order , it seems that finally I 'll arrive on time .
Does basketball have the fame that it deserves ?
Nowadays , basketball is the sport which rules in the USA .
90% of Americans want to be a basketball star , with the dream of playing with Lebron James , Pau Gasol , Marc Gasol ...
According to the results of a questionnaire ( Houston inhabitants ) most of them play basketball to forget homework , problems and to relax in their free time .
Also , they think that the main reason for their preference instead of other sports which is more intense .
However they think that basketball is only a reason to meet all the family , friends ...
Furthermore , they give advice to all those novices at basketball " do n't ever lose the passion " , because if they give up , they wo n't play with the biggest players in the world .
In conclusion , the real objective of the questionnaire consists of what the people think about the king sport of the United States of America .
It gives me a sense of achievement . For these reasons , I would like to it do every day .
There is a good restaurant in my town and I think you will like it .
It is a friendly restaurant with a nice menu .
I like the people who serve there and the decoration is pretty .
Public transport has advantages and disadvantages . i will start with the disadvantages .
Public transport is very crowded , so you may not have a seat . I hate public transport because I was attacked by a madman once . also taxi is not a good mode of transport . I hope I have my own car soon to avoid public transport . Travelling in your car makes it easier and better .
The advantages might include that it has a low price and might rescue you if your car is not working .
I am writing with regard to your outsourcing service because I am currently having a problem with my accounted . For this reason , I am looking for a new service that can help me .
I would appreciate it if I could arrange an appointment with you to find out about your service .
I 'm a really sporty person . I love different sports . I think that it 's something that is great for your body and your metabolism , Did you know that doing exercise can reduce depression and increase the quality of your life ?
I think one of my favorite sports of all is athletics . I love it because it is a sport where you prove yourself , you have to be better every day than you were yesterday . It forces you to improve every time . Also , it is an exercise that helps your whole body , especially the legs , because it gives them great strength , but also your hands , because they have to be in constant movement , and all the body in general , because you run and your metabolism is accommodated and helps you to have coordination .
I enjoy running a lot because it relaxes me . I let out all my worries and frustrations , so it makes me happy .
I recommend all people who want to run , if you do n't feel like you 're improving , keep going anyway and with time you will see results .
This is an introduction to how to make bank notes .
The first two step is to design them with background color artwork and security features and prepare metal plates using skilled machinists .
Then there are some requirements for printing sheets : color on both sides , special ink and images slightly raised .
The most essential and key process is manual inspection of printed sheets with three categories : good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets and bad sheets .
The acceptable and not damaged severely sheets are supposed to be packaged and distributed , which means they will be cut into separate bank notes , packed and then dispatched .
When I was a little girl I used to play volleyball and I really liked that .
Today I do not play volleyball anymore , but I really enjoy dancing . Now I can say that it is my favourite , it is all of .
The line graph shows the U.S. cigarette price in dollars related to cigarette consumption in billions of packs from 1970 to 2006 .
The hugest gap is in 1981 , when the cheapest price was combined with the highest expenditure on cigarette packs in the whole interval .
I am very pleased to help organise sports activities .
The world is progressing rapidly . Day by day there are new modes of transportation , there is new technology .
From the beginning of the world till now , mankind has wanted a fast income and an easy way of life , so he tries more and more to find a solution to his problems by creating new ways of living more easily and more conveniently for him .
So , transportation is one of the most important issues facing mankind , because it is related to interaction between people , like trade and many other purposes .
Firstly , I 'd like to talk about jobs . I think that these are the most important thing to worry about . If our studies get better , we will create more jobs and as a result the economic situation of the country will be better .
Moreover , our capacity for learning more languages seems to be really adequate . Unfortunately , while there are a lot of teenagers that are working really hard , there are others that are all the opposite .
Because we were born in ' the internet generation ' as everyone says , so this aspect might be helpful for us .
In conclusion , I 've got to say that now we do n't have to worry about the future , we just have to carry on in the present and do the best we can .
Anyway , I was wondering if you wanted to go to the cinema with me to see the new Leonardo Dicaprio s movie , because I heard that action movies are your favourite .
Nowadays the public transport system is running out of passengers due to heavy use of personal transport such as cars and bikes . In the early 1990s , the public transport systems were the most popular transport system across the world because , most people did not have their own vehicles . But in the late 1990s , most people were able to buy their own vehicle thanks to many financial institutions which have various loan facilities .
Today , many people use their own vehicle instead of public transport . The other thing is , it is an easy and convenient way to travel to work and any other personal work . , therefore , it can be seen that the demand for public transport is getting lower and lower .
In conclusion , it is true that the demand from the public is going down rapidly as they have their own vehicles .
I have seen the following announcement in International Sport Monthly magazine .
I had the opportunity to meet more about this sport .
I would advise you to the person starting the sport endeavor and can fulfill their dream . Many ca n't get what they accomplished . Those players are very famous today .
Some people prefer playing together , but there are also competitions between players .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think that this class discussion ca n't be true .
Providing that we care about the environment .
I 'm looking forward to people having more interest in this case .
He works in real state investment .
My older brother is 30 years old and he is working as an accountant for a radio and television union in Cairo .
The last member is me . I 'm an aeronautical engineer in Qatar .
He is very helpful and collaborator .
The expansion of public transport is one of the keys to saving the planet , especially if the energy source used comes from clean sources .
Nowadays , the use of vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel is the main cause of air pollution in big cities around the world . Research shows that private cars are used , most often carrying a small number of people at a time , which makes it very inefficient considering the quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic substances emitted into the environment each time the engine is started .
From my point of view , the best thing the police can do with these people is send them to a reformatory until they can leave disciplined .
Another good option is to give them a difficult job to keep them busy every day . But I do n't know what kind of job it could be , because a person who commits a crime is n't going to do something to help society , like community service .
The flowchart provides an overview of the steps for making bank notes . It shows how bank notes are manufactured from design to a thing we can use .
First , should take some considerations in design , including background colour , artwork , security issues .
Next , skilled machinists is prepared , in which there are metal plates .
Then the printer will print some sheets into bank notes ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) . Subsequently , the technical must be used specially for distinction , for example , the colour printed on both sides , special ink is used and images are slightly raised .
Depending on the quality of sheets , there will be two results . If the quality is good or the bank note is partially damaged but can be used , it will be cut into separate bank notes , then it is packed and dispatched , while any bad sheets will be securely destroyed .
Describe a supermarket near your home
There are no very big supermarkets near my home , but there is a nice one .
Also , a section for detergents , tissues , perfumes , etc .
You can see some store fridges around the supermarket for drinks and dairy products like milk , yogurt , cheese , butter and cream . Also , chest freezers for ice creams . In one corner , they sell cosmetics and a salesperson helps customers to find what they need .
I can understand how difficult this decision must be .
And I know which subject you 've always been interested in : music .
It is slow , inefficient and dangerous .
Comparing cars and buses , the car is more expensive than the bus , because the car is comfortable and faster .
He had a girlfriend called Sinha , who was a girl with a big heart but , unfortunately , a broken one .
One day , Michael decided to throw a surprise party for Sinha to make her happy and make her feel his love more , so he arranged everything and , to keep it a surprise for her , he was busy all the time and did not show off all week as usual . That made Sinha worried and she suspected that Michael did not love her any more and had met another girl , and she became extremely sad , and it got even worse when Michael asked her to go to his apartment to give her the surprise but he did not answer his phone after that .
When he came she started crying and thought he would break up with her and she did not give him a chance to talk or explain anything . She started to cry louder and accused him of cheating . That made Michael astonished at how she did not trust in him , how she thought that about him , and he told her that he could not stand that anymore , he would break up with her , and he left . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
There 's no question which is my favourite restaurant in town : The Seaside . I will tell you why and also why it 's so appropriate for us , as a class , to have our last farewell dinner there .
Our class has changed over the years , with great classmates leaving and coming . We have always been welcoming , and not least towards the new ones .
It 's not necessary to be nice and kind to everyone , but our class actually is . At the weekends , the whole class gather together at different events .
I think the welcoming process in the beginning is crucial for this fellowship we have today and probably in 10 years too .
What I just said is what the restaurant , Seaside , means to me . Welcoming .
Fellowship .
It all started at the Parson Institute in the art history class . Students of the race of Fine Arts . In the class the teacher in charge , Jimena , assigned a task to his students , saying :
-To begin this course , I want to be sure you know the meaning of art , so I want it translated into a sculpture or painting made by yourselves , without any specific technique , only your imagination , and with this you will explain to me what art is .
After 4 days , they all came with spectacular pictures , portraits of people , large sculptures , apart from one student . Her name was Sandra . She arrived with a piece of crumpled paper , on which she had only written a name in a different style of letter , only there reflected , exposing the moment everyone laughed at her for her work , but the teacher said :
Art is complex , and seeing that everyone laughed at the work of his classmate , I can see that nobody understood the real meaning , since art is different for each person , each creates a different definition , so we must respect each person and understand that each person is a different world and everyone is art .
A student that really moved him , and reflect so apologetic , and went out of the room , closing the door , and Michael knew then that he had made a mistake .
My favorite sport affects me greatly . I 'm a kung - fu fighter .
Everyday I get up early and exercise in the garden with my friends . I exercise more and more to improve myself and become the best fighter in the world . I 'm a champion of my sport , so , I seek to put all my efforts into being the best in the world . Finally I did not have the encouragement of my family or my teachers .
I have to say that studying another language gives you more opportunities , because these days you need to know other languages to find a job and be more intelligent than your colleagues to get the work and that 's great .
And today it is necessary , because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversations with them , you need to know more than your native language , because in the rest of the world , and particularly in Europe , people know more than two languages and that 's great .
These days , most people feel comfortable travelling by car and so they believe that public transport is not going to continue for long .
However , I do not agree with them , because in most parts of the world mass transport systems are still popular and they are environmentally friendly and cost - efficient .
Secondly , public transport is environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicles .
Public buses prevent more cars from polluting the environment .
People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel to the same destination by private vehicle .
In conclusion , although the car is convenient for travelling , it is not enough to being an end to public transportation .
In the towns of the future , care for the environment will be one of the most important things .
People have conciencied themselves that they need to respect nature and the places where we live .
Human beings have destroyed our environment over time , and now the earth is in danger .
I have recently bought an electric car as a substitute for my traditional car .
An electric car is less harmful to the environment .
With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and makes people mature , whilst opponents claim that military service has effects on people 's studies and people should have freedom of choice .
Firstly , every country requires stability and must be protected by strong armed forces for national security .
If a war or other danger threatens the safety of a country they can not get help from other countries immediately .
In particular , some countries with small populations have a policy that people need to do military service to develop into a powerful country .
Secondly , it is important for people to become mature when they complete military service , which probably is a particular experience at 18 years old .
Consequently , people could be more independent and strong . They seem to become mature earlier than other people who do not do military service .
Military service mainly improves physical fitness , but education might be completed better in school at that age because it has a professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere , people usually find it easier to concentrate on learning knowledge .
Additionally , critics argue that countries are able to allow people to have freedom of choice about military service .
Some people are unwilling to do military service , while some people volunteer for military service and possibly enjoy it .
Furthermore , it also can respect rights of people , especially women who are not able to adapt to the hard training .
In conclusion , it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people to improve themselves .
The best course of action would be for government to attempt to allow people to volunteer for it when they have completed their studies .
I really appreciate your encouraging us every time in class .
In our city , we have a billboard to urge people to pay attention to the environment .
In the schools , we set up a workshop to tell students how important the environment is to our lives .
So everyone brings the trash to the place permission .
In this hour , many people turn off the lights in their house to save energy and protect the environment .
I wish a lot of people around the world could see the importance of the environment .
I was in a museum in New York looking at all the beautiful paintings and sculptures , when I heared the museum alarm . Everyone was afraid , including me .
I carefully approached the window of the house and I saw two men with the paintings .
They threatened all the people cruelly , so all the sightseers were angry with them .
However , the layout of the terminal was unknown to me , so I was completely lost .
We got on a train . The ceiling was comfortable but everyone was complaining about the two men .
When we arrived , we were on the other side of the city of New York . The features were so common because it was a good economic and conveniently because it would attract more tourists .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had an interview to get a scholarship so that he could pursue his dream of studying medicine in Ireland .
After the bus arrived , he got on and half an hour later he arrived at the destination .
The interviewer who was sitting in front of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loved .
Peter , without hesitating , hugged the interviewer , who was a man about 40 years old .
I want the job at the summer camp . I will look after children between 8 - 12 years old . I will help to organise sports and evening activities and , if you want , I could work in the kitchen .
I want to do this course , because it will help me to enlarge my vocabulary .
Please , write me a list with the words that I need for technical conversation .
I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " The Crazy Cat " . It is a very good restaurant .
First , the restaurant has a wide variety of food .
The purpose of the chef is soup and creamed corn to start , beef medallion covered bittersweet of carrot sauce with nuts and the dessert is chocolate cake with cheese .
The atmosphere is also very good . It has live music with different bands .
The cost is reasonable .
Nowadays , it is the most important challenge for television .
People complain about how the information in different TV shows does n't contribute to the process of learning . That 's why many of these programmes are considered trash , because of the multiple shows such as reality shows , talk shows , or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people .
A good example of these shows are how people are paid to act in reality or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious family problems , where the only aim is to get a bigger audience .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that have appeared recently . This type of program is one where the information is often gossip about the personal lives of famous singers and actors without taking into account whether they are true or not .
It 's a pity to know that only a few programs exist that try to educate people with the most up - to - date information through documentaries , investigations , cultural or opinion programs , which in my opinion help us to acquire more knowledge .
When you drive your own transport , a car for example , you go to and from a specific place , but on a bus , you go to the bus stop and not to your house or school , work ...
It is better for the people to be more comfortable because you drive and not the other person . I know some people , drivers , began haven't got work , but the public transport is free and is free because it is the government who pay . This money bacame do to make more work for others .
Not everything is good . Some people haven't got money and ca n't go to another place and the pollution is increasing . It is a serious problem and the solution is only for rich people . The solution is buying an electric car . The other solution , more economical , is for the government to give money to the people to buy an electric car .
In the end , only one person could be alive , even though those sacrificed tried to escape this horrible result .
Besides , the attractive storyline has a lot of climax , so that everyone can watch this film from the beginning to the end and this creates the billion box office to this film .
However , I think the props should be improved , such as the killer 's knife and the actors ' costumes . The knife looks as brittle as a handicraft , and I believe those are second - hand clothes . I think this is a pity in this movie .
I 'm studying medicine . This major is very challenging although stressful , because the self - study is every day and there is a lot of information .
This major involves everything . We always have to consider all the possibilities to complete homework , you have to know the maximum possible information to be able to complete it .
When you get the answer or solution , you can see that all the effort was worthwhile .
I have experience of going to the hospital and it was very interesting .
I could only oversee what they do to obtain visual experience and know what surgery was like .
Of course , studying in a foreign country also has disadvantages .
Even though there are lots of different possibilities and scholarships , not everybody can afford them .
It is a very useful experience in many ways .
I like travelling with my family and friends . I like travelling because I can get to know new people , places and cultures .
I do n't have a favourite subject , but l like English because we can communicate all over the world .
I like watching television , playing computer games and swimming .
My favourite types of film are science fiction , animation and historical .
My favourite types of games are adventure , war , historical and horror .
I prefer playing football to playing basketball .
I play basketball at school .
Carbohydrates are essential for a healthy diet .
Nutritionists recommend a quarter of a person 's diet should contain carbohydrates .
When your body takes in an insufficient amount of carbohydrates , the protein replaces the lack of carbohydrates to supply the body with energy .
Nowadays , I am studying for a degree in economics at the University of Barcelona .
I have some experience working with children aged between 5 and 17 years .
Now our company is going to do multidimensional operations , not just focus on furniture , but also on home appliances .
In addition , we will adjust the company 's management structure in each department depending on the market 's reaction and the environment .
And because we have our own factories and professional machines , we can easily avoid price competition .
For the factories , because the Chinese demographic dividends are not like before anymore , low price and undiversified products should become verity and premium goods .
Focus on user experience , inventive , unique and our core products
Therefore , we are reforming and making high - tech items , likes LEDs , photoelectric , vacuums , steam mops , etc .
Use this core technology to develop blow machine , air purifiers , irons , etc .
Besides , factories are keeping going on our professional items and service like , high glossy , auto painting and 4-side edge sealing , honeycomb board , etc .
Nowadays , people have a lot of fear of pollution of the planet .
All governments are increasing their policies and laws relating to this topic and they also promote new rules in the daily life of the population .
One of the new rules for the reduction of pollution in the cities is public transport .
According to the general world laws about global warming , each country has considered its owns arguments about it .
I can give as an example how big cities around the world can reduce pollution more .
These cities do n't allow people to drive in the city centre , and the industry reduces its taxes if it 's increasing the politic nature .
The town mayor has given the population a free bus .
I think , in conclusion , all people should have good behaviour and an open mind and they and myself also should take public transport more often .
The temperature was over 20 degrees .
After we came back , I told my family everything .
Environmental changes are really needed in the current situation .
People contribution is very important in this matter .
The report explains how my town 's people take care of their surroundings to preserve this planet in a better way .
Government policy changes help a lot with water preservation .
Many factories are following the regulations and not draining the harmful waste into the water .
People come forward and utilise these bins effectively instead of throwing rubbish away .
In addition to that , recyclable waste is sold and the money is given to the relevant person .
This gives motivation to the public and they can earn by using the right way to dispose of their waste .
Town council not only encourage people to plant trees or gardens , it subsidises their green improvements .
Example , free fertilizers , water pumps , and pesticides .
In summary , people take many initiatives and are moving forward to have a safe and attractive environment and surroundings .
This is an international sport because in all parts of world there are people that they play it .
Football is a famous sport . You can watch it on TV or you can see it live . There are a lot of level categories , the most famous category is the first .
Soccer is the best sport for me because you can get fit , meet other people and participate in competitions .
If you want to start doing this sport , you should be prepared to work hard .
Because you are the best teacher in the whole world ! Many of our classmates really like you too ! We know that you are going to teach at Discovery - bay primary school . My English results are better since you taught me . I really love you , Ms Cumings ! Your friend Ms Decock told me that she is going to Australia , and I love you both . I hope you that you will come back sometimes !
The graph given shows the seasonal sales of ice - cream from two places at an English seaside resort from 2012 to 2014 . They are , respectively , an ice - cream van and an indoor public swimming pool .
In the case of the ice - cream van , it sold most in Jul - Sep each year , nearly reaching 5000 dollars and it was still slightly increasing year by year .
She put her cup of coffee on the windowsill , hooked up the brist on her beautiful little breasts , put right her colourful light - minded skirt , took her orange scarf and little red handbag and went to the door .
Nowadays , we constantly use means of transport to go everywhere so that our lifestyle .
Despite this , travelling by public transport can be a better option in so many cases .
Certainly , cities will be crowded in the future because the population is always increasing .
Using your own car to go to the city centre could be a nightmare . It would be a stressful waste of time .
Besides , the price of petrol is increasing too , and it is likely it will be so expensive that most people will not be able to afford a car .
In contrast , there will be cheaper alternatives like buses , trains or even planes for long distances .
On the other hand , many drivers enjoy travelling in their own vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free .
Finally , governments and society are concerned about the environment and I think that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emissions .
In my opinion , public transport will not disappear , even if cars are much more comfortable , faster and more evolved than now .
So we should be aware of the importance of time . I hope not to waste it and to make the best use of it to giving opportunity for rising . Those who waste it , will be left behind and they will fail to make a mark in their life .
The great men and successful guys became famous and rose through the suitable use of time . They a are guide and a source of inspiration for a new generation .
So , we can say that time is a double - edged sword , either helping you or against you , and the popular saying is right : " do n't put off the work of this day to the next day " because our work will accumulate . Then it will become harder to finish it . To ensure the best use of time in our lives , we need to be punctual . Punctuality avoids tension and trouble . Finally , even scientists have another vision of time . They have discovered that time is the fourth dimension through relativity theory , which exchange all concepts in science .
I love my town because , when I was a small girl , I went there , and I was with my grandparents , my cousins and my friends .
My best friend lives in Madrid , but we always used to be together in her house or in my grandparents ' house .
To begin with , the format of the bank notes needs to be designed . Factors for consideration include the background colour , the artwork and the security issues .
Secondly , equipment such as skilled machinists and metal plates have to be prepared for the next steps .
Thirdly , they print the sheets of bank notes ( 50 banks notes per sheet ) with special ink , where colour is considered on both sides and images will be slightly raised on the bank notes .
Most importantly , they manually inspect each printed sheet in case there should be damaged sheets .
Once damaged sheets are discovered , they individually separate them into good and bad ones and then burn the bad notes , making sure that the remaining sheets are of good quality .
Good sheets are cut into separate bank notes , then packed and dispatched to other places , while the bad ones have to be destroyed securely .
The movie which I have chosen to write about is Microphone .
It is an Egyptian movie starring Khalen Aboelnaga and some young actors . The action of this film takes place in Alexandria , a city in Egypt , and it is about some young people who need a good chance to deliver their voices to people as they do n't have much money to produce their own albums ,
that sort of band is famous among young people and they call it " underground bands " . Their songs give a big concenet to the political and social situation in Egypt and they became famous after the 25 January Revolution . I choose this movie as it reflects what happens in our society . There is no chance for young people and if they find it , they face a lot of problems to save it and they do n't find time for other activities , and sometimes they work on something which they never learn from or love .
I live in a small town , and there are a few things that my town does for the environment : like recycling , for which we must know what material the things we throw away are made of , and put them in the right dumpster .
This is a small act for us , but if we all contribute , it will be a big help for the environment .
We can also use appliances that do not consume so much , if we can adopt sustainable electrical systems or buy organic products .
In the big cities , they have begun to build green buildings , they use electric public transport in order not to pollute .
It was interesting !
In the evening we had dinner in a particular restaurant and my friends and I took many photos of a famous sight .
I will never forget this experience !
It was a nice experience .
I hope it will be a good cat and a good experience for me .
This experience helped me a lot because I became much more responsible , not only with those boys , but also with my brothers and sister ( I have two brothers and one sister ) and I learned the meaning of working and earning money .
I did n't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful , and also because I had known them since they were born .
However , we were lucky enough to have a great mother who tried her best to support my older brother , my older sister and me in completing our college studies . Of course , my uncle , younger brother of my mother lent a big hand to go through the hard times , so that made us often help each other in my family when a member was in difficulty .
In particular , I was the youngest member of the family , and I caused much more trouble when I was young .
I do really thank my mother and all the members of my family for being patient and exertion to me . Now we have a great relationship with each other and treasure the happiness we have got not so easily .
So , are the members of my family my best friends?I'll answer you : there 's not much better answer than Yes !
How my town takes care of the environment
First of all , let me introduce my town . I live in Kabul , the capital of Afghanistan .
This town is located in the central zone of Afghanistan with 4462(km² ) surface area , and has more than seven million inhabitants . The economic and security situation is not suitable and these factors have a direct effect on how we care for the environment .
The most important factor in environmental improvement is the lack of the required knowledge among the local people .
Based on necessity , the people and government of this town together effectually take care of the environment .
The municipality of the town collects the garbage from the streets and roads and ships it to a
Fortunately , Kabul is surrounded by mountains and has a mountainous climate . This town has approximately 15 mm of rain per year . The remarkable agricultural area and forestry all around the town have a positive effect on Kabul 's environment and produces fresh air for the citizens of the town .
Doing sports is my hobby because I find it interesting and it makes me healthy .
Actually , there are a lot of kinds of sports that I like , but the most interesting sport for me is football .
I am interested in working with you .
This is an excellent opportunity for me because I want to work as an English teacher .
Later , I studied to be an English teacher at the university of Extremadura .
They learn and understand English very well .
I worked in the English holiday school this year and I have learned a lot through this experience .
I organized activities like sports , visits to cities , festivals , etc .
There are so many sports in the world , like basketball , baseball , running , yoga , swimming , and so on .
volleyball .
First of all , exercising can make you
It seems to me a complete sport , because you can play it in pairs or in an individual way .
To be good at badminton you need to prepare yourself in a physical way but also the psychological part is very important .
Nowadays , young people are influenced by the western culture , so they are getting more fashion - conscious . Youngsters are interested in wearing different stylish and colorful clothes . They are happy about wearing different color clothes . They do n't want to wear our traditional dress , such as sari , dhoti , choli and many more . They only like to wear shirts , pants , skirts , t - shirts and many more . Youngsters are influenced by watching different programmes on television .
Many classmates went to different sections of the sport .
After After one month , my instructor told me that I would enter the competition .
The day of the competition arrived and I went with others to show how I 'd practiced .
Then instructor said my name and I went out on the Tatami . When I left I had a special feeling ; many people were looking and clapping .
I . I was very happy because it was my first competition .
After the end of the competition , we were all awarded medals and certificates .
Then as always , they played the Kazakhstan national anthem .
This time I felt like a Champion . It was a really special feeling .
Sport has given me a boost of vitality , energy , and optimism and strengthened my immune system .
My most exciting day was June 8th 2014 ; an international competition in Belgium .
The day before , there were the qualifiers , which I passed .
The day of the finals , I was so nervous , but determined .
After the competition I was relaxed and happy , because I had done my job .
In the end , I placed 7th for both beam and floor , and after we took the photos , I went back to the changing room .
I am writing with regard to finding accounting services for my company .
I know that you have experience in searching got the best employees and you have quality .
I need my employees to be punctual and that they have responsibility in their job because we are talking about the money of the company .

Technologies are moving on at high speed .
As the technological world is moving fast , the automobile industry is also coming up with new types of cars & scooters that work in very economical way .
Buying cars and scooters is more convenient than in the last decade .
People now buy cars and scooters according to their convenience and pocket .
Which was a time - consuming and obviously cheaper way of commuting from one place to another .
Using private vehicles is more convenient for them than using public transport .
So public transport 's importance is decreasing every day .
If it so there will come a time when individual people will not be interested in public transport .
This has a tremendous impact on other aspects of life .
Fuel consumption has increased in a few years .
People do not even care about safety parameters while driving on the roads .
Public transport is a very useful resource . You can travel without polluting the atmosphere and it is very cheap .
Nowadays , we usually travel very often to many different places , so for us , it is more comfortable to travel in our cars , but for the atmosphere and for our wallets , it is n't .
It would be a great advance for people and for the atmosphere , and for countries as well , because we will save a lot of money .
Firstly , family is the basis of the relationship .
Secondly , although friendship and love are the most important feelings , the family structures the person and influences their behavior .
Although I have a good relationship with my parents , I could n't think of them as friends .
In conclusion , I think that the two relationships are different .
Perhaps I think that this statement is false because I think this statement should say that public transport is going to exist in the future because travelling by car is not so much more convenient .
I think that travelling by car is good because you have your own seat and in the winter your car is hot and you can also listen to the radio .
On public transport , you do n't have your own seat , so sometimes you travel standing up , which is not very comfortable , and in winter you do n't have air conditioning , so if it 's cold outside , it 's cold inside too . Sometimes you have to travel with sick people that can transmit the illness to you .
On the other hand , public transport does n't pollute , but the car pollutes , so , for us , travelling by car is better than travelling by public transport , but for the atmosphere , it is better to travel by public transport than to travel by car .
What makes me like learning new languages is how it helps me communicate with others easily . I also like traveling so much , as it makes me see new places and learn more about other countries around the world and their cultures and traditions . However , I do n't travel outside my country because I am a student and I do n't have my own money which I can spend on whatever I like .
About the pollution , technology , obesity and other things around the world .
Pollution is a big problem for us and the planet .
Also , TV , radio , the internet , big companies have advertisements about helping the planet .
Moreover , from kindergarten , schools are educating about taking care of the planet , simply by doing things like separating the garbage .
For example , the way of preparing food can be dangerous because a lot food has artificial things that are not good for us .
Technology has good thing and bad sides .
Technology is advancing very fast , in the best way . This is good for us because we will do a lot of things .
In conclusion , I think that we are on track for the next years .
No one can deny the importance of public transport , but actually this importance is turn to private sector transport .
And this importance of private transport is because private transportation provides a comfortable way to move from one place to another . Also , it helps to save time and reduce costs spent in public transportation .
Firstly , private transport provides a comfortable way to travel from one place to another without sharing with strange people and , by using this kind of transport , is also convenient because you are free to choose the time of a trip .
Secondly , it is a good way of travelling or moving from one place to another without wasting time waiting for a specific time to move or even waste time waiting for a public transportation vehicle to reach all the points it has to go to , but on the other hand , when you have your own transport or private transport , you get the right to choose the time of your trip or when you want to move or stay , and nowadays , we can not afford to waste our time taking public transport .
Finally , public transport involves more costs , because public transport ( such a buses , trains ) fares are increasing every year , and we do not face this problem with private transport .
In comparison with the Li Ren edition , the three children 's editions have some dissimilarities in plot , title , topic , character , language and so on .
We will discuss how to present the features in different aspects such as education , entertainment , literature and children .
Besides , an adaptation is connected with the Li Ren edition .
People from India and Pakistan coming to the UK significantly increased by around 10 times in 1970 , compared to 1940 .
Now I will talk about the Daruma , a Japanese restaurant that was a very good experience for me .
All the place was surrounded by a nice and warm atmosphere .
It was a sunny day , a special day in my life . the day was 29 October 2009 . That day I had a university admission test at Shajalaj university .
Before that day , I was frustrated , so it brings happiness to my mind .
There was no other option for me . I just wanted her . During the exam , I was thinking the whole time about how to communicate with her .
When the examination was over , again , I started to talk with her , asking her her exam was .
When I was returning from Syleth , I called the girl and talked to her and told her that I had got chance at university , but the girl said that she knew .
Please , give my congratulations to your cousin .
The food is always in a big restaurant where we eat the best food in the city . I recommend you to come to a Spanish wedding .
Hello , I 'm Arnau and I am twelve years old . I live in Manresa ( Catalonia ) . I am very hardworking in high school and I 'm funny and very talkative and I 'm not freaky .
I 'm really into Ps3 , especially Fifa 15 , and a fan of riding a bike , but I do n't like computer games , they are very boring , but I like chatting on the internet with my friends . Sometimes I like playing on my Ipad .

Well , I will explain in this article about one museum that is considered " The Best in Mexico " , but why ?
In 1810 , there was a war for independence in Mexico and many people fought with other people . For example , Miguel Hidalgo is considered " The father of independence " and he fought with the Spanish monarchy .
The Museum is in Guanajuato , Guanajuato .
The museum is the most interesting place in my country because it describes the history of our country .
Being a two team sport makes the game competitive and interesting .
He is a good coach but he does n't like to buy experienced footballers .
Buying cheap footballers has wrecked the Arsenal team several times because of the lack of experience of the cheap players .
People from different cultures play in the same club .
When I am on the court , my opponents fear my service and I am very at my position to cover the entire court .
Coming to the infrastructure of badminton , it is all about the cock and the racquets .
At present , many people think that English is the world language and it is absolutely an essential skill to communicate with people from other countries .
For this reason , Taiwanese parents do not want their kids to be behind others . Therefore , many kindergartens have started to teach children English .
Everything seemed so fine , and nothing was wrong , anyway .

He learns how to compose and plays some kind of ancient instrument .
Television is one of the most useful inventions of the modern world .
It is a commodity which serves the dual purpose of both education and entertainment at one and the same time .
The TV shows broadcast on television play a vital role in shaping the thoughts of the viewers .
To tell the truth , shopping is so boring for men , particularly when they go to the store with women .
Shopping with women is nightmarish .
Nowadays , with technology , we have different ways to get around , like hoverboards , skateboards , and maybe it means there is no future for public transport .
Another point is that we have our own cars and it 's more comfortable . I do n't have to wait in line to buy tickets .
All that you need to become a runner is motivation and a plan .
That is what happened with me personally .
Motivation for me was a 15k race .
So to finish the competition with pleasure , I needed to work out a plan , which was a day - by - day diary of our jogging distance , time , and mood during our workout .
First of all , it is absolutely minimal . You just need boots for running !
My advice is : eat a lot of vegetables and fruit , drink plenty of water and run at least 3 times per week .
We can enjoy cricket with our friends by playing cricket and we can also have fun , entertainment .
Playing cricket also gives physical exercise to our body . we can bowl , bat , field in cricket , which requires a lot of physical activity .
Playing cricket gives relaxation and reduces stress .
I can give advice to people who are interested in playing cricket . They must know all the rules of cricket before playing it .
There are two desks with two computers , two chairs and two bookshelves with my brother 's school books and mine .
This sport is an individual sport , so you win alone and do n't beat a team , but if you play tournaments in pairs the one who wins is the team .
So you will become one of the most famous players in the world and you will win a lot of tennis tournaments , including the four slams : the Australian Open , the US open , the Roland Garros and Wimbledon .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
It is great when you are in a cup and go very far in the tournament .
If you are going to begin playing football , you need football boots . You also need protection for the legs .
I have worked for a few different companies and associations in the past .
I really think that we should go to that new centre that you wrote about in your last email and do some of the activities .
But we could also try the climbing , but it would be better if we could climb outside , in the countryside .
Citizens want , at the same time , efficient and quick means of transportation , personalised solutions to meet their transportation needs , and the cheapest transportation costs .
This place has some restaurants and sports bar s where I can talk with Latinos and feel at home .
I think that public transport is much better for the environment than private transport .
I think that public transport is the future , because many countries will have to ban entrance to their towns for private cars to stop the CO2 emissions to the atmosphere , in order to protect the planet and the health of their citizens .
So I do not agree with this affirmation . In my opinion , travelling by car is much more expensive and harmful to the environment than using public transport .
Maybe he is sorry she thought , but why if she is perfect , she is everything that a man could want . So what was happening .
-Are you ok ? - She says , a little bit afraid of his forthcoming word .
-I'm sorry - he repeats again , but more serious and with his normal face - It 's because , well it , was my first kiss OK ! ? I can fight with Bloutums , Dragons , Two - Headed snakes and everything that you can imagine .
They stop in a dressmaker 's market .
- I 'm gon na give information to Lucresia .
- What kind of information ?
When they entered the dressmaker 's market , Lucresia was n't there .
-These dresses are made of textile fiber . Almost everything here is synthetic and wearable for everyone - explained Snow .
- Wow , everything is beautiful , it makes me feel like I am suspended in a dream or fairytale .
In the past , cars were only affordable for the upper classes , while for the middle class and lower there were not many choices for them besides walking and public transportation .
Once technology and the standard of living are improved , many people left the traditional habit of using public transportation and chose the car for several reasons .
As we know , public transportation is not a direct way to get to all our destinations and it forces us to stop at many stops first . Moreover we have to take another one to reach our destination , so it is already obvious why using a car is better .
Secondly , public transportation is usually very crowded and makes us not feel safe , since there is an opportunity for us to be robbed .
Then , by car , we can enjoy the scenery , share a laugh , change our destination all of a sudden and many more .
For these reasons , it can not be doubted that people think a car is more comfortable to use rather than public transportation .
Since cars are affordable nowadays , a family can have more than one . That makes the number of cars grow rapidly , but they do not think about the negative side effects that a car has .
Firstly , it leads to global warming , since the concentration of pollution is higher in many countries , and actually it is not only leading to but also making global warming faster and can also threaten our health .
Then roads are more crowded right now and there is so much traffic , so people waste more time on the road , then it makes one of the positive points of using a car disappear and the importance of public transportation is needed .
While in the statement it says that public transportation will be abandoned by many people , in my opinion , the opposite is true - that public transportation is our future .
It can be proved now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher . Besides , it is not as costly as using a car , and the quality of public transportation has improved , so citizens have no worries about using it .
That is hardly surprising , it has been closed since 2005 .
Cause there was lots of damage , but they did n't take responsibility .
But you need to understand the main idea .
Anyway , if you read different books , you can understand better .
In conclusion , it 's more important to learn the concept than to say something stupid ....
So , if you need techniques for learning , you need to analyse and create your own words , this way you will never forget this definition .
( It is my country place . ) I like it because it is near the water and we have a big lawn where we play football , volleyball and have fun .
My favourite subjects at school are mathematics , geography , and , of course , English .
The location of the restaurant is fantastic , right in the centre of the city , and with plenty of space for parking .
The decor is not too modern , but not too classic . It has a comfortable atmosphere .
The menu is very well constructed , and the food is based on local products .
I am writing this letter because we need to improve the facilities in the gym .
On those days , there are a lot of people and classes at the same time and sometimes we ca n't have the class comfortably .
And the solution to the second problem is that you should do maintenance once a year .
Yours sincerely , Maximiliano Khachaturyan .
I 'm so glad to hear from you and I also would like you to know that your idea for our new school project is really interesting .

In the last year sales at Benton Electronics in the first quarter of the year were 500 and they increased to 620 in the second quarter . In the third quarter , sales stayed at 620 and in the last quarter of the year sales went down very quickly to 420 . As you can see , sales were very unstable .

My Life at University
Life at university involves a lot of difficult and interesting things .
Of course , everything always have two sides .
Now that I live at university , my life has changed a lot .
I was very unsure of myself and I could n't make friends well , so I think that it was too difficult to ask teachers or friends .
Secondly , studying at university , I have to live a long way from home , which makes me homesick , sad , and worried . I have to live in a dormitory with many strange people . They 're very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates .
It 's not convenient .
Everyday , I have to clean our room , wash clothes . I have to spend a lot of time finishing everything before I start studying .
When I first lived here , I used to call my family and complain about life here .
However , university life has many conveniences .
Living alone , I have to save money , because there are many situations which I have to deal with without family , and you can become a good person with many good characteristics , such as confidence , independence , friendliness .
Because my family always did everything for me when I lived with them , it 's very difficult to be independent .
For me , jogging is very stressless .
He had come to Agatha 's investigation office to ask her to look into some murders had that happened recently .
Two weeks later , Agatha meets John in the old palace 's cellar .
Unfortunately , Agatha ca n't find sufficient clues to identify the guilty party .
Irritated , John understands Agatha 's difficulties and , before going away , he calls Agatha without Michael to tell her another important thing .
One reason is that travelling by car is more comfortable .
For all these reasons , I think that travelling by car is better .
I have a lot of interests , but my favourite is volleyball .
Volleyball is a discipline which I have been practising for 6 years .
It 's very large and has special lights in the Greek performers ' room mainly .
This museum houses the historical collection of the Spanish royal family from many centuries ago to the present time .
I prefer walking , because the bus , helicopter , and metro are very polluting .
Suddenly , a man in black told us that we should plug the machine into the electricity .
He was very embarrassed .
Good morning everyone and welcome to your favorite program " You can also do so " . Today we 're going to learn how to make a cake for children 's birthdays , and Sofia will tell us what ingredients we are going to need to be able to make the cake .

These programmes are fashionable .
We were going to Gdańsk to see the new stadium that was built for the UEFA European Championship .
Bydgoszcz is my hometown and the destination of this journey .
Sadly our car broke down ... at a big and busy intersection !
This was n't some big , we still had four wheels and a motor , but the electronics in the car stopped working .
We did n't have a speedometer , blinkers and lights ; it was a very dangerous situation .
My father rang friends but unfortunately no one could help us .
In the car park in front of this building a very nice and crazy old man helped us and charged the accumulator in our car .
Fortunately , we returned home healthy and happy but very very tired .

Shopping facilities in Moral de Calatrava .
This report shows the sorts of shops which are located in Moral de Calatrava .
Traditional clothes : that kind of clothing can be expensive , but if you want to live like in the past , you can put on those clothes and you will have great fun although those clothes went out of style many years ago .
Something more fashionable : there are also a few clothes shop where you can find a lot of by fashionable Italian and Spanish designers .
If you need something for a special event like a wedding , you can go to three shops which are specialised in that .
Every Saturday morning , this village organizes a market where people can buy some natural vegetables or fruit which have been grown by local farmers .
-If you buy some clothes , assure yourself that they fit you and you like them enough to conservate .
My town tries all the time to make our town more beautiful and comfortable by taking more care of the environment . They provide us with good buses , which are friends to the environment , and offer the tickets for these buses at a cheap price . They also try to find the best way to make the rubbish more useful by recycling . Also , people try all the time to find the best way to keep our village clean ; they never throw the rubbish in the streets or the gardens . They also take care of the fuel in their cars to not be bad for the environment . So , it 's our duty to take care of our village and the whole environment alongside the government .
There are many accidental problems encountered by international students studying in Australia .
Because of different cultural backgrounds , the speaking styles of international students who come from different countries are different .
For example , people always walk on the right of the road in China . However , Australian rules specify that citizens drive on the left of the road .
Secondly , loneliness can be a big problem when a person leaves their own country , going away from family members and close friends .
Thirdly , students may not be accustomed to western eating habits , like burgers , pizza and bread . Because of the unfamiliar environment , students may lack a sense of security .
The most important way is that individuals should participate in student activities which are held by students of the same nationality , so that they may not feel lonely . At the same time , they can also actively communicate with local students to acquire more information about Australian culture , in order to fit in quickly .
I have been thinking about some ideas to help you to organize some sports or evening activities .
I used to work in a restaurant in Salou and it was quite satisfying .
I think that I 'm a suitable person to look after them because I am quite responsible .
I 'm an energetic and responsible person .
My name is Margarita Varela and I 'm interested in the Summer camp Assistant 's position .
I am a responsible person who can cope in a crisis .
I took a First Aid course last year in order to know what to do in case of unexpected accidents .
My available time is on Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays .
Then , I was wondering if food , accommodation and expenses are covered by you , or do you give any kind of help to your employees ? I would appreciate it a lot if you sent me this information .
But as this takes 5 days , many people do n't have time to watch this game and its losing its popularity with the younger generation .

Everyone is able to enjoy the excitement throughout this game .
2 . He should be disciplined .
3 . During his playing time , he must give his full concentration .
So . I need more information about eating customs in different countries .
In Korea , we usually use chopsticks when we eat meals and spoons as well .
Have you ever used chopsticks ?
So , I have to learn to use chopsticks to eat .
When you feel really weak .
I have to present this project next Monday .
All thanks to new technologies , innovation in the field of medicine and new scientific discoveries .
As far as I 'm concerned , we will be submerged by too many tools which will replace manpower and craft . In addition , globalization will destroy the cultural traditions of each country .
On the one hand , I 'm for progress . On the other hand , I hope that the new will not destroy the old .
Apart from that , I imagine the world with everything automatic , planes that take me from New York to Dubai in three hours and robots instead of waiters in a restaurant .
I have read the advertisement and I promise you that I am perfect for this post .
and I know how to take care of a camp . I 'm funny and cheerful , but I 'm also professional , so I know how to take care of children .
I am an experienced cook , so I can also cook for the children . I am also a good singer , so we can sing songs together with the children .
I can not agree with the statement that there is " no future for public transport " given that the premise is " travelling by car is more convenient " .
First of all , public transport is rather more convenient than a private car .
The accessibility is not just improving underground , but also on the ground and bridging .
The environment is becoming a more and more burning issue , , especially from many years to nowadays .
We already know that a great part of the pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of the transport that invades cities worldwide .
However , we can already fight this - waiting for the development of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable , sustainable energy . For example , taking advantage of public transport .
The best idea is still , obviously , valorizing the use of bicycles .
Polluting them is like endangering the life of the whole world .
In addition , what about domestic waste , which is our reality ? We should all learn to manage our waste , because each of us , in our own small way , is a great threat to the environment .
In conclusion , I think it is never too late to save our wonderful world .
But if you leave the city and travel about 30 km , there are a lot of rivers and waterfalls .
My favourite restaurant is in Modugno .
It 's located in a quiet street , so the restaurant is often very relaxing , especially between 8 and 9 pm .
The restaurant looks very elegant and traditional .
Usually , there is no music in the restaurant .
In this way , customers can have the chance to have a conversation , without being annoyed by television or music .
I find it appreciable : I really love to talk to the people I 'm eating with .
Despite this , the restaurant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments , hung up on the walls .
I really like it , because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I 'm looking at .
Everything is delicious and very tasty , especially the pizzas : they dress them in many different ways . I try a different meal every time I go there .
The thoughts which people put in her mind were completely wrong . She ca n't deny that those thoughts affected her badly , brought her to the point that they made her hate herself .
The words they said to her were deadly ones , they colored her life black . till it 's the only time to prove to them that she can do anything , she 's good at everything like them all , that she just did n't want to do it like them all as she just hated the way
Being unsuccessful at studying is a horrible thing , it affects people badly .
That was me . I never liked studying , I never found myself in those subjects , but it was n't a big deal to me . I hated being seen as unsuccessful or a loser , as I was n't that . I knew that I was clever enough to study all these subjects and do well in exams so I can get high marks , but they all did n't get that . They judged me for my marks , but marks do n't form brains or thoughts , marks are n't the only way that makes you great now or in the future .
Whatever . In high school , the senior year here in our country identifies your future ; the college you 'll spend your life studying in and working for its knowledge , so I got that I should do my best this year so my future would be better . And it happened . I showed them all that I can do whatever I want , even if the things I was n't like they see me , and that all my previous marks were n't my best . I got a high score and entered The faculty of Engineering , which was the top college .
Your thoughts are the only ones that will make the difference , so take care only of them and believe in yourself so you can achieve the prestige you 're looking for .
Do n't give anyone the opportunity to make you give up , and continue in a successful life . Fight .
I am interested in the work .
Although I do n't have a teacher available there , the program helps a lot because the corrections appear at the same time as you check it .
Humans also want houses , and transport facilities .
Our flats and houses make the other animals lose their homes , and it leads to environmental deterioration .
We make the transport easy . However , we take away other animal s ' lives through carelessness .
THE REASON WHY I ADMIRE HIM IS BECAUSE HE WAS DETERMINED WHEN HE WON A SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY MEDICINE IN RUSSIA . HE LIVED THERE FOR 7 YEARS .
How does the area take care of the environment ?
It builds a lot of facilities for residents .
But , fortunately , people living in this area all use these bikes carefully , so we do n't care so much about that .
It makes a father or mother 's life more convenient !
People living in Taiwan , no matter whether you are local people or not , can use all of these facilities .
And lots of city administrations advocate protecting animals .
I am Julia Timmerman from the Netherlands and I read your advertisement about working in summer camps in the USA .

It 's quite a strange sounds , because his father , grandfather , and great - grandfather had travelled in time .
This school is located in Marin , which is in northern Spain near Pontevedra .
The school is the Spanish institution in charge of training the Spanish navy officer class .
And it was established in 1943 . Moreover , there are not only the royal navy but also the royal marine corps .
Students have to study two parts , which are the engineering part and the military part .
In the engineering part , there are a lot of laboratories , which help us to easily understand about subjects such as Physics , Chemistry or even Economics .
For example , the planetarium in a navigation room for learning about the position of stars , four small boats used to practice leadership and navigation in the Pontevedra river , or even the simulation for creating situations which seldom arise .
On the other hand , five years in school are not superficial because now there are not only the military subjects but also the engineering subjects .
Today , on the roads there are a lot of cars , buses , motorcycles , and other kinds of transportation .
All people should use their own cars to go somewhere only when it 's necessary , because each car on the road is bad for our environment .
I know a good restaurant . Its name is " Moonlight " . It is located in Abbas elakad St.
It is large , clean and comfortable and has air conditioning and internet wifi .
It offers many kinds of delicious foods , like meat , chicken , seafood , and if you want something different , you will find it there . It is suitable for my class because it is different from any other restaurant .
One of the most famous buildings is the Churruca Earl Palace , which has a medieval tower with battlements ( the rest of the towers in the city do not have them because the Muslims took them out ) .
Nowadays , the Palace has a very good restaurant with a comfortable patio where you can taste the most exclusive products from Extremadura .
The present chapter aims to introduce audiovisual translation ( AVT ) - one of the most popular types of translation nowadays .
Audiovisual translation brings a lot of dilemmas and constraints over which translators must agonise .
But there are a variety of techniques which help to tackle these kinds of problems .
The chapter will also cover the definition of the notion of puns as a stylistic feature and how puns are transferred from one language into another .
As an extension of this , I will evaluate whether the effect of the pun in the original version is maintained in the dubbed version .
The people in my town take care of the environment .
The advance of technology in recent years has been awesome .
Computers did n't have any programs and as a result were limited , boring and tedious .
These days , computers are multifunctional .
I went to the beach and played volleyball with my brother and sister .
The car is a more comfortable mode of transport than public transport , but it is not sustainable , its cost is higher , and if all people travel by car , the cities will be very polluted .
Another mode of transport that could be commonly used in the future is the bike . This mode of transport is cheap and ecological . Also , more and more the cities are building a lot of bike lanes , so it is a good alternative .
For travelling to other cities or town , in my opinion , the car will remain the most used mode of transport , although new modes of transport could change this situation .
Finally , I think that the most used mode of transport in the cities in the future will be the bus , metro and bike , and for travelling between cities , the car will remain the most used .
I was especially delighted with the national music and Latin American dances .
I would like to invite you to the celebration of my birthday in two weeks .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
When they go to work or for other purposes , they choose to drive by themselves .
It is not only convenient , but also time - saving .
I am writing to you about the advertisement in the Mirror daily newspaper .
I am really very interested in the job on your summer camp . I have worked for seven months in Spain in a similar job .
by the time I have studied for a degree in journalism .
I am available to start to work immediately .
The dream of every person that plays this sport , is to make it a profession as well as a hobby , but very few people make it .
My undergraduate studies in Pharmacy at the University of Asia Pacific gave me a solid background in the health care sector and chemistry , as well as a strong theoretical framework , while allowing me to explore my personal interests in pharmaceutical technology .
This undergraduate work along with diversified professional experience helped shape the specific research interests that now drive me to pursue graduate work in the field of industrial pharmacology and gave me the opportunity to learn and work with the new medicines and delivery methods , ensuring their safety and quality academic and research opportunities for my interest in pharmaceuticals as a scientific career .
I am very grateful for your invitation to the interview .
I am glad to tell you that I am able to come on February 16th at 10:00am . I would appreciate it if you could reserve a parking space for me .
It has a lot of historical places .
The most historical place is the Pyramids . They were built more than 7000 years ago .
Many people think that parents are responsible for the bad behaviour of young people and they should be punished for that .
It is a time when children must choose which people are good or bad , and which way they will go in a difficult situation . For example , will they drink alcohol or will they have fun without any stimulants ?
The Great Wall is a great military construction in China , known as a miracle in the history of ancient human construction .
The existing Great Wall was mainly built in the 15th century of Ming . The Great Wall has a total length of 8851.8 kilometres .
It is a symbol of China , along with Tiannanmen Square and the Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses .
The development of each nation and their relationship is the key point to observing and understanding the area of the Great Wall .
This week was a little bit difficult because it was the beginning of classes . I got up early to be on time for my classes and to start with all the enthusiasm in the new semester .
The next day , Tuesday , it was hard for me to get up , but the simple fact of seeing my classmates meant it was so much easier .
Scientists try to make people 's lives easier , but that 's harmful for people 's health because that makes people not move and get more fat .
Renewable and new energy is clean and so cheap , we can use the sun 's rays to generate electricity for houses and cars .
Working as an ITC is very exciting because you need to program everything , it is like a challenge , although you can do different things . You can be on duty in your house and deal with your boss by cellphone , so do n't be alarmed if your children bother you .
It is a little stressful when you have a lot of work . I hope when I have my job I will be in charge of IT department security .
It 's a very worthwhile job .
There is no accounting for tastes and I can not answer for everyone .
I would like to tell you about this experience and how much I enjoyed working in there .
I was responsible for selling the movie tickets and having a good time .
I am writing in connection with the advertisement for a job in Green Pepper Cafe .
I have all the needed traits for this job : knowledge of cooking , politeness and diligence at work .
In addition , I want to say that I always try to do all my duties with responsibility .
I am looking forward to hearing from you if you are interested in my application .
However , Michael discovered that it was a bad wizard .
It was a hot , sunny day . Peter decided to go to the waterfront promenade and have a walk .
Peter thought that he must do something quickly to prevent her from committing suicide .
So he immediately contacted the police for help .
Finally , the life of the woman was saved by the police and the police thanked Peter for helping them .
The person I most admire is called Ronaldinho , a football player who , in my opinion , is the best of all time .
The skills he has are wonderful . He knows everything about football , his passes were fantastic , he passed the ball even with his back !
My mom likes growing plants such as vegetables .
This book got me interested and I began reading more and more . The more I read , the more I loved it . At this time nothing mattered to me . I wanted to finish the book as soon as possible . I do not know the end , but I wanted the end of the book to be amazing , but at the same time , I did not finish the book because the mystery to open up finished in .
In the end , a lady interrupted me and I was angry about the situation .
Nowadays our world is fighting every day against different problems . One day there is the problem of violence , one day the atmospheric conditions , or many other problems .
In my opinion , everyone 's life will see a great improvement , from the economic point of view , but also from the social and cultural one .
It is known that in the future there will come a day when any kind of unrenewable resource will run out .
But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources , such as electricity generated by the light of the sun 's rays .
Or in addition , we could use the energy generated by the environment , such as the wind or inorganic waste .
Maybe there will also be great new discoveries in medicine that will make all kinds of disease disappear .
To sum up , I think that we should expect a great future in which man will regain possession of his whole capability and , thanks to that , he will change everyone 's lives for the better .
Today I was at the university learning new things .
Jose is not at my university but we are good friends .
Last month I went to Machalilla National Park with my friends .
Los Frailes is in Machalilla National Park . It is a wonderful beach , the sand is very white .
I 'm interested in one sport ; football .
I think it 's a good idea if you buy some equipment for football and practise with your friends before matches at home or in the playground for two or three days .
I understand what you mean , because cars are so convenient , as you said .
The movie is about a doll called Annabelle which was kept in a museum in Conecticut where she is visited by a priest who blesses her twice a month .
John From finds the perfect gift for his pregnant wife : a beautiful doll dressed in a wedding dress .
Unfortunatelly , in a horrible night , the couple 's house is invaded by a Satanist group who attack them and leave just blood behind them .
The aim of this report is to highlight how the citizens take care of the environment , in order to give suggestions to keep this area clean .
In the matter of that , information concerning what people do , or could do , is going to be shown .
Disadvantages :
Unfortunately , deeper problems are linked to the difficulty that all the inhabitants have respecting those principles .
Some think that volunteers should involve careless people in many projects to keep their city attractive and marvelous .
The government can improve public transport by making a great investment like changing the old vehicles for new and increasing the number of buses , trains and building more bus stops and trains stations . This kind of action will help a lot to improve the quality of public transport for the population and will make the life of the people easier .
However , if this situation does not change and if our government do not take providence about this important issue , it will be the end of transport public and it will be more convenient to use a car .
The second problem is about that some apparatus are not working well because the school hasn't done maintenance a since long time ago .
For the second problem , the solution , for me , is to hire someone to do the maintenance and say to all of the students to take care of the school 's machines .
I work as freelancer journalist , prepare reports dealing with the whole situation in the city of Jerusalem , and publish my reports on many of the websites .
I am also committed to preparing monthly reports for the newspaper supplement " The Voice of Women " which is published by the WATC ; the " Women 's Affairs Technical Committee , and I have a collaboration with Environment and Development , a magazine which is published by the Center for development work " Maan " , and other websites and news and media organizations .
The world is sadly lacking in an environmental mind . As a consequence , it caused global warming , which is the most important global problem . It does n't matter to more than three quarters of the world 's population .
Currently , we have got more than six different types of banks on our streets , but as far as I know , it is not sufficient to meet the needs of the environment because , nowadays , we produce a lot of different materials , all of them overproduced and we only learn about this in our home , in our childhood . Accordingly , I am one of the few teenagers in the world worried about it , so I really do help the environment as far as I can .
First of all , at home we recycle plastic , glass , paper and cartons , oils , clothes , batteries , putting organic matter in a special composting bank so that we avoid burning or burying in excess those scraps with other materials , and , finally , all the other things are sent to a special tip so that we avoid dropping them anywhere . Then , when I have time and I see a senior citizen in the street putting their scraps in the wrong bank , I explain to them how they have to recycle and how important it is for our environment that we carefully recycle .
A couple of years ago , I could hardly see any bins in supermarkets and houses .
Nowadays , I see bins everywhere and even a small child of 3 being taught to put unwanted materials in the bin .
It is truly an amazing experience and how much progress my small village has made in 2 years .
However , separate bins for different categories of rubbish are not provided .
So , we can easily see people throwing everything in the same bin .
In spite of throwing rubbish in a bin , we also do some harm to the environment unknowingly .
Then , I suppose that in every country much more renewable energy will be used instead of nuclear energy to ensure a secure future for the next generations , and maybe everybody will use electric cars to reduce the atmospheric pollution .
I think that public transport has a future . Indeed , travelling in a car is much more comfortable , because you do n't have to walk to take a bus or the underground .
Perhaps in the future public transport could be more comfortable for the rest of the people who do n't have a car .
This has some advantages , such as it being more comfortable and faster .
When you travel by bus , you must have a timetable and it is less comfortable than travelling by car .
Sometimes , private transport is cheaper if you go with other people .
On the other hand , private transport is damaging for the planet and we must take care of the planet . We can help to prevent the pollution of the environment if we take public transport , which does n't pollute .
At the moment , there is more than one car per person . That is a problem for me because people do n't take care the of environment .
They prefer to be comfortable .
In conclusion , using public transport causes less damage to the environment and most people prefer .
He performs in many interesting movies and operas .
One of his interesting films is about a musician , and it was popular between 1980 and 2000 .
Life is unpredictable and unforeseen .
The immense possibilities of life give us the opportunity to explore life but sometimes it leads to threats and dangers to our life .
The insurance for non - accidental death is known as general insurance and for life is known as life insurance .
The government should play a key role by providing trustworthy organizations , surveyors , loss assessors etc .
To provide insurance at nominal prices , and making claims should be easy . Give surety so that people can accept and trust the insurance companies .
It gives competition to national companies . By virtue of which they work properly mannerly and give better option to policy holders . People can always buy a nominal premium we should inform them about the types of insurance as well as the benefits of insurance .
Second , soccer is a very interesting game , because when I play soccer I feel very happy .
Recently , I read four great books about Shoah . They were very interesting . My favourite was : " The Book Thief " . I read it for school , but I had already seen the film of this book .
Nowadays , he treats me as botheration .
I was hesitant but later decided to go .
We had been told earlier that Abul kaka had got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from the office . Nonetheless , the performance of the vehicle was awful that day .
I do n't feel comfortable on highways for many reasons .
When I was a youngster , my father and I rode a motorcycle to visit our place using this road .
So we four were occupying the back seat uncomfortably .
I thought I should n't go because those benches were disgraceful for me .
My thoughts are unquestionably better than others ' .
It gave the impression that only going and coming back in a big car was the main purpose of the trip .
That was ridiculous .
We visited Nagar chak with much anticipation .
While I was listening to Noman , I was discerning that I should question more .
They prefer industrialization to nature .
Travelling or moving from one place to another by car is much more convenient than public transport .
It is faster and cleaner and much more comfortable .
You can even take a rest for a while to sleep or to have a nap .
It 's convenient .
But , on the other hand , because , recently , the traffic has been terrifically unbearable : so many cars ; very noisy ; unclean air produced , public transport has become better for saving the planet .
All over the world , people always need advice to keep looking after their environments . First , the municipal should do workshops in schools and universities providing students with tips that should help us to make our environment clean . Second , they should run awareness campaigns about the environment ; for example , telling people to put their rubbish in waste paper baskets , which helps workers to recycle it easily . Finally , to stay healthy , we need a healthy environment .
I discovered a new world .
Krav maga teaches us how to handle ourselves in difficult situations .
The most exciting day of my life was when my sister and I discovered that we would spend one week on a cruise with our friends ! That was a very beautiful holiday !
Every evening we went to the restaurant on the cruiser .
My classmates and I along with our teachers and other classes went to the cinema to see the film " Fantastic Boccaccio " .
It was an interesting experience to go to the cinema for my class and see a film about what I had studied in the Italian lesson and understand better the stories of Boccaccio , one of the most important Italian writers .
Watching the film , we had the possibility to see the characteristics of Boccaccio 's main characters and the different places where the stories took place .
In my opinion , the film was very well made : the registers of the film ( there are two ) tell us five novels with only one main protagonist : love in every situation .
It 's obvious that life nowadays is really different from 50 years ago , so we can predict that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
When it comes to change , we can think of what in our lives is still inconvenient and could probably change .
Most of the work will probably be done by machines . People who lack academic qualifications might find it very hard to get a job . Knowledge might be in demand if people live in the future .
There are some issues that make me worried . The environment is getting worse . We have to come up with methods to solve this and save our Earth .
The relationships between countries are also significant , as we can see discord between countries , hoping that it will not lead to war .
Television entertains as well as educates people .
These days , people are educating themselves by watching the television .
Televison not only provides entertainment , it will also give lots of information about the events around the globe .
Channels like National Geographic and Animal Planet will tell us the animal behaviour and the origins of species .
Few programmes some intellectual programs will increase the creativity of the people .
With a great effort , he sat down on the grass , he felt tired , and had a slight sensation of pain in his chest , sitting there with many sounds in the air , he started to recall ... his face changed is dark , now he had a clear image of eveerything . When he opened the door of the house , his girlfriend was there dying on the floor . Michael remembered everything : the fight , the lies , the screams , the knife ... the blood ; but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Diabetes is an increase of glucose in the blood , There are two types , first Diabetes Type 1 which is present in children , the patient needs insulin every day . Also , this diabetes is caused by the destruction of the insulin released by the person 's immune system .
This diabetes is caused by bad diet of people or because people have a bad life .
Many people think travelling by car is more comfortable for them .
However , they must understand travelling by car is not any kind of exercise .
Please record your message and send it to my email address f9u54t4g245@gmail.com before 24th evening .
This week , I went to the country . It was great fun because we went to the cinema and we ate in a lot of different restaurants .
Hi readers of international sports monthly magazine .
I am writing to sponsorize my favourite sport , the most beautiful sport in the world ;
basketball .
Basketball is a complete sport ; aerobic and anaerobic .
Nowadays , basketball is spreading around the world .
So let 's play basketball .
He is going to go to university next year .
At the weekend he usually plays football or basketball and this year he is learning how to rock climb .
We studied hard together to prepare for the university exam , shared our problems and almost things has relatived with us .
The first year of university , I revealed my love to him .
Unfortunately , he refused me .
Last week , from September 11 to September 21 , we had a mini - vacation .
Also , my uncle , aunt , grandfather and cousins went with us .
I 'm sure you 'll agree that Pompei is the most important archeological site in the world .
Is n't it incredible ?
There is a unique atmosphere !
In particular , in urban areas , for example , Taipei city in Taiwan .
People who live there know the convenient public transport system called MRT ; it 's fast , cheaper and you do n't have to find a parking space .
Besides , it 's harmful and makes the earth 's environment worse because of the emission of so much carbon dioxide .
So , I think the government should have to draw up a proposal to solve the problems between the use for urban areas and countryside .
And think deeply about the problem of protecting the environment .
My family members are very helpful and supportive .
There are my role models . Sometimes we go to the tour programs , it programs . Those are very happy moments .
Steve Ramsay works for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D and lives in Washington D.C. after the Battle of New York .
One day , a S.H.I.E.L.D agent was attacked by a ghost .
But he does n't know he is involved in a conspiracy .
He meets a strong opponent who is a winter soldier when he wants to find the wirepuller .
Besides being excellent exercise , it is also the most comfortable , because it allows me to concentrate , to be with myself , talking and praying to God with each step in the morning .
It is an activity that goes according to the capacity of each person , and doing it each morning improves our health and takes away all the bad from our body .
The graph below gives information about seasonal sales of ice - cream in different places : in an ice - cream van and an indoor swimming pool from Jan to Dec .
First , the graph showed an upward trend for the ice cream van and , in 2014,it had the largest percentage of sales at nearly 5500 dollars from Jul - Sep .
Second , for the indoor swimming pool , it generally appears to be wavy falling , from 2500 dollars in 2012 to 2000 dollars in 2014 . We can infer , it will not rise sharply , and it is impossible for it to fall sharply .
Most people like to have their own car , because they think it is more comfortable and flexible .
But I think that public transport is the future . We need to preserve the environment , this is an imperative for our world , and the solution is to take the point that the governments invest more in public transport , so people do n't need to get a car to be able to have a job and do n't need it for the normal development of their lives .
Also , we have to promote people getting jobs close to their accommodation or getting accommodation close to their jobs , because we have too much pollution . And we could reward companies that hire staff close to the place of work , maybe in a radius of 4 kilometres , and we could reward people that change their accommodation to live near to their job or for going there by bicycle .
Summertime was first converted in 1900 .
I like spring and always wait for it and wait for the summer holidays with impatience .
However , I am stopped by recent tragic developments in foreign countries .
It 's the best , the most beautiful and the most comfortable resort in the South .
I have to start saying that I never imagined swimming as my favorite sport , because until my back injury , I did other sports . I mostly like extreme sports like downhill skiing , skateboarding , martial arts like Aikido , jiujitsu or ninjutsu , but because of my injury I had to start swimming and now I love it .
The reason why I enjoy this sport is because I feel free when I am in the water , it is so relaxing and I have read it is the most complete sport because you work the whole body .
If you want to start swimming , I think you should look for a swimming teacher because if ca n't swim , you need one , and if you can swim but not well , if you are not in practice and know your swimming style is not the best , I recommend professional assistance .
More time that you do n't have that assistance , it is going to be more difficult to improve your style and enjoy swimming more , because if you really know how to swim you will have more resistance in the water .
She works at a language school at the local university .
Then , she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her , standing just beside the bed .
She was so scared .
She tried screaming and calling me as I was sleeping peacefully beside her .
Even worse , two of them started whispering in her ears , die … die .. .
She reproached me for not waking her up despite the fact that she had been calling me so eagerly .
- experience it when they are very tired physically and very stressed .
- repeatedly dream again if they rarely awake themselves .
Some experience this very easily and often .
Hi ! My name is Cátia and I am a student of electrical engineering .
I am in the third year at university , I do n't know what the Master 's will be that I am going to do , but I want a Master 's related to programming .
I have many difficulties with programming , but I think that if I work hard I can overcome my difficulties .
In the last few days , I and my group did some experiments for our project .
We used some resistors and a source of two hundred and thirty volts to control the temperature of water .
Initially , we had some problems because the resistors did not increase the temperature enough to warm the water .
I am going to try to read these books to improve my English , because in the future I intend to take the first certificate .
This is very important for me because when I work for a company I will need a certificate ! ! !
In my opinion , you must go to Madrid or Barcelona because they are the most attractive .
Spanish food is fantastic , there are a lot of restaurants for you to eat at and I think that the food is more expensive than in your country .
If you do n't like Spanish food , you can go to a restaurant with food from another country , but I know you love it .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I 'm so glad you are coming to my country . I 'll give you some suggestions , hoping that you can have a wonderful summer vacation !
If you want a short - term job , I think a restaurant is the best one for you .
You should be able to have a great experience .
When it comes to travelling , you must not miss the night markets .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I think that public transport is always going to be very important in our life , because not all people have the possibility to buy a car , and because public transport is less expensive than a car . So for that reason , public transport in the future could exist , because public transport is a necessity all over the world , not only because of money , but also for the facility to take a bus or any other public transport .
I went to the nature section , which is interesting as it is about natural aspects on earth like the elements , rocks and periods of life related to organisms .
The section was big and it presented a lot of information in a scientific manner , some sections had complete information while others had not .
It was a period of time in earth 's history when temperatures fell globally , causing ice sheets and glaciers to form far from the north and south poles .
He uses a rule for debates : proposition + result = positive or negative ( Why ? )
But before the lesson , he had to have lunch with his family and take the dog to the vet 's for his annual vaccine .
Peter had a quick lunch in ten minutes , spent another two minutes finding the bike and putting the dog in the basket ; at the vet 's surgery , three people were waiting , so Peter was forced to wait .
Unfortunately , Anne , his sister , had just taken the bike , so he was forced to walk to the nearest supermarket .
After an exhausting afternoon , Peter had a bit of luck . In fact , his father , Jack , had just come back from work , so he could go to get the milk and giving him a lift .
First , I want to introduce myself .
If I am in public and want to give a presentation , I always get nervous .
I love writing but I am not confident about my grammar .
An excessive amount of cars on the road is not an option as this could cause problems in most metropolitan areas .
There would be a tremendous amount of pollution and traffic jams .
As the population grows , you will see an increasing problem .
Therefore , public transportation is the future and more and more people will be using the metro , public buses etc .
I think that sport is important for discipline in life .
My favourite sport is football . It is a complete sport ; there are aggression , mentality and fun .
My favourite football club is Napoli . It is the heart club . For this team , I feel indescribable emotions ... when I see my team , I smile in moments of joy , I cry in moments of sadness and suffering and rejoice when they score and win the game .
Working in your own company is very challenging because you deal with a lot of areas , manage all departments and learn about business , management , economics , sales , engineering , technical support and other skills .
You are responsible for your workers and customer satisfaction . However , it is very satisfying to see how your own company is growing and your customers returning because they loved your work .
That work looks depressing , demanding and stressful , but it is very rewarding and if you like the challenges you will never be bored .
They are so kind , friendly , and stressed because they have a lot of problems nowadays . The level of poverty , the standard of living , the fixed cost is increasing dramatically and the purchasing power is decreasing .
So , if you want to work in Egypt , you must have complete information about the job ( location , salary , incentives , allowances , work environment , position title , company type , policy , mission , vision )
Military service is when people are forced by the government to be a part of the army to serve and protect the country .
Thus , there is a source of agreement and another source of disagreement , which is freedom of choice and mental maturity .
Otherwise , when people are forced by the government , they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted .
If people do military service when they are just 18 , they may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who works in the military may request the soldiers that everything frequently be regular .
People should not complain about anything even if they seem to be right .
But after a period of time , people could develop their obedience , especially young people ; they are likely to become more independent people .
In my city , we do n't have a regular policy of care for the environment .
There have been many projects to improve the care for the environment .
In my country , you can make a lot of effort to take care of the environment , but the bad attitude of our people is a big problem .
That is because we do n't take interest in the problems of others .
We think that our authorities are responsible for these matters .
So , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
If everyone demonstrated a better attitude , it would be possible to improve our environment .
Nowadays , we grow up with the possibility of choosing a lot of sports .
The favorite sport of many people is football , whereas my favorite is basketball .
Also , I have met great friends who play basketball .
Every sport focuses on some parts of the body , but basketball is the most complete sport .
It is true that basketball requires a lot of physical activity , but a good mental attitude is very important .
You ca n't be disappointed because you do n't get a point or have a bad day , because the other players can sympathise with you .
Adolescence has always been the hardest part in anybody 's whole life .
Turning , in a fleeting glimpse , into an adult , perceiving the other side of life , how tough and complicated it is , trying to deal with its different circumstances .
However , here you are completely different , made of life lessons , preferring to keep a stiff upper lip , cowering in your own reality .
Yes , television entertains , but it can also educate .
Television can improve knowledge of current affairs .
Television helps us to find the fields that interest us , like music , sports , movies or nature .
These days , television allows us to see events all around the world .
However , there are quite a lot of disadvantages to television .
In particular , fake news spreads faster without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how they make use of the opportunity .
TV was and is seen as entertainment , but have you ever questioned whether it is more than just entertainment ?
Are we subconsciously educating ourselves ?
Now that is an interesting question . We can watch anything from news to Catfish the TV show . In the name of entertainment , we are actually learning .
The truth is we are always learning , but how we learn is another matter . The main types of learners are auditory , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV stimulates two learning styles , which are visual and auditory .
Some may argue that TV just does not have sufficient content for us to be able to learn . Others may argue that TV is an amazing source of learning , e.g. we learn about new technology via a mobile phone advert aired on TV .
I have personally picked up information I would not have come across otherwise . For example , I have been able to learn that the new BMW seven series , has ambient lighting , it can pull in and out of the garage at the touch of a button , it 's computerised system can read different road surfaces and adapt it s driving .
So , have you ever asked yourself whether television entertains , but can also educate ?
Electronic was born .
It made everything possible .
The circuit is characterised by long straights and chicanes , which makes it possible to achieve high speeds .
In my opinion , driving at high speed on the long straight could cause overheating of the cars ' engines and they can blow up .
The rugged kerbs could cause the suspension to crack .
I think cutting down the trees which are around the circuit and undercutting kerbs could reduce danger and technical problems on the track and we should reduce the long straights .
Global power and politics are now surprisingly centered on those which have an apex maturity of science .
Addiction to authoritative nature over other leads to the huge production of war weapons , converting the blessing nature of science into critics .
Despite all of the assistance of science in daily life , it is not without criticism in different areas .
Science replaces human labor with tools , but what about happiness ?
There is no definition of happiness in scientism or how could it get through the scientific user manual ?
Very often , it has been criticized for changing indigenous cultures through so - called luxurious development that is contradictory to religious faith .
Science is concerned only with information about the world , whatever it is , and sometimes in unethical conclusions without considering morality .
But living in the 21st century , it 's difficult to blame science when we are benefited through its technological applications in our everyday life to an ever - greater extent .
In fact , they keep the woods clean and the owners send the loggers to remove dead trees now or those that could lead to hazards , but every time you remove a tree , it is immediately replaced with a young plant so that the environment does not undergo changes that will lead out balance the system .
For waste management across the country , even in the countryside , we have bins for recycling paper , plastic , glass and waste .
Travelling using any form of transport has become one of our needs . In the past , people used to spend hours waiting for public transport . Now , we can afford any of those modern cars at the dealership .
Another disadvantage is the unclean chairs on public transport .
Those are the main reasons that could make public transport disappear .
Firstly , it is a good idea for young children to do physical activity . That is the first step to doing exercise , then competing in sports will encourage competitors to make an extra effort .
Also , just for young children that are in the process of growth and development , physical exercise is essential , because they can have a healthier life .
Young children try to make an effort , and want to win at this age , and if they train , the results are better and that encourages them to keep training .
In the future , adults that are able to obtain more achievements and be more responsible , and you can have a good social life if you compete in or do sports .
In addition , stress is a clear disadvantage of competing , because competitors are trying to win and this can frustrates .
Finally , I think that competing in sports has some benefits and disadvantages , but when it is controlled there are some benefits that help you in your whole life .
For upcoming enhancement , I would like to inform you that there are no longer any public transportation services since travel by car is more convenient .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to outline what shopping facilities there are in our town and write some tips for tourists with different preferences .
Shopping facilities
Although our town is quite small , there are a wide variety of shops , such as clothes shops , sports shops , toy shops or book shops .
Even though the shops are not large , there are remarkable goods . For example , nice running shoes or valuable books .
Possibility of the shops
If you have a small child , you can visit toy shops , which offer many cars and helicopters .
Conclusion
To sum up , I think our town offers many interesting shops .
Halloween is a traditional holiday in the USA but the original history came from the Celtic people .
The immigrants came with this religious culture and with time it has become part of American culture .
Today , this holiday is celebrated around the world and you can have fun with a party or dress up in a costume .
The picture below illustrates how to make bank notes .
First is to design the note , including background color , artwork and security issues .
Second is to prepare metal plates using qualified machinists .
Last is the key step ; inspection .
It is of great importance to inspect the printed sheets .
The issue of whether there is no future for public transport is a topic that has caused an ongoing argument . In my essay , i intend to discuss contravening viewpoint in more depth .
First , some people believe that public transport is a significant part of our life and it 's more difficult to rely only on our cars .
My favorite way to travel is by plane because I like to be fast and , in my life , I hate waiting . In my opinion , the plane is the best for me . For example , when you want to go somewhere you need to reach there so quickly , you do n't want to take a long time . And the plane is the best way of travelling in the world and is safer than other ways . You can see on the pollution of people who have had an accident , how often an accident happens by plane , so anyway if it has happened , I ca n't imagine it . Finally , I hope everyone who likes to travel is safe and sound and has a safe journey .
First of all , Television has less viewers nowadays .
Most people turn to Internet websites or applications like Netflix or Youtube .
Now let 's go back to those days when young people still watched television for entertainment .
There were a lot of programs on television .
Most people watched the news , movies , or TV shows on television .
As I remember , there were educational channels like Discovery and National Geographic .
Those channels always contained a lot of new technology .
Some people may think that only these kinds of channel can provide educational knowledge , and some people do n't consider watching these channels as entertainment .
But these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational .
So television entertains , but can it also educate ?
My studies at the Tecnologico de Monterrey are demanding and challenging because it has a very high educative score worldwide , but also has so many good things . For example , we have a lot of exchanges all around the world . When you have the opportunity to do an exchange , you have to deal with the language and the culture of the other country . That means you have to be responsible for studying the basic things about that country , but all of this is worthwhile because when you are there you have so much fun .
I advise people to start this sport , because it is complete and makes your mind and body feel very good .
When I was fourteen years old , I won a championship because , in that period , I swam as a competitive athlete .
It was a real satisfaction and I was happy .
I think this sport is the most complete compared to the other sports .

Introduction
The aim of the report is to write about how our town takes care of the environment .
Conclusion
We do everything to make our town more green . Our citizens always have new ideas that make a difference to our daily lives .
It is common that more and more people get overweight , because of too much fast food and an unhealthy lifestyle .
Now some scientists have suggested having warnings on some types of food and drink .
Everything has to happen fast .
First of all , we need to make people aware of the current environmental situation in order to take action to help the environment .
This action would decrease the amount of gas emitted into the environment .
Talking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it into the following types : metal , plastic , organic , glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman .
For example , organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer , the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory and so can the glass .
Therefore , the environment is not going to recover if we do not decide to play our part in dealing with this global problem .
As we 've seen , these days , the number of cars is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increase in the number of private cars .
Governments around the world have been talking a lot about the measures that should be taken to improve the quality of public transport .
No doubt travelling by car is quite a lot better than going by public bus .
Although Louis felt nervous , she realised this was the opportunity of a lifetime .
I am struggling at school .
I will start with old vehicles . If we do n't do any maintenance , this type will be damaged and we will lose it .
In the future , every person will use his own car and there will be no need for public transport . This type of transport has a route and just takes you to specific places and you ca n't use it to go to small streets .
But in some countries , you can use the underground ( metro ) . It is more advanced than old types , like bus or taxi . The underground is faster and cleaner and .
Michael is a 22-year - old man , he has studied for a degree in electrical engineering and now he wants to put his knowledge into practice .
He went to buy a newspaper to search for a job . He looked at all the advertisements but he never found the one he needed .
When he was a kid , he wanted to work in a video games shop , so luckily for him there was a job available at the Play Station store .
Of course , he did not think twice and went to print out his CV because the interview was that day . Then he took a shower and dressed for the occasion .
He prepared something to eat fast , brushed his teeth , he just picked up his mobile , keys and money , but he had n't noticed that he was forgetting his CV .
It is an interesting activity ! There is the Fifa World Cup too !
Next , we will have a soccer competition .
Soccer is an interesting sport but we need to be careful .
Unfortunately , my best friend deceived me . I do n't know how she managed it , but she hurt me .
My cousins are very reliable , like my grandmother and my parents .
For all rules there are exceptions .
You need to discover who is your best friend . As you go through life , you will learn who is who .
So an important historical place is St. Katherine 's castle .
It 's on top of a big hill with difficult slopes to climb up because the most important property is that it is impregnable .
In the reconquest age the stronghold never fell to a direct assault . Finally the Castellan 's army , after a long siege , forced the government to surrender it .
Then , in the 18th century , the Napoleonic army lived in it until the end of the Spanish war of independence .
I try to do all the activities in class .
I do n't have enough time to practise and do activities at home .
I need to speak and participate more in class .
We speak most of the time , so it is good to develop our confidence and fluency to converse .
Next , a boat is usually very big , so we can do many activities on it , such as dancing , drinking .
All in all , travelling on the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable , in addition , it is very safe .
Have you ever been rafting ? Do you know how amazing it is to do this cool sport ? If you do n't know anything about it , it 's high time you did !
Therefore , we went to join a sports centre which had taken over organising this amazing outdoor activity .
Rafting lets you burn all your adrenaline while you try to get down a river in a mini - boat .
In addition , you 'll enjoy the breathtaking landscapes around you and you 'll also see a vast range of wildlife on both sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clothes and to bring sun cream with you .
In my life I have had big experiences that have made me change and mature .
One of the most important experiences , I think , was coming to study in Tijuana .
I am studying Nutrition at the University . That is why I am living in Tijuana .
Before I came to live in Tijuana , I was really nervous because I had to leave everything and because it would be a change in my life .
To sum up , coming to live in Tijuana was a real challenge for me .
Now I am so independent and I have learned how to live alone .
I live in a small village in countryside with only a few people .
Even if we are a small village , we take care of the environment through the use of photovoltaic systems on the roofs of many buildings , such as the nursery school and other buildings that have this system to produce energy .
The garbage truck picks up paper once a week , plastic two times per month and undifferentiated three times a week for all people who live in my country .
My district makes my village clean and it usually tries to make it attractive with new social initiatives for the community .
We have been friends since we started to talk , but our friendship has changed over time .
When we were 12 , we played in the garden with balls and with the other boys and girls , but when we were 12 years old , everything changed . We did n't want to play in the garden because we preferred cinema or watching TV .
For this reason , I think that friendship is such an important thing in life .
I think the opposite . I believe that public transportation has a really huge future .
It is true that there are a lot of users that want to use a car and that number is growing . There are also a lot of people that do n't have the possibility to have a car and some use public transportation for many reasons , like the price , because it is easier to get to the place by public transportation rather than a car , or because of the traffic . Sometimes it is so exhausting for people to drive for many hours and even sometimes public transportation is faster .
The population is growing so fast , we need public transportation . It is important .
Public transportation is convenient for some people and some people think the car is more convenient . Finally , we will need public transportation in the future .
In our opinion , globalization is a good thing that is happening to us , allowing us to interact with the whole world , so we can get to know cultures , monuments , etc .
It brings us a lot of opportunities to change and , in some cases , to get a better life in other countries and find a job with the highest salary .
However , we need to change some things in the world , more than these is to change a lot of things in third world countries , because it is not acceptable that in the twenty - first century a person has to live on less than a dollar per day .
Firstly , the city of Vancouver has a programme called Go Green Vancouver that will protect the environment by separating the rubbish by containers . At the same time , there is a collaboration from the city hall of any district that it will provide 3 containers for each house ; one for paper one for bottles , and the last one for rubbish materials .
Secondly , there is a programme with the water company to cut down on the use of water by 50% using a recycling water treatment and recirculating to the house without dumping the waste and so saving our planet .
Finally , every city hall is improving the care of the environment because there is an incentive programme from the government , such that if they cut the of every house by 50% , city halls will get more money from central government .
I strongly believe that grammar is not the most important element for speaking English . If you know grammar , you only know certain rules for writing , but I think that speaking is more important than writing , because when you go to any place in the world , you have to be prepared to talk and understand whatever they say to you . In this part you may notice that if you do n't know vocabulary , you wo n't understand anything . But here is another topic . Whether you understand or not , you have to notice the way that people talk to you , and try to understand what the person is trying to say .
With reference to your e - mail , we discovered that the price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .
Please be advised of the right amount on the settlement date .
It is clear that technology has provided us with several options for communication .
Another way this change is evident is that social networking or applications such as Skype , FaceTime and Facebook are widely used to stay in touch with family , friends and relatives
My favourite sport is basketball .
When I 'm playing this sport I have great moments and I learn more and I will have more experience in the future .
Basketball is recognized by people all over the world .
I am writing to apply for the job advertised on your webpage .
Yours faithfully
I am writing to apply for the job in a summer camp advertised on February 9th in the local newspaper .
I have experience of arranging different sports activities for children .
And there is good communication between us .
In my opinion , every family must have good communication , because I think communication is one of the most important things in our life .
We use communication all the time .
Because people have to use many communication techniques to communicate with other people .
However , families that do n't have good communication do n't have a good life .
If we want to have a good life , we must have good communication in our families .
Now , when I swim in the open pool , I am overwhelmed by positive emotions .
Apart from that , you see new places and you have fun . You also learn about other cultures , historical facts , you also learn to respect other people and their customs .
In conclusion , I think that it is the best way to open your mind . Not the only way , but yes , the best way .
Many countries have truly started to be concerned about the environment and worried about globe warming . In schools , teachers are doing their best to educate children in how to take care of their schools and keep them tidy . Also , they teach them in how to plant trees in the public gardens of their towns .
Although the government strict so many laws and taxes on the people who do not pay their taxes to the council for removal of the rubbish from towns and villages , in the biggest polluted city in the world , people have started to use bicycles and cycle instead of driving their cars to reduce the pollution of their city . Also , they invented different ways to plant even every little area which can be planted to keep their city clean and attractive .
For example , if we completely rely on using cars it is going to increase the use of gasoline .
Apparently , it is going to cause more pollution and more global warming issues .
Public transport is really important and it has a lot of advantages to help humanity .
For instance , San Francisco is a great example of an incredible city . The variety of choices of public transport is remarkable .
In spite of the cost of these facilities , it is going to be expensive , but it is necessary .
In conclusion , governments should work on that , because people need public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car .
First of all , nowadays , wherever we go we can find Italian restaurants easily .
but I think Italian restaurants are getting famous .
On the other hand , it could be complicated , but nobody complains .
I think that 's why this city can maintain a safe environment .
It attracts many fashionable people .
During the voyage , we disembarked in the Bahamas and CoCo kay , which is a private island belonging to the cruise . We went to the beach and played so many games .
To sum up , this trip was the best experience we have had in our lives , because we made friends , visited a new country and we had a lot of fun .
I love horses and I do horse riding at Djursholms ridklubb .
But let me tell you it was a concert by the Lala Band and I have taken and I especially , I was the cameraman .
I heard that you really have a lot of work activities now .
The main character is so cool , charismatic , and patient .
The movie is already a success , opening at the box office with a $ 36 million endorsement .
I am very excited about seeing Kevin Heart and Will Ferrell 's characters come together .
I hope that you consider my application and contact me about the job .
I checked connections between Warsaw and Berlin and she will be at Berlin Ostbf station at 11.10 .
To put it simply , the new generation has decided to take their driving licence and I have seen this around me , with my colleagues , my friends , my family .
This affirmation : travelling by car is so much more convenient , says everything . For example , if we think of the time we spend on waiting for a bus to arrive at our destination , and the traffic is one of a lot of things that makes everyone prefer to buy a car . It is more practical and faster .
We can stop and do some mental arithmetic and we can see the large amount of money we spend each year .
I am part of the new generation who in the future will use cars and the public transport will disappear .
Varese has many attractions among which there is the lake , where I like to go .
In the argument , the author asserted that the city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza .
The author claimed that the business dropping is caused by the increasing number of skateboard users .
Likewise , the skateboard users brought a lot of garbage that affects the stores in the plaza .
Based on the author 's two concerns , the statement that came to the conclusion that to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision .
First of all , there is a contradiction in the argument .
If more skateboard users are willing to go to Central Plaza , there are more customers to help the growth of business .
From this point view , the decrease in business must be caused by other factors , but not skateboard users .
Furthermore , the products for sale in the stores might not meet customers ' needs .
Second , the author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboard users is not only happen by specific person , whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing .
Those problems suggest that there is not sufficient security in Central Plaza .
Moreover , the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboard users taking over pedestrian walking space .
To solve this problem , the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding , and separate the different spaces for walking and skateboarding .
To sum up , the author 's prediction wo n't happen if the city prohibits skateboarding .
In contact author 's concerns , the increasing skateboard users would bring more potential to improve business in Central Plaza .
On the other hand , the author should provide profound discussion why people who come to Central Plaza do n't shop there .
To strengthen the author 's conclusion , the author should put the factors above into the argument .
Finally , the consequence of cocaine is death . If you inhale cocaine all the time or a lot , you will die prematurely .
In conclusion , cocaine is the most dangerous addiction , because you die prematurely and your body is destroyed by the cocaine .
There is an increasing trend towards private transport so that public transport will be reduced in the future .
Ultimately , public transport will be negligible in the future .
The main one is that nowadays people are incredibly busy with their day to day life , so that they do n't like to spend their valuable time waiting for regular transport . Also , public transport causes lots of pollution which is harmful for human beings .
For example , lunchtime travelling is very dangerous for pregnant women due to emissions of carbon mon oxide , which affects red blood cells and irritates the respiratory system . As a result , they prefer private transport systems to prevent such hazards .
To illustrate , if teenage girls travel by public transport every day who will interact with society beyond the limitation.so it is a big challenge for them .
I am writing this e - mail because we want to hire your company to do the accounting for our company .
Principally , we need to have the Financial States , so we need them as fast as you can because , if not , we will have legal problems .
The line which represents the indoor swimming pool remains fairly steady , from approximately 1800 to 2500 , the period of every year from April to June and October to December has the highest outstanding achievement , whilst the sales are downwards overall .
However , compared to the line for the indoor swimming pool , the difference of seasonal achievement of the ice - cream van is considerably larger .
Overall , the achievement of the ice - cream van is better than the indoor swimming pool , from about 1100 to 5500 .
The discrepancy between these two places is great .
The best sales achievement of the van is 4500 , 5000 , 5500 respectively .
But there was no one , absolutely no one . I was scared , I yelled and screamed , looked and looked , but I had no success .
Public transport was created to relieve the traffic in big town centres and also to facilitate workers ' commutes .
I particularly decided to drive to do my day - to - day tasks such as , shopping , visiting friends , church and so on .
I 'm a great people person and have great knowledge of computers , organising activities for children and also I 'm a jr . chef .
I hope you can grant me the opportunity to have a meeting .
Mario Monteagudo
What a nice poem , at least mention the name of a proficient poet too .
I also hope to meet a group of old friends once again to revive the wonderful and unforgettable shared memories of student life .
If it is unspeakably for public readings , thus mention it in the email .
My favourite sport is basketball .
I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work . You have to understand each other .
He is a Polish basketball player .
He is really tall , he is 202 centimeters .
My history of basketball was very short .
Television plays an essential part in our life ; we turn it on nearly every day , since it can make life more interesting .
Television entertains us , it can also educate .
For one , a show broadcast on television may enlighten us and give us some enlightenment .
So , why ca n't television educate us ?
For another , there are many different types of programs which can broaden our views ; they give details of education , plus other meaningful information , such as documentaries , talk shows and so on .
Television is just like a kaleidoscope , there are various materials provided for us .
To sum up , television entertains ; it can also educate .
Syria has a lot of good restaurants .
The Damascus restaurant at the centre of the city is quite a nice place to have a meal .
This restaurant also has games for children , which they can spend their time playing with .
It 's a very nice restaurant which I like the most .
Though public transport is cheaper and one could get to know many people , and increase one 's network .
At those times , a car is convenient to use .
Ever increasing crowds in cities and traffic problems are increasing .
The future houses will be different not in terms of architecture , but in terms of functionality .
Different people will need different functions , options and functionality in the future house .
From : horses , steam vehicle , first petrol and gas car to future cars when the fuel will be electricity .
The film tells us the story of Monica ( Scarlett Johansson ) and her routine life on " Cretacro " , an enormous mysterious island located in the Pacific Ocean . The problems start when Monica falls in love with Martin .
Martin was a solitary and quiet guy who moved to Cretacro to relax , but he changed when he met Monica in the main restaurant .
One of my main responsibilities is preparing something by 7.30 am so I get up at 6 every morning and I leave home for work at 6.45 am .
I really like to read everything I can catch and I will have a look in every book to see what it is about .
I have all her collected works at home and I enjoy a lot having a trip with her characters in Bath and all around . I like to read children 's books and I had lots of fun with Beatrix Potter books and all her little animals ; with Peter and all of them .
When I need a book for my English classes , I go to Waterstone or to Amazon .
Nowadays , there are many modes of public transportation , such as underground , buses , etc . , but it is a reality that people prefer to travel by car .
Currently , traveling by car is more useful than public transport ; you can move around the city and reduce the time it takes . Sometimes you can share your car with friends or family and this way of travelling is cheaper .
Teacher , I know travelling by car is the most convenient .
Nevertheless , I believe that technology will make progress in the future .
Moreover , we still have a lot of things which we can and must improve , like security , comfort and economic resources .
On the other hand , we should know that every means of transportation may be changed in 50 years .
For all these reasons , I think that we should be prudent when we assess means of transportation .
According to Wordsworth , a poet is not an ordinary man , he has a greater sensitivity and knowledge .
The power of imagination makes him become a teacher : he has to show men how to understand their feelings and the nature that surrounds them .
He is the only one who can produce poetry in a simple language , thanks to imagination and memory .
I live in a big city and I have the opportunity to see a lot of tourists during the year .
Sometimes I give them some information about the names of streets or where the main monuments are .
I have no particular problem helping them , but I often have some doubts about suggesting a place to go shopping .
The reason is that in my city there are a lot of good shopping facilities for tourists .
An example could be to have free entry to the Campidoglio museum if you buy a local newspaper .
As you see , there are a lot of opportunities for tourists to spend their money in my city .
My town makes great efforts to take care of the environment . They have put many bins in the streets to keep it clean and they prevent private transport on many days to keep the air clean . They plant trees to absorb co2 and release oxygen , they build factories away from the houses of citizens to prevent the respiratory diseases which are a result of air pollution from factories . So , not only my country itself but also individuals follow a proper procedure to keep the environment clean .
Football is my favourite sport and I enjoy it because it is an aggressive game and fun .
Then , researchers found out that Pal Enger , the most famous art thief in Norway , was the person who had stolen the painting .
3 months ago , he wanted 1 million dollars for the painting , but the Norwegian government said no .
Finally , the Norwegian police got the painting back thanks to a police investigation .
I have developed organizational and time management skills through my work with different companies .
In particular , I am highly skilled at welcoming and directing customers .
About my personality , I am outgoing and enthusiastic .
I also have problem - solving skills .
In my previous job , I was paid the compliment that
I can provide extraordinary service with a smile , even if I was in an unexpected situation .
With these qualifications and personality , I believe that they will prove me to be an ideal candidate for 5-star Cabin Crew at Qatar Airways .

Wasting time is a huge issue in our lives . A lot of knowledge is related to time , such as history , education and health .
I think that there is a future for public transport , because there are still people who can not afford to buy a car , even though travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to consider that people need to earn sufficient money to support their families and be able to buy a car .
I 'm interested in this job because at the moment I haven't got a job .
In the workplace I 'm a responsible person , I am never late .
Also , I always work with children and I have a teaching qualification . I'm a friendly person and I have a good CV .
My experience of this job is extensive .
I like to do sports activities and educational activities .
My favourite activities are out in the open air .
I like to prepare my activities a week before , then when I have to do this activity it is quicker .
In terms of making bank notes , the picture below demonstrates the process of making them .
There are mainly 4 steps : design , preparation , printing and inspecting .
Firstly , personnel design the background colour , the artwork and the security features on the bank notes , which is also done in process of other card , such , such as notes for supermarkets .
Then , in the preparation process , skilled machinists prepare metal plates for printing .
After sheets of bank notes are printed , there are differences and specials for it , it uses special ink , and prints colors on both sides , and images are slightly raised .
Finally , inspectors at the bank manually check all printing sheets and divide them into three categories : " bad sheets " are sent for disposal , where things are securely destroyed ; " Good quality sheets " will go for packaging and distribution , where sheets are cut , packed and dispatched .
I 'd like to write on this subject because it 's a very important topic .
My favourite sport is football . I like it so much . It means a lot to me . It means partnership , teamwork , entertainment , exercise .
I advise anyone who dreams of being a member of the most famous teams to work on himself a lot and play football a lot to be professional in this sport and show a lot of matches & followed by captain supervised on him
This issue is not clear - cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding on a career in our life .
I think that , on balance , it is more important to try to get satisfaction .
We work eight hours a day , so if we submerge in a bloody pond for a long time , we could definitely make ourselves frustrated .
I would choose a job with satisfaction .
Customer satisfaction brings me happiness .
Also , the satisfaction of the customers pushes me to work harder and be better at my job .
Job satisfaction could make us to purchase perfection .
As a result , job satisfaction is a good way to get paid better .
I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customers a fabulous dish .
They also have a playground where children can play and moms can sit on benches and gray when grandparents accompany their grandchildren and a red deck painted with some dolls that say ,
Possibly , we will live in space or underground .
In the future , everything could change .
A variety of negative impacts appear as a result of rapid urbanization .
Not only the growing proportion of impervious surfaces , but also the " false " green infrastructure contributes to it .
Mountains of studies have demonstrated that green infrastructure is an economical , beautiful and effective strategy to control stormwater .
However , urban flooding keeps raging , even when the amount of green infrastructure fulfils the stormwater - control needs in some areas .
What is the obstacle that stopped these green infrastructures from providing the ecosystem service of mitigating and eliminating urban flooding ?
As you know , soccer is a sport which has many people in a team , so it requires us to unite and assist each other .
Most girls do n't like this . I think that it brings us energy , we need to do exercise , have a reasonable diet ... and so on .
This article is about what I think about the efficiency of public transport .
When I lived for more than 12 years in the countryside , I was dependent on buses and trains .
Spontaneous activities were impossible as you always had to plan in advance .
I do agree television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed for several reasons .
First , this kind of advertisement should be forbidden on account of the fact that young children are still very vulnerable .
For instance , when I was three years old , I used to be captivated by all the toys which were presented in TV commercials just because of the way they were presented .
Secondly , I am also opposed to the allowance of this advertising because of the severe consequences it has on the parents ' and child 's relationships .
It is common to see parents having issues with their kids because of this kind of commercial .
Many parents have an unhealthy relationship , or even a wrecked relationship , with their kids .
One day , Sophia got really excited about an advertisement for a barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy .
Unfortunately , my cousin did not have enough money to buy it , but her daughter - a three - year - old kid - did not understand it and got angry with Patricia , not speaking to her for three weeks !
In conclusion , I am strongly in favour of this statement . Advertisements for young kids , not only upto 5 but upto 8 years old should be forbidden because of the kid 's vulnerability and the risk to their parents ' relationships with them .
Finally , if the advertisements are still broadcast , it is essential some educational politics comes with them , valorizing and teaching kids about understanding their parents .
I read your advertisement in my newspaper last week .
I did a one - week internship in a restaurant in my village .
I 'm really interested in that job .
I am writing in response to your advertisement which I saw in " The Daily Magazine " last week .

The people in my town deal with rubbish by healthy methods . The citizens collect the rubbish and throw it in big boxes far away from the city .
Tanta will be an attractive city and it will be an important tourist destination in the future .
It is a fact that pollution is one of the biggest concerns of the modern world .
The reason can be attributed to increased consumerism and lack of awareness about waste management .
In the following paragraphs , I am going to analyze these issues in a detailed way to provide a solution .
I fully understand why it is so difficult to decide which activity is more important for you .
I think I would have the same dilemma .
However , sometimes we need to sacrifice something when we do n't have enough time for everything .
In conclusion , I think you should give up your music classes .
Nowadays , cars are more affordable than ever .
With the development of technology , people will use other means of transport .
Bearing in mind that society is also changing , people will tend to choose a place of work which is near their home and wo n't need to spend time travelling .
We are witnessing a great development in working from home these days , which will also lead to fewer people using public transport .
Three Suggestions to be a Doctor
Do you want to be a doctor ? Many people around the world want to help people , so they choose to study medical .

If people live the same way as now , in the future , people will be considered as working robots instead of human beings .
When I was a junior high school student , I enjoyed playing basketball with my classmates .
For several reasons , I really liked to play basketball . First , playing basketball can train your muscles and make the body healthier . Second , my classmates and I all know how to win a game from basketball because basketball is a team sport .
If you play basketball and enjoy the game , you just go to the basketball court with a basketball , and try to throw the ball into the basket again and again .
Three paradigms result from the attempt to characterize Spanish tourism research epistemologically through the study of the AECIT Conference proceedings .
They are distinguished mainly by the disciplines from which they come : marketing and management , economics and geography .
Also , for low income families , who could n't afford to buy new cars , public transposition will help them to survive .
I 'm a very happy person and very interested in cooking and all things about the kitchen . It 's cool . My dream job is cook .

A comparison between people who like to use public transport and private transport shows that the former can save money and time but they are also much more relaxed than people who use private transport .
In the modern growing world , the basic needs of the general public are increasing day by day and their expectations of quality of life have taken on new dimensions .
But today , things are changing and technology plays a significant role in our lives . The automobile industry increased its vertical and having a car has become a necessity rather than a luxury .
We can see nowadays , more and more people would prefer to use their own car instead of buses or taxis because they feel comfortable and mobile in it .
I believe that as soon as the automobile industry develops new technology in cars , people will be more keen to use their own vehicle instead of public transport .
There are many reasons responsible for a better understanding between parents and child .
The first reason is none other than the generation gap .
As far as I know , how to better understanding between parent and child .
On the one hand , we could take a communication forum . It could share everyone 's thoughts .
Furthermore talking with parents can provide argued with them .
Sport increases our physical performance .
Football is a simple sport where the players must kick the ball into the opponents ' goal . In this sport , you principally improve the leg muscles , but all your body moves .
However , football is very competitive .
These days a lot of children wish to be professional players and they practise this sport all the time and everywhere to improve their technique .
Football is great fun and you can play it anywhere with anyone .

" The Exorcist " is one of the most exciting and astonishing thrillers that I have seen in my life .
The actors ' performances are sublime , and they make you feel afraid throughout the film .
Even though is destacable the fidelity with the text of the novel .
One thing that I find interesting , is that this film is atemporal . I mean that you can watch it in any decade of your life , and it always seems like a contemporary film .
Nowadays , with the development of society , a large number of forests and wetlands are replaced by tower blocks and transport networks .

My town takes care of the environment , because the people of my town try to plant as many trees and plants as they can .
The people of my town try to plant plants in the centre or anywhere that is too polluted , so they try to keep the air at recommended levels . In the morning , a lot of people go on foot to work or to school , or ride a bike , or they take the bus .
Travelling by car is convenient , but for most people , public transport is very important and much needed .
Not all people can afford to make journeys by car . A car is easy and cozy also , but public transport is fair and is very affordable for all classes of people .
Public transport mainly means public bus . People used to travel long distances by public bus . It is possible to carry large numbers of people to different places by bus .
Why do cultural differences sometimes cause the division of a country ?
Recently , Scotland really has ' Hit the world ' because some of the Scotch have tried their best for the Scotland referendum .
Although I knew that there was some conflict between England and Scotland , the vote really shocked me .
- It goes without saying that cars are much more convenient than late trains , but I can not agree with the overall statement , although I do abhor using public transport .
I have been travelling with both for years , and I reckon everyone ends up needing public transport one day or another .
I would be a tad oblivious thinking vehicle ownership is granted beforehand when younger .
As a grown - up now , I know full well how much more affordable public transport is , albeit less than before .
Richard 's parents are good neighbours .
In this area there are a lot of clothes shops and supermarkets , but there are n't any sports shops .
The rapid advance of information technology and the development of Internet networks enable the evolution of banking activities at a comprehensive level .
The connectivity derived from the Internet provides an invaluable business tool for online banking .

The customers from traditional branch banking moving towards using electronic delivery channels like personal computers ( PC ) and mobile phones is the most fundamental change .
Compared with the past when we uses horses for transportation .
The reason why we have such improvement is that the technology and innovation have changed our life .
Cars replaced the horse , and even planes have replaced the cars for long distance transportation .
So I think there will be a future for public transportation , and this may be because of updated technologies .
Her mom tried to tell Fernanda that they arrived very late because they had a very perplexing problem . So her mom told her that they came out of the park at 9:00pm . It was still late but not too late , so they were on the street and the police arrived because the police thought that she had a globe of wine , and her mother told the police that she did n't have alcohol or wine in her car , and the police did n't believe her and they took them to the police station so they could check her car , and after about 10 minutes , they told her that she did n't have anything . So they went from there to their house and it was late , so that 's the reason .
Here is some information about us .
We are a married couple , both 32 years old , living at the moment in Flims in Kanton Graubünden .
I am originally from Ukraine and lived from 2009 till last year in Germany , and Juan is from Colombia , and has been in Switzerland for 3 years .
We 're moving to Zürich because of my husband 's job in the newly - opened hotel Kirchgasse , right on the corner from the apartment .

If you 'd like , we could get references from our previous landlords .
I hope this information is enough for a start and we can have the possibility to meet you and introduce ourselves in person .
If I told you to choose between travelling in a car or by bus , which one would you pick ?
But why public transport have no future to stand and keep going ? that 's because of people changing their minds . They started to like having their own way of travelling . Privacy is also an important reason . People need to have a private means of transportation .
I remember those years and I would like my children to practise it when they are older . It is an interesting sport .
Nowadays , I like to do other sports : tennis , basketball , ... but I prefer playing football with my mates on weekends , and then we drink some beers in the pub to celebrate the victory or the defeat .
I am here to write a composition about public transportation in Somalia , especially the capital city , Mogadishu , where there is little public transport compared to our neighboring countries . There is a scarcity of public transport and there is one type and model , which is the van , and very distracted roads , which may cause collateral damage .
Sometimes , passengers and drivers face risks and road blocks , which usually happen when the Somali government leaders are travelling across the city and even abroad .
So , having a good infrastructure helps a lot and constant peace and the people of Somalia will not suffer any more .
We have a very nice shopping centre .
1 . Is it possible to go without a compression machine ?
2 . I 've noticed that the machine 's cost is higher than it was previously .
As for public transport , you can save fuel as well as reduce pollution , but it takes more time to reach the destination ,
while if you have your own conveyance , you can save time and , moreover , it is safe .
But keeping in view of the environment , we should choose to use public transport .

I live in Bhubaneswar with my family .
It is a clean and environmentally friendly city .
The city has its own public transportation system and waste management system .
People who live here take care of the city 's environment , so the city is a clean and green place .
The parks are full of greenery ; these parks are also used as playgrounds for children .
Trees in the parks are not sufficient according to the requirements of our city .
Everybody got interested in the project .
Our city has a well equipped waste management system .
Each house in the city has two types of dustbin to keep recyclable and non - recyclable items separate .
In the morning , a waste collection truck comes and it takes this waste away .
These waste materials are processed in an environmentally friendly way .

Of course I recommend this movie , because it is very interesting and in some parts it is funny too , and Nicole is the principal character , so I love it !
I do not agree with what journalists do , because , to me , if I were a movie star , a famous man who had done many performances , I would not like to be pursued by journalists every hour of the day .
In addition , everyone wants to have a moment of privacy and because of journalists , paparazzi , they can not have a moment to relax , tutoring for children or dependent on what else you want to do , and you can not because of journalists .
Sometimes they abuse the right to be a journalist with all sorts of questions , with no response , or have a partial response to these famous people can say that journalists have a stressful job for some people .
And finally , I would like to say yes , I am against these people , or they might still change their style and everything would be OK !

My town is called Assuit . The People here have no knowledge of how to deal with their rubbish . people throw their rubbish everywhere . On the other hand , we haven't any kind of law that can limit that action . I mean rubbish throwing .
So , if we still do n't do anything new , our country will still be unattractive .
Public transport is a bit uncomfortable .
Because if everyone uses his / her car , pollution will increase and that will eventually affect every living being .
The " Casa Alvaro restaurant " is a restaurant situated in Valença , a small city in the north of Portugal .

Dear head teacher ,
Furthermore , going on field trips gives students a chance to try things for themselves .
In addition , field trips are an important part of our school activities .

As you can imagine , I visited a lot of monuments and cathedrals which I could see and find out something new about them .
As I discovered , the river Danube is the loveliest of rivers .
My flatmate is my best friend today .
It 's what we call the Mediterranean diet .
It includes vegetables , meat , fish and olive oil .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I love it when the temperature is a little bit cold , but not too much .
And sometimes I take my camera with me , because I love photography and there are so many great motifs .
In this opportunity I 'm going to talk about different cool restaurants we could choose for going out at the end of classes .
The reason is , three days ago , he had been working when a girl at his work asked him whether he had a girlfriend and he said " I had one , come on , you know my ex - girlfriend " , then she just walked away without saying anything .
He remembered two years ago when he had been working and he decided to return home early . While he was on his way home , he saw his girlfriend with another guy . They were hugging .
He arrived home and he just thought and thought all night . It was the second time that she had been unfaithful . Since then , he has been alone .
This girl was an acquaintance of his .
They were talking about their lives and he remembered how he met her on the bus . Maybe she had always been the woman of his life . He looked at her eyes and smile he wanted to ask her whether if it was not too late to start to get to know her . But he decided to leave the pub . He walked to the exit .
I had a terrible experience in this Chinese New Year , because Norovirus infected me ! At first , I had a high fever , but I thought if I took some medicine I would be fine .

My living room is the best room in my house because it is big , comfortable and beautiful .
There are three sofas around the coffee table and it is so comfortable .
In addition , there is a small blackboard for my little brother because my mother wants my brother to learn Arabic and English letters .
When this phenomenon occurs , most of the migrants need to learn the new language to adapt to the new environment .
As a consequence , they forget their first language .
Another important point is the necessity of approval by some indigenous groups or people that emigrate from the countryside to the city in order to get a better lifestyle .
We are facing a crucial moment due to the extinction of most of the indigenous languages .
Public transport will be worse in the future than travelling by car because it is uncomfortable and slow .
The apartments in the cities are much more expensive and people prefer to travel in their car .
I think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
This is convenient in terms of the cost of travelling , because every cost is divided between the participants and it is an opportunity to meet other people .
My country is a very interesting place . We have a lot of ancient and mystical places .
You can travel to Samarkand , Bukhara , Khiva and other historical cities .
In the city centre we can go to other shopping centers such as : " Passage " , Europe " , " Scorpion " . Last weekend we visited Passage .
We like it because the cafe has a beautiful design and tasty food . After that , we went for a walk on embankment .
First of all , thank you professor for teaching me in the meantime . The entire course really benefited me , especially at the first meeting , about British English . I still did not really understand , it makes me frustrated , but gradually , later I found the beauty of the language in British English . I think it 's all because of the usual problem of American English , and so I really appreciate that you choose simple textbooks and it 's easy to learn , and you are really very careful and very humorous . You 're always careful in pronunciation correction for each student , and using a variety of reading skills lets us immerse ourselves in reading .
I love to listen to British English , but it 's really hard to study , because we all learn American English in Taiwan , so when I have the opportunity to in be contact with British English , it 's full - of - tone cadence always feels particularly charming , and British culture exudes noble temperament , so the British accent sounds like there is always an indescribable elegance .
And the strengths and weaknesses of both segmental and suprasegmental , I think it 's maybe the learning habit . When I hear sentences , I use many varieties of tone and manner to say the sentences again . Therefore , I can easily interpret illustrations instructions the emotions and feelings .
Only possible in segmental pronunciation , the occasional missed a few notes , such as -d , I did not notice this because when I deliberately stressed -d , I found the tone and mood more likely to become very weird . This is the biggest problem I 've encountered in pronunciation teaching .
I 'm not teaching English in my new school , but in the future , if there is the chance , I will definitely give it a try . especially in the curriculum learned some teaching tips , the biggest gain this course is to read picture books to read and record , because that and English proficiency is not just training , but will note that strengthen their pronunciation and intonation , and then each time peer feedback also completed the listening exercises .
If I have an opportunity to go back to teaching English , I think I will try this skill to get my students to do the recordings heard training , then make their English better and better .
My village is in the north of the region of the Extremadura .
The population of my village is about sixteen hundred people .
The town hall put containers for trash in the streets and the workers from the town hall clean the streets .
To begin with , nowadays more and more people prefer travelling by car rather than by bus or train .
Certainly , it is more comfortable to travel in your own transport with your family or your friends . You can stop and have a rest wherever you want .
To differentiate between old computers and computers today , we would first have to describe each type of machine .
I start by describing the old computers which we saw in the video , which were a few simple machines ( at the time they were created ) and they filled an enormous room .
These were experimental models .
Currently , in the 21st century , computers have had a very long technology advance which range from the software and the size of the internal memory ( bigger than old computers ) , the size of the computer ( which is varied , but smaller than the computers of the past ) and their shape , the weight of them ( they are more lightweight ) and variations in the colors of the screen ( visually ) .
Finally , I can say that with the passage of time we change the way we see the world , evolution comes into play , not only of technology , but also of society , religion , etc . ,
Sometimes famous people want to be alone without any journalists .
Journalists follow you and they do n't allow you to live like normal people .
My opinion is the opposite of the one expressed in this composition title .
I live in a city , and for many people like me , the most convenient transport is public transport .
There is heavy traffic and difficulty finding a parking space .
Every day , the population spends a lot of time in traffic congestion .
A representative to carry out an investigation so that the town takes care of the environment .

It 's in AL - Sulaymanyiah district .
Also , it is near Bandati Minimarket and AL - Shafa Hospital .
It has some disadvantages like , it hasn't a private parking lot .
Finally , my apartment is very beautiful , and it has a lot more advantages than its disadvantages .
An Unforgettable Lesson
There are various kinds of different things that happen in people 's lives , some may be normal and nothing special , while others may be so meaningful and unforgettable that you will remember them for a long time .
Have you ever had this kind of experience ?
When I was in elementary school , I took part in a speaking contest , but I failed , and I was broken - hearted .
Eventually , I was third in the contest .
Through this time , I learnt that winning and losing are not the most significant thing .
Resolve/ determine / insistence
My country has witnessed a tremendous change in the last ten years .
But now , I feel uncomfortable without food every day .
On the other hand , children are used to eating only what they want , because in general , they do n't like legumes , vegetables , fruit , fish ...
They like eating junk food , hamburgers , French fries and sweets and , what 's more , they do n't do any exercise .
That 's the reason why we have to do more exercise , eat less fat and more vegetables , and teach our children to eat better and healthier than they are used to doing .
My opinion of self - employment
I never ever wanted to be self - employed .
My dad and my grandfather ran their own business for more than 20 years .
Nowadays , the number of car owners has been increasing in many countries , especially in developed countries , due to the convenience of travelling by car .
Thus , some people claim that the social trend tends to reduce the popularity of travelling by public transport .
As a result , this development is highly controversial in positive and negative ways .
To tackle this problem , we have to carefully think about it .
The lifestyle , technological equipment and the design of cars and houses keep changing annually .
We can not stop changing , but we can guide changes to provide special benefit which makes life easier and more comfortable .
Using the changing method would improve the education system in many ways , especially for people with obstruction .
In conclusion , the changing of our life can help us to explore different benefits of changing every decade .
It service the education and entertainment aspects of our lives .
The ecological problems have been very bad for the last few years .
The urban authorities can not change the situation cardinally .
But there is active construction of new roads , road junctions and improving of roads .
All rubbish is taken away without separation .
But people are interested in it and this year I saw announcements about days for receiving separate rubbish .
But I hope one day to go to a tournament , travel to Spain and watch my favourite player , who is Rafael Nadal from Spain .
Once in a while , I enjoy watching tennis when there is a competition or tournament , besides watching and enjoying it , I can also learn how real the game is , what its rules were or what happens when they yell at the umpire for no reason . You can learn all these details and wait for a future day to put them into practice , or helping the players is one of the things that I want to make real .
Travelling by car is much more convenient .
Riding a horse is an old - fashioned way but still interesting .
Public transportation is excellent ; you save money , take care of the environment and make friends .
Nowadays , Easter is associated more with spring 's arrival than with religious rituals .
People are more likely to take care of the gardening or shopping than participate in the celebration of Good Friday , which makes the author connect Easter with a pagan spring festival .
Flamengo was champion in 2009 . In 2009 Flamengo had a great team with good players , but now it is struggling to finish the competition in the first 4 teams of the championship .
It must be the aftereffect of whatever those clowns in masks have done to me . I want to shut down all the noises around me , especially those whispered shouts coming from behind .
She 's incredible ; she is like the sister I never had .
It is a really beautiful place and has a lot of attractions scenery , such as the great beaches beside rows of trees , the obviously regularly weather ... Therefore , taking care of the environment there is a vitally important mission of my town 's state .
When receiving an alarm about the pollution of water or land ... by the town 's inhabitants , the authorities must reposibile for this cause .
Finally , the government usually encourages on the radio , television etc .
If it is very cold outside , I put a jacket on , but if it is very hot , I wear shorts , sandals , a lighweight vest and sunglasses .
In your message , you said that you needed to find a famous person in my country and needed some suggestions from me .
He started the hospital system in my country .
In modern life , we rely on transport to get to work or travel everywhere .
It is convenient to travel by private car everyone can afford it , so that everyone has a private car nowadays . Some people suggest private cars are going to replace public transport .
Not to mention , it 's definitely hard to enjoy travelling on holidays .
Secondly , private cars are the main reason for air pollution . We should consider the protection of the environment for the future of humanity , not only care about the convenience we can see for now .
Therefore people do n't need to drive cars to travel in the city .
On the contrary , we need more public transport to improve our traffic system and find a better way to protect the environment .
It was 11 pm and her boyfriend was n't in their house . She started getting confused and temerously .
Alison felt desperate . She noticed that her husband 's car keys were in her house , so he was walking or someone had picked him up . She picked up the phone and she called all his group of friends . Nobody knew anything and now they were scared .
She was terrified . She started thinking about the possibility of death .
She got into her car and looked for her husband all over their small city , Pentonville . After half an hour , she saw him sleeping in a square .
The statement " public transport is our future " has been an interesting political discussion for years .
In conclusion , public transport is very good and if it disappears it will be a big problem . It is true that sometimes you need private transport , but apart from that , public transport is used a lot by people of all ages .
Transportation is very important in cities and villages as well as in sub - lines .
Any Anyway , in some cases , a car is very useful to reach the destination very fast .
Public transport provides all the information about routes they follow and give an idea to passengers about the place .
I 'm a committed , responsible , and organized person .
I like new challenges to improve myself .
I think that I have enough experience for the job .
My skills and accomplishments speak for me , because I 'm qualified for this job , I have the requirements that are requested to apply to work here .
If you choose me , I comitted with myself to comply with everything , working in a timely manner , because that is how I am .
The most important thing for me is to have more work experience and surpass my achievements that I gained long ago .
I would like to advise children who are taking their first steps in this sport , that it is with perseverance and effort that you can achieve great treasures .
They 're healthy activities .
As for me , even if travelling by car is so much more convenient , most people will always travel by train , railway , bus and other types of public transport .
In my opinion , people will travel by public transport more frequently , because this type of transport is less expensive , more reliable and even more environmentally friendly than travelling by car .
On the other hand , we can say that it is really uncomfortable to travel by public transport , but can improve even this in the future .
We can discover new ways of travelling , take more care of our public transport and modernise it , so people will be motivated to travel on it .
My trust in future technology is so enormous that I hope there will be new environmentally friendly and cheaper ways to travel around our world .
If this happens , people will be more social and empatic , not only about people 's emotions , but also about our environment , and they will treasure it .
To illustrate this , when we use renewable energy , we reduce emissions , so , our natural resources will be conserved for our future and our children 's future .
For example , by using wind energy or solar energy for electricity generation , we will use less fuel , which is implicated in emissions .
Secondly , we should improve our regulations that impose rules on people to reduce the use of things that cause a lot of pollution such as using big vehicles or building big facilities such as big factories .
As a result , ways to cut down on pollution . For instance , when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same , that causes a lot of pollution . Because of that , we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars to cut down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improving our regulations are two ways to cut down on pollution for a better future .
Secondly , do more cooperation between countries .
For example , people should cooperate in intervening to bring peace to the world , to stop war in many areas like the United Nations is doing .
For example , the United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . In brief , knowing each other and more cooperation between countries are two ways to avoid war for a better future .
For that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars to cut down on pollution for a better future .
All in all , using renewable energy and improving our regulations are two ways to cut down on pollution for a better future .
My most terrifying day was January 23rd last year .
Currently , a very significant problem for its social and economic impact is the chaotic public transport in Lima .
To solve this problem , Lima has been making long - term strategies .
We do not respect traffic rules and drive only with the intention of going as fast as possible to our destination . This often causes traffic accidents and congestion .
For this reason , people are becoming aware of the terrible problem and are learning and teaching vial culture to new generations .
In addition , public institutions are promoting this and also private companies create advertising to increase awareness .
This is due to the fact that Lima , in the beginning , did not have a plan to design its public roads and highways , and it has only been improvising to build them without any criteria to transport its population .
Currently , this issue is so important that governments are investing and working to create solutions , such a metro .
I think we have really become aware of the chaos of public transport and we have begun to design and implement strategies that , in 20 years , will improve our reality .
Maybe travelling by car is so much more convenient , but there are a lot of cars and those cars produce a lot of fumes and the natural world is dying . If we do nothing , the natural world will disappear .
I would like people to take public transport for travelling , so we will be able to rescue the countryside .
I usually take public transport to go to the University , because public transport is cheaper than a car .
With respect to the international dispute over the Diaoyutai Islands , the Republic of China should consistently express willingness to resolve the issue in a peaceful manner in line with the principles of the UN Charter and international law .
To this end , it proposed the East China Sea Peace Initiative in 2013 , which called upon all parties concerned to take the steps outlined below :
( 1 ) exercise restraint and refrain from taking any antagonistic .
( 2 ) shelve controversies and set up dialogue .
( 3 ) observe international law and resolve disputes through peaceful means .
( 5 ) establish a mechanism in collaboratively exploring and developing resources in the East China Sea .
He read about rites of pilgrimage and Kabaa .
After he finished the book , he wanted to go to the Kabaa and do rites of pilgrimage .
Luckily , he remembered he had the dragon costume and he wore it .
Eventually , he saw the Kabaa .
They were doing rites of pilgrimage .
It had been a fun day out , but unfortunately he had to be home in time for bed .
After he had arrived at home , he fell asleep and he started to think of his next adventure ..........
My neighbourhood is a very pleasant area , it is quite big and it is so green .
The population is estimated at around ten thousand people .
My neighbourhood is surrounded by a large range of mountains which have scenic views .
One of the most amazing things that will attract you , is that it has a safari , park which is the most enjoyable thing . At the same time , it introduces you to wildlife without your needing to go out of your city .
Transportation is not an issue , because it has got many bus lanes and bus stops .
The purpose of this proposal is to provide details about shopping facilities in my hometown , Vung Tau , and give some recommendations for tourists .
They have a long tradition dating back to the 18th century when Vungtau was a small commercial port .
Not only are they well - known for their long tradition , but they are also famous for the hospitality of the inhabitants living here , which attracts domestic and foreign tourists who come here to see the famous sights as well as shop for souvenirs .
They offer a wide range of choices , from souvenir items such as pictures and jewellery to local specialities , at a reasonable price to suit the interests of different people .
It is conveniently situated in the town centre , which takes 5 minutes to walk to as the crow flies .
A lot of products , such as consumer electronics , foods , and souvenirs are sold here .
Compared with local shops , products ' prices in the shopping mall are considerably higher than those in local shops , but it offers a wider variety of products .
I highly recommend local shops to our tourists for their cheap prices and the hospitable manners of residents here .
Dear Mrs. Weber and Mrs. Schnappauf ,
To be more precise , I am in the graduating class .
My hobbies are meeting Friends and hanging out with them or playing basketball in my spare time .
I 'm easily excited and nervous because this oral examination will determine whether I can do my A -level at the college of further education in Bamberg , which is what I really want .
There is a grass surface , but it 's also played on artificial grass .
I really enjoy playing it because it 's very exciting because anything could happen .
From the point of view of the environment , this is a bad idea , because it uses a lot of gas per person .
I think that the main problem with public transport is the communications between villages and small towns , because they only exists between the big cities .
Some countries have a good communications network and people use then mainly because public transport is cheaper than the car and quicker .
My name is Afsaneh . I 'm from IRAN . I came to London 4 months ago and I want to talk about the Iranian celebration of new year .
We have 3 special days during the celebration of our new year .
1- chaharshanbeh soori
3- sizdehbedar
chahrshanbeh soori :
It means Tuesday night of week and takes place on the last Tuesday night of the year . On this night , people make a bonfire and jump over the fires and say to the fire : I give you my sign of sickness ( yellow color ) and you give me your healthy sign ( red color ) and eat some special foods .
Sizdehbedar :
It means thirteenth day of spring . On this day , people go on a picnic and spend the day out of their homes in nature because they believe that the number thirteen brings bad luck for them .
The television can entertain , and also educate people .
There are so many educational programs , like Animal Planet , and so many others .
Sometimes , some TV shows are so great that they help you in certain classes , for example , Animal Planet can help you in biology . The History Channel can help in history , etc ... In my opinion , television can be as good as books , and can also be a form of learning as good as only reading books , because TV is something fun , so you can learn and have fun at the same time .
Last year I saw a movie called ' ' Side by Side '' , and it talked a little about life in ancient history , and by coincidence I was doing this subject in school , so it helped me a lot .
In my opinion , television can entertain and it can educate people in different ways .
I am writing in response to your advertisment for SUMMER CAMPS .
I am very interested in the job , because I would like to work for you this summer .
I worked as an assistant chef in a Lagunak Restaurant last summer . I worked in another restaurant in London , but I would like to look after children , because I have studied to be a teacher .
Also , for me , the salary is not a problem , because my motivation is to learn .
Yours faithfully .
In the future , I really want my grandchildren to be happy . That is all I ask for . I may be young , but I think I do n't see myself living on earth in the next 50 years . I mean dreaming does not hurt .
Public transport would have more of a future if it were better distributed .
Personally , I use public transport more and I hardly ever use private transport .
Baja California is bigger than Aguascalientes for the beaches and tourist cities .
The transportation is practical because not all places are search , use cars , trucks and sometimes boats more .
Baja California 's weather is not as cold as Chihuahua 's .
The last few days when I was in Baja California I got very little time for shopping and going to the beach .
have sent me your CV after the weekend , because he will surely want it .
I think the car is more convenient than public transport .
And without getting stuck in the city because of delays by drivers . On public transport there is the possibility that you 're standing for the whole trip , there is always a lot of people , it is cold in the winter and in the summer it 's too hot .
A terrible explosion resulting from carelessness followed .
In my opinion , all of us should be careful with all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters .
Additionally , all human beings should stop fighting and devote themselves to pursuing a peaceful world .
Last but not least , we should do everything according to our conscience .
Frankly , it seems that the town that I have been living in has not taken care of the environment .
In general , we do n't care about anything ; water , recyclable things , even our air conditioning .
Here in Brazil , it is very difficult care about it because it demands serious action and skills from our government , which unfortunately wo n't happen soon .
Our government prefer to keep our population without information , because it is easier to manipulate their minds .
And why am I talking about it ? I am talking about it because the foundation of environmental protection is our mindset . Just with knowledge and information , we will be able to manage actions to save , protect and improve the environment , and instead we have the current result .
but these things are not important if there is not a comfortable atmosphere .
In this report I am going to talk about how my town takes care of the environment .
n the town , he tries to make people aware of the situation and they take care of the environment .
The " green " organisations want to believe the problem is serious and that radical political solutions are needed .
In my opinion , we should be conscientious and stop it . If we do n't stop it , after , it will be too late .
I do lots of activities with them ..
For example : we go to the restaurant , we go to see my brother 's football matches , we eat or stay at home all together .
I do n't argue with only one member of my family .. I sometimes argue with my brother about television channels , but we make up immediately .
It has a lot of beautiful things , like an old church from the 15th Century . This church is in ruins , but the new church is also very beautiful and comfortable .
Another interesting place in my village is the square with its spring .
Also , there are the supermarket , bar and restaurants .
Let us examine the advantages and disadvantages
Also , for some people , it could be cheaper to travel by bus , especially for a tourist from a foreign country .
When you are travelling with a big company , it is the best decision to travel by bus .
Nowadays , people have a stressful life , so we ca n't spend time waiting for public transport .
Using your own car , you can take the decision of what timetable is more convenient and what route you are going to use .
It 's more comfortable to go anywhere in your own car . The problem is the pollution that this life brings us , and also the parking problems .
Also , travelling by car is so much more convenient because you do n't have to stop in each town , so using your own car saves time .
In my opinion , the most important is thing enjoying your work because we spend an average of nine hours in the office or in whatever work that we do . As a result , if you do n't feel comfortable , your life could be hell .
The truth is , that the ideal would be that all people could work in their dream jobs and , of course , make a lot of money , like for example , Hollywood actors or football players . But that is almost impossible .
Ecotourism Bacalar Quintana Roo .
There are cabins where you can have a good time in front of a bonfire and sleep in a beautiful room made of ecological materials .
On the trip you can do many activities , like climbing , swimming , paddling , rafting and enjoying the place .
I think I am the right person for this job because I have a lot of motivation and a good level of English .
I would also like to get this job because I love the USA and I often do babysitting , so the company of children does not frighten me .
When I was younger , I went to summer camp in France . Consequently , I know which activities I can propose to children .
I love English but there is an interesting subject I want to study and it 's Mathematics .
This subject is beautiful and incredible . like it very much .
Can you help me somehow ? Please . I want to study this subject .
Firstly , Django Unchained reminds us of the hard life suffered by black people in the past through a great introduction without dialogues , where black people were unchained while they came back to be sold to an owner farm . This was matched with an amazing soundtrack as identity Tarantino 's films .
On the one hand , there are some arguments for sport , especially volleyball .
When I play volleyball , I totally forget all my problems and focus on nothing but volleyball and the intensity of the game . This is a game I like to play .
In addition to this , it pushes me to keep on trying so that I can get everything right .
On the other hand , there are a lot of famous players of volleyball who have had knee ligament injuries .The most frequent cause of injury was landing from a jump in the attack zone .
In my opinion , volleyball must then be considered among high - risk sports according to the frequency and gravity of our surgical findings . My advice for someone who is starting this sport is that you will be refreshed after you play this game and it makes you do your work in a relaxed way .
I believe there are numerous possibilities for public transport because cars and public transport play completely different roles in our society .
In Japan , which has one of the largest populations over 60 , many senior citizens prefer using buses to cars .
In addition , a new generation is growing up and they do n't own their own cars because there are few opportunities to travel and because of the high cost of having a car of their own .
Second , public transport provides a quick and easy way to visit unfamiliar places .
It is not necessary for us to know in advance how to get to the destination when we are using public transport .
When it comes to our environment , the use of public transport could be a solution for reducing the emission of CO2 .
It is beyond doubt the taking care of the environment is regarded as a turning point in our life .
It is upstream that irrigates our economic life , and there is no doubt that negligence has the ability to destroy many good aspects of our lives , and our government is doing its best to put an end to negligence ,
but we also must cooperate to save our town . On the one hand , we must Presentation an awareness program for all people ,
and we must not throw rubbish in the street to keep the area clean , and we must Maintain clean trees to keep the area attractive . Thus , we can improve the national income by attracting many people from other towns . And we must teach children that cleanliness is necessary for their health and at their school they should throw rubbish in the waste baskets and anyone who throws it on the ground will be punished . In conclusion , we ca n't do without cleanliness in our town .
The natural environment is being destroyed . That is a problem people focus on frequently .
Building more large buildings can destroy people 's and animals ' living environment and some animals may become extinct .
Governments should take some measures to deal with building more buildings . We will destroy the natural environment .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
I do not agree with this statement because in big cities there are a lot of cars . If all the people in a city use their own car at the same time , there will be a huge traffic jam , so travelling by car is n't much more convenient in this situation .
We are taking part in a championship this year .
And I am glad to win a championship cup .
Do n't be afraid of hockey ! You are used to sitting in front of a computer , but the best choice is to get up and go to the hockey club .
I am a volunteer and I work as a babysitter . I can cook .
I am cheerful and hardworking .
I have experience of this work , because last year I worked at a children 's camp in London .
From then on , I felt my disease decrease and feel relax .
Consequently , I need to swim often .
You can go to a swimming club . That is a way to meet people with interesting of same .
I started with three kilometers for one jog .
Now my average jog is 8 - 10 kilometers and going on 40 - 50 minutes .
After rehabilitation , I continued to feel pain in my foot and I still limped .
After these moments , you start doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable .
My recommendations for beginners .
2 ) Work systematically .
4 ) Think about your initial physical condition .
I would like to start working in your cafe , because I am very interested in cooking and everything connected with it .
I have experience of working in a cafe .
I think I am good at dealing with people , particularly in the food sector .
I look forward to new challenges and tasks .
I am an open , hard - working and responsible student .
Schools have Physical Education to teach this good habit from our childhood .
In conclusion , Physical Education is necessary in schools because sports improve our health and make us feel good and healthy .
I would like to make a reservation for next month , from 24th may to 28th ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I have questions about your booking policy .
I mean , after reading the terms and deposit policy , I understand I must pay for the first night at the time of booking and the rest of the stay should be paid upon arrival at the front desk .
Plus , if I cancel the reservation 48 hrs before arrival I will be charged 5% of the full stay .
I understand this part , but if I have to cancel the reservation , how should I do it ?
My favourite sport is swimming because it is the one I have been practising for a long time , since I was a kid .
I like other sports such as football and volleyball , too .
To conclude , I think this is a really good sport to start with when you are a small child to gain experience and , year after year , become better .
The first one is individual sports and in this kind you practise your game alone and you are the only player on your team .
Although some people prefer individual games , I prefer team games .
Because they teach us the meaning of cooperation and leadership .
I find football interesting because it teaches us a lot of values such as cooperation and onest .
I think it is the most interesting sport .
Famous people definitely deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
In our world there are many personalities , more or less known , such a film stars , musicians and so on , but why ca n't they have normal lives ?
Actually I have to admit , that film stars , politicians and other famous people have to count on fame .
With reference to your advertisement for the summer camp job in the current , I am writing to you to apply for it .
In the advertisement you state that you need a person who has skills relevant to working with children .
I would like to tell you that I have done a course on which I learnt to organise all kinds of activities for children , from canoeing to swimming competitions . Also , I worked in a summer camp last year , where I could put all the things that I had learnt into practise and it was a very pleasant experience which I would like to have again .
Because of that , if you want , I will send you a letter of recommendation from my boss at that camp .
I would be very grateful if you would consider my application .
Everything 's OK .
The concert was just flubbergasted .
It really was amazing . I think , it was a breakthrough in my perception of music .
The good thing about it was the fact that the band ( actually I do n't even remember its name ) was playing with so much passion , that no one probably even thought about leaving the place .
First of all , Balkan music turned out to be one of the most irresistible kinds I have ever heard .
The mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music , probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music .
With reference to your advertisement posted on the web ( CareerCast IT ) a few days ago , I am sending you attached my curriculum vitae in support of my application for the following position : Graduate Project Engineer , which is being offered at your company .
I have never worked as an engineer , but I am experienced in electronics as a hobbyist since I was a child . I have my own lab equipment and I have designed and assembled several circuits .
Please , feel free to get in touch with my teacher in order to obtain references for me : ( 5wYU8kZ1pS6@uniovi.es Phone : 34 123 45 67 89 . He speaks English fluently ) .
If you consider my application , it would certainly be a great job opportunity for me to gain experience in the engineering field and develop my professional career .
My ability to learn and work , together with my enthusiasm , are core strengths that could be of great help to your company .
I should like to thank you in advance for granting me an appointment for an interview and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
When we arrived there in July last summer , the owners welcomed us with a magnificent basket of fresh fruits in the room and a variety of drinks in the fridge , all included in the room 's fee .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone because there you will completely relax and it will really seem to you as if you were in heaven !
It still gives me great fun in the incredible company of my friends and it keeps me fit as well .
I definitely recommend this sport to anyone who wants to keep fit , have fun with their friends , and live a happy life .
At any time of day or night , we can see people eating in all kinds of eating establishments ; from restaurants to food stalls in the streets .
I would show you the restaurant which is my favorite choice .
If you are interested in my idea , I would help you to find one immediately .
We knew we had a competition and that it was a really hard one .
The other team was professional , they had won many competitions , they were really good , but Tom and I knew that we could win .
Our competition was on Monday . We had one day left .
I told Tom I wanted to talk about our achievements before we went home .
He also thanked me and told me that if it was n't for me he would n't even have thought about playing tennis professionally .
I am a university student .
I 'm 18 years old and I 'm interested in working in your Summer Camp .
I have experience with kids .
I can also do different activities with kids , for example , singing , running around the garden , planting trees , drawing , playing instruments , etc .
I 'm the right person for the job because I 'm reliable and experienced .
Sport is an important thing for all of us because it helps us avoid disease and become healthier . My favourite sport is swimming , so practising this kind of sport is the best because it helps me feel fresh and relaxed .
Moreover , daily exercise is a very good idea which helps us to avoid becoming overweight and to keep our body healthier . So I always want to advise people to practise this sport or other knids of sports to avoid diseases .
The first one is basically based on the true story of the main character , a financial broker , who is played by the famous Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio and on how he became rich by breaking the rules and speculating on the stock market .
Walter Mitty , in contrast , deals with the fictional story of the main character , an archivist , whose life is changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors .
Far from the moise and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street , Walter Mitty offers the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character 's life and adventures , through which he will discover his true self and will start a new life .
Although presenting a more lively plot , The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does .
I must say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a well - constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie .
My name is Rebeca Costa and I am writing this letter about the advertisement for a job in the USA Summer Camps .
I think that I can help you with several camps activities , because of my background in volunteer work . I have experience not only in the kitchen but also organising and managing some youth sports games in my neighborhood .
I would like to know more information about how to proceed with applying and when this job will commence .
Yours faithfully
It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly in their private vehicles .
It seems more convenient to them to get around on their own rather than be tied to public transport .
It can be argued that public transport systems have been losing their popularity in many ways .
People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car .
This may cause people to get to their particular destination late .
Secondly , public transport seems to be getting more expensive day by day , which has reduced its popularity .
People therefore find cars more affordable for them .
Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase a car .
In conclusion , I would say that , due to recent progress in society , there has been a considerable increase in car ownership .
It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties , which I find awful .
That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who does n't , but fame is not the same as being remembered .
We can see that people become famous when they die , so , journalists are instrumental in creating a negative or positive opinion of that person .
" Nowadays , older people are disadvantaged because they lack the ability to use technology confidently . " Do you agree or disagree ?
In our world , it 's impossible to live without using technology .
But this is an anachronism .
It 's impossible to stop science .
The question is whether older people are disadvantaged by not using technology in a confident way .
There is no doubt : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example , explains well and calmly the use of new technology to an old man or woman , in the end , these people are also in a position to use it .
New technology consists , for instance , in smartphones , tablets , PCs .
There are some old people who are interested in knowing how technology works , but others who are not interested at all .
For the latter , it 's not necessary to use technology , because they can continue to live without using it .
To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , anyone who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results might be lower than their expectations .
Dear Sir/ Madam ( director of the film department )
As requested by a local tourist office , this is a report regarding shopping facilities in my town and shops that will appeal to tourists with different interests .
Regarding the actual shopping mall , it has more than 30 shops with a variety of things , from fashionable clothes to delicious food and even squaint books .
Moreover , it is a source of entertainment for all ages .
Called in a malicious way , there are 6 floors for jewellery , clothes , accessories , gadgets , books etc .
In addition to that , cheap is the best word to describe the prices .
To sum up , it would seem that downtown is a preferable place , with better value for money .
Although using your own car is better for moving around the city , public transport has been shown to be a good option for travelling long distances at a low cost and , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There probably is n't a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living in today . That is , if businesses continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure , they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .
In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to improve if the companies in charge want citizens to use their buses , trains and other public vehicles in the future .
Those improvements should include lowering the price , reducing the times or offering new destinations and more resources .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to share the experience of different students who worked abroad during the summer .
In order to do so , I conducted interviews with 30 university students .
Conclusion
Even if there are some disadvantages , most students agreed that this is an amazing experience not to be missed .
All in all , I suggest encouraging students to find a job abroad during the summer .
There are a few things which I am very keen and passionate about in the whole world .
I have been doing swimming since I was six years old . Now I am twenty one . This should leave you in no doubt about how much I care about my hobby .
This is not just a sport , but an extraordinary thing I do in my ordinary life , in everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrated , sick of passing fancies or fake friends , there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it : this is , of course , swimming .
So , I let myself drop into the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged , all the problems , sadness and heaviness of life suddenly disappear , and that 's the most amazing emotion I could ever try .
I advise parents to let children begin swimming as soon as they can , provided they are interested in it .
First of all , the environment is contaminated and these substances get to us by water , air , food ... also clothes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves around us , even if we are living in the country or far from the factories .
If you want to live healthily , you must understand it and try to choose between the few real options you have .
The main advice would be to have a balanced diet : a lot of fruits and vegetables , few fats , to drink more water , etc .
Your health needs calm , friendship , happiness ... You must keep in contact with your friends and spend time with yourself ( do not forget your hobbies and learn new things ) and your family .
It is known that the Internet makes things easier than ever and can be used for everything .
One of the advantages of the Internet is that we can meet new people around the world and make friends without talking face to face .
In my opinion . I must express the facilities given by the Internet .
When you have finished your studies and you have gotten a job where where you do the same activities every day , the brain does n't work hard and you might have some problems like forgetting words , dates , information that you learnt a few years ago , because your memory wo n't work in the same way .
I wish to apply for the post of worker in an USA summer camp that was advertised in the newspaper last Monday .
This job is of great interest to me as it reflects my ambitions in life and requires my education , skills and experience .
With majors in linguistics ( to be more precise , the English and Chinese languages ) , I have recently got a second degree in psychology .
Two years ago , I worked as an interpreter and an organizer at the Waterski World Championships in Moscow .
In addition , as I have been determined to build my career as a teacher since my childhood and , moreover , I definitely have a way with children of any age , after graduation I gained experience at university and in a local school .
In terms of my personality , I am very hardworking , enthusiastic about a wide range of activities , open and friendly .
My opinion is rooted in my experience , so I really enjoy interacting with people , especially children , and to tell you the truth , I like cooking and experiencing new things in general .
I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this position .
My enclosed resume outlines my experience in greater detail .
I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you .
A wise man in the past said once , " If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climber , the strength of a shot putter , the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer . "
You have to be competitive !
If you do n't know what racket you should buy , you will get all the information at the club .
Mostly , the badminton clubs sell all kinds of badminton equipment for beginners and professionals . Do n't be lazy !
I usually play three times a week and I had a tournament last weekend .
Every lost game gives me more motivation to practice harder and every won game makes me proud and happy about all the hard work that I have done in the last few months .
Those films are really good . You have a drama , a romance , and a thriller ; those films are very entertaining .
Another thriller that is really good is The Cabin in the Woods . That movie is really entertaining , and scary .
If you like scary thrillers , this movie is the one for you to watch , I do n't remember it very well , but it is also mysterious , so you will like that one .
This place does n't appear in history books , but it symbolises better than others a change in our country .
This building is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a short walk from Gaudi 's magnificent artwork , it is n't as famous as that .
When the Civil War ended , the country was completely destroyed and people had nothing to eat .
Particularly in Barcelona , the trouble was that they could fish in the sea but there was n't an appropriate place to keep the fish , so they could n't eat it one or two days later .
That situation must have been terrible for the population , but fortunately , there is always a possible solution .
Neighbours helped them to build the building and , after a few months , they began to use it .
This is a great example of how the Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without the government 's help .
However , the structure has been kept so that visitors can enjoy this popular architectural jewel .
He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle was n't really a battle , it was a revolution , where the fish were the citizens .
This meant some fish were damaged thanks to the revolution , which also meant that , while they were reproducing , the genes of the baby were changed .
And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish , they will taste different or simply change shape .
If there were a revolution in the city , obviously the fish would try to escape .
The homeless man had another dream where there was a pest around the forest that was contaminating all types of food .
When he woke up from his dream , he kind of having a skeptic attitude , but he was diminishing it .
Nowadays , it is more and more popular to take a year off between school and university .
It has many advantages and disadvantages as well .
They do n't know which university and field of study to choose .
You have enough time to try to use your abilities and at the same time discover your own calling .
The year off gives them opportunities to get a job .
In the beginning , it would be a simple job and without high wages , but you would get some experience .
You can get to know other countries and new individuals .
You start your studies later compared with your friends .
It is also a point that if you do n't achieve what you wanted to during the gap year , you are in the same place as when you were graduating school .
Last year , I attended an art course , which taught me how to make interesting things only using my hands and my imagination .
I have a certificate for high achievement in the areas of painting and designing things in clay .
Among my colleagues and friends , I have a reputation for being a mature , responsible and easy - going person .
I believe that this will give me the chance to consider my application and get the job .
Yours faithfully ,
Nowadays , television is very important in our lives because there are a lot of benefits and advantages to watching TV .
There are lots of interesting programs suitable for people of every age .
In my opinion , TV is useful because we can learn many interesting things and also reduce stress by watching TV .
We can choose entertainment programs which are full of fun .
Everyone can choose something suitable for them .
The driving instructor picked me up at the gas station and from there we went to a parking lot near AMC and practised parallel parking and the k - turn .
The instructor dropped me back at the gas station and from there I took a bus to Princeton and from there I transferred to another bus to my home .
Micheal is a clever , shy guy who decided to look for new opportunities outside of his small town . After the tragedy of losing his father , he felt the need to move forward with his life and discover his real needs . No one in Micheal 's school was able to understand this weird , isolated guy , so he never accepted having new friendships out of his class , that ends when the class ends . Then there was that girl . A beautiful popular blonde who was in the cheer leaders and every boy 's dreams . One day , after a physics exam , she just stumbled into his bag and knocked his books out of it . " Sorry " , she said , with a sad sexy look ! ,
that look occupied Micheal 's mind from then on and led to him dropping his dream of being a creative engineer and abbreviated it all on his muscles and girls hoping that he might be noticed by her . Arika , the girl who was using anyone who could make her make a step towards her success and popularity .

Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To study 1 unit per week was difficult for us , because of translation .
We were faced with the real problem of lack of time for translating , especially closer to the end when our translators worked with very large texts .
It makes studying more effective and comfortable for us .
We 're also waiting for information about your fee , order of payments and other employment terms .
So , definitely , if you want to try this beautiful experience , I sincerely recommend it to you .
- I 'm absolutely sure that you need n't drink coffee every morning .
Try not to eat a very substantial meal in the evening and in the morning .
Yes , I believe that television entertains and also educates .
Watching the history channel gives us great information about the history of the earth .
Watching the National Geographic or Discovery channels takes us into a world of animals where we get to see numerous wild animals and their characteristics , which are really interesting .
Watching the daily news on television enlightens us about what 's happening around the world .
There are also many disadvantages to television .
There are plenty of entertainment programs which just waste our time with no other benefits .
It 's really depressing to see kids being engrossed in soap operas or some useless reality shows or cartoons .
Entertainments are a must . Everyone should take time off from their busy or hectic schedule .
If everyone uses television wisely , it can do more good than bad .
To USA SUMMER CAMPS department of human resources ,
I am writing this letter in response to the job advertisement for working in a summer camp in which I am quite interested .
I am currently studying for a marketing and market research degree at Malaga University . In September I will start my last year of the course , which I hope to finish next year .
The idea of working in the kitchens really excites me , because I would like to provide my cooking experience . I started it as an obligation because my parents where always working , but eventually , I liked it , and now I make all sorts of desserts and meals .
I know this is going to be your first visit to Russia and it 's really great ! I 'll give you information about two ways of getting to my place without significant expenses .
The second way is more convenient and comfortable .
As for the weather , it 's quite nice at the moment , but I suggest bringing something warm just in case as the weather is very changeable here .
I have just received your letter and I 'm glad that you have found my film the most interesting .
I 'm really pleased as there were about 200 competitors and , so , I would never have thought I would be the winner .
I think he will be excited when I tell him the news .
I 'm really sorry , but on May 15th I have an important exam at school , so it would be impossible for me to meet her .
Mr. Green , I 'm really keen to know who the professional film director is .
Particularly , in the south of the country .
Since many European tourists like to have their holidays on the beach enjoying the sunshine and also discovering the historical remains from the past , Antalya ( Turkey ) is the best city to work in .
In the case of workers , I would like to have accommodation given by the company .
Cyberschool have been attempting to present their new project called cyberschool .
Cyberschool is when students receive
Electronic gadgets are bad for our eye .
Some individuals might even become computer addicts due to the time they spend on their PC .
Next , there has been a sudden rise in obesity because of this new project .
Travelling to school at least includes 1 kilometer of walking , whereas staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and healthy .
Finally , I personally disagree with cyberschool .
Cyberschool are n't interested in health and safety issues !
Now that they were back home , Paulina found out that her mom was in town , so by instinct she decided to go and visit her , as well her brother , who had been avoiding her because she taunted him by being in love with his best friend . They were n't together anymore , but that was such a devastating thing .
Genuinely , she knew , that begging him was n't enough , so going to their old house as a surprise would at least give her the chance to confront him instead of making a fuss about it . Despite this insignificant trick , she knew her mom would be really happy to see her daughter .
There are only a limited number of government buses on the road and their frequency is not good , so they get overcrowded .
People board these buses out of compulsion , as they have to reach their office on time .
On the other hand , the metro service is a good means of transportation ; it goes under the road , so you do n't get traffic .
The only flaw of the metro service is its unavailability in remote areas .
So , even if you travel by metro , you have to take a bus or car to reach your destination , unless it is located near a metro station .
People who are rich prefer to travel in their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience .
On public transport , many people do n't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey . It is very exhausting , especially on a long journey .
While in a private vehicle , you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey .
Many crimes such as pickpocketing , eve teasing , violence , etc take place on public transport .
It has been an easy target for terrorists to plant bombs , so if you are traveling on a bus , you accept the risk .
Recent graduate vs. experienced worker
One of our seniors workers will retire in a month and therefore , as I 'm in charge of the Human Resources department , I have to start the search for a new employee .
It is a commonly held view that an experienced worker will facilitate the search of .
However , I would like to review another option , such hiring a recent graduate from a renowned university .
Any experienced worker would bring a sense of calm , steadiness , wisdom , commitment and experience , of course .
He would contribute his life experience , and he would ask for better working conditions such as salary , family time , and health insurance .
However , a recent graduate will be keen to accumulate knowledge and fearless of trying a different approach .
In my opinion , recent graduates are ambitious , without prejudices , and most of them are not family people as yet .
In conclusion , I would say that a recent graduate would be a great asset for our company as they will accomplish our targets .
What disadvantages does it have ?
Firstly , it is true that they have similar relationships to those we had many years ago .
The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch , such as emails and messages , instead of writing letters , which took a long time to arrive .
While it is true that social networks help shy people to make new friends , it is also true that young people write their messages with abbreviations .
After doing this regularly , they tend to have problems at school because they start to write incorrectly .
They also publish their conversations on the internet .
But when they do this , they expose a lot of details about themselves , details that everyone can see , especially strangers .
In conclusion , I think that social networks can constitute a big problem , especially for people who are not aware of what dangers there are on the internet .
I am glad to hear that you are interested in visiting Brazil next summer .
It is a little village where you can experience a different culture , find local handicrafts , eat good food and enjoy beautiful beaches .
Near " Taipus " , you could visit " Barra Grande " , where you can see the sunset at " Ponta do Mutá " and eat seafood overlooking the bay .
Television currently occupies a very important role in entertainment . However , one of the problems that society has faced since television became popular is that it is a distractor in education .
There are educational programs and channels which transmit good documentaries , but most people prefer other types of programs , such as cartoons , soap operas and soccer matches .
In addition , many of the educational programs are not transmitted by broadcast television and people without cable systems have no access to these .
So TV could become a useful tool in the educational process if more effort was put into this , from the television programming to the preference of society .
It is argued that whether the government or teachers have the right to determine what subjects should be taught in schools .
In my opinion , although there are some advantages if teachers are responsible for this task , I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission .
There are two main advantages of teachers deciding what subjects are taught in schools .
If the decision is made by central authorities , the most obvious advantage is that the assessment of students ' grades could be standardized throughout the whole country .
For example , a fair grade judging system is essential in a Joint College Entrance Examination .
Although some drawbacks may exist when this task is determined by the central authorities , a committee comprising experts in different disciplines could minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusion , while there are advantages and disadvantages of both central authorities and teachers leading this task , I prefer the government to do so .
On the one hand , friends are like a family because you live together a lot of experiences and adventures .
They are essential to share secrets or anything .
In conclusion , so family and friends are very necessary in your life .
Both texts contribute different approaches to the music industry .
Accordingly , the first one considers whether the industry has been affected by file sharing , whereas the second analyses the success of live performance in the present technological era .
The first text asserts that file sharing benefits new artists and offers listeners a wide choice of styles , despite the fact that it is believed that file sharing is detrimental to the music industry .
Additionally , the writer suggests that it has some potential which can be used by the CD industry .
The second text assesses the attraction of concerts despite the present high quality of recorded music , and suggests that the reasons for the success may be the communal experience and its offer of different songs and performances that make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , the music industry should adapt to new technologies and new habits of users .
On the other hand , personally speaking , I 've always been amazed by the attraction of concerts for large audiences . Therefore , in my opinion , the second text offers good reasons to explain this phenomenon .
The first place you could visit is FEXPOCRUZ . You will be astounded by the gorgeous girls and the fascinating business you can get there .
If you want to go sightseeing downtown and enjoy the nightlife , I know a fun place where we can dance and drink a lot .
If you need more information about this city , let me know .
That 's one of the possibilities which and I can do in winter when I want to be outside , instead of walking or snowboarding .
And more , I have an opportunity to meet new people .
On the other hand , I might get a cold and a temperature or something like that .
Casar de Cáceres is located in the north of Cáceres . You can see a lot of amazing things in this spectacular village .
Walking around the mysterious streets can be a great experience . We can find some really nice people , including pilgrims crossing the village every day following the historic path of the Via de la Plata , which is located in Casar .
You can smell and taste the gastronomic delights that are on offer , such as the stunning Torta del Casar with denomination of origin .
Many drivers regard travelling by car as a future means to travel which helps people save a lot of time .
However , others believe that public transport is better , due to the fact that public transport is environmentally friendly .
It is a known fact that travelling by car is less green than by travelling public transport .
In present - day society , sustainable development is of paramount importance as our environment is being destroyed at a fast rate .
Using public transport helps save resources such as fuel and electricity .
If people insist on travelling by car , they are , in fact , producing greenhouse gases which are given out by their cars .
It is definitely not environmentally friendly .
To preserve our environment , taking public transport is a must and a global trend in the future .
All in all , public transport should be an indispensable part of our future plan , because we have to protect our beautiful environment . Travelling by car , although much more convenient , is never a clever choice for the betterment of our future society because of serious environmental issues .
If everyone started using a car for traveling , there would n't be enough road for everyone as there are seven billion people in the world , and even for the environment it is better to use cars as little as possible .
On top of that , fuel consumption would be too high as we have limited availability of fuel resources .
The government and public bodies should start thinking about it , and to save society public transport is best .
Certain age groups wo n't be able to drive a car , so they definitely need public transport .
I can understand the use of public transport is decreasing nowadays , but there is still a future for it .
Everyone should think about it because it is really vital for society ; and especially the international bodies should do something about it to motivate people to use public transport as much as possible .
So , in summary , to save the environment , to make the roads accessible to everyone , public transport should be used and we should all try to educate people about the importance of public transport .
They lived in a small town in Massachusetts .
He asked Jessica to let him go with her , but she did n't agree , because before marrying him , she wanted to try to see if their love could hold out against everything , including distance .
She was disappointed and tried to explain her thinking to him , but he did n't want to understand her reasons .
Then , I would make the next recommendation .
Nevertheless , the sports store is a little expensive .
However , these three are the most visited by tourists , so they will not disappoint you .
They argue that a large number of people prefer travelling in private transport , because it is more comfortable and convenient .
Travelling by car can give you a certain status and make you feel more independent , besides the comfort and convenience .
Firstly , travelling by bus or on other public transport , such as the underground , helps us to decrease the emission of exhaust which causes pollution and global warming .
And last but not the least , public transport is much safer than private transport , because it transports many more people , and so , there is more caution .
Detoxification , a method people often use to lose weight , has not been proved by science .
People think that it is a common and effective way , but I believe , since there is no scientific evidence , it should not be brought to the weight - loss process .
In fact , some people just understand one aspect of this method , that is to say , they have applied the wrong method .
However , the method has brought some unexpected results due to their wrong understanding .
In fact , some deaths have been caused by bringing detoxification to the weight - loss process , because they follow the majority without carefully considering .
Generally speaking , the method has not been demonstrated to work by scientists , so it is better to avoid it in order not to have some unexpected consequences .
Film stars and politicians are interesting to people because of their talents and special abilities .
Of course , people want to know some facts about the personal lives of famous people , but often , stars do n't like it when journalists try to get into their lives .
On the one hand , famous people try to hide their lives from journalists .
In everyday life , the internet has become one of the most important things and it is becoming more and more influential .
On the other hand , with the internet , we can follow the news and current affairs very quickly and we do not have to wait for the news on the television , and we do not have to buy newspapers .
In conclusion , the internet has pros and cons , but it can be very useful and fun to use .
Gnadenthal is a very small village consisting of almost only one single drivable road , which is not famous for its size , though .
What is really special about this little village is the Christian brotherhood who have been living there more than 1000 years .
That is probably the reason why the local conditions are still similar to the ones of the Middle Ages , apart from some infrastructural improvements that made diseases like plaque obsolete .
The few houses themselves are set around a very old Romanesque church , which is bordered by a traditional farmyard for raising sheep and cows .
Nearby , fields growing vegetables can be visited which have never been altered by any modern machine but only by the power of hand and cattle .
Gnadenthal is exceptionally suitable for people who want to take some time off from their hard and stressful daily life in order to find calmness and to think about themselves in a way of their character .
Since there is no chance for any distractions because of the missing digital infrastructure , any guest will experience a four - day visit the same as a four - week journey in the usual western world .
This enables him to get used to the traditional way of life of a monk .
By conserving this place , the opportunity to gather a great amount of psychological enrichment is conserved , too .
Hi bro , What s up there ? .I'm going to recommend you to give up sport . As I told you too many times , sport is bad for your health . It makes you to be all day with legs or arms broken or something like that , and music improves and stimulates your brain and intelligence .
But also , I told you that if you are very good at sports , you might get a grant for your studies , which will be worth it , so I do n't know . In my opinion , I would continue with the music if you are good at it because it is better for your brain , but also , sports can relax you and make you disconnect , so if I were you , I would think about it and compare which of them you like more or which makes you feel better or relax more or just makes you laugh or have a good time .
So , I enjoy running alone or with friends , because this sport has a lot of possibilities , more than I thought when I started to run after finishing High School .
Therefore , we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths to pavement .
Later , I had more roommates , colleagues and partners even who did this sport , which is among the most fashionable ones at the moment .
But , for beginners , I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence , and practising with company because running can be boring , tiring , dangerous even , but if you have a strong spirit and willpower , you 'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses .
I enjoy it and got achievability from it .
Through the practice of Karate , I really understand myself .
Since most of these public transport amenities have been remedial rather than something planned when foreseeing future problems , they have only been of limited help and , therefore , they have only worked for some time .
This has resulted in only very needy people using public transport , and the vast majority of people still use their personal automobile , with inconveniences and safety being the excuse .
Indeed , using public transport is not only unsafe and uncomfortable , but also unhealthy .
So , little by little , and as the economic conditions of people improve , public transport will eventually disappear .
In the past , I tried to play basketball , tennis , ping pong and so on , but the outcome made me depressed and less confident .
Especially in New Zealand , there are some beautiful islands and you can get to them by ferry easily .
If you are interested in hiking , you should buy waterproof clothes , just in case .
In some places , you will have difficulty finding it .
Let 's start hiking as soon as possible , otherwise you will miss the opportunity to see fabulous scenery .
During the last decades , the number of cars used in big cities has increased steadily . Proportionally , air pollution and deaths associated with traffic accidents have also increased .
One way to reduce those negative consequences is to foster the use of public transport .
It moves more people per liter of oil used and pollutes a small fraction of the amount it would have if every passenger had traveled using individual cars .
However , public transport lacks some advantages only found when using our own car .
The first point which I would like to mention is cost .
Cars are n't cheap and if you think that it is easier to move from one place to another when you have a car , you have got a point , but there are a lot of considerations which you should occur like gas , insurance or parking costs .
That could be frustrating , especially when you have a long journey and you need to spend long hours driving .
Finally , the word convenient means something different for everyone .
Being there has some advantages and disadvantages .
I can start by saying something about the advantages : we are not just classmates but we are friends .
But there are some disadvantages , like stairs because we are on the second floor . We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many stairs to reach our classroom and that 's so annoying sometimes .
Furthermore , travelling by car is a very comfortable way of travelling .
As you may be concerned , cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages .
In addition , cars have been increasing the world 's carbon emissions and that causes the ' Ozone Layer ' to thin down .
To sum up , cars have advantages but , on the other hand , they can also create problems .
In my opinion , cars are one of the best and most useful inventions .
Unfortunately , we should be careful with the way we use them .
You 've chosen the best country for attending university .
Travelling could be a good way to improve your language and to get to know Italy better .
You should definitely visit Rome and Florence !
These are both amazing because they are full of history ; in the first one you can still see Roman monuments , while Florence offers lots of Medieval churches .
Maybe you 'll choose to attend university in one of these cities !
Italy offers lots of work opportunity during summertime .
Adam was twelve years old , a clever boy in his school , always got the top marks and participated in most activities , and known to all the teachers and students .
He also played in the school football team and beat the state club .
Despite all these things , Adam was lonely and had no friends in school or in Abbeywood Street in Queensland , where he lived in Australia , and Adam was very annoyed about that , and what made it worse , was that a boy called Johnny had insulted him and Adam did n't want to have a fight with him .
He realized Adam 's marks were getting lower and he was involved in some trouble in school and began to investigate him .
As a matter of fact , Mr Michael should have provided some advice for Adam when his marks got lower , but he did n't , and the consequences were very bad , so Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I know this is not easy , but there is an ecological and cheap mode of transport : the bicycle .
For short distances , it is a good way to do exercise and to avoid polluting .
But let me tell you that I was confused in the best way , not because it was rather wacky but because happenend unexpected .
The plot revolves around an FBI squad who face , in a game of cat and mouse , a team composed of the four best illusionists .
They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances , sharing out the stolen money with their audiences .
If I have to stand out any weakness I would say that is a bit predictable .
As it is a movie related to magic tricks , when a sequence is played and it seems simple and easily understandable , you know that , in fact , it is not .
On the other hand , if you are looking for a film that is extremely gripping and can keep you guessing , it 's definitely the right choice for you .
Exam stress leads to many bad consequences for high school students .
These consequences vary . One example would be that students may get lower grades in their exams , or even fail them .
They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness , since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam .
As a result , many high school students may not concentrate during classes , or whilst studying , since they have many things going through their heads ( since they 've been studying a lot ) .
Based on all the problems listed ( and many more ) , we must find solutions that will help both students and teachers to deal with exam stress .
The study guide does n't necessarily need to be a long and complex one ( since those may cause them stress too ) ; they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises .
Then I decided to study engineering and become one of the best engineers ever .
Long after that , because I had such a natural talent at engineering , I began to write books and essays about everything related to my job .
People are looking for a comfortable , easy life .
We are all looking for that without great difficulty or effort and one way to achieve this goal is to study abroad .
Many students today like to study abroad to get a high standard of living , to get their life job and experience a new way of life .
Studying abroad can enhance employment opportunities .
Companies are looking for well - educated people with good experience to hire and students are more likely to suit their choices .
With your certificate , you can easily find a job .
Universities are also a rich place for big opportunities to get there if you have studied abroad .
You can work at a university as a lecturer and get a high salary .
Students who go to study in another country experience variety of life .
They try new food in completely different places .
They learn how to do everything by themselves and become independent .
To sum up , studying abroad is a great chance to get a great job as you have higher education with much more experience .
Moreover , you can learn many things and expand your knowledge , and have friends from different backgrounds .
Do you remember our arrangement ?
Also , on Tuesday and on Friday we wo n't have class and we will be able to go running and cycling .
Besides , I 've a big surprise . Apart from remembering our agreement , my father is taking up hiking with his friends and he has invited us to join them .
Anyway , what about having lunch on Saturday and speaking about it quietly ?
I 'm writing in response to the announcement in International Sports Monthly .
I would like to say that my favourite sport is birdwatching .
To begin with , I have been interested in birdwatching from when I was young and I want to be a biologist when I grow up .
Birdwatching really relaxes me and brings me closer to nature .
Also , I enjoy being able to recognise the different species of birds .
If someone wants to start birdwatching , I think he should be interested in birdwatching first .
This means that if he does n't like it , he will definitely give up immediately .
Then he should buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope .
To sum up , I believe birdwatching is a really exciting sport but you must like it to start it .
Sports or hobbies could be great options as new activities to plan at my college . However , I believe there are others which could be provided for us and it would be interesting to take part in .
In addition , it could be interesting , although you do n't have to do physical activity , because your ability to edit a speech , support an idea , have connected speech will be improved by this kind of activity .
I think that the allure of this activity is that you can meet a lot of people and share with them that experience .
In conclusion , making a speech contributes to our social relationships and it allows us to define our personality .
I am glad to hear that everything is OK with you .
I am very grateful that you will help me with searching for some information about colleges in England .
Actually , I am interested in science , especially the area between chemistry and physics .
Also , I 'm interested in tuition which refers to biology and the influence of different kinds of chemical compounds on the human body .
You know that I learnt biotechnology at school in Bulgaria .
Customer satisfaction is much greater when the customer gets service which has value or quality much greater than expected .
If service only meets expectations and does not provide anything more than them , that means customer satisfaction is there , but the customer will not feel great .
If service is not meeting the expectations of the customer or its quality is just below what is expected , it causes customer dissatisfaction .
This will result in consequences such as negative feedback .
In this context , it can be concluded that 78% of the respondents are satisfied with both the customer service of builders and the results of Vasthu .
The rest of the respondents gave positive feedback .
The factors which hinder other respondents from giving very positive feedback may be either dissatisfaction caused by customer service or failure of Vashtu 's results ' failure to meet their expectations .
It is one of my favourite free time activities .
Personally , I watch a comedy movie almost every evening .
I respond to the article " White House calls for ' genuine choice ' in Hong Kong elections after petition attracts 200,000 signatures " on SCMP .
In fact , China will not be moved by this , and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong , China and the US .
It is better not to interfere in internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China 's political conditions .
The US is supporting this illegal activity indirectly .
The US always keep " rule by law " as their catchphrase , but Occupying Central is disobeying Hong Kong law .
According to Wiki encyclopedia , the FBI called the occupiers " terrorists " and decided to suppress the dispute as if dealing with a terrorist attack .
So the US has no qualification to criticize China .
Apart from this , the presidential election in the US is full of unfairness .
I do not know if there is a filter for presidential candidates . I just know that the ballots are counted by states .
After Hong Kong gets " real democracy " , the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent .
The US always targets dividing China into many small , weak countries , then it can break up one of its competitors .
Let us look at countries that the US introduced " democracy " to .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria . There was chaos instead of " democracy " everywhere , and the next might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central will lead to chaos similar to the Tunisian Revolution .
The signature collection by the White House has now ended .
Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts are both considered crucial for students ' education .
Some people think that knowing facts is easier and more practical .
Nevertheless , others consider learning ideas and concepts to be the best way to deal with many academic and real - life problems .
l completely agree with the idea that it is important for students to learn ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
However , ideas and concepts give people a competitive edge when dealing with other similar issues .
From this experience , I learn that I should not just remember facts , but should try my best to understand ideas and concept .
Consequently , you can reach high academic levels .
However , learning ideas and concepts needs more investigation and understanding from many of the academic textbooks .
When students grasp the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issues related to it deeply .
There were masses of materials on a specific issue , but I tried my best to grasp its notion and that made me recognize any unmentioned points .
Not only do students learn more in their studies , but also it helps students understand many facts in our lives better than any other way .
He is so brilliant ; he speaks three languages , plays several instruments , and most important of all , he is a man of remarkable principles .
When he was younger , he worked for the government , but he had to quit because of the corruption .
He always wanted to have his own business . He used to say , if you work for somebody you are part of the problem , but if you hire people to work for you , you are part of the solution , so if you want to be successful , be your own boss .
When I try to create in dreams the home of the future , the first thing which I have in mind is new technology . In my opinion , homes in the future have to be different . This is connected with our society and development .
In general , houses could have open space , a lot of windows and light everywhere .
In my opinion , inside they will still look the same , maybe with more technology connected with new inventions .
One of the most impressive solutions will be swimming pools in the sky , near area .
They will be more comfortable and useful for our community .
We found very cosy and traditional houses , the market was very popular , with a lot of people walking around , and the people were very nice to us .
The next place was a restaurant near the beach .
Near the restaurant , we saw a very strange thing .
When he saw me in front of him , he immediately invited me to dinner with him .
Because I had never heard beautiful words like that about me , I accepted the invitation without thinking .
When the night came , I went to the restaurant that he invited me to go to .
Since then , we have been in touch and now we are dating . I think this is extraordinary .
But one day , my sports teacher gave me the opportunity to become a basketball player at nine years old .
Since that day , basketball has been my favourite sport .
Would you like to become a basketball player too ?
A player can win a game , but only a team can win championships " .
If you remember that , and understand it , you will become a great basketball player .
All of us are surrounded by plastic . Plastic is needed for a lot of things in our everyday life .
However , I also think that it 's important to be conscious of environmental concerns , so some ideas like this could be good to reduce rubbish .
So , we can use plastic in a responsible way , but we have to know that we should n't take this idea to the extreme because we need plastic .
I watched till they dragged him away , and then everything went quiet again , as if there was nobody , so I 'm sure the cops will ENFORCE the guy who did this .
A couple 's coming slowly down Frankstown , walking with a girl by the hand . She has to be the boy 's baby sister .
Could they hear my old mind working to guide them , lead them and TREND them and get up out of this damn wheelchair and take them by the hand .
But , unfortunately , we 're not in the future .
The other benefit of living abroad is incredible personal experiences .
Therefore , this experience opens you up to different ways of viewing the world which may alter the rest of your life . In addition , it gives your children a much better understanding of other cultures when they attend international schools .
Congratulations !
Near the mountains ( about 20 kilometres ) you can find beaches , but I recommend the beaches in the South , Andalusia .
There are many kilometres of coast and there are a lot of sites and parties to enjoy all the time .
Travelling in Spain is easy .
Not unlike most of the world 's sports lovers , I 'm mad about football !
Not just a really competitive game , football is a full mix of art , creativity , dedication , hard work and team work .
When a very skilled player finds himself in a hostile work environment ( with talented but selfish players who are n't committed to their " team play " ) he tends to lose performance and lack good results in matches .
Supporters of traditional clubs can be very passionate .
Usually , when facing tough opponents or decisive matches , they turn the stadium into a really big party in order to intimidate their adversaries ; coloring the benches with flags and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaics to express their delight .
If someone asks me what is the most important thing to start playing ( or even following ) this terrific sport , I 'd say it 's passion for wearing your club 's jersey and respect for your adversaries .
For years of wars and difficult situations , history was creating people 's beliefs and convictions .
I think religion means a lot to people- especially Polish people .
I want to describe the story of the Monastery of Częstochowa .
It 's a city in Poland strongly connected with the dramatic history of our country .
The icon , depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child , known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was imported from Russia in 1384 . And since then a lot of pilgrims have been visiting that picture .
Polish people had to defend Częstochowa and rescue their country . But the Polish resistance was smaller and smaller .
Immediately the fighters of Sweden began to stop attacking a hill .
He promised that the Madonna of Częstochowa would always be a Polish queen .
I think it is a perfect example of an important historical place in my country .
I think everybody who lives in Poland must go to Częstochowa .
On the one hand , we have people who live for their sport . On the other hand , there are people who do any sport , indifferently , because it is just a way to lose weight or a way to spend their free time .
Unfortunately , I do n't have a favourite sport , although I 'd like to have one .
It is likely you would have more self - confidence if you worked harder during a lesson .
So , for the unlucky ones like me , my suggestion is , if you have not fallen in love with any sport , you should try a course ! You will surely feel better and more relaxed after that .
Tarragona is an interesting and beautiful place for spending your time .
It is an big city and there are a lot of attractions .
Restaurants and clubs
You should go to the restaurants located in the harbour of Tarragona .
All of them are based on the typical Mediterranean cuisine .
Mirabel , Aquamar and Siroco are the trendy restaurants .
They are very comfortable and cosy and a good price .
At night it has a special atmosphere .
Watching the Mediterranean sea .
Conclusions and recommendations
Tarragona and surroundings are a good place to visit and to explore their culture .
First , parents are a great source of experience , which can be helpful in teaching .
Secondly , they have a close relationship with their children , which results in feelings and emotions .
As mentioned earlier , experience is a prerequisite for every teacher .
It does n't matter whether they have failed or gained success through those events , the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events .
From this point of view , children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences .
I , myself , have faced so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents .
Once , when I was 18 years old , I had to make an important decision about my university major .
So , I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities .
I was hoping that my decision was the right one , but it was n't actually . I had chosen electronics but my parents told me to do some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronics .
I followed their recommendations and I totally changed my thinking .
So , by considering different ideas and opinions , finally I chose computer engineering as my university major .
So , parents ' experiences can make them good teachers for their children .
They have a strong familiarity with preferences , skills , talents and all other valuable information related to their children .
Regarding this information , they can teach their children and help them to make reasonable decisions .
So , I went to my parents and asked for their help . They presented the best recommendations for making the decision , then I could make the best friends that I could easily get along with .
I am really satisfied with my parents as my indisputable teachers .
All in all , parents are a great source of experience , which can help them to be good teachers .
Also , they have so many close relationships with their children , which makes them trustworthy characters as teachers .
When the weather is good , I often go out with my friend for a walk in the countryside or go shopping .
Finally , I enjoy taking care of my garden , where there are many flowerbeds with a lot of different kinds of flowers .
Actually , I do n't like computer games very much , because , in my opinion , they are so boring ! I also think these games create a sort of dependency , like alcohol or drugs , so they can be very dangerous !
For example , I use my computer to prepare exercises for my students or to look for funny and useful laboratory experiments in chemistry .
This is a documentary about science .
I like watching it because I can get a lot of information from this programme .
For example , I can learn about the Big Bang , or the origin of the universe . It 's fascinating !
From this programme I can get information about the latest scientific discoveries and
technological developments .
In my opinion , it is one of the most interesting programmes about science on TV .
What did you understand about the job advertisement ?
This is a job dealing with all the information on a cruise , and the media manager works with other managers on a cruise .
Every day you have new news about the cruise , excursions , the weather and a lot of other information about the cruise .
If you want information early the in morning , you can get newspapers in your cabin .
The media manager follows information on panel , changes information depending on the weather , trips and a lot of other information .
You can change all the information on a cruise and inform passengers about the change of plan for the cruise .
We also have to keep in mind taking care of our environment , in order to have a healthy life .
In my town we protect the environment around us :
At school , children are taught about how to make appropriate use of electricity .
There are many people that offer themselves as volunteers to clean the city , and have been very helpful in making the city cleaner and more attractive .
" Seven " is a story about a psychopathic serial killer , who kills on behalf of morality and ethics .
In particular , the killer kills seven people , each one corresponding to those actions that , according to the Christian religion , are the seven deadly sins .
All the murders show characteristics reflecting a specific deadly sin .
That provides , especially to one of the two detectives who are investigating the crimes , a trail to follow in their investigation .
In the movie there , are some references to Dante 's " Divina Commedia " , an Italian poem , as well as to the Bible .
The film is excellent because of both a very exciting and engaging plot , and great performances by the main characters - the serial killer and the two detectives .
Many times when I have been shopping , I was unhappy or disappointed for different reasons .
Unfortunately , we realize at home , that our wallet is empty .
When it comes to bargain sales , in such periods , people start to behave like animals and rarely think rationally .
Nevertheless , some people treat shopping too seriously and , as a result , become addicted to it .
I 'd like to present my application because I think I 'm the person that you are looking for for the job described in your advertisement .
There , over the last two years , I was the leader of a group which was involved in the organisation of lessons for young students with learning difficulties .
I was in the school swimming team and I 've got a first - aid certificate .
Each year , in the summer holiday , I 've worked in the " Summer camp " organised in our neighbourhood , both helping in the kitchens and organising sports and various activities for children between 6 and 13 years old .
In the wonderful world of cooking that we live , in where we have a lot of products and chefs are so good , I would like to visit an Italian restaurant , because I love cheese and I think that Italy is the best place in the world where you can eat different types of cheese .
The perfect atmosphere for me is a modern building that has different rooms with different styles : modern , classical , gothic , etc .
When I eat in a restaurant , I hate two things : people smoking and the loud voices of the people .
Whereas I love two things too : a friendly waitress with her traditional black clothes and a light on my table that makes the night more romantic if you dine with your partner or more relaxed if you dine with your friend .
I think that an Italian restaurant is a great place for my class , because there they can choose between different fantastic dishes . For example , pasta , pizza , seafood or pork .
I enjoyed the time off from university .
My time off from university is important to my personal development .
Learning can also take place outside the university campus .
As such , we develop through interacting with our environment .
While on holidays from university ,
I was able to inspire some members of my family to send their children to university .
I told my friends and family members the importance of university education to our community .
I visited many interesting places , e.g. a nature reserve , historical places , the zoo , rivers etc .
Also during this period , I was involved in a local community project building a community hospital . While on this project , I interacted and shared ideas with other professionals on the project .
While on time off from university ,
I took a part - time job with the local housing company .
This part - time job gives me a learning opportunity to develop my skills and understand the practical aspects of my career .
This practical experience gave me the opportunity to understand the importance of supervision .
I earnt some money to pay my university fees and rent for three months . I also received a very good reference from the firm which was passed on to the university .
They would like to offer me another opportunity to do a work placement in my final year at university .
My parents are both English native speakers , but to learn more about the culture , I studied languages at university and now I have a degree in English and French , so this job is also an opportunity for me to improve my English in another situation and not only with my parents and family .
In Italy , I worked as a babysitter for a couple of months . I took care of 3 kids : 1 child is 7 years old and the other 2 children are both 11 years old . And back then , I had to cook lunch and dinner for them .
At university , I was part of the football team and we won a championship against one of the most athletic football teams in our country .
I think I 'm an energetic person that likes all the types of sports and activities , but the most important thing is that I love kids and playing with them makes me really happy .
The convenience of travelling by car benefits the majority of us in modern society .
Car manufacturers are desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of cars .
By making them more modern , powerful and economical , they have successfully attracted more customers than ever .
As a result , the rapid increase of cars on the road has brought negative consequences .
Firstly , vehicles ' emissions can have detrimental effects on the environment in many ways .
Secondly , vehicles contain many different fluids , including motor oil , antifreeze , gasoline , air - conditioning refrigerants , and brake , transmission , hydraulic and windshield - wiper fluids .
In most cases , these fluids are toxic to humans and animals , and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed of incorrectly .
In addition , traffic congestion has become another worsening problem .
The traffic jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days .
It is considered to be one of the longest traffic jams by some media .
On the other hand , modern public transport has been improved progressively in the past decade .
Its comfortable , efficient and economical features have been attracting more young professionals .
In 2013 , the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides , averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2 ] Shanghai Metro system is 14 metro lines and 329 stations , with an operating route length of 334 miles , with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013 .
In addition to the convenience of public transport , the fares are much cheaper compared with driving a car .
Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport passes as a benefit .
The public transport in my city is very convenient .
Even though our subway system is still developing , the main line that passes through downtown , several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourists ' , students ' and professionals ' first choice for commuting .
There are some park - and - ride stations allowing car drivers to connect with the subway . It is very convenient and encourages more people to drive less .
Environmental awareness has positively affected the younger generations .
I think it would be a good idea to try the restaurant " The old clock " .
The restaurant is charming and fascinating , located in the old town 's center .
It 's an ancient brewery which keeps a special atmosphere .
The menu is not really wide - this is good in my opinion , because I 'm quite suspicious of restaurants offering too many dishes ... The restaurant serves fresh food only , depending on the season 's produce .
There is also a good choice of food for vegetarians , so Mike and Ann will not have a problem eating .
Last but not least , the price is good , especially considering the quality of food and service .
I was lying on the couch with a mystery novel in my hands ! It had all just been a nightmare !
All over the world , the number of overweight people is growing .
Obesity is one of the most significant challenges of present - day society due to the fact that the number of people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly .
This essay will look at some of the key causes and effects of obesity among people .
Having looked at both causes and effects of obesity among people , it is recommended that people pay attention to eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a healthy lifestyle for their own benefit .
I liked this shopping centre because it has a lot of women 's shops inside , the facilities are quite attractive and very up - to - date , the green zones are broad and it is supplied with a lot of wooden benches .
Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
The sky was cloudy , the temperature was below zero , the wind made him not able to walk and it was then that he realized why is sister was celebrating her wedding on this date .
For me , these are the most incredible sports that anyone can do .
The ideal is to start doing this sport as children , because the older you are the more difficult it is to overcome fear , but it is never too late to learn to swim .
This sport combines the movement of arms and legs with breathing , as coordination between these parts is crucial .
Among the advantages of swimming we can highlight the following :
Improving the respiratory system .
5 . Relax not only the body but also the mind , so that stress decreases considerably .
If you want to know more and learn to practise this sport , we recommend attending a specialized school . There are many good and not so expensive ones , where you can count on the support of a qualified instructor who will give you the confidence to start .
As per our discussion earlier on the Service Guide Sales communication , I would like to ask you if you have already started to prepare the background and sales communication materials for this service guide and how to use it .
We are aiming to deliver the Service Guide materials in Week 25 to the marketing colleagues for translation and localisation .
The countries will have 6 weeks to localise and produce it ( till Week 32 ) .
Following our communication to the marketing community , ideally we should also inform the sales community about the sales communication materials and guidelines .
I propose having a meeting to discuss the process / timeline and align our communications to the marketing and sales community .

You 're welcome , I 'll be very happy to put you up . I'll show you the marvellous venues which are situated in my hometown .
To come to my home , firstly you must take the National Express coach .
About the weather forecast for next month , I 'm sorry to tell you that the temperature might fall .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Driving your own car gives you more freedom when travelling and increases your sense of independence .
However , a car is not always more economical to run because , for example , you have to pay for road taxes , insurance , and motor tests .
Not to mention the fuel .
The main reason for this is that cars use diesel or petrol , whereas trains use electricity .
From 17th to 20th March me and my schoolmates , and the 2 M , went on a trip to Sicily .
Then we had lunch and went to ' Giardini Naxos ' and we saw the necropolis .
It was an incredible trip !
It looks like regular cars but has some advantages .
In addition , my car is considerably more powerful than other means of transport .
I want to see tropical animals , birds and meet the local population .
Travelling by car is much more convenient , as many people say , but public transport is much better for the environment .
Many people use public transport every day and I think this is good for our communication , because we can talk to other people .
It is also good for our environment because there is just one bus for 80 people .
Public transport will increase in the future , because every year there are more train stations and more streets .
Only by looking in the eyes of stone - cold danger can he evade disappearance himself .
My favourite sport is swimming . I like it because it makes me feel free , independent and happy .
It is an individual sport but also a team activity .
In my opinion , it is one of the healthiest sports there are because you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breathing .
I do not swim in competitions , but almost since I was 3 years old ,
I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates .
If he is afraid of the water , it is not recommended to do this sport , or being able to overcome his fear would be a great goal .
It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you .
If we talk about my favourite sport , it will be basketball .
I love basketball , though I rarely play basketball because it is hard to find a stadium to play basketball in Thailand .
I like basketball because it is one of the easiest sports .
Let 's talk about the advantages of playing basketball .
I think playing basketball helps me to be healthy .
If someone wants to play some sport , basketball is my first suggestion .
So , newbies can understand and know the rules easily .
This is a story about basketball , my favourite sport .
All in all , as we can see , there are many advantages and disadvantages to considering the members of your family your best friends .
From my point of view , friendship is based on honesty .
Introduction :
The purpose of this report is to evaluate the range of options available for many twenty - somethings in order to choose their housing in my country , as well as the main obstacles they face with each one .
It will also describe the possible housing prospects in the coming years and the consequences for young people .
Due to the enormous economic crisis that has shaken Europe and that has intoxicated the real - estate market , most of the prices are eye - wateringly expensive for college students that want to study abroad or simply emancipate .
In addition , the unwillingness of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something important to take into account .
But then I proved to myself that everything is possible .
In addition , I made new friends there . They are very clever and physically strong .
They teach me the techniques of how to run faster .
I keep practicing with them , running around West Lake every Saturday .
After the race , we got together in the cafe , drink beer and had a nice conversation .
My next goal is to participate in a full - marathon .
I think everything is possible when you are organized . You start to build your own timetable , which makes your life more easy and effective .
We can learn that a lot of successful people are very organized .
This company has the intention of setting up some training courses for staff , so I came up with the idea of having a course that concentrates on company morale .
I strongly believe in the idea of having a comfortable office environment , because when you like what you are doing and also where you are doing it , you will do it the best you can .
I recommend that everyone in this department takes the course , that way we could have the views of all the employees and focus on what we need to improve and channel it into profits .
These courses will last about a week and I suggest we only take from two to three hours per day so it does n't become tedious and we can keep everyone interested .
In conclusion , this will make everyone feel part of the company and we will have everyone 's opinions .
The story of Blade Runner is about a police officer named Dickard who is working as a killer for the most dangerous robots on earth , which they call the replicants , and they are dangerous to humans .
Dickard , the police officer , kills three robots in the film , but at the end of the movie and before he tries to kill the last robot , he discovers that batty has emotions and feelings instead of his mechanical body , because he saves Dickard 's life at the end of the film .
Travelling has an important role in our everyday life ; we need to get to work , school , want to meet our friends .
On the one hand , it is more convenient to have a car .
Owning a vechicle is very convenient and gives you independence .
It enables you to go anywhere you want , no matter when .
You can also stop worrying about how much you take to work and on trips , being able to hide all those things inside your trunk , while this is impossible with any other means of transport ,
Moreover , travelling by train , tram or bus produces less exhaust fumes and , as a result , saves the ozone layer .
To sum up , travelling using public transport is more beneficial for both the environment and travellers .
I am convinced , that in spite of cars being comfortable , public transport will constantly develop .
Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and divide to produce more stem cells .
They can also treat or prevent a disease or condition , and are used by scientists in research , and by doctors .
There are a lot of people in this world that are ill and need stem cells in their healing process , so parents that had an aborted foetus should let the scientists and the doctors use the stem cells in their research and help other people .
Science nowadays has developed a lot and has given the population a lot of possibilities , like storing stem cells and using them to treat future health problems anyone can have .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to inform visitors to Leonberg about our shopping facilities .
There you can find almost anything you want , from clothes to electronics and groceries , to beauty products and flowers .
Furthermore , the picturesque old town of Leonberg has a number of lovely small corner shops where you can buy local food and handmade products .
Even if you are interested in more than ordinary shopping , you will be satisfied in Leonberg .
We have a big furniture store , an extraordinary market garden , a well - known home improvement store , and also a large bike retailer with professionally trained shop assistants .
Recommendations
In my opinion , shopping is not always enjoyable , especially for men .
Sometimes , your shopping trip turns out to be unsuccessful and you are desperate because you wasted money .
If we look around us , we can see a lot of facilities .
For this reason , we are always involved in the project of improving the facilities for life , and one of the most important aspects of the project is the home .
Nowadays , we have a lot of electronic devices , such as microwaves , remote contols for TV , electronic devices for cooking , personal computers , and so on and so forth .
Each one makes everyday life a bit easier , but real progress in the home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind .
An inner electronic system would compose the whole house ; it would include small devices of wave reception connected , on every side of the house , to a gum headband whose function would be to identify neural stimuli and to convert them into radio waves .
This system would also be connected to the Internet in a ' dual output remote port of information ' .
Having explained it , I am completely sure that this outline of my ' house of future ' will astonish and amaze everyone who reads my sublime project .
How are you doing ? I remember you wanted me to tell you about my experience with helping at a concert I went to last month .
But , I fortunately made it .
I was attached to a group of people who were responsible for informing the public about the programme and all the organisational stuff .
We took some photos and got autographs .
Michael the big man , who can do everything in the whole damn world , except take care of his keys , I guess ... "
Sexual Harassment
Their behavior may make you feel uncomfortable and disgusting .
You should know it is called sexual harassment .
Sexual harassment is somebody else ( maybe strangers or maybe someone you are familiar with ) bullying or forcing you sexually .
You may get hurt physically and mentally by sexual harassment .
Today , I will talk about the problem of sexual harassment .
First , I will show you what happens when sexual harassment occurs .
Second , I will tell you how to deal with sexual harassment .
Sexual harassment may occur in a variety of circumstances - in workplaces , schools and even houses .
The perpetrators harm the victims by words or assault .
Now you know what sexual harassment is .
If you are the victim of sexual harassment or you are a witness , you should try to call for help first .
Many people hesitate to tell others about an incident because they think it is embarrassing to tell others about this .
I have explained two important aspects of sexual harassment .
First , I showed you what sexual harassment is .
In conclusion , sexual harassment may happen anywhere , anytime , by anyone .
Be alert and take some precautions to protect yourself .
Let 's say no to sexual harassment !
This restaurant is near the riverside of Zarate .
in other restaurants , and they let you eat the amount of main courses that you wish for the same price .
In addition , the atmosphere of the place is excellent .
with an amazing riverside view that makes you relax and feel comfortable .
Travelling by car is much more convenient than using public transport for various obvious reasons .
But , considering the increase in private vehicles in our crowded overpopulated world , it is recommended by geologists and ecologists that we use public transportation .
In this way , we not only contribute to saving our eco - system , we also contribute to increasing the national revenue .
Our interaction with human beings has been pathetically reduced .
Exchanging greetings , expressing emotions , updating work status , gaming , studying and more have become activities we do using mobile phones .
Cars are mostly used by people travelling long distances in a shorter time .
Inside cities and for shorter distances , nothing can be more comfortable and safe than public transport .
Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely , but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with other people .
For centuries the population of the world has been dreaming of commuting anywhere comfortably by car .
It was after thinking about this major problem that governments around the world launched the greatest and most ambitious plan .
To start with , cars are going to be made using high technology at a lower cost , and therefore affordable to all .
City development is already under construction .
New motorways , streets , car parks are no longer sitting in the council 's offices , waiting to be signed , they are a reality transforming the world landscape .
Could we ever think of such a dream coming true ? All this is beyond my imagination and understanding , whereas new technologies could be used to give the world a much better healthy environment and less egocentric .
I am very interested in starting a pet - care franchise because I like pets and I think all these services would be very helpful for a lot of people in my country too .
Can you tell me more about the possibility of taking out a Petpals franchise in my country ?
I would like to know what initial investment I have to calculate ?
In your article you write about an education center with assistance for new franchisees .
In the future our lives will be much more difficult because we 'll struggle for everything alone .
Everyone will get help from the machines or technological .
Technology will be our best friend .
Despite this , our appearance will change . Our fashion will be more technique .
What about relationships ?
Well , I do n't think that we will build a close relationship with anyone and building a family will be even worse .
The family might exist on paper , but not in reality , because each member of the family will be busy and they will just send some messages from the high - technology phones they 'll have at that time .
I know , it sounds boring and pessimistic , but if we do n't change our minds immediately , the future is going to be like that , for sure .
From an overall perspective , it is notable a higher amount of illiterate women in all the regions compared with men , who are in some cases the half part of the total of women in each region .
Developed countries , Latin America and East Asia are the three regions that show a low percentage of illiterate people , expressed as below 20% , whereas Sub - Saharan Africa , Arab States and South Asia have over 30% of people who do not know to how read and write .
Developed countries ' figures are the lowest , being almost at 1% , whilst South Asia numbers rose sharply , reaching almost 60% in the case of females and exceeding 30% for males .
As we can see , an unequal percentage is shown depending on the area where the people come from .
Buenos Aires is a city made for tourists . Visitors can do so many activities in a small radio of the city . Dancing Tango , eating traditional meat or visiting a beautiful library are some of them .
Furthermore , there are many places where tourists can buy many things , such as a typical mate or a picture of the Obelisco Porteño .
But if visitors want something more than a typical souvenir , they can visit canteens or a bar where tango shows are put on and take their own pictures or even buy a CD with the traditional music of Buenos Aires .
Even if you just want to go shopping for clothes , there are so many places you can go . Palermo is known as a little New York for the designers and well - known brands , and technology is located in Recoleta .
So , Buenos Aires , also known as the Paris of America , gives all visitors the opportunity to meet Argentinian tradition in just one city that includes the history and the culture of the country .
Pontevedra on its way to becoming a green town .
Pontevedra has been one of the most polluted towns in Galicia for many years .
We started to appreciate the advantages of walking .
At the beginning , this was a very controversial decision .
Finally , he has championed moving Celulosa 's factory to a safer place .
Pontevedra is going greener .
Nevertheless , our passion is still strong .
In many countries , it 's considered that relatives are the close family and the only people with whom an individual can be just the way he is .
This point of view is based on , for example , the fact that you share an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that it is less probable to find negative feelings inside the family , like envy , refuse or hate .
But , family does not always guarantee these functions , and neither do friends .
It is a lovely place not far from our school , and I think it 's interesting in his natural habitat .
During this year she had explained the harbor world , in particular the world of Miramare , and I described the same things from the geographical aspects .
I was just a bit worried because there are 28 students in this class , but they are very respectful and clever .
All the students were interested in the information and they asked for a lot of explanations .
During this day , the students had the opportunity to hear very interesting things , but not in the same way as if they were in a class during a traditional frontal lesson .
They had improved their knowledge by having experience of the field .
In recent years , whether using the internet is beneficial or not has never failed to attract people 's attention .
While many people believe that the internet brings a vast amount of problems , such as a reduction in interaction between people and some bad information sources , in contrast , I have a strong opinion that the internet brings many more benefits than drawbacks .
People should first recognize that searching for information these days is much more convenient than in the past .
We had to go to a library to spend a lot of time finding information we needed on the shelves before .
On the other hand , we can access the information with just a click nowadays .
Clearly , the assessment has become much more efficient with computers and the internet .
Yet , perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using the internet , is the vast amount of information contained on it .
All the information in the world can emerge immediately after a click .
Admittedly , some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough , but it still offers us many other useful sources .
At the same time , some sources contain pornography and violent information , which makes many people afraid of using the internet to search for information .
Nevertheless , it remains a good way to store and supply information which hoped to have more flows in the future .
I think one of the important historical places in Japan is the Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto .
It has five storeys and is one of the tallest historical buildings in Kyoto .
It is a great and famous sightseeing place and it is also an important place for Japanese culture .
Kiyomizu temple was used many times as a background for a lot of Japanese novels , paintings and historical dramas .
I am sending you useful information about places of interest in Katowice , which you can show to your group .
I would recommend one of the most appealing scope , which is situated in a really attractive part of my city .

Hello , I saw the job advertisement for the summer camp and I 'm really interested in working with you .
In the past , I have done many summer camps for kids between 5 and 9 years old , so I already have a lot of experience in this kind of job .
I am conscious of the essential elements you need to be familiar with when it comes to dealing with kids , such as , patience , charisma , kindness , empathy , etc ; and I would be delighted to be part of your team .
On the other hand , you have the public service called Metrobus , and in this case you will hop off the bus a few times . When you arrive you must find the A - line , go to the Patriotismo station ( C line ) , then go to the delta station and walk to # 76 Acrone Street .

In the last ten years , Brazil has created a wide range of governmental programmes .
Educational and medical assistance , as well as iinfrastructure improvements are some of the recent advancements .
One of the best examples in education has been a scholarship programme called Science Without Borders .
It offers students a unique opportunity to study abroad and acquiring an international standard qualification .
In addition to this , it provides them with access to the newest research developments .
As a consequence of this investment , the state is contributing to the improvement of the careers of Brazilian professionals .
On the other hand , a problem could stem from the lack of incentives for the nationwide educational institutions .
Therefore , in order to avoid giving rise to any further complications , the Brazilian authorities should bear in mind the development of both national and international programmes .
As a result , quality would be guaranteed .
I am writing because I recently saw your advertisement and I am interested in it .
I am studying Civil Engineering and I am a very energetic person , and I think that this ability is essential for the job that you are seeking to fill .
Another important reason is that I want to have some money for personal things .
I think that it is a really good option to get experience and to do different and interesting things , like organise sports activities and fun activities for children .
I enclose my personal contact information and hope for a positive answer from you .
A while later , I discovered I was in a huge old museum .
Fortunately , I got an old machine gun .
I found your advertisement in the newspaper and I am very interested in working in your summer camps .
I am studying at the Czech Agriculture University in the final year .
I am a very good hard worker and I do not have any problems with working in kitchens and preparing the meals for the children and my colleagues .
3 ) conclusion
I think it 's very interesting to discover how foreign people usually eat .
I hope this information will be useful to you .

Do n't forget to recognise the most activities and tasks for you .
For instance , when you stay at university class or something like that , you should remember how much time you have to do it .
Finally , it depends on what works for you , because you have to constantly remember the time that you do your tasks .
It was late at night and Michael went surrounded with deep darkness to the edge of the forest .
The visibility was very poor because the moon was hiding behind dark grey shadows , but Michael went on memory .
Suddenly , a tumbledown cottage emerged from the darkness .
He felt a rage and a fear of discovery . " Why is she singing ?
The Nazis could be everywhere , " he thought , and unlocked the door with a little key .
If I had the opportunity of giving some advice to a person that is starting in this sport , I would tell him to not give up , because this is n't an easy sport , and it is more mental than physical .
The cathedral has a height of 55 m. The cathedral was raised to the rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756 . What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk .
The visitors programme is from Monday to Sunday , from ten o'clock a.m to six p.m. And the phone number you can call for more information is 0040212345678 .
PEOPLE 's LIVES WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS .
This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages that we will find in the next 50 years .
It will consider some relevant things which will be completely changed in the future , as well as arguing and explaining the pros and cons of everything .
Furthermore , the environment will suffer the terrible effects of our current lifestyle .
Consequently , protective clothes , which will be made with materials and NASA technology , will be worn by the future population .
In fact , the development of different vaccines will mean that it will be possible to get over a great number of diseases .
It started when I was 12 or 13 years old , his music meant everything to me .
I really hope in this " hiatus " , this is what they called their break , they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends , managers or the media around them .
Famous people live in a completely different way than ordinary people .
It is believed they are extraordinary , perfectly beautiful and incredibly happy like we see in their photos in magazines and on TV .
Unfortunately , in reality it is n't so amazing as it seems to be .
There are a lot of disadvantages to being a star , which normal people do n't realise . For example , not having a private life .
There are a lot of different viewpoints and I would like to consider them .
Almost their every secret comes out and they are still judged , criticised or mocked .
Journalists and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance the the value of them .
Being all the time at the centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming .
That is why a lot of big names suffer from depression or even try to take their life .
On the other hand , this is the price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this .
People can not have everything and live as they want .
They ought to appreciate what they have and stop complaining about their life , because there are plenty of people , who dream of being them .
They have not got expensive cars , detached houses , they ca n't afford to travel and their only entertainment is watching TV .
However , nobody has everything they dreamed of ; it is normal that always in our lives something will annoy us .
Famous people have to notice how much they have , appreciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life , because it is not such a disaster as they often think .
Day by day , the power of consumption increases more and more and one of the areas you can see this is in the traffic .
People who have the resources to buy or hire something and are looking for convenience have a great desire to buy a car .
The poor quality of public transportation and the lack of options like underground and train , helps people choose to use a car .
These things make us think about whether public transport has a future . After all , to do all the things you need in your routine , like to go to work , to go shopping or just to go out with the family , it is more convenient by car than by bus .
Cars nowadays have technology that allows both drivers and passengers to have a better journey while listening to music or using the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey .
The government needs to invest in better conditions on public transport , with more options for the transportation of citizens , in order to make it easier to go from one place to another , and harder to choose between a car or a bus .
Everything has two sides and the choice of transportation is not an exception .
Firstly , travelling by train , metro or bus can lead to the reduction of gasoline consumption .
As a result , they offer low fares and play an important role in environmental protection .
It was reported that for one hundred kilometers , each car consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline , and released a certain proportion of air pollution .
Meanwhile , with the same amount of fuel , a bus carries fifty people , and even up to as high as hundreds of people with mass transportation .
Secondly , it can not be denied that travelling by car is convenient , but people who agree with the idea point out that high - quality and modern public transport such as the Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable .
can also satisfy passengers who can not travel by plane and need to take long - distance journeys .
There are some places in developing countries , for example , in remote or highland areas , where people have not seen a car for many years . They have no choice apart from old buses to travel .
In conclusion , public transportation will still be the first choice of people in the future .
There are some similarities . However , differences in the educational system cause differences in the attitudes to education .
University education is valuable in Australia , just like in Russia .
In general , most employers prefer applicants who have achieved an academic degree .
The most important argument was that travelling by car is much more convenient .
The fact that you can travel anywhere at any time is undeniable .
If you want to buy some vegetables for your dinner , you will have to wait until the next train arrives at your station .
He started his career when he was sixteen years old through kart competitions .
After only three years , he joined the Benetton formula one team and two years later he won his first driver championship .
In 2000 , he won his third driver championship with Ferrari and also won it consecutively for three years .
Then Ferrari and Michael decided on a new collaboration , so the greatest became a test driver and tried to improve the car outside of the races .
Like every German , since he was a young driver , he had dreamed of being a championship driver with the national car .
To summarize , he arranged a meeting with the head of Ferrari and the press because he would like to announce his definitive
retirement .
This , unfortunately , was only an excuse . He was only pretending to retire as he had already signed a contract to drive Mercedes .
At the end of the meeting , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
These people usually give arguments such as that the public transport is never on time , or that it is difficult to get to your destination using it and without having to take 3 different routes , or even that public transport is not as suitable for a made - up short - notice trip as a private car can be .
In my opinion , these arguments depend on how efficiently designed the public transport system is , taking into account number of routes , timetables , cost of the tickets and facilities for users who use it frequently .
The benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community are quite well known : a significant reduction in pollutant gases , a high decrease in noise pollution , as well as , as a consequence of having fewer cars circulating on our streets , an increase in pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking , running or cycling .
All these benefits will surely contribute to a better future for all the habitants , so let 's give public transport a chance .
The city only began to take care of the environment in the last ten years when the studies created technologies aimed at not causing pollution .
On the roofs of the supermarkets there are solar panels and they exploit the sun to produce energy .
And if we consider the speech where the woman said that , at present , this phenomenon is a problem , because this bamboo is the main source of food for the Giant Panda that still lives in the jungle .
The Giant Panda is an endangered species . The pandas have to survive the hunters and the destruction of their habitat by humans .
Therefore , the risks of the extinction of the Giant Panda are real .
I am on the point of finishing my Engineering degree in Mining Engineering , specializing in energy , at Vigo University .
I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing for the First Certificate Exam , planned for July and June , respectively .
I would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level , and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these goals .
Thus , the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of getting an internship at your company .
In this programme , the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor .
The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence costs , so the company is not required to pay him a salary .
Furthermore , as the programme is endorsed by the European Union , the trainee has accident and liability insurance .
As for the duration , the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months , 3 months being the period covered by the subsistence grant .
I will be completely available to do the internship from next September onwards .
I hope you will consider my application and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
These days Italy has quite a big problem with unemployment . It 's very difficult to find a job and most people find jobs in supermarkets .
I live in Valpolicella , a famous region for wine , and I have already worked in a four - star hotel for high school .
It was a good experience . The hotel had every comfort you can imagine : a restaurant , a spa , a gym , indoor and outdoor swimming pools , a beauty center and a church .
The personnel were n't so helpful , but luckily someone gave me some advice , especially the porter , Artan .
Valpolicella has many sights that are worth seeing : first of all is Lake Garda , a lake with a famous phallic shape which divides three different regions ( Veneto , Trentino and Lombardy ) .
Orlando Duque , the Colombian diver , who is the high - jump champion of the FINA World Cup 2014 , stated that since 2007 he has been thinking about retirement even though he feels the strength and desire to go to the World Cup in 2017 in Guadalajara , México .
" I have been thinking about retirement since 2007 . I have been lucky because I was injured and I got better " , said Duque during the press conference of the World Series that , this year , will end up in Mexico on 17th and 18th October , after the competition in Bilbao ( Spain ) .
" I turned 40 three weeks ago . I feel motivated to train , and while I have the motivation I can continue ; now I do n't have an exact date ( … ) I just have set 2017 in Guadalajara " , said Duque , who was the first sportsman who won a world championship in falls from height .
" Jumps have been my life , I have spent all my life on jumps and it motivates me to do it , I want to continue " , explained Duque when he pointed out that he still has several screws in his right ankle and he is still lacking completely recovery .
The Natural Well Ik Kil , which is located three kilometers away from the archeological zone of Chichén Itza , will be the final one of the Jumps season , 2014 , and in that season Duque and the Mexican Jonathan Paredes will face each other in order to be among the top five spots of the season .
" The plan is to win this competition because I always compete to win .
In the men 's test , the high - jumpers are thrown into the water from a height of 27 meters , whereas in the women 's competition the launch pad is placed at 20 meters .
You may ask why , of all the possible activities , this one was chosen .
This is my favorite sport because it improves my health in many ways and boosts the immune system and quality of life .
The first times may be hard , in that they require training a sedentary person does not have .
After the first trials , however , improvements are soon noticed and the results come quickly : better breathing , uninterrupted and quiet sleep , and an unmistakable sense of well - being .
Despite being a common and easy to do activity , running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well .
Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce discomfort and keep one 's feet at a nice temperature .
Notwithstanding , a formidable pair of running shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period .
This way , there will be less trouble when doing the exercise .
Anybody can do it , it is practical and simple , and goals can be set in accordance with the person 's needs and limitations .
I always considered football as art .
Players must be considered as a painter working on a piece of art .
Only the results will be recognized at the end .
Their expectations will be considered useless .
Everything after a successful result will be a plus .
So , if someone is ever wondering to whether start playing this sport , they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win .
I would recommend them to always remember that , so if things do n't turn out as they expected , they wo n't feel disappointed .
We are people and all of us must have a private life , including celebrities .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazzi who are trying to find out more about their private life .
I agree that film stars and famous politicians must have their free time because they are working for people everyday .
It is quite hard to have a rest when journalists are trying to find out some exciting things about your private life .
On the other hand , famous politicians and film stars have chosen such a life .
It is a part of their everyday life , they are used to being in public and they are used to saying something about themselves on camera , so everyone will know about their life .
There are some moments when celebrities need some time to be with their families and friends and journalists must not disturb such moments .
In the modern world , a company which has excellent staff is more competitive , and these employees are usually motivated .
It is clear that staff would spend more time on their tasks if they were motivated by their boss , while unmotivated employees are more likely to put less effort into their jobs .
Generally speaking , there are two basic employee motivation methods : rewards involving money and non - financial rewards .
Many leaders believe that money is the best . However , from my own perspective , the non - financial rewards are the best approach to motivating employees and I will prove my opinion in this essay .
I had never been very frightened until one day when something strange happened .
My sister claimed that on her trip , she had seen completely astounding buildings , but while she was talking , we heard a very loud scream .
Outside , it was getting very cold and the sky was dark , so we could n't see anything but , nevertheless , we continued walking through the trees , when suddenly we saw a very big shadow in front of us .
Ana and I decided to go outside to look for Michael . When we went out , he was in front of the house , making strange sounds . When he saw us , he smiled at us in a malevolent way , then made us go back inside .
My favorite sport is basketball .
One reason why I love this particular sport is because it 's based on cooperation .
For example , if you play basketball and the ball is passed regularly , then your team is more likely to win because passes cause confusion and exhaustion for the opposing team .
On the other hand , if he chooses to play professionally , then he must try hard .
Regular exercise is potentionall so that he / she can build up strength and endurance .
One of my favourite restaurants is one located in a delightful town called Ubeda .
The restaurant has a very characterful decoration indeed , because you seem to be inside a train .
However , the most impressive thing is the range of flavours that explode inside your mouth .
The connection between quality and price is plenty balanced .
I know from personal experience that it is worth tasting the gourmet sampling menu .
I really think it is suitable for the class , because each one of us could know in advance how much we would pay to eat there and , besides , we could taste the main courses of this restaurant .
Without a shadow of a doubt , I am absolutely sure this would be the best option for our class .
I 'm not a great fan of films based on fictional , unrealistic facts and events .
And that 's obvious because it 's the first serious production by this young , promising director , whose ' Flushed " became a worldwide hit .
An enormous number of additional attractions for viewers provided me with unforgettable feelings .
Everything came us a surprise and you did n't expect that this or that action would take place .
The movie requires us to be highly concentrated on what is going on and I find that to be one of the most conceiving factors for those who still have some objections .
The director gives a chance to broaden our minds and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe an imaginable ending to the gripping story .
RECOMMENDATONS
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no circumstances should we miss it !
The profile of millions of recent graduates and professional people in Spain is one of a young person , well prepared and without work who is thinking of going abroad as a good chance to get a job .
Working abroad can offer you a good opportunity . Maybe it would never happen in your own country instead .
Furthermore , as is well known , salaries are higher in other European countries than in Spain , so your living standard may improve the same as your career path .
On the other hand , going abroad without your family might be a really bad experience , because you may really miss them , maybe because you are not able to visit them as much as you can due to living far away from home .
The weather may be a disadvantage , as well .
For example , if you go to work in England , you can say goodbye to the bright and sunny Spanish days and say a big welcome to the frightful English weather and depression .
To sum up , the disadvantages of going abroad are greater than the advantages , but every cloud has a silver lining .
Maybe , many people who have studied did it to get a job opportunity in their own country , but that 's life .
I have got one sister . She is 15 years old and her name is Tina . She also goes to Fribergaskolan .
called " Djursholms ridskola " and on Sundays I often go
When we were in Thailand , we saw many different animals ; everything from big leguans to rainbow fishes and deadly sea - snakes .
Every year at the sport - vaccination me , my mom and my sister go to Switzerland to go skiing in the Alps . It 's wonderful and really fun .
Three words that describe me best are , perhaps , animal lover , happy and a perfectionist .
I like food , especially Italian food . It is my favorite food to eat .
My favorite restaurant is " La Piazza " in Djurholm and it is , of course , Italian . I have actually been to Italy twice , to Rome and Florence and to a small town named Lucignano in the countryside .
When we were there last summer , I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called a Hoopoe .
Some of the books I like are " Only Way is Up " and " Steal the Show " and were written by Emmy Abrahamson . I think she is a very good author . Another author I like is John Boyne who wrote " The Terrible Thing that Happened to Barnaby Brocket " .
I love to design presentations and edit things on the computer , but also in real life , like my room , clip - art and more .
Parkour is a discipline in which the main purpose is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and fastest way , without causing any harm to your body .
One of the foundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method , created by Georges Hébert .
Basically , the method is based on developing the main foundations of movement of the human body . These are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped movement , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
He had a great background in gymnastics and , from a teenager , he used to do a lot of exercises .
The roots of Parkour were developed by him and he taught some Parkour techniques to the firemen who he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the foundations of Parkour too .
David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment , and then the current Parkour was born .
Some people say that David created Parkour but , in fact , his father developed all the ideas of the discipline .
David adapted it to the urban environment and created new moves .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosophical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a phrase from the Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that , in a dangerous situation , you will be able to save yourself and other people , and so on .
There are fewer people who use public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than on public transport .
For a lot of people , travelling in your own car is more comfortable than travelling by public transport like buses or the metro , because you do not depend on a schedule , which is very common when you take public transport .
In addition , when you travel in your own car , you save a lot of time during the journey .
However , public transport also has advantages .
On the other hand , travelling by metro or bus pollutes less than going by car .
The reason is that when you use a car , you normally go on your own and when you travel by metro or bus , a lot of people travel at the same time as you .
The consequence of this is that , in the near future , public transport will disappear .
The company ensures the quality of water from production to distribution .
The product will be registered with the Ministry of Health and Sri Lanka Standards Association and adhere to their rules and regulations for production , storage and distribution .
We will not compromise the quality of the production process or the product in any way .
The company will ensure low negative environmental impact due to the production process .
The direct supplies to offices , households and hotels will also be given a good price for the delivery service .
We will rent water dispensers with a maintenance service to required customers in future to attract more customers .
During the last century , our way of life has changed completely , even in villages .
To resolve this problem , my village has created a plan to teach its population how important it is to take care of the environment and how to do it .
For this reason , we have new containers to separate all rubbish : we have to throw away bottles , cans and cartons into the yellow bin ; paper and cardboard go in the blue bin and there is another one for glass .
At school , children are learning how to use less water or electricity at home .
I hope these simple actions can be used by other people because the environment needs us to work together for a better world .
How interesting !
Anyway , he built a skyscraper , which is called 21 .
But that 's not the most interesting thing !
It 's an unforgettable experience .
It may not be your cup of tea , but I think it 's the most interesting and beautiful place in our town . I 'm looking forward to seeing you !
When visiting Copenhagen during summer time , there is a huge variety of shops and restaurants that will give you a sense of the Copenhagen lifestyle .
Afterwards , take the bridge over the lakes and enjoy a full day of shopping .
When you are tired of shopping , take the bus to the West Side of Copenhagen where there is a vast choice of restaurants ; everything from Italian to Chinese to Danish cuisine .
If you like an evening stroll or a night out , walk through Istedgade for a glimpse of the old Copenhagen and the nightlife it offers .
In the following paragraphs I 'll tell you what they told me .
The first question we discussed was : ' Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufacturers ? '
An argument some used was : ' In case we removed this whole industry , then there would be a humongous group of people unemployed , and that would be a problem . '
Next we talked about the following question : ' Does it have too much effect on models ? ' They did n't have to think about their opinion . They all directly said ' Yes ' .
In their opinion , young people , including themselves , are very busy with fashion and clothes .
Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kind of clothing , just because they thought they would have more friends then .
The next question was : ' Does it make society materialistic and competitive ? '
I asked them the question : ' If you liked a piece of clothing but your friends did n't , would you then buy it ? '
I totally do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transportation because of the existence of cars .
The general public are using public transportation more than before .
Students who are not allowed to drive are still using public transportation and they always will do .
Moreover , the traffic in areas such as downtown forces people to use public transportation like trains , since the trains are faster .
Insurance is so expensive in North America , most householders do not use a car because of insurance , and also because of added costs like fixing the cars , changing car oil etc .
Furthermore , the government are enhancing public transportation services . They are providing them at a lower cost . The fairs for rides on public transportation are less than the cost of driving a car the same distance .
Finally , none will argue about the benefit of using cars over public transportation , but that does not exclude public transportation .
how are you ? I hope that everything is all right .
Although I was watching it from backstage , the atmosphere was the same as if I 'd been watching it in front of the stage together with other fans .
There was a lot of work during the concert preparation .
We had to check if everything was correct : sound , light , special effects .
Besides , we had to see if the band had everything that they needed : something to eat and to drink . I was responsible for that .
It was an unforgettable experience . I will never forget it .
The opportunity to meet my idols in real life was the most exciting .
I will tell you everything when we meet !
Attached we return to you text of the doctoral thesis of , directed by Dr. , requesting you to fill out the detailed report of evaluation , also enclosed .
We explicitly point out that this report is compulsory to proceed with the necessary arrangements for the deposit of the thesis .
I did not do everything I wanted because I was forced by my parents to go to Boquete .
But once , one of her friends told me that before the kiss , everything was going to be OK .
Belarus is not a popular tourist destination nowadays , but a lot of people would be surprised to find the real medieval atmosphere in Grodno , a western city of the country .
Two ancient castles remind us of the times of kings and nobility , quiet pedestrian streets show us life as if it could be the 1800s .
Grodno is situated at the crossroads of great trading routes , that 's why one can hear Polish , Jewish , German , and Lithuanian there .
Its multi - ethnic population was the reason for organising and holding the Festival of National Cultures every two years .
It 's worth visiting because the traditions of the ancient Belarusian , Tatar , Russian , Jewish being shown make us feel history itself .
A city of different religions , different nationalities and " talking stones " is waiting for you .
REPORT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY TOWN
The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve , or zoo , make it very attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourist destination is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities .
ATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES
There are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics .
These include facilities like ample parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge , elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls if you are carrying very heavy loads of purchases , and relaxation spots like cinemas and gaming centers for kids .
In addition , most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people , as this is a statutory requirement when building a shopping mall .
SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS
Its products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors .
Another shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market .
This is where you will find several shops that sell most African traditional artifacts .
CONCLUSION
I hope from the explanations , I have been able to convince you of my opinion of the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities , which abound as you take your time in considering visiting them .
In developed countries , four wheels have gained a lot of appreciation in everyday transportation .
In the capital cities of Europe one can easily notice how many people prefer their own means instead of the pushing crowd on public transportation .
It is , however , well known after a plethora of scientific publications that cars harm the environment dramatically .
On the other hand , modern citizens like to be part of the green revolution and our carbon footprint has an effect on everyday decision making .
Many organizations and public authorities encourage workers to use public means of transport to and from the workplace in order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and save natural resources .
As a result , before private transportation reaches its peak for the 21st century , it is most probable that green mobility will overtake it and dominate in people 's choices .
There is a great future for public transport , the same as for cycling and travelling on foot , instead of cars and other polluting machines .
Do n't worry about not recognising me because I haven't changed a lot in two years , but , to reassure you , I will be carrying a bright orange suitcase .
I would like to visit Big Ben and many other places that you suggest , but I do n't really want to see ordinary tourist sights , so if you could show me something that not everyone can find , I would appreciate that .
I am sure it is an easy task : here you can visit many entertaining facilities where you can find technology or culture , for example , and there are also many places to eat , dance , etc .
The great view it provides is incredible .
Times Square is a good site for shopping too , although the excessive amount of advertising is a little bit annoying .
Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , anthropology and seeing a lot of types of art .
Remarkably , teenagers like eating these and this is where you can find some of the best .
If you need more information , please tell me .
I entirely agree with the statement : travelling by car is much more convenient , because you can go wherever you want without waiting for a bus or train at a bus stop or station .
I think that travelling by car is also more inner and comfortable because you only travel with people you know .
Talking about money , the car is probably more convenient , even if you have to pay for fuel , highway and everything that is necessary for the maintenance of the car .
In contrast , if you use public transport , you have to pay expensive fares and buy different tickets .
So , people prefer travelling by their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way .
Finally , we should use public transport to reduce pollution , but it should be better supervised and maintained .
I agree with the statement , that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Usually , journalists also follow them all the time .
Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gossip about famous people which is not true .
It may be a danger for the family of a celebrity , politician , famous person , and because of it some could break up .
They want to be rich and famous and they know that journalist will follow them .
In my opinion , the television has an important role in society because it can influence people 's lives .
I mean some people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language through the different programs that television offers or just use subtitles to make it simple .
It 's important to know what is happening in the world , because it can enrich your knowledge culturally , politically , etc .
Besides , you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if a lot of serious situations are occurring in your country .
Children learn a lot of things through cartoons , it can help them to improve their speaking and to learn new vocabulary .
The television is one of the most important media .
So , for that reason , I think television can entertain and also educate .
I 'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if they 're sad or a break for someone 's in their free time .
I have always believed I can become an engineer and computer technician to invent more things since I was small .
After I received more and more information about some successful engineers and inventors such as Steve Jobs , I realizes that , no matter who you are and how smart you are , you can not live without a healthy body .
Consequently , I believe physical development is a necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful to for providing me with opportunities to do extra - curricular activities .
Therefore , to keep my body healthy and my interest , I have kept taking part in the School Aquathon since I was in the second one . I participate in the same events each year .
Besides , it gives me a motivation to train harder and never think of giving up , and that I need to keep up my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body .
I learnt how to set a proper goal as it is a significant factor in success .
I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after taking part in the School Aquathon and saw others improve and not just me .
School work and examinations give me huge pressure , so I found a way to strike a balance when I learnt to do windsurfing .
In my opinion , windsurfing is special and indispensable to me .
On the recommendation of my instructor , I participated in the joint school windsurfing competition .
On that day , I found something wrong with my position on the results board . I was shocked and decided to protest about the wrongdoings of the race committee .
To find out more information about having a green lifestyle , I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013 .
Also , I learnt communication skills with friends .
One of the purposes of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle , so I got a better physical development .
To have more different experiences , I have joined the " Dialogue in the dark " experiential exhibition .
In the totally dark environment , I experience the feelings of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their lives .
After undergoing this experience , I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future .
I have got a greater passion for engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life .
Also , I have learnt communication skills through others and am considerate .
Through this colorful school life , I have had different types of experience and I have finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician .
I think it is not a good engineer who only has skills in engineering .
Therefore , I think my experience can train me to be admitted as a suitable candidate in engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal .
People differ from each other and everyone has different professions .
Being a politician or a film star have something in common : those people are famous .
And , as a drawback of being a celebrity , they are followed by paparazzi almost everywhere .
I think that journalists should remember about the private life of famous people , which should remain a secret for other people .
There are a lot of cases where journalists make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists .
Besides , being followed by unknown people must be quite a scary experience .
Some people would say that it 's necessary for ordinary people to know how a politician lives so they can know if he should be trusted .
My listening is good and I can understand .
I make lots of grammatical mistakes when I am speaking and writing .
I like reading books and travelling to different countries and getting to know there culture .
I have two children . They go to school . I would like to join an English course in the morning from 10 am to 2 pm on any weekdays . I want to start the course as soon as possible .
After some time , the bus stopped for 5 minutes and Michael bought two chocolates , chips and a soft drink and offered her a chocolate .
This is how they started their conversation and , while exchanging conversation , they felt as if they had known each other for a long time ... they became attracted to each other and in the midst of that they kissed each other and even exchanged phone numbers .
Their bus was about to reach their destination next morning , so Michael offered to drop her at home and the girl accepted with a smile .
I am writing with regard to an advertisement that appeared in the local newspaper recently .
This advertisement sought a group of young people to work in summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , my name is Lorena and I am twenty - three years old and I am from Spain and I would like to job in your summer camp because I could improve my English and earn money ; my English is good because all this year I have been at an English academy to learn the language and now I am going to take another certificate . And as a result I will be able to communicate with children .
Secondly , last year I stayed in a beach summer camp and there were children aged 6 - 13 . My partner and I organised water activities when the weather was good , . On the other hand , when the weather was bad we organised puzzle games , adventure games , etc .
The advertisement mentions work in the kitchens . Our summer camp was small because it was in a small town , so we had to cook children food and I was able to do it without problems .
Yours faithfully ,
Honestly , as an eight - year - old boy who knew close to nothing about Christianity , his knowledge of Christianity was lower than that of a three - year - old child .
Anxiousness got the better of him as he prepared himself to enter the sanctuary .
WHATTTT I MISSPELLED MICHAEL ! ! Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transport means travelling around the world and cities using trains , buses , taxis , airplanes etc .
First of all , travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars have to pay for gas , insurance , repairs , environment fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .
In conclusion , public transport will not be affected by using private cars .
Suddenly two people dressed as astronauts were leaving the park and warned the young boys to go to their house and wait until this unfortunate event was over .
While they were walking back home , they heard a journalist commenting on what incident had happened in the park .
The only thing they could clearly hear was : - But this can only be caused by contamination , although this windy day hasn't helped .
Jackson stopped walking and was distracted by a beautiful dog Michael continued on his way , unaware that Jackson was n't following him .
Almost arriving at home and mulling over the thoughts , he drew his own conclusions as to what might have happened .
What I think is stupid is that most people usually hide their faces behind the screen and no one wants to appreciate a sunny day anymore !
What I disagree with in this video is that he generalizes too much .
I think it is cool to have a social network , and there is nothing wrong with letting kids enjoy the technology that has become part of our generation .
However , they must be supervised , especially by their parents .
The thing nowadays is , if you disconnect from all of the things we have , people make fun of you and say that you are old or just do n't know how to deal with the modern world .
I 've experienced this , so that 's why I am saying it .
The internet has caused me depression once . I felt really alone and I used to be someone who I was n't in real life , but I learned how to deal with it .
Sportswear , elegant clothes and , of course , accessories .
In the summer time , Milan offers a variety of facilities and services , especially for young people .
Visiting the centre of the city is really fascinating : Piazza del Duomo is one of the most evocative squares in Italy with the particularity of the white marble facade of the Dome and its multitude of spires .
The surroundings are dedicated to fashion : you can find the most important shops for which Milan is known throughout the world .
The Sforzesco Castle is another suggestive historic monument and the green Sempione park is one of the best places where people can do sports or can attend a yoga class in the open air .
Finally , people can experience the Milanese nightlife in the area of the Navigli , which is really crowded from 19:00 till late .
Here you can experience the typical Milanese aperitif , during which you can have a cocktail while eating whatever you want and you can get to know a lot of young people .
The police announced checkout is the murder motivation .
Suddenly , he hears a weak voice whispering ; do not try to stop the shadow , let it kill the criminals or you 'll die .
He checks everywhere but ca n't find anyone .
He goes inside it and discovers a half - decayed body that fits Mendez 's description .
He understands that the shadow was the ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez 's murderer .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in Pamplona , and to outline some recommended shops that might appeal to tourists with different interests .
Shopping Facilities
In addition , several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located in the centre with easy access and cheap rates .
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionate about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " are dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
Recommendations for tourists
I would strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter their interests , should visit the aforementioned special shops .
In my opinion , celebrities should remember that if they want to be famous they , probably , will be chased by paparazzi .
On the other hand , they are still normal people , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
Probably , they want to go on holidays without being recognised by other people , without giving autographs and having their photo taken .
And celebrities know well that they have to be controversial , because that is the best way to achieve their lovely fame .
So , big names try to go somewhere without guards , without make - up to show themselves , to cause some juicy gossip about them , to gain fame in the easiest way .
To sum up , fame is ambivalent and people who want to be famous should realize it before becoming a star .
I found the advertisement on your website and I 'm sure that I 'm the person you are looking for .
Although I 'm an Italian native speaker , I 've been studying English for seven years ; furthermore , last summer I spent two months in Philadelphia , so I can communicate quite well in your language .
I 'm really cheerful and hardworking , and I have good marks for sport .
Thank you for considering my application .
Yours faithfully ,
I absolutely agree with the statement .
I understand , they are rich , their lives might seem interesting , even more interesting than ours , but they are not so different , they are not better than us , ordinary people .
Many journalists or photographers think when they write some gossip about politicians or when they take some " curious " photos , it 's OK .
It must be really stressful when you ca n't go anywhere without journalists following you .
And also , it must be really uncomfortable for friends or family who go with you .
Of course , some famous people might like this feeling that they are so liked and favourite and those who do n't like it have the possibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalists following them do n't exist .
My town is a very good town for taking care of the environment .
Our town is full of green plants everywhere : in the school playground , between the roads and many other places .
Plastic substances should be reused .
People with dogs will be sentenced and will suffer heavy consequences .
City X helps reforestation in many countries and places such as Brazil , Java , Sumatra , Peru , Guyana , French Guyana , Surinam , Bolivia , Uruguay , Paraguay , Colombia , Venezuela , Equador , Chile , Indonesia , Bali , Malaysia , Singapore , India , and many more .
New technologies are changing the way of thinking about private cars in a new , much safer and more ecological way .
On the one hand , public transport is well known for its large number of benefits , like less pollution and more economical aspects .
Moreover , in large crowded cities , using the underground or buses is usually a good way to avoid traffic jams , saving time and stress for sad drivers during their commutes .
For that reason , encouraging the use of public transport has been the main concern of most modern governments .
On the other hand , huge technological improvements in car features like self - driving , electrical engines , solar power and others , have created a new way of conceiving the way we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving . This is a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time as we are driving .
However , that is really close to being changed by Google 's Self - Drive Car , which is a new technology able to drive a car to any destination without human intervention .
Furthermore , the car could be empty and go anywhere we command .
That exciting news opens up a new world of possibilities for the use of cars .
In addition , many other improvements like electric engines from Tesla are adding new benefits to this new concept of Intelligent - Cars .
To summarise , cars are going to be so independent , ecological , cheap and intelligent that we will never take public transport again .
I have a brother named Markus who wants to be a professional tennis player when he gets older . He is 17 years old .
Seems simple , but looks beautiful . Sometimes simplicity is the most perfect accessory .
Nowadays , people care more about themselves and doing good things is wrong for some of them !
I 'm sad when I see a nursing home but , you know , there , people will never say whether they do bad or good and , at the end of the day , they will not care only about themselves and their insecurity .
I am really happy you wrote to me for some advice and I am very honoured that you want to spend some time in my country .
It is very beautiful because it is structured like a mountain ( and so you can start from the top floor and then you go down , visiting other floors ) .
In that wonderful city , you must visit the statue of Jesus Christ called " il Cristo velato " made of marble , and then you must visit the centre of the city , full of fantastic features that make this city really special , like Spaccanapoli , Hidden Napoli , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio Church and so on .
I think you could work as an entertainer in some tourist villages around the country .
In that way , you could improve your way to make a relationship with people and it could also be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your ability , so I think that you could take some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .
Nowadays , people have different viewpoints about whether the principal concern when choosing an occupation is salary .
Personally , I disagree with the view that money is the most important consideration for choosing a job , because there are several equally important factors .
I believe that other considerations are as important as money .
Firstly , the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned .
Working in a company which is built on good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily bring fulfillment and sustain passion for your job for a long time .
We would believe that this work is worth contributing to for life .
Secondly , the co - worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job .
Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring workers a sense of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence the quality of work may increase greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessary for people 's daily lives , satisfying their basic needs .
For example , the cost of food , drinks and commodities needs the support of a steady income .
Furthermore , we may need much more money to do some activities , such as worldwide travel or camping for days .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , health - care will be increasingly important with people getting older . Hence having enough money as a stable income can not be disregarded .
In conclusion , while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people 's choice of profession , I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors .
There are various reasons why I am absolutely fascinated by this martial art .
Behind every single movement you will find gracefulness and power .
On entering a class , you are able to fully concentrate on the sport .
There are certain procedures at the beginning of a class which encourage you to empty your mind and be ready for class .
Especially in our hectic world , it is very important to find yourself and just listen to your body .
As a martial artist , you start to achieve great fitness and your balance will improve a lot , as well as your flexibility .
Many characteristics will increase immensely , such as confidence , self - defense or responsibility .
However , to see any improvements you should attend regularly and at least twice a week .
I 'm writing to reply to one of your advertisements published in the local newspaper last week .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the privilege of working as a teacher all my life , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care of children .
Due to my experience as a teacher , I am sure that I wo n't have any difficulty with organising sports and inventing a wide range of activities in order to entertain children .
As well as taking part in activities relating to cooking .
I would be grateful if you would send me more information about this job and you can get in touch with me on 671234567 .
Yours faithfully
Personally , I think the best month to come to Italy is April as the weather is temperate .
Thanks a lot for your invitation and if I was n't so busy , I would travel around with you .
I wish I could express my dissatisfaction with the facilities .
Also , the phone did not work properly , it was impossible to use it to call the receptionist .
There were six of us from a school , and we all agree the stay was unpleasant .
I regret to inform you that if you do not offer your apologies and compensation for all the disturbance caused to me , I will go to the authorities .
Yours faithfully ,
I go by cycle to " Fribergaskolan " every day , together with my friends Tekla , Julia and Bianca .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " . It 's an Asian buffet and they make the best food .
I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost every one of them in my old school ( called Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other big hobbies is photography .
They had to sew my finger , but in the end , everything went fine .
In Camden , every block has three or four containers to recycle paper , plastic , glass and old clothes .
The council collects , once a week , door to door , paper and organic waste .
What is more , people are encouraged to collect rain water to use for these activities .
Public transport has been made accessible by reducing the fares and making it free for students .
Nowadays there is a lot of information about health , having good eating habits , sleeping the number of hours recommended by specialist doctors , etc .
For these reasons , I consider that doing any sport that you like or you may be interested in could be a good option .
I think that , in particular , spinning is a hard sports activity because when you have spent approximately 1 hour on your bike you 'll probably feel tired .
If you want to lose weight , this type of sport is perfect because it belongs to the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food , whereas it is suitable for people that only do exercise for entertainment .
Furthermore , from the first time that I was in the gym , I have got to know nice and friendly sportsmen who try to give me advice not only on how to improve my techniques but on how to avoid injury too .
Although it is kind of hard for young people who have finished school finally , to understand that it 's definitely not finished yet , education does n't stop from then on and it is one of the most important things to continue going to school .
On the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't really have the opportunity to choose whether they want to go or not .
Trying to motivate people for education , studying and school is a very hard thing if they all know all those dreams are not going to happen anyway , whereas people in Switzerland have to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possibilities look like .
Therefore , education should be accessible for everyone , in my opinion , for as long as possible , but only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
Only if all of that is guaranteed will the motivation increase .
For most men , shopping is so boring and exhausting , but for women it can be the best way to make their mood better , because they are so happy when they buy lots of clothes in a sale , cheaper than at the regular price .
In the big shopping centres your purse can be stolen by pickpockets and you can lose a lot of money .
Personally , I really like shopping , because I am interested in fashion and I like looking good .
Nowadays , technology and society have changed in different ways and most people have more free time than before .
In contrast , technology has been becoming more useful and it could do work that we had to do some years ago and having more free time could be better for us .
I 've been searching for a lot of stuff we could visit once I get there , for example , Piccadilly Circus .
At a glance it seems very original and special , does n't it ?
I think it would be fascinating to go sightseeing around there and I could find some souvenirs for my family .
If you manage to organize it beforehand , I 'll have the time to prepare all the soccer stuff ( boots etc . ) .
I 'll give you some other information shortly .
My colleagues are brain - damaged .
But instead I am writing about stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .
Sometimes it 's hard to believe that everything will be OK .
Friendship is one of the most valuable sentiments for people , especially for people who in their school days .
When it comes to the best way for students to make friends , some argue that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable . However , from where I stand , joining a sports team is undoubtedly the best choice .
Training in the same sports team , the students can not only release the whole day 's pressure , but can also build up good relationships with others through communication and exercise .
For example , the champions of the Olympic Games , China 's famous synchronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia . The two girls enjoy a really good friendship .
Additionally , cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team .
Here , students learn how to work together , how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork , how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self , and even how to negotiate or discuss with others , as well as how to be patient and rational .
Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students , I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent .
However , if students participate in community activities , for example , doing volunteer job in the town 's library , they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is spent working .
Is everything OK with your family ?
She has a wonderful body , but in her face you can see perfection .
This year , my country 's media celebrated a doctor who works in Afghanistan .
He left his job in a safe and comfortable Italian hospital to move to a country that is living through a civil war .
We have so many interesting places to visit , but if I must limit myself to only one , I choose the centre of the city .
It is renovating , but you can see many beautiful buildings .
Besides brilliant actors , they have incredible decor and it 's perfectly situated as it is very near to the bus stop .
It is a really interesting place and I think you 'll appreciate this .
Yours sincerely ,
Some people go shopping to feel better in themselves .
I personally love to go shopping and spend my money on new clothes .
I heard about it in my English class at my university .
I am in the 5th semester of Industrial Design , and I have 500 points in my TOEFL .
Taking part in the camp was wonderful because I helped with planning the activities .
Finally , I am a master in the kitchen . I really enjoy making desserts and I was on a cooking course last summer . In fact , I have experience in the kitchen .
As I mentioned above I have experience in camps . I speak English , so I just want an opportunity to show you .
Please give me the opportunity to work with you .
If you would like to know more about me , please contact me at your earliest convenience .

I am writing this letter to apply for the post advertised in the Tuoitre newspaper of 13 March .
Since graduating from University of Education majoring in business English , I have been working for a food joint stock company on a contract basis .
I am particularly interested in dealing with various types of foods and meeting new people .
I would welcome the chance to work as a part of your cafe where I will make a small contribution while developing my English skills further .
Meeting new people and setting up new social relationships are also the tempting point attracting me .
In addition , your cafe is conveniently located near my home , which takes about 10 minutes to go to on foot and I have 2 days off a week . That gives me the opportunity to take on a new job .
Yours faithfully ,
Last week , my friends and I were selected from the class to go on a fascinating trip to a contemporary and magnificent museum .
At this mind - blowing place , we looked and gazed at the phenomenally awe - inspiring and unbelievable fossils of ancient dinosaur bones up to 100 meters high !
I luxuriate the making of the spellbinding models and the gift we got to pick in the dinosaur shop .
I enjoyed this unforgettable trip to the museum , and hope you can take time out to go one day !
My favorite thing to do is play sims 3 and sims 4 and listen to music . My favorite music type is rock and , of course , my favorite band is Green Day and , of course , then my favorite song is Stray Hearts ( Green Day ) .
Inside the " Monumento a La Bandera " you can see historical objects about the history of Argentina , and in the underground there is the hall of honor of American Flags .
If you want to enter the hall of honor or enter the monument , it 's free , but if you want to go up to the viewpoint , unless you are younger than 5 , you must pay an entrance fee of 10 $ .
Since I was a child , my favourite characters have always been the cruellest ones .
Obviously , because in every story , book or movie , although heroes are weaker than bad characters , they always win !
For example , in Terminator 's movies , the villain was always stronger and more equipped than the hero , but at the end of the movie , the righteous one wins the battle .
In recent years , social media sites have developed and penetrated our society as the essentials rapidly .
There are enormous numbers of users all over the world , and social media sites such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are utilized for acquiring information , contributing ideas , sharing photographs and communicating between individuals , between individuals and organizations or between organizations .
While social media sites make our society more convenient and more comfortable compared with the past , they simultaneously bring with them some issues .
There are two advantages and one disadvantage of the current consequences , and I mention conceivable effects of social media sites in the future .
Usually children go to kindergarten up to 5 years old , and after that , they start preschool .
However , the Bulgarian government was thinking about changing the law so all children have to start at 6 years old .
I think I ca n't compare the education of children in school or tertiary education between Bulgarian and Australia , because I still do n't have children and I am not studying at university in Australia .
The town has 100,000 inhabitants .
After a day of shopping , you can go to one of the many restaurants Kortrijk has .
Many green zones have been created .
Unfortunately , our holiday did not live up to the claims made by you .
We had a number of problems . The first one concerns the number of beds . You offered space to sleep for six people , so we expected six beds , but we only had five .
So , two of us had to share a bed , which is hardly acceptable .
The other problem related to the offered excursions . You promised a number of attractions , but two ( the walk up to the mountain , as well as the visit to a historic castle ) were not available .
Unfortunately , we also had problems with food . In your brochure it said that we would have a number of restaurants around , but in fact there was only one , which was , in addition to that , really expensive .
In our honest opinion , this is not acceptable , because in the brochure you talked about more than one restaurant .
It requires a vivid imagination to try to put a view of the future . First of all , the means of transport will change . Vehicles will depend mainly on solar energy or nuclear energy . A flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work . You will need to supply your car with spinach after they invent a spinach - fuelled car .
Also , food will change in the future . Capsules of your favourite foods will be available in the future in mobile supermarkets . These capsules will turn into your lunch as soon as you put a small amount of water on them .
I think today 's television is still good value , because there is more choice than ever before .
You can watch whatever you want , whenever you want ! There 's always something to watch for everybody .
Of course , I think that we should n't watch too much television .
I think that 's the only negative point about today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
They just ca n't stop watching television , because there 's just so much that they like to watch .
In that way , we can enjoy all the new technology of today , and all the enjoyable TV programmes !
It was taken on the embankment of Khabarovsk .
In the background , you can see the River Amur .
On the left , you can see people on an observation area .
I was very excited because it was my first visit to Khabarovsk in the summer .
By the way , on that day everybody was celebrating the Day of the City .
Afterwards , we went for a walk .
When we were schoolgirls , we used to spend all our free time together .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for SUMMER CAMPS USA to work in different positions .
I have qualifications in teaching children . I am a graduate teacher from University Carlos III of Madrid . I have experience of adventure sports . I like the country and mountains .
I also have a lifeguard certificate .
I have experience with children aged between 10 and 12 . I have worked in the South School Centre for two years .
I do not have experience of working in kitchens , but I like cooking . I live alone and I do the housework myself and the meals .
Yours faithfully .
This year is the last one before going to university .
On one hand , it is true that leaving school means passing from the basis to your future profession .
After sixteen years of continuous work , it is the perfect moment to take a rest and enjoy your life by travelling .
However , it could be a great time to work and earn some money to pay for university or simply for saving it .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break before university , the routine of working and studying every day could break .
So when university starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and , as a consequence , the marks will be lower .
To conclude , I think after school we need to apply for university in order to continue working on what we like .
The year off should be taken after university studies .
As the number of traffic accidents has increased dramatically over the years , finding the best solutions has put the government under pressure as to whether to implement stricter penalties or use alternative regulations .
Personally , road safety can not be ensured by either the former or the latter methods .
Instead , it should be a combination of various actions .
As a matter of fact , severe punishments can partly decrease the rate of offences .
Nobody wants to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison , so fear of punishment might be effective and prevent people committing the offence a second time .
Moreover , one 's penalty also can be considered as a mirror that people can look at and avoid doing the same things .
Its penalties , depending on the severity , could include fines , licence suspension , community service or imprisonment .
Consequently , those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only , and therefore , minimize the number of accidents .
Authorities should enact more safety policies on roads and ensure by improving the quality of traffic facilities .
In many developing countries , the government rarely attach special importance to both the quality and quantity of the traffic system , especially in rural areas .
Furthermore , vehicle collisions are rising greatly due to the number of unclear road signs .
Traffic education is also a compulsory measure , especially for younger generations as they commit the majority of offences .
People should be educated carefully about all the safety regulations and laws when they get their driving licence . The more they know the rules , the less risks are taken on the road .
In general , reducing traffic accidents is important .
Therefore , it should be considered carefully how to combine both severe penalties and many other regulations .
Public transportation once used to be a convenient and inexpensive way to transport oneself in the city .
However , the increasing rate of car ownership has been taking the place of public transportation , providing more convenience for getting around places and to places .
Travelling by car gives flexibility in our schedule .
This convenience of cars enables us to use our time efficiently .
However , cars can not take the place of public transportation just because of that convenience .
Maintaining cars has associated costs .
In addition , cars require regular maintenance , such as oil change and checking tire pressures .
Mechanical problems can often be costly problems .
Unlike public transportation , one has to be responsible for his or her mode of transportation , and it could be expensive sometimes .
On the other hand , public transportation is inexpensive .
In other perspective , cars require driving .
For example , people who have disabilities and certain diseases are not able to drive .
For those people , public transportation can be the optimal choice of transportation .
In conclusion , cars are convenient . However , they are not for everyone .
Therefore , public transportation has its own reasons for existence , and there is a future for public transportation .
Our congregation has run educational family camps with the support of NNNs Integration programme for 8 years .
We have huge experience of organising seminars and camps for families with disabled children .
For many children , participating in this camp is the only opportunity to spend time with children their own age and to feel like fully - fledged members of society .
Words fail to express the emotions that all participants experience .
The health improvements of some children could be considered a miracle .
A reduction in financial support from foreign charity foundations has led to our camp not being possible this year .
Our budget is fixed for only 75 people , which is almost twice the number of participants last year .
We do n't know and we do n't want to know how to refuse children participation in the camp in this situation !
The greater amount of money has already been collected thanks to the trustee board of " NNN " community , but we still need an additional $ 13000 .
We are asking you not to be indifferent to disabled children and to provide feasible help .
The idea that newspapers will disappear with time due to people 's attitude towards surfing the internet for the worldwide news does not necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted .
One of the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of society deals with newspapers as a daily routine .
To the best of my knowledge , it is a way of behaving more than a way of coping with the latest technologies .
To begin , the reason for the decreasing popularity of newspapers is that most people , these days , rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world .
On the other hand , newspapers are presented in a definite place , with limited time , and in addition , they are a daily expense .
While some may claim that credibility is the main reliable aspect of publishing .
It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectable reputation are the ones which will be accepted by thousands of people .
In this respect , newspapers seem to be more credible than numerous websites that make up fake stories much more than publishing real news .
Furthermore , reading habits have their own taste , specifically for elderly people .
They enjoy turning the pages and reading the headlines using their eyeglasses .
This marvelous , tasteful generation ca n't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences on modern society .
In light of the foregoing discussion , it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect towards globalisation even in daily news worldwide .
However , the newspapers still have their lead in that respect .
It can be suggested that a combination of both media will positively influence the ways of delivering news .
However , I accepted her plan and I met her at " Wonderland Café " .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe : comfortable chairs and sofas , beautiful features and really good - tasting coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think of .
Although the most important thing is that there were not only friendly staff but they looked like they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
I strongly recommend this café if you want to enjoy an excellent coffee with a careful decor and brilliant performances in which you can participate while having a drink .
This sport is not so hard , and it gives me the opportunity to do an activity that is not too expensive and can be done outdoors and not in a closed sports hall .
When I come back from my job in the afternoon , I put on something comfortable , take my bike and go away along the streets alone with my thoughts and no one can disturb me .
The Visit is a movie in which two grandparents get to know their grandchildren for the first time .
They have never met their grandparents because their mom had a fight a long time ago with them , even before they both where born , that caused them not to know any more about each other .
The girl is making a film for a school project about the journey and about getting to know her grandparents .
because sometimes they start acting really weird and after 9:30 pm weird things happen to them . Then both kids understand that their grandparents are hiding a really big secret .
Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff , this is the fun part about shopping in small stores : you can always find something unique .
Second , it is true that shopping in a shopping center is fast and convenient , because one can buy all types of things together .
However , most shopping centers provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive .
In conclusion , I prefer to shop in small stores because I am more likely to find the one and the only product , while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting .
The changes to television are evident . This could be because society is changing too .
On television we can see what people consume .
If TV programmes are a lot of rubish , it is because some people prefer them .
Maybe , there are a lot of repeats of old programmes , but some of them are still watched by a large number of people .
And sometimes , programmes are too aggressive and give people bad messages .
On the other hand , there are some channels which show documentaries and programmes about specific subjects like science , math or history .
I think there are good TV programmes , but people do n't give them the value that they should have .
There are a lot of old programmes , but it is n't a problem .
Television still has something important to show .
I am writing to congratulate you on the excellent Dumplings Festival which I attended in Cracovie last November .
I had a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concerning the organisation .
I was far from impressed by all the dumplings which housewives prepared .
However , there are a couple of small suggestions .
First of all , the venue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
I saw parents with children but kids did not have many attractions .
Once again , please accept my compliments on a job well done . I hope you find my suggestions helpful and I look forward to an even more successful event next year .
These days , the use of technology is increasing , especially the use of robots .
According to Russell and Norwing , robots are special machines that have intelligence to carry out activities on their own or by command ( as cited in Chijindu & Inyiama , 2012 ) .
They represent an innovation that has changed the world in distinct ways and has been embedded in different areas of society ; for example in security , health , the armed forces , education , industry and agriculture .
Consequently , positive and negative social impacts can be observed by the population .
More accurate surgery , emotional bonding and an increase in communication are examples of positive consequences .
Negative impacts , such as the human dependence on robots for doing basic activities and pollution of the environment , can be cited .
This essay will describe the positive and negative social consequences of robots , and possible implications in the future .
Each day , the environment suffers different problems caused by global warming and humans are the sole agents responsible for this problem .
We need to analyze and investigate the main problems to find solutions which might heal our world .
As we know , in all cities , a lot of cars are used every day unnecessarily .
Probably , if we used public transport like buses instead of private vehicles , we would reduce the greenhouse effect caused by the CO2 produced .
I think we must be down to earth and creative to cut down on our daily trash production .
To sum up , it 's necessary to solve the environmental problems to keep our planet safe , so we had better start resolving closer issues .
In Pantanal , the weather is hot and wet , and we can drive to the river deeper in the wood and see wild animals , like alligators .
There , you will see beautiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice vineyards .
Here , you 'll find most kinds of temporary job , like in restaurants , bars , etc .
Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese . None of those languages are as popular as English is .
Over 1 billion people around the world speak English as a second language . Because of that , it is considered the universal language .
Nowadays , it is obligatory if you want to get a better job .
I will discuss the importance of English as a second language in Brazil .
Brazilians need to learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
Learning English as a foreign language will have a huge impact on Brazilians ' professional lives , helping them to get a better position .
To conclude , Brazil has a lack of English speakers .
The Brazilian educational system should be aware to develop students ' language skills more .
Learning English as a second language will help Brazilians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
It is a rich , graceful and delightful language to learn .
She was going to the national championships in swimming and she had been preparing since last summer .
Especially since the previous national competitions when she suffered a shoulder injury and could not start .
Anna won first prize and regained confidence .
These people sometimes think of their sons or daughters as innocent angels who spend a lot of their time with inexperienced teachers with no qualifications .
Teaching could be a stimulating working environment for students and teachers if it combined a rewarding career and the improvement of teaching skills .
In this case , teaching would n't be monotonous and with no opportunities or prospects .
I am writing to ask you if your school could organize an individual course in English for me .
My pronunciation is not always correct , and as a result , I have some problems with listening . I know English economic terminology very well but my everyday English is rather poor .
I enjoy visiting museums and travelling in my free time .
I prefer learning on a one - to - one basis , because it is more comfortable for me .
I love outdoor activities . I have been doing rock climbing for nine years now , and started motocross in 2010 . Also , I consider myself very friendly with children and teenagers . When I was a child , my father and I used to go camping almost every other weekend . That was until four years ago , because he is no longer able to stay out of the city . But he taught me all that I need to know to survive out there , so , I really know how to do things in the woods .
Also , I am chef , so I can assure you that I will be helpful in the kitchen . I have been cooking for large numbers of people for 7 years in a really big restaurant .
It is said that there is no future for public transportation . I used to think that when I was young , but it has changed as I am getting older .
There are a lot of benefits of developing public transportation .
First , it is more convenient .
Most developed countries developed a public transportation system to lower the impact of a growing population .
Shared costs make the huge expense of developing and building the public transport system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally - friendly .
Public transportation is proved to require less energy consumption .
I still think the public transportation system will keep on growing in such a crowded era .
How long have you not used public transportation for ? Do you agree that there is no future for public transport ?
I personally think so , the reasons are as follows :
Also , travelling , of course , is a big part of the function of the car !
The very well developed highways , roads , and city streets provide a good foundation for cars . Look at North America , highways have been built everywhere . It 's really your loss if you do n't drive a car .
Second , people start to learn to drive at the age of 16 , and they can master driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) . Soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still driving to their destinations as they are used to it .
So who can be bothered to take public transportation anymore ?
Third , public transportation sucks , when you think about it . You can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hassles of the public transportation transfers in your mind .
The wasted time also should weigh in , whether it is waiting for the trains , or waiting for the delayed buses , not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car .
And driving your own car can be very convenient too ; it can go right to your own garage .
All in all , public transport is not as fast as a car can be , it 's not as convenient as a car can be , so its future is in doubt .
Thirdly , I lived for two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
If I could change places for 24 hours with a famous person , I would like to be Paula Echevarria .
I will start by telling you something about Paula Echevarria . She is a very pretty and famous actress . She also writes a fashion blog . She is 34 years old and she is married to David Bustamente , who is a popular and handsome singer in Spain . They have a daughter - her name is Daniela - and they are like a perfect family .
I have chosen Paula because she is popular , famous , rich and has the perfect husband . But , above all , I choose her because she is friendly , intelligent and always smiling .
Therefore , she has everything good about being a celebrity , but the most important is that she is a great person .
Let me conclude by saying that I would like to be Paula for one day , because not only is she a good professional , but she is also a wonderful role model to be followed by everyone .
I would like to talk about my hobby of breeding birds . This hobby is very pleasant for me and also for many people , especially when you have different kinds of singing birds like canaries or finches .
This hobby gives me pleasure and a good sense of nature , especially when I wake up with the sound of the singing birds in my house .
At present , I have three kinds of birds . One of them is a yellow canary , the second one is a finch , and the third one is a combination of two kinds of birds . Each bird has its own special voice .
By increasing the variety of cars with new technology , people 's demand hasn't ' stopped .
As technology enhances the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it because of many different attractions that these cars have .
Furthermore , there are advantages to travelling by car , like seeing the scenery and also the costs are less in comparison with a plane .
On the other hand , by increasing the population , we should revise the regulations with the fast pace of technology .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for the job in the USA summer camps .
I am interested in applying for this position .
I am 25 years old and have just finished university studies to be a sports teacher .
I think I am suitable for this position because I am hardworking and energetic .
I also have the proficiency ( CPE ) degree and I have been to the USA several times so my English knowledge is good .
Furthermore , during my studies at university I worked on 2 projects based on sports activities for children aged 7 - 13 , organising them .
This job would give me the opportunity to practise my skills and get more experience with children as well .
Studying English abroad is the better alternative , but it has advantages and disadvantages .
On the other hand , living abroad , you 'll need to speak English all the time and you 'll have the opportunity to learn English in a short time , and in a not boring way .
So , probably , if you have the opportunity to stay abroad for several months , you should do it , to learn English and live a different experience .
In order to improve the time you spend on it , we will recommend you to star in one of our malls , where you can find at your disposal lots of facilities , from the most fashionable shop to the most traditional .
First of all , coming to a mall will help you to deal with them . Also , we have to rate positively the wide range of services you can find here : restaurants , coffee shops and some free areas to spare .
For all of you who have kids , you will also be interested in the different areas which take care of them for free for as much time as you need .
In conclusion , you will save time , money and a foot ache . So accept my advice and try to enjoy the rest of your time in the city .
There are two main characters .
Arthur went to London for an appointment for a job interview .
The company requested him to go back three days later , so he was looking for a hotel that someone had recommended him .
He was delighted with her and fell in love immediately .
He forgot his engagement and went to live with Blanche .
I chose this story because even though this story was written in the early twentieth century , the underlying theme is still current today .
And I would also like to highlight that it reflects the importance of every decision we make and how it can change our future .
" Atacama 33 " is a recent American movie that tells the true story of a group of miners that were trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months .
The film is well - developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that the miners had to go through .
The characters were perfect because they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involved in the real accident .
It is universally accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable .
However , shopping can have a bad effect on our health , especially as we can feel tired or exhausted at the end of a hard day .
People claim that shopping can make our mood better , which in consequence will be fun .
In conclusion , I would like to say that there are different views about shopping and that 's not a surprise because we are all different .
On the positive side , the use of the internet helps us to quickly and easily find a lot of information about all the topics .
On the negative side , the use of the Internet can be a waste of time in our lives ; this happens because although searching is faster , we can get distracted looking at other things on account of the attractions of the Internet .
To sum up , the Internet is a good and efficient instrument if we know the correct use of it .
But to learn new cultures , we must know their languages , especially if we want to travel .
Due to globalization , there are more and more multinational companies that require employees who can speak at least fluent English , but if a candidate knows more languages he can have more career opportunities and achieve top level positions .
In my opinion , it is very important to speak several languages , not only for the above reasons , but also to train your brain , to have the opportunity to find a job abroad and , why not
Unfortunately , it is very difficult to learn foreign languages when we are adults , so it is extremely important to teach and to study them from kindergarten age .
The doorbell rang insistently . It was Saturday in the early morning and I was still in bed .
First I asked " Who is ringing so early ? What 's happening?Suddenly , a familiar voice shouted to me through the door .
You do n't think opening the door to your little brother"Oh brother ! , I shouted , and I ran to open the door . "
What an amazing surprise ! I was very emotional and was about to cry . "
In answer to your question about the use of the internet by young people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information more easily and quickly .
Also , it plays a great role in removing the borders between nations . In a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just to talk to a friend .
Nowadays , the Internet is very useful , it has many ways of helping people , such us helping with their homework , using Google , or entertainment websites like Youtube , email services such as Hotmail , and the number one social network site , Facebook .
Obviously , we can not imagine how much time we spend online , because the whole day we are connected , in our houses , on mobile phones and on computers at work .
I think it is a bohemian way to travel too , because the train used to be one of the most appreciated means of transport in literature .
The boat is a very beautiful way to travel , but I 'm sure when I travel by boat in the future , I 'll feel anxiety because I 'll be surrounded by water .
In conclusion , my main problem is concern about how safe the means of transport that I take is , so , the train lets me be more relaxed than other ways to travel .
Volleyball is a complete sport where you can exercise all your muscles .
A feature of volleyball is that the players have to rotate their positions while they are scoring points .
In fact , I enjoy playing volleyball because it is a fun sport which you can play with a lot of people , eleven people to be precise .
I suggest to new players of volleyball that they should start step by step .
Wear comfortable clothes and suitable shoes .
Nowadays , they have to work through a lot of issues while they are in their adolescence . They begin to have a lack of self - esteem , depression , social pressure , and all this can cause a lot of problems .
They have to realise that if they continue eating that way and not doing any exercise they are more likely to have different diseases .
I went to a workshop about a light - controlled synthesizer .
On the way there , everyone who participated in the workshop stopped to buy some snacks .
When we reached the workshop , the kids and I were told to put on protective glasses and given booklets with the instructions .
We were instructed to make a badge that flashed different coloured light by using solder to attach the LED and battery hatch to the badge .
Then we had to follow the instructions in the booklet to make the synthesizer .
At first I was quite confused , but then one of the instructors came and helped me out .
Each synthesizer emitted a loud noise .
When the light sensor is in the shade , the synthesizer emits a lower pitch , and when the sensor is exposed to light , the synthesizer 's pitch rises .
I worked as an Advocate ( Solicitor ) for a period of more than four years and from those jobs I gained lots of experience in minute taking , dealing with clients , arranging meetings and handling cases .
I am a proficient user of Microsoft Office packages .
I worked voluntarily for some cases relating to juvenile justice , like ( speedy disposal of cases , abuse of their rights while they were in custody , custodial death etc . )
I worked on a project about how education as a fundamental right for children under 14 years of age is denied in some communities .
In my second placement , I had to do lots of administrative work , including typing .
I had to work as a liaison with clients as well as the company officials ( since Shriram Law Consultants is a part of the Shriram Group of Companies ) .
The article and the lecture are about the attitude towards conducting medical experiments on animals .
The author claims that the main aim of the scientists is to reduce human suffering even if it demands research conducted on animals .
The lecturer opposes this idea , as , in her view , medical experiments on animals should not be conducted .
Firstly , the author informs us about the impossibility of discovering new types of drugs .
Secondly , the author suggests that it is impossible to replace experiments on animals with anything else .
The lecturer disagrees with that point of view , because it is possible to introduce computer substitution or do research on tissues .
The lecturer argues that , as a biologist , she used to see animals suffering without the appropriate amount of anesthesia .
The article states that the most efficient replacement for internal - combustion engines will be fuel - cell engines , because of their various advantages , while the reader refutes this point by stating that hydrogen does not have so many advantages .
First of all , the reading passage says that the internal - combustion engine relies on petroleum , which will soon be depleted , but hydrogen will not deplete easily .
The professor counters this point by explaining that hydrogen is , in fact , not easily found .
She adds that it is not directly usable , because hydrogen should be obtained in a pure liquid state , which technologically is very hard to keep under -200 degrees Celsius .
The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem , because it needs to be purified in order to be used .
She explains that in the process of purification , a large amount of coal and oil is burned , which pollutes factories rather than the environment .
Finally , the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economical , because it requires only half of the energy of internal - combustion - powered cars .
She explains that platinum is very hard to find and , without this metal , it is impossible to produce hydrogen .
An Unexpected Success
I am a fairly calm person and I am interested in reading every kind of book , therefore , I have a quiet life .
Last Spring , however , something happened which surprised everybody , especially me .
My little sister wanted to learn to play the piano so she joined a music school which organised a concert performance at the end of the course .
Unfortunately , she could no longer play .
I was absolutely terrified as I had to show .
I am definitely going to play the piano for a long time .
He was the pastor of a Baptist Church and he fought against the discrimination against black people in the United States in the 60s .
He founded the civil rights movement to free black people from racial segregation and inequality .
He participated a lot of times in meetings , as a leader , and he went against the law several times .
He decided not to use violence in this kind of action , because he was concerned about fighting against the Vietnam War and poverty .
The other goal of Martin Luther King was the right to vote for African American people .
Report on shopping facilities in my town :
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to assess the most interesting shops for tourists and make some suggestions .
Shopping facilities :
In general , shops are concentrated in a specific zone so that tourists can find what they are interested in very easily .
Suggestions :
In general , tourists think shops should be opened at midday as they are foreigners and like to buy things after seeing the sights around the city .
Conclusion and recommendations :
I 'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience .
As you know , Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation . It 's a very fast , energetic city with lots of things to do and to see .
You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school .
In addition , a few years ago , the Big Theater was restored and has regained its original appearance .
There is no need to describe all the sightseeing in Moscow . You can easily find it on the Internet . I just want to say that I 'm sure you 'll like it a lot .
It 's a group of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history .
There you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia .
You will understand that people here and there are very different and their lifestyles are dissimilar .
I could n't wait to listen to my favorite song until they played it . It was the best experience ever . I wish you could have been there to see that .
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NAPLES AND I HOPE IT'LL BE USEFUL .
I THINK THAT THE EASIEST MODE OF TRANSPORT FOR YOU IS THE UNDERGROUND ; NEAR THE TRAIN IN GARIBALDI SQUARE THERE IS THE UNDERGROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO CATCH AND YOU HAVE TO GET OFF AT CHIAIANO STATION . I'LL BE AT CHAIANO STATION , SO WE WILL WALK TO MY HOME .
Some people claim that universities and colleges should not spend a great deal of money on sports and social activities , as their budgets should prioritize classes and libraries .
However , as educational institutions , universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge for their students to help them develop academically and socially .
The student had a great number of assignments and projects , so he spent more time on accessing the library , becoming more ambitious to study books , and using a computer to search the for latest information .
Sometimes he felt tired of doing papers , and went to the gym to play basketball .
Therefore , not only did he get high scores in the reports , having absorbed a great deal of knowledge at the library , but he reduced the study stress and kept healthy at the gym .
I had a similar experience
when I studied at university . I sat in classes for hours every day .
At university , I also have a lot of assignments , so I like to go to the library to study , where it is more quiet , spacious and internet accessible .
That 's why I like to go to a school with good facilities and widespread information to help me to be a successful person .
Sports and social activities can greatly improve my efficiency .
For these reasons , I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social activities to prepare students for their future development .
Academic education will always be at the heart of a university .
In universities , sports and social activities should by no means take the place of a focus on academic study .
I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academic facilities as well as sports and social activities .
It is a great life stage , but at the same time , it is difficult . Sometimes teenagers have problems with their families , with themselves . As a result , they do n't know what to choose .
Many times , when people leave high school and they go to University , they realise after several months that the course they had chosen is not for them .
You can work , travel , go on an exchange study program , rest and do something that you are interested in .
When students go to university after they have taken a year off , fewer people leave the course after several months because they know themselves better .
I 'm interested in doing a course at your school .
I have an intermediate level and I 'd like to speak English better because my pronunciation is n't very good .
My grammar and writing are good , but as I 've said already , my pronunciation is awful .
I 'm available to start the course immediately and I want both an eight - week intensive course and a one - month summer course in August , when I 'll be on holiday , and in addition , I 'd like to learn in small groups because the teacher can focus on his pupils better .
Twenty years ago , no one would have thought of the invention of the iPad or smartphones and how they could change our lives , but today , these items have become necessities of our daily lives . Nowadays , many people have got into the habit of carrying their smartphones no matter where they go .
The progress of science , whether it is in scientific research or in the design of consumer products , has changed our lives and will definitely keep changing our lives in the future .
The iPad , smartphones , genetic food engineering , all of them have one thing in common - they have changed our lives dramatically .
Take genetic engineering as an example . On the one hand , it helps farmers to produce more crops and meats ; on the other , it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways of producing more crops and poultry in the future , resulting in an unprecedented increase in the human population , which brings pollution to the environment .
To cope with the problems of overpopulation and pollution , people need to dramatically change their lives in the next 50 years : they may , among other things , face tight birth control and environmental protection measures imposed by the government .
It is sad to say that the future generations have no choice but to adapt to the changes in order to survive .
As a result , I could be very helpful with organising sports and activities , but I could also provide assistance in other places , including the kitchen .
Furthermore , I am cheerful , energetic , and I get on well with kids .
I watched the film one month ago and it has really impressive and engrossing effects .
The film is about a movie shooting and the adventures of a film crew which is in Bolivia .
They come across some problems while they are shooting the film and this supplies quite a few strong highlights .
These problems are imperialism and poverty .
Actually , they want to describe the history of discovery and conquest from a critical perspective , but while shooting the film , there are some protests against the privatization of water and the team fall into chaos and then the film starts to give some social and political messages .
The crucial point is the transformations and experienced contradictions of the characters .
In our imperialist and capitalist world , we need more films or artistic influences which mention the problems of our life and realities .
I do n't think that there is no future for public transport and I agree that travelling by car is much more convenient .
If the government provided good transport infrastructure like modern and comfort buses , traffic free Metro lines , then people would rather use public transport than travel by car .
Governments should promote the best mode of transport in order to reduce carbon emissions and people would be encouraged to go green .
Many times , because of huge traffic congestion on the road , we waste our time , while using public transport like the Metro saves us time .
Department stores are found in all big cities .
There you can find almost everything you want .
CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE
There are such interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would never have expected or , unsurprisingly , misinformation .
We know that making social contact can sometimes be a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and daunting experience .
In my experience , being in front of the screen of a personal computer , you will be able to express and exchange ideas or opinions as easily as if you have to in front of someone else .
However , both readers and writers do not only do it in an altruistic and philanthropic way , but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to become famous if they really appeal to a large number of people and they will also be able to earn money thanks to advertising .
Consequently , we should never blindly trust everything we see or read on the Internet .
To give an example , I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series , characters , new seasons , and when they will be ready to watch again .
Whether they give us reliable information or not usually depends on the source .
You must n't take everything into account .
To clarify what the situation is , it is true that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites , but the fact is writing or reading a blog can give people a practical way to communicate and share preferences , beliefs or thoughts . however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
There was a lot of blood and it was then that Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I 'm writing to you in connection with your volunteer project , whose
description I found at http://http://europa.eu / youth/. I would like to know whether you are
accepting applications at the moment .
Your project is very compelling for me .
take part in it . I could help you with teaching math , together with computer programming ,
in an engaging and interesting way . I 'm passionate about math and programming .
Currently , I am working as a python programmer .
Programming language is a great choice for teaching kids to program .
Programming is fun and math concepts are absorbed much more easily through it .
I have a bachelor 's degree in mathematics ( I 'm a math teacher ) and a master 's degree in computer science .
Please let me know if you are looking for volunteers and if you are considering
applicants from Russia .
I will be happy to send you my CV and covering letter .
I have a sending organisation " Centre for Youth Studies - Higher School of Economics "
( accreditation number 2014-XT-16 )
I often try to play interesting games with the children . I think the games are a fun way to teach interesting things both to children and to older people . That is why I invent new methods to introduce science in the children 's lives .
The favorite game for my brothers is called " coca boom " . With this game I showed them what chemistry is . We cough a " Coke " and some " Mentos " sweets , then I put the " Mentos " into the " Coke " and I taught them what happens when you mix two substances .
I would be happy if you considered me if there are vacancies .
I play basketball in my free time and hang out with my friends from my old school .
My favorite book is " The Hunger Games " .
I like that book so much because it is pretty realistic and it could happen in the real world sometime .
Everything is made of blocks and you can build and play with friends .
But I played basketball and tennis at the same time , so I chose basketball , because I think it 's fun .
Besides seeing touristic or historical places and attending open - air activities , people also want to see the museums of the city they visit .
Because museums offer so many interesting and different things , they differ from other places in the city being visited .
First of all , people visit museums to learn the history of the city being visited . We know that museums are generally established to exhibit special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to exhibit modern belongings .
These old things in the museum give us unique information about the history of the city and its social life .
For example , when you go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City , you can see lots of historical monuments and items belonging to American history and also other countries ' history .
Many items in museums have cultural value as well as historical value .
For instance , art museums include art collections such as paintings by many different artists .
Besides historic and cultural characters , some museums also can be a source of fun , including attractive activities .
In sum , museums are attractive places for tourists to find out about the city they are visiting .
By visiting museums we can learn interesting details about the history and culture of that society .
In addition to having lots of information , we also can have fun seeing interesting things in the museums , such as huge dinosaurs . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you visit .
Today plenty of ecology organisations are trying to raise people 's awareness of the environmental damage .
It is often necessary to have a car when living in a small city or village without public transport , and it is understandable .
But while living in a big city , where there are lots of bus stops , tram stops or metro stations , it is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck in a jam during rush hours .
As the ecology organisations says , it is better for the environment , and as we decided , it is better for us to save our precious time .
Increasingly , people prefer to use public transport rather than drive a car for these reasons .
The importance of the internet in our lives
The last decades there has been a massive change in our lives . This is caused by the development of the internet .
There have been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on social life .
The internet allows you to search for information in massive online libraries for research and writing essays .
There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find the publications of researchers around the world .
The internet is becoming important for our studies because of the availability of information sources .
The internet has a lot of consequences in our lives .
Also , it gives us the possibility to get in contact with family and friends .
In my life there are so many sports I like but there is one in particular that I love so much .
When I was young I saw my father watching football programmes every day but I did n't understand what football was .
However , over time I began to understand how to play and I liked it much more than in the past .
He won two national championships and also an important European competition .
On the other hand , my advice that I would give to someone who is starting this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsibility and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
Is it best for the pollution and the environment ?
But , I think that in other cases we take the car without any reason . It 's only a bad habit and maybe we could change it to improve our health ( going on foot or taking a bike for example ) and also we will help to the environment and the pollution .
For example , I 'm a commuter and I also need my car to pick up my daughter from school in the afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't like the traffic . Then when I get away from the hustle and bustle of the city I usually go to my village .
In my opinion , tennis is the best sport because I 'm an individualist , so I prefer individual sports , because in these kinds of games everything depends on you .
I hope this sport will have more importance in Italy in the future .
I am writing to you to raise an important issue concerning the school library .
I look forward to understanding and I hope we will reach a consensus .
Together with an unofficial Student Council , we created a petition which is to raise the issue with the teaching council .
Our priority is good preparation for the secondary school certificate .
Moreover , pupils demand the possibility to borrow books .
It is the most important matter , because most of us are not able to buy highly educational books .
Our request boils down to the fundamental role of education .
It is broadening the horizons of our knowledge .
Besides the issues that have already been mentioned , there is also the undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library , it would be more representative .
Given the rationality of the above arguments , we pupils expect the positive consideration of our request .
Respectfully yours ,
Our lives have changed a lot since the last century due to technological improvements and changes in society .
First of all , as we said before , people 's lives have changed due to two important elements , which are technological improvements and changes in society .
The first one is very obvious because , every day , researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new inventions and improve the old ones .
For instance , one hundred years ago , it was impossible to see a woman working and supporting the whole family alone financially , or studying for a degree at university , things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society .
In addition , there are other conditions and facts that have helped to change people 's lives , such as political decisions , global wars and global economic problems , etc .
I am writing to You in connection with your request for information about an interesting building or place to visit in Katowice .
The most interesting is the art gallery , Oko Miasta , which is located in the city centre .
It is a very distinctive place because of its size , its appearance and its atmosphere .
It is a good place for everyone who wants to get some Polish literature .
Furthermore , in the building of the art gallery there is a club Oko .
Not only is it the popular place among young Polish citizens , but it is also really extraordinary : people can walk the red carpet and drink the most famous drinks .
I recommend it because it is the best place for young people .
While he was lost in the action , a strange and unexpected sound came from his sister 's bedroom .
My sister should definitely close her windows . I am going out of this house . I should leave this cat here and let it ruin her things " .
Destination : Disney .
Do you imagine travelling to the United States ?
Have you ever gone to a place designated only for having fun ?
Disney is the dream of a lot of people in the world , many of them have said that it is a magic and awesome experience .
Firstly , Disney is not an ordinary destination like beaches or mountains , it is a place that requires a different means of transport since it is a long way away .
The vacation starts when the plane takes off and nerves and happiness blend , creating an experience you will never forget .
When the plane arrives at the airport in Miami , you can appreciate the beautiful view that this place offers .
Secondly , the entrance to Disney is incredible and colorful . It also has the main characters in it .
Each one has a different topic and amazing rides perfect for adolescents .
To conclude , Disney has so many facilities that it is impossible to get bored , you can relax in your hotel and have an unforgettable time on the roller - coasters .
Indeed , it is true that travelling by car is much more convenient .
We therefore have to choose other alternatives .
This technology will be improved further in the future .
Besides that , if I had to choose a type of film , I would say , comedy and action ones are the most appealing to me , if they have a real dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one .
Honestly , they lasted for 3 hours , but the most impressive of all this is that they were able to create a single world between me and the screen for all that time .
They really held my attention , they had all the characteristics that I consider the basic ones in a film , not to mention the astonishing actors that gave an impressive performance .
All I expect in a film is the way they establish connections between the actors and the audience in a way that allows them to play with the characters as if they were puppets and to create a coherent and attractive film .
I am writing this letter regarding the advertisement about the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I understand that you require people who have good English , are energetic , cheerful and hardworking , who are able to look after children between 8 and 12 , help organise sports and evening activities and work in the kitchen .
I have previous experience working with " ADRENALINE SUMMER CAMPS " coaching children in how to play football for a football championship . Within the summer camps , I also organized other activities such as climbing , running , competitions , expeditions and other movement .
During the time I spent coaching , organizing and helping in the kitchen , I learnt that the most important thing is to keep a positive attitude and always motivate them every step of the way .
I truly enjoy working with children to help them learn and improve their already acquired skills , especially in sports .
Hence the reason I am very interested in this opportunity to coach sports for children during this summer .
Yours faithfully
I think everybody knows the importance of having a person who is always there .
For me , a good person to speak with about everything , especially about my problems .
Although we have many different views on life , we understand each other and are best friends .
Many people around the world follow international sports events passionately .
That could be a great way to stop international tensions , although crises and wars still exist .
Sports in general are followed by a huge percentage of the population .
I 'm keen on individual disciplines .
Probably we , as the human race , need this kind of thing .
I 'd prefer that people demonstrate good behavior independently of international sports events .
I 've been interested in playing an instrument since I was a child .
Latent fingerprints are commonly found at the scene of a crime .
They are key clues in forensic investigation .
Persistence and uniqueness are the characteristics of the fingerprint .
The latent form of fingerprint is invisible to the human eye , hence the need for some methods for visualization and development of latent fingerprints .
Divergent approaches are used on a routine basis for the development of latent fingerprints .
Powders , by adhering physically to the fingerprint residue develop the latent fingerprint . Chemical reagents undergo reactions with the organic and inorganic parts of the fingerprints . Developing the latent , small particle reagent developed latent fingerprints by adhesion to sebaceous content of the fingerprints , ninhydrin reacting with amino acid of the fingerprint and developing the latent marks . Single and multi - metal deposition methods work on the principle of deposition and result in the negative development of latent marks .
New methods are continually added in the literature and show the importance of fingerprints in the criminal investigation system .
One can easily deduce information about culprits from the partial form of a latent fingerprint .
What is more , if you want to get rid of depression or stress , go to the gym .
According to scientific research , mental health is closely connected to physical health .
As for me , I am keen on basketball as it is my personal way to unwind and work out .
I am into it because it is quite addictive and spectaculous .
Moreover , it is considered to be one of the most active and popular kinds of sport all around the world .
To sum up , I believe that if you want to be mentally and physically fit , you should try to do some sport and exercise . Also , do not worry if you are not so good at it , just keep doing it and enjoy yourself .
These are defined as plant - derived substances that occur naturally with no or minimal manufacturing processes and which manage and cure various health conditions effectively ( Bent , 2008 ; Tachjian ; Maria and Jahangir , 2010 ) .
Although herbal medicines have significantly performed well in the treatment and management of illness , people have increasingly consumed these products via self - directed therapy .
This essay will demonstrate that there is considerable evidence for a possible detrimental affect on public health due to the increasing use of self - prescribed herbal medicines and that a health crisis is likely if no action is taken by health organisations .
The most recent thriller I 've seen is " The Miserables " .
However , I 'm not referring to the musical , nor the intermediate version ; the oldest version is the relevant one .
It is a movie that presents a lot of richness in characters and historical facts .
You are able to analyse human emotions and rationalise moral situations , so it is a movie that provides a lot of factors .
I found it very exciting because it shows a pre - revolutionary era when Jean Valjean is sent to work as a slave for stealing a small piece of bread .
After he ends his sentence , he has to solve many moral situations that prove who he really is .
What really makes the difference is if you choose to help others or not .
I think people who read the book ( written by Victor Hugo ) who are interested in this historical incident , or who merely want to analyse human relationships must see the movie .
Meanwhile , wild animals which have forests and wetlands as their habitats will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to find after the destruction of their homelands .
To reduce the above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before the construction of buildings and transport and try their best to decrease the side effects .
They should provide financial support to those who once lived in such destroyed areas and help them develop professional skills to look for good jobs .
Although there will be many bad influences of large - scale building on people and animals , countries would develop better if governments could make efforts to solve the above problems .
Personally , for me , shopping is very pleasant , but sometimes it can be a little tiring .
First of all , if we are in shops , we can buy everything we want .
Anyway , there are also some disadvantages of shopping .
He had great talent , but no one understood his creative mind .
Everyone considered him a crazy and boring guy obsessed by his passion , except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to give up his dream .
At that time , Kate was working in an international advertising agency .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutionary at the same time , something that could give a new vision of reality , and Kate started to offer some information about many artists .
One night she was working at home . She was in difficulty because no one satisfied her clients .
She started to be a little bit nervous , she was n't able to find any solution when , suddenly , she remembered that Michael 's art had the features requested by her clients .
She immediately picked up the phone and called Michael and she started to explain her project .
Michael was very excited because he finally had the opportunity to introduce his view of art through his pictures .
After lots of meetings and conferences with the representation of China , Japan , the USA and Oceania , Michael began to be the man who he had dreamed of being since he was a child .
Everything was going well except his behaviour towards his friend Kate .
One day , the two friends had a terrible argument .
Kate was really angry and she ordered him to leave her room immediately .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to propose the best places for visiting and to show the wide range of existing facilities which can be used by young people who are going to make a trip to my area .
Whenever I hear about famous actors or singers complaining about photographers following them , I ca n't get a smile off my face .
What 's the description of a famous person ?
Despite the fact I said that famous people need to be well known , I think that ca n't be applied to politicians .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie star 's , but they should make their decisions transparent for most of the population though .
It is their job to make decisions that ensure the benefit of the people in their country , but we do n't need to know anything else about them , after they come home to spend some time with their families .

Letter of Recommendation
It is my pleasure to write a recommendation letter for Mr
I have known Kadeer since 2012 , when he joined the faculty of Computers and Information , Fayoum University , as an undergraduate student .
He attended my labs on the " structured programming " course during the first year .
We frequently discussed various difficult problems in the scope of the course , and I was impressed by his analytical abilities .
He showed a distinct intellectual level compared to other students .
Also during this course , he had to work in a team and deliver a project as a requirement for the course .
He contributed excellent and innovative ideas during this project and he showed that he is an excellent team player .
Kadeer as one of the most excellent and outstanding personalities among his colleagues .
I believe that Mr Kadeer will perform very well and I strongly recommend him for the " Google Student Ambassador MENA Program " .
Assistance Lecturer at CS Dep . ,
Computers and Information Faculty ,
Fayoum University , Fayoum , Egypt .

He was very naughty and was not very interested in his studies .
He was a very big menace and the villagers hated him because of his mischievous behavior .
People gathered around his house hearing him screaming out loud and within no time the fire brigade also arrived at the destination .
He was even made to apologize to all the neighboring villagers .
This film was about how a previous robbery which had been committed by Vin 's gang leads to the hatred of a criminal played by Jason Statham .
The chasing of Jason vs. Vin was so exciting . Furthermore , a walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jason is interrupted by another party .
The end of the story comes when Diesel gets cornered by Jason , suddenly Dwayne came and shot Jason with a machine gun .
The next scene was the demolishing of the whole building as well as the blowing up of Jason 's helicopter .
Vin 's family lived happily ever after because the enemy was eradicated and the rest got jailed .
The film was the last movie starring Paul Walker as , during the film production process , he passed away due to a car accident .
This film 's Soundtrack , ' See You Again ' , was composed by Wiz Khalifa and dedicated to Paul .
This film will keep everyone 's attention because the scenarios , the action scenes , and drama beyond Paul 's death are harmonized rigorously .
I know how much you like both activities so I suppose you are having a hard time .
I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson . You promised me you would never give up ! You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you achieved it .
You 've kept working on it for almost your entire life now and , although you have not become a professional one , you have never given up .
When I first introduced you to it , you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements .
Proof not only that you are very determined , but that piano playing was meant to be .
I 'd suggest we take some days off together and head for any particular place he would like to go to .
Then , once we got on the car , I 'd let the music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words .
At that point , I would let his talking go on without stopping him through interruption .
Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive .
I really enjoy volleyball and horse riding , although my favourite sport is swimming .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , especially in the summer , because in the water you can cool down .
Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling , but public transportation is the most effective way to take people from one place to another .
In fact , travelling by car is not convenient when people have their own cars for their family or themselves .
The main advantage of public transportation is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively low cost .
For example , a bus can take more than 40 passengers at one time at a low cost .
The second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution in a city .
In conclusion , public transportation will still play an important role in transportation in a city , unless environmentally - friendly vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well to accommodate a huge number of cars .
Personally , people must dedicate most of their time to things they should do for two important reasons .
By doing so , you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential .
For example , when I was 17 , I was starting my first day of class at the university .
I started to feel bored with the complementary courses on my curriculum because they were the kind of courses that did n't have any relevance to my university course , which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Law , and so on .
I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with when I went for a vacation in the countryside .
That experience taught me how important it is to do whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in life .
Second , if you avoid doing things just because you do n't like them , you 'll miss opportunities .
As you can see , my friend missed the opportunity because he did n't like what he was asked to do .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention of the last century , while others think that there are a lot of inventions throughout history that are more important than the computer .
Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and it is for that that I think it is the most important invention .
Some people say that the computer changes the way people see the world , and this changes the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .
On the other hand , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with their friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that it is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that there exist inventions more important than the computer that we still use nowadays .
Personally , I prefer different movies .
Therefore , I feel more peaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and undemanding .
Thank you for your reply , it was so useful , but I still have some questions and I would be really pleased if you could give me this necessary information .
First of all , I want to know what water sports you offer , because our group of students would probably be interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surfing , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would also like to ask you about the type of equipment you can lend us to do these kinds of activities and sports I have just mentioned .
As you said , the safety of the students is our main concern . We must be completely sure that you will take care of them , chiefly because most of the students are still young and we have a strong commitment to their parents .
However , I do n't think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city , especially if you take into account the economic aspects .
In my view , using public transport in this case has two important advantages : the first one is you do n't have to worry about parking ; the second one is you can move in a relaxed way , reading a book , listening to music or talking with other passengers .
Nevertheless , having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not only because the price of petrol is continuously rising , but also because you have to pay high taxes for the car .
In short , although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than doing it by public transport , it is not probable that it will disappear in the near future .
As I see it , there are several ways to improve , it because we are trying to invent a lot of things every day .
Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life . I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioning or anything which can make travelling enjoyable .
Most people are frustrated or agitated because they have to use public transport .
Artificial intelligence is one of the best ways , we can switch drivers to these vehicles .
In conclusion , we have a lot of things to improve .
Help them and enjoy your journey .
In fact , probably it was n't a significant thing for most people , but it was for her .
Hello I 'm Mathieu Sanabria and I 'm here to deny and explain everything about the case of my sextape . I went to a party with my football team - mates and we were having a whale of time . Then some girls arrived and I started to talk with one of them . I like her and she likes me so , we went to my room to have privacy and I do n't know how , but some guys got into my room and started to record me with the girl and I did n't notice . Then many days later , I received a call from a guy who told me that he had a very explicit video of me doing things with a girl and that if I did n't give him some money he would put that video on the Internet .
He asked me how much money he should demand from Mathieu ? Then I asked him how much he needed?He said about one hundred thousand euros and after that I said " you can get it " . With hindsight , I was wrong because it was illegal .
The British band announced that the album was coming with news ; a new singer , Bruce Dickison , joined the group and made the fans completely astonished by his nice - sounding voice .
The infrastructure built for controlling and maintaining the environmental ecosystem is bad . In other words , the government and people do not care about the environment , rather they spoil the environment .
The government always say they are doing their best to improve the environment but nothing is done . Perhaps they are mismanaging people 's money in terms of various projects that control the pollution of the city .
The government is not the only one to blame , but also the people who live here , who never care about their environment .
Although many factories and people are polluting the environment drastically , some people and organizations are protecting the environment , but most often these people are discriminated against by society .
But they do n't care about this and continue with their work . Often these people tend to demonstrate the effect of the pollution on people and future generations and have made some people change the way they look at the city , but often , most people do n't care about what they try to say and sometimes these people are scolded .
So far , people do n't understand the consequences of pollution , but within a decade they will suffer and understand the consequences of pollution in their life for sure .
I have seen your advertisement and I would be more than delighted to take part in a summer camp as an assistant .
I think I have some experience with young children as I have to take care of my own brothers every day .
And in order to help them defend themselves , I can also teach them some techniques for self - defense .
As the only Brazilian president from an underprivileged background , Lula has made history after running for President four times .
Since he took up office in 2002 , Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking more than forty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
During Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom like never before and became a world economic power .
Democracy also had fundamental changes in that period .
To curb corruption , new laws were created , institutions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .
Minority groups received more attention to protect their rights and investments in education , health and well - being increased .
Curiously , Lula is the only Brazilian president without a university degree .
For the poorest Brazilians , Lula and his history is something to be proud of .
For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor migrant from northern Brazil , overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own , privileged , university - educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems .
I am writing to apply for a job in the USA I saw recently in your advertisement in a local newspaper of my city .
Further to our recent telephone conversation , I have worked as a babysitter with children aged 5 - 10 for five years .
Furthermore , I worked for some major companies when I finished my degree in Journalism five years ago .
By the way , I have experience in the organization of sport and evening activities because , at university , I did a course in Public Relations .
If you want to see my reports , I can send you them whenever you want or , if you prefer to ask my teachers about me , I can send you their phone numbers in case you want references from my job .
My teachers have said to me that , if you want , they can write a letter about my experience .
Yours faithfully ,
Most people like to drive cars instead of using public transportation .
Students go to school or university by car as well .
The government had to start major public transportation projects in order to solve the problem .
The underground metro in Riyadh is one of those projects .
It 's fast , easy , comfortable and safe .
Buses are much more convenient for driving kids to schools .
Transporting workers by public transportation or by bus is more convenient for big companies .
Public transport or travelling by car ?
I think travelling by car is a very comfortable way to travel .
You do n't have to think about bus timetables and stops .
You must know the timetables and from which platform the train will leave .
I think it 's true that travelling by car will be more popular .
It is really good . It is better than the previous novel , FSOGrey . I really mean it . It is not porn . BE GROWN UP PLEASE . If you do n't want to read the " sex parts " , just turn over the next page till it ends , that 's all . I did that to finish that novel . This novel is just to tell us the passionate love story between a successful businessman , chairmen man with a very unhappy childhood , and he only refers to his birth mother as " the crack whore " , which is related to his recent behaviour - BDSM . And the girl seemed very bored of her routine life , innocent , did nt know anything about life . Apparently , THEY were so different from each other , but somehow , some magic connected them and made them a very lovely couple .
The two maps depict the main changes which took place in Shipsmouth between the years 1995 and 2010 .
Overall , it can be seen that the city has became more modern , with more transport and entertainment facilities .
One striking change is that a new station has been built , to connect the north of the city with the city centre and the road has been pedestrianized .
Another interesting redevelopment is that the factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre , and in the same way , so was the Church , which was pulled down to be replaced by a pub .
The urban areas were demolished , to make way for skyscrapers .
One must recognize the field and the strengths , as well as the weaknesses , of his opponent to score a goal .
Thus , it is a game with a combination of mental and physical skills .
For people starting to do this sport , one can try to train individually .
Information about the basic theory and technique of tennis can be gathered from the internet / books .
Learning to do juggling would also be beneficial .
Many coaches advise their pupils to practise it for better coordination of hand and eye .
But most importantly , one should enjoy all of this fun .
I do n't exactly understand why people want to learn about the private lives of politicians and film stars ,
Unfortunately , a lot of people are interested in others .
These happenings are not strange .
Because all people have got predicaments .
But the public wants to see famous politicians and stars in every situation .
For example , they want to see well - known people with their boyfriend / girlfriend or want to see them in causal attire or want to see famous women without make - up .
On the other hand , this opinion should be considered : Some big names are important for someone who seems them like an ideal .
However , being able to protect themselves against an invasion of privacy is a fundamental human right of stars .
The government should give superstars the right to protection of personal relationships and activities .
Ultimately , crowd - pleasing people also have got civic rights just like everyone else .
It is more convenient as you can travel straight to the place you want to go .
First of all , public transport provides the experience of the journey .
They give you the experience of flying in the sky or floating on the sea .
That is an experience you can not get by car .
Third , public transport is good for the environment .
The " Times " newspaper publishes an intercepted letter written by the Spanish Ambassador , Dupuy de Lowe , that will make him resign due to what he wrote about the USA .
Next , to the explosion of the North American steamer , Maine , the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures us that it could n't have been done from the outside , but must have been done from the inside .
On the other hand , the USA commission brings their results to Parliament without previously notifying Spain of their results and with the opposite conclusion to that of the Spanish commission .
However , the Spanish government does not agree with the USA 's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with international arbitration .
Later , the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba , but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans .
Mackinley asks for the arbitration of Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain asks North Americans to get off of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict .
The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba .
Later , the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to militarily intervene in Cuba if necessary .
The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date .
In this Memorandum , the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of president Mackinley .
Also , this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict , which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blowing - up of the steamer Maine , the latter being remarked concerning the USA having rejected the Spanish proposal to carry out the arbitration together .
The 21st of April EEUU denies Spanish sovereignty of Cuba . The 23rd of April , Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and on the 25th , the USA declares war on Spain .
From that day , diplomatic relations between both nations will be suspended .
So it is not just a fundamental element of being a good person , but also affects your society .
But the problem is , I do really care about my friends , so I always say " Yes " to my friends , because I do n't want to disappoint them .
That way you wo n't have lots of pressure , and you can be an honourable person .
I 'm glad you have graduated from school and that you have plans to go to university .
It 's good for you to take a year 's break before continuing with your studies .
I 'm going to make you a very nice itinerary and , hopefully , we 'll also find somewhere for you to work .
Then we can go visit the Fortress in Sighisoara , which is the only fortress in Europe to be actually inhabited .
He says I shop too much , but the fact is , he does n't want to spend money , he has stopped buying me flowers and chocolates and he has stopped being romantic .
Anyway , I still love him and still have the hope that this is just a temporary period in our life and he will be back to the man I loved once , especially since we have the most amazing reason to live for ; it 's our beautiful son , our angel and the amazing love of our lives .
Although some people would suggest that such a service has no future because people rely more on the car , as it is convenient , it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has a future .
Firstly , society today is more concerned about being environmentally friendly .
This is a worth seeing be concerned because air pollution has a negative impact on our health and the ecosystem .
For example , if a bus can carry 100 passengers , at least 25 cars can be reduced on the road , solving the problem of traffic jams .
In addition , scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles , so they become less harmful to the environment .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should have a future .
Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco - friendly , and there are still many people who rely on public transport .
Everyone deserves to have a private life , even celebrities and stars , who are the life and soul of the party during their working hours .
We all need a shelter where we can hide from daily difficulties .
This is the only way to maintain our mental health and not to fall into depression .
We can say for sure that stars and celebrities are also people .
What is more , celebrities , like ordinary people , need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationships with others .
They are not able to buy real relationships such as friendship and love .
They can gain fame and admiration thanks to their skills , but their stage personality is more like a powerful creation .
Sometimes , in everyday life , they are not even interesting in terms of character and appearance .
That is why a private life is so important , especially for stars , who are assessed all the time by society .
They showed me everything I had to do .
I had to carry some musical instruments and install software .
Then I helped with organization and selling tickets .
I love to help people and the best thing was that I met members of the band and have their autographs !
I believe that knowing more languages is always better . That way , people have a lot more culture and are more knowledgeable .
In conclusion , learning languages may be very handy , but can also be a time - wasting activity .
I saw your advertisement looking for a children 's monitor , and I think I could be the best person to fill that position .
I have worked at schools in Spain and I have first - hand knowledge of organising sports and activities .
We could learn new activities from each other .
Nevertheless , I realize this is not the ideal reference .
See my curriculum vitae , enclosed , for more details .
I would love to answer any question you could ask at this email address , qq@gmail.com , and this mobile phone number , 666666666 . I would be delighted to attend an interview whenever suits you .
Yours faithfully ,
They can barely breath with all those photographers around them .
It can really damage someone 's reputation .
For example , when a fan follows a cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredictable , or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
My opinion is , that famous people deserve a quiet time , when they are with their partners or with family , but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym .
Years ago , we used to get through to other people by ringing them up or texting messages via our mobile phone and , as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate via social networks such as Twitter , Facebook , Whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news and social issues via Twitter instead of newspapers , for instance . It 's common to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings the news on their smartphone , an image so far from years back .
We also can have more knowledge about current issues via Facebook pages , which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes , such as political discussions , strikes , the economy ... As far I am concerned , the present - day population knows more about what 's going on in the world than in previous years .
One example of this could be North Korea or some Arab countries , where their governments ban internet access for citizens . In other words , they want to mislead the people about reality to avoid the population claiming via these networks or being up in arms against their system .
On the other hand , we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends via Facebook , uploading photos at any time , having a coffee , watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere .
So , this means we are getting less intimate and becoming more gossipy at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow your favourite celebrities and have direct interaction , but this also has negative consequences such as some followers criticise them .
Michael Xander is the famous team captain of Onix University , one of the most prestigious schools in the Philippines .
He has everything : the looks , the brains and the charm , but he has never felt contented .
Everything has been easy for him , he is used to getting what he wants .
She was starstruck .
This guy actually asked her out and she 's not that stupid not to know his intentions .
She had just challenged him .
Since then , everything had gone so perfectly between the two of them .
Celine realised that Michael was not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael 's reputation .
Tears automatically fell down her face .
Everything Michael had done for her was just for a bet .
He just loved that girl so much that he wanted to protect her from everything .
His eyes looked automatically at how Celine looked today .
Celine came in and kissed him aggressively .
Everything felt amazing and beautiful .
I know everything .
Everything was just a bet , right ? ' Celine said .
Everything that happened between us was too good to be true .
These days , shopping is one of the most important parts of life .
The very first reason for my disagreement is that I do not have enough money to purchase everything that I would like to buy .
Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and , furthermore , it gives me a great amount of sadness .
The next thing about unpleasant shopping is enormous lines .
The last , but not least , reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a long way to a store in which I can buy everything I want .
Of course , I could go to a few different shops , but without a driving license , travelling is a tough task .
Architects , builders , painters and sculptors were brought from Europe by ship as well as all the construction materials that were necessary for its building .
It is a sophisticated building , full of details everywhere around the theater , from the floor to the ceiling , everything carefully designed according to that period .
The place set out important concerts , presentations and international festivals still nowadays .
During the rubber age , there was no urban life around the building , which is completely different from today , of course , since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater , that are the same age as the theater and it is surrounded by art galleries , pubs , offices , houses , restaurants , where groups of friends , tourists and families usually go to appreciate the breeze at the end of a warm day and during the night .
In big cities , there 's a similar sport called basketball and this one is more for boys .
Every Monday we meet in the sports hall in Mandach .
You can find more information also on the Internet .
However , the lecturer points out the problems in all his assertions .
In contrast , the professor argues that it was impossible that they were weapons because they show no damage .
Nevertheless , the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible .
Last but not least , the author asserts that the stone balls might serve a social purpose .
Science is developing very quickly and nowadays scientists are discovering new things .
I think people will not go out of their homes to buy goods and food or clothes , because professional robots will be invented and they will do anything that you want , and they will obey your orders .
However , this could cause a problem for humans and some people will face the threat of compulsory redundancies .
I assume that another problem will be robots , because little by little they will capture the world and they will become human 's enemy , and that would be one of the possibilities in the future .
In conclusion , I would say that developing is not very good for humankind , and little by little the world will be demolished by human errors .
' The Go - between ' by L.P.Hartley
This is an original and moving love story that has people who are against the relationship between the main characters .
Leo is a kind of popular boy at school as he invents special spells and shows them to his schoolmates , but everything he knows changes when he 's invited to the house of Marcus , who is his classmate at school .
So , there he meets the gorgeous eldest sister of Marcus and he immediately falls in love and from then the go - between appears in the story .
This paper is a review of scientific research , including magazines , newspapers , websites and others , with the purpose of exploring ecotourism , presenting the tourist attractions and beaches to people , in order to call it to their attention in relation to commercial promotion and local development , where a lot of people do not know the natural beauties of our city .
Warning the responsible departments how much they can do for the city in relation to employment opportunities , tourist attractions , environmental education , ecological preservation and make it the best tourist city in Litoral Paulista .
Through marketing and advertising , we want to encourage young people who enjoy surfing the dissemination of the best beaches of this city to practise it with others that may have .
Preserving , exploring the trails and beaches , encouraging extreme sports are what we believe are attractive to tourists of this wonderful coastal city .
Key words : ecotourism , marketing , track , the Guarujá beaches , tourism .
In today 's world people use public transport for every kind of travel .
Nevertheless , travelling by car could pose a real threat to public transport because it is much more comfortable .
Firstly , having a car makes travelling much easier .
A car offers comfort because you can personalise your space and your ride .
However , public transport is not threatened by the car .
First of all , too many cars make towns crowded and create traffic jams , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one car makes as much pollution as one bus which transports many more people .
It is about an ordinary young woman who has everything she needs in life .
This book is very exciting because there are a lot of things that are happening and it 's not monotonous at all .
Recently , I saw an advertisement for a job .
I have taken courses in the last 2 months with an organization that organizes activities for children aged between one and 15 .
This organization taught us how to deal with children , and how to make their lives happier and more joyful .
In addition , we were also taught how to organize sports and activities for them in a way they will enjoy .
I believe that I am suitable for this job as I have broad experience in what is required . I would be on top of the world if you allowed me to be part of the team .
Everything happened that summer I spent in Egypt .
My mother had found a new job in some ancient ruins , right in the middle of the desert . I should mention that she was an important archaeologist , known all over the world , and she had to travel to every corner on Earth .
I used to spend my whole holidays at my grandparents ' country house , surrounded by green fields , forest and rivers , but when I turned eighteen my mother thought I was old enough to take a plane on my own and stay with her for a month .
On the other hand , the taxi did n't even have air conditioning , so I spent the two hours of the journey trying to fan myself with a magazine I borrowed from the driver .
I reached the hotel well in the afternoon . Nevertheless , the air was still oppressive and hot like at midday .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give some tips for tourist who come to the city . I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping for clothes in the city , as well as some recommendations .
In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes . You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if you are a shopaholic , it will be worth it .
Linda is a modern shop where you can find the latest fashion in Milano and luxury accessories from the most well - known companies .
If the idea of a street market does not seduce you , I recommend you visit a little shop in Saint Peter street , The Old Bag , where you can buy bags and other accessories , such as umbrellas , gloves and scarfs .
Recommendations
I suggest a quick visit to every shop and making comparisons of price and quality .
This is a short report which will include my recommendation of the most interesting places in my town for them to enjoy .
In the " Culture Centre " , your young visitors will be able to attend daily cultural activities , such as theater , cinema and drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Centre " , they will have an opportunity to take part in many sports activities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics and karate classes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months , I suggest that they should enrol in a Polish language course .
It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish at least at a basic level .
The course would be three times a week only , and fully paid by the Polish government .
In short , a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience for your students .
Every year , in my house , we play the same role : my mother and my sister prepare different dishes for Christmas dinner , and I am highly likely to be the one responsible for carrying those dishes from the kitchen to the dining room , because the rest of the family is lost in their conversations trying to save the world .
It was an unforgettable moment . I was looking at her , slightly excited because she was eating alone without help and fast , which was and still is , unusual coming from her .
If there were more buses or trains at any time ( also in the night ) , it would be convenient to use them and to leave the car in the garage .
Unfortunately , it 's not possible because of the costs that the Economic System would be compelled to support .
So , people often prefer using the car and paying for petrol instead of a bus ticket because of having more advantages : not being forced to wait for the buses and not having to take a taxi in the night when they come back from the disco , for example .
It 's a cheap service and it 's greatly appreciated by people who need a car not every day and only for a little time .
The Internship , a film by Shawn Levy with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn .
In the beginning , one of them looks for a job by asking his sister 's boyfriend , but fortunately , his friend convinces him to find another job .
They send their CVs .
Of course , they are much older than the other candidates , and when the staff check their CVs only one member confirmed their candidature .
Despite everything , they could take part in the competition .
The Google agency invites a lot of people and declares that only one group will have the possibility to win .
Of course , when the groups arrange themselves , the two old men remain alone and they are forced to create a group with the discards .
Of course , on paper , this group does n't have a chance , but events demonstrate something different .
This film is interesting because it drafts work problems , but not only this , it also shows some important values , like the importance of solidarity , group cohesion and the importance of not losing faith in dreams , even if the situation is withstands .
Of course , there are also negative observations about this film . For example , there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story . They are n't interesting and they last too long .
In addition , some situations in the film are taken from High School Movie .
In conclusion , this film is plain and a little discounted but , at the same time , a light and funny film to watch during the summer with some friends .
It may help you to choose what to study at university , as I know you haven't decided yet .
If you do n't like this idea , there is an excellent website which offers a lot of jobs and maybe you will find something interesting .
The rest are artists or good workers .
It must be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to ask question or to take photos .
If something changes in your life it will be a news item on television , and people will invent rumours about you .
There are celebrities that sell their life on television and then do not want journalists to chase them .
There are other famous people who do not appear on television and they are chased by reporters .
This is because something new has occurred and they want to collect information .
It is impossible to have a private life if you are a celebrity , because people who love you want to know about your private life .
To summarize , if you expose yourself on television you will not have a private life .
I would like to apply for the job of instructor in the USA Summer Camp as advertised in the newspaper .
Last winter I worked as a coach for my basketball team with kids about ten years old .
I have training in basketball and Physical Education .
Moreover , I am very active and hardworking , as you request .
Also , I feel that I can be a positive incorporation in the Summer Camps .
The house in which we will live in the future will be full of complicated - to - use computers and robots .
Robots will , of course , be remarkable , which will help us with everyday chores , for instance , by cooking delicious dishes , cleaning everything in the house or even washing and ironing clothes .
To be perfectly honest , every human being dreams of the home of the future and every dream is individual , but in the future , will our dreams come true ?
If you want to visit some interesting place or building , you should go to our zoo , which is near Zlín in Lešná .
In the chateau there is an exhibition of snakes and spiders .
It 's a beautiful place for all generations in nature and you can spend all day there .
If you were hungry , there are some restaurants and fast food restaurants .
It is argued that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
To illustrate my point of view I want to give some examples .
First of all , being on the covers of newspapers and magazines helps them make themselves more attractive to directors .
The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable , because popularity gives the possibility to earn more money .
Honestly , I do not like nature programmes so much because they are so boring !
I personally like sports programmes and comedy shows , because I love sports and also enjoy having a good laugh .
My favourite TV shows are " Hablemos de Football " , " Sports Center " , " Fox Sport " and " The Simpsons " . All these except " The Simpsons " are about sports , mainly football , basketball and rugby .
And as a sports lover I am glad to be informed about the latest matches of the international leagues like the " NBA " , " Premium League " and also the " National League " because of my deep love of sports .
I watch some football matches repetitions and comedy shows .
Jabalpur(M.P )
to your engagement party .
You are very lucky in choosing a life partner . I have seen your life partner . She is so beautiful . You both have a perfect match .
You are like Romeo and juliett . But I am really sorry I am not coming to the engagement party because my mother has been admitted to the hospital .
I think you will understand my situation .
Please send me some engagement photographs .
Talk to me via video conferencing after the party .
I enjoyed the summer holiday , it was entertaining and I usually travelled around Hong Kong with my family during the weekends .
I usually woke up at around nine o'clock in the morning and spent the day reading newspapers and books , and also digitalized some video tapes .
I enjoy reading newspapers so I can get updates on the latest developments and news .
Furthermore , it can also improve my language skills .
I usually watch television programs on the Discovery Network at night .
Besides , I find those programs talking about building massive structures and science interesting and I gained some knowledge from those programs .
To get prepared for the things to be taught in grade 9 , I also flipped through some textbooks , including Integrated Science , Geography , etc .
And I find the knowledge to be taught in some subjects interesting , while some is n't .
As I am a member of the Robotics Team , I went to school for 3 days during the summer holiday to prepare for a competition on fourth of October .
Despite the hard work , I enjoyed the process of preparing for the competition a lot .
We are looking for better conditions everywhere .
First of all is traffic jams ; if you are stuck in a traffic jam in a big bus you will waste much more time than you expected on the road . Besides , public transport is overcrowded in rush hours . Another downside is that most buses are old and dirty .
That 's why people choose to travel by car , because it is more convenient and faster .
Green And Clean Environment
Introduction
The aim of this report is to explain the way our Community have decided to preserve the environment of our town and which other activities could be useful in order to achieve this purpose .
On the one hand , if you belong to a school , you can participate by giving information to the children about the catastrophic image our village would have if we did not reduce the pollution to the minimum range .
On the other hand , everyone has the opportunity to clean the streets where they spend most of their time .
Nobody needs to be worried about the vacuum or the broom because it is provided by the Government .
If you do not have time to help with those kinds of activities , there is a rule you must follow .
Recommendations
My recommendation is to invest in a good cleaning machine , consequently we will not have to spend hours cleaning the streets .
A high number of tourists visit Cáceres searching for culture , heritage and typical food from Extremadura .
For that reason , this town has a lot of facilities to meet that demand and to offer a good time too .
The most attractive resource in Cáceres is its heritage .
One of the most characteristic things about this region is the food and Cáceres is the top city of gastronomy in Europe .
" Atrio " is the most important restaurant in the city and it has been recognised with two stars by the most famous guide for restaurants in Spain .
Anyway , " Atrio " is not just a fine food restaurant , but it is a five - star hotel in the middle of the old town .
Pintores Street is the commercial place of the city and it has a great selection of shops and restaurants with typical food from Spain .
Garlic is a plant , a member of the lily family , with a characteristic odor and taste .
It has been known in human history since at least 3000 B.C. In many cultures , garlic is associated with superstitions , bringing bad or good luck .
The slaves , who constructed the pyramids , were fed with garlic , because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger , so they could work harder .
At the present time , modern science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption on human health .
Experiments carried out with garlic and some types of bacteria , revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria .
Therefore , the bactericidal effect of garlic can probably explain some ancients ' beliefs that this plant could help in some illness treatments .
Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic on the blood system .
It was demonstrated that garlic has a compound that can make the blood " thinner " .
Therefore , including garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health , as some cultures believed .
How many of us today are really into helping the environment ?
Is it worth all the time , energy and money spent on convincing people to be responsible for their environment ?
I recently joined a campaign program in Manila , Philippines , dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources .
I was very enthusiastic in all the activities until after one event .
I found out that the leaders of this organization were not realizing the beliefs and principles they were imparting to the public .
They were not a good representation of their ideals .
I backed off and decided to just continue to make my personal contribution to helping mother earth .
Maybe we can not convince the whole world to participate in helping the environment right away , but it can begin with ourselves .
I have been living an environment - friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago .
This does n't just save me from excessive gasoline expenses , but it also made me physically fit .
Fourthly , I only buy organic products for consumption and keep a small spice garden in my backyard .
And finally , I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing in order to help our environment .
All in all , I think that helping our environment does n't have to be a big deal . We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable and irrevocable .
That is a small start , but it will eventually reap a huge outcome .
To begin with , I would like to tell you that I am really interested in the course because I think it would provide me with some professional advantages in my career as a school teacher .
Learning languages is increasingly important in the teaching sector , so I want to improve it .
I think my weak points are speaking and listening skills . Nevertheless , I would also be interested in working over writing and grammar points .
Although I am in my late forties I am still very active , so I like practising sports , music and going to the cinema as well .
Michael is an American guy , living and studying in the Netherlands at Leiden University .
He has been living in the Netherlands for about a year .
One day , he went out with a couple of friends . They went to a night club called " Miami beach " . They were dancing and having fun and then he saw a beautiful girl and she could n't take her eyes off him , so he decided to go and talk to her .
Without a second thought I decided to follow the directions on the puzzling map .
The directions took me along a path towards a cave and I went into it .
I had been well prepared and I carried a lantern .
I am writing in connection with your stay in Cracow .
I know you 're looking for an interesting place to visit , so I want to offer you a place where you can rest , have a lot of fun and have a great time with your group .
I want to recommend the amusement park , one of the most interesting places to visit here .
On the face of it , it sounds childish , but I think it 's a good way to spend free time , even for adults .
This is a huge amusement park with many attractions for young people looking for excitement .
Yours faithfully ,
First and foremost , the bank notes should be designed and the design includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Next is the preparation of metal plates .
In this step , skilled machinists are required .
dispatched .
The difference is , the good part will be kept while the bad part will be destroyed .
So , I tried to translate your French on Google translator and I could n't understand what you meant about my English and Google translator . I 'm used to writing English and I at am intermediate level .
I use Google translator to find an equivalent word to a Spanish word sometimes .
It is n't easy at all , they 're very different languages , and I prefer to use the software " Grammarly spellchecker " to get some help .
There is a new and stunning generation of basketball players .
He 's improving his game in a spectacular way .
It is n't only that he 's a very good player ( He is :D ) , but also , thanks to his style of play , his assists , and points have served as a lever to his team , which has improved dramatically .
He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old , and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old .
His current team is preparing him physically in the gym . His physical form has improved a lot and now he is faster , stronger and he 's still 23 years old .
Watching him play is a delight , especially his assists and juggling games while he looks in the opposite direction .
The " Di Roma restaurant " is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village , " Monção " . It is very popular with teenagers and adults who love to eat pizza or any other fast food .
As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting , a lot of paintings of the city .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best - quality ingredients .
The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the region , which are very popular around the country .
I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours .
For this reason , I highly recommend going to Di Roma restaurant .
Firstly , it is very good for the environment because it reduces a lot of carbon dioxide gas which , if everybody took their car instead of taking public transport , would pollute the atmosphere .
Secondly , travelling on public transport makes it much easier to travel in rush hours or in those periods in which you should not take your car .
Finally , it is a good way of travelling because it is safer than travelling in a car or on a motorbike and also because you are much more relaxed than in a car and it saves time , too .
To conclude , public transport is good for the environment , it makes it much easier and cheaper to travel , and it , in some ways , saves lives .
It 's some kilometers outside of it .
It 's a big country and does n't have many inhabitants .
But they also were the ones that first discovered Greenland , North America and Asia .
Most people in Sweden are Christians .
The climate in Sweden can be very cold , especially in the northern parts of Sweden .
Most people go to high school and university .
He 's one of the best football players in the world and is really popular both in Sweden and in other countries , especially in Europe .
After the handover in 1997 , it became a special administrative region of China .
From the 1980 's , it has been developed as an international financial centre and so many global investors have set up their headquarters there .
For education , every developed country is concerned with the issue .
The Hong Kong government has invested lots of capital in developing a better education system to build a knowledge - based society and a better future .
As mentioned , Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China , whose systems and laws are different from Mainland China .
Residents in Hong Kong are enjoying a high level of freedom in religion , speech , organization , activities , going abroad during their life .
Owing to those separate characteristics , actually , Hong Kong can be described as a colourful and brilliant city .
Going places is of paramount importance for people , and going quickly even more so ; that 's why I think public transport is not the most efficient way to go places .
The use of public transport takes more time than using a car , which can be considered as a waste of time .
All this makes using a car much more convenient , due to the fact that not only do you leave when you want , but also straightaway from the very door of your own house .
When you go by car you can control your timing , stop at will , and if you go with someone else , it may be cheaper : provided the cost of the journey will be the same , no matter how many passengers you take with you , while on public transport you have to pay for a ticket for every single passenger .
Anyway , to tell you the truth , I 'd rather take a train . For instance , it means travelling in a relaxing way , not running risks of accidents , having the chance to read or play " travel " chess , meeting new people , like on a stage coach but moving faster .
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which appeared in this month 's edition of EnglishAcademy magazine .
As you will see from my enclosed CV , I have worked the last three years as a personal assistant to the director of a well - known international company based in London while I am finishing my part - time degree in Modern Languages ( English - German ) .
Throughout my work history and studies , I have displayed excellent teamwork and people - oriented skills , which I believe are crucial skills in an administrative position .
I have also worked under pressure and met deadlines without any problems , because I am used to being resourceful and managing time efficiently .
In terms of my suitability for reception and administrative roles , I am organized , amiable and helpful .
In addition , I have excellent customer service skills and am highly efficient in the use of computers in a wide variety of applications .
Therefore , I consider myself competent and optimistic to respond to the challenge offered by the post of receptionist in your language school .
I would genuinely welcome the opportunity of an invitation to work for your language school .
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information or to arrange a personal meeting .
Yours faithfully
I do n't know what I have to say , but the only thing that I know is that my English pronunciation is not very good .
I want to improve my English pronunciation skills so I will be able to understand native speakers .
I have an American girlfriend and she is very fluent in English because it is her mother tongue .
I want to be fluent so she can understand what I want to tell her .
Now I have decided to improve my writing skills , because once they have improved , I will be very happy and I think that my ideas ' expression will be good .
I think that my pronunciation will be good when I can speak for a long period of time and in all situations .
Thank you for sending me the corrected form of my writing , and I really appreciate that very much .
He completed his studies six years ago , but since then he has been unable to find proper employment in his country .
Therefore , he decided to migrate , looking for better job opportunities .
After a complex and difficult journey , Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coast in 2011 . Helped by the Senegalese community , he eventually found a job as a fruit seller in a local market .
Despite his high qualified studies in education , Mohamed had to do a job in a completely different field .
The phenomenon of the immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last decades .
However , nowadays , even in rich Western Europe , many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find employment .
This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other countries .
Such a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools , which has failed to adapt to the changes brought about in society by globalization .
Therefore , once graduated , qualified young people find themselves facing both the economic crisis and a hostile job market .
I believe that governments of different countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and , therefore , contribute to exacerbating the impact of the economic crisis .
I go cycling and running regularly so I think I could describe myself as a sportswoman .
I am a passionate reader , in particular of thrillers and French poetry .
Therefore , I think this experience of three months could offer me a unique chance to grow as a person and better understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent .
I think this experience is the challenge that I need in order to become more mature and responsible .
Therefore , I would be more than willing to share this experience with another student .
As on the 6th of September there will be the university entry test for Medicine , I will have to fly back to Italy for a couple of days .
Last year , I did some graphic design for the website of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addition , last year , I participated in a work placement at the ASL in Rivoli .
I am going to repeat the experience in March at the local hospital .
Because , when we decide to go shopping and we have an idea what we want to buy and it appears that we ca n't find what we want , we are disappointed and frustrated .
Sometimes , shopping - particularly for women - is the best way to improve their mood .
Unfortunately , shopping can also bring displeasure .
Because everybody drives their cars and motorcycles on the roads , the traffic jams will not only be a serious problem for the government but will also be a safety problem for citizens .
Therefore , the government need to introduce a good traffic policy to ensure citizens ' safety and welfare of have the privilege of driving on the road .
As a result , I think traveling only by car is not a wise choice for the earth , although it is convenient .
But we need to think that there is a better way to protect the earth and humans ' environment , such as riding a bicycle or waiting for an environmentally - friendly car to be invented .
People 's lifestyles have changed completely in the past 20 years .
Even though there are more and more cars on the roads , I do not think this tendency will completely reduce the demand for public transportation for the following reasons :
There are many people who have experienced a car crash , or are just simply afraid of driving , so they prefer to use public transport .
Not to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers ' lives and it is less about convenience , even if travelling by car means you do n't need to deal with other passengers .
I 'm from Ecuador , a country surrounded by a great number of natural resources .
We are an underdeveloped country , as other countries say , a " third world country " , but I 'm happy about that .
We see what they really are ; the underdeveloped countries that they are .
Recently , my country has started to develop its resources , our renewable energy , such as wind , solar , hydro - electric power , geothermal energy .
Starting to develop our nation is in effect starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment .
Traditional energies are focused on giving all the resources to big cities .
Also , it is a big opportunity to help them .
They need resources to improve their living conditions until my country has the possibility to give them better opportunities .
It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is in big cities , without looking after and helping the surroundings .
Nowadays , my country has started to build a great number of hydroelectric and wind parks and we are also starting to think about geothermal energy .
But I think one thing is necessary before implementing these types of energies .
All of them require further studies to be done and , with that , we could find out the feasibility of the projects and the size of them .
Implementation takes time and money , but if the project does not work , all of that could be spent in vain .
Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then building large constructions to extract them .
Sustainability is about finding the best way to interact with the environment .
It is like making friends with nature and finding out what it needs of us and showing it what we need of it .
Trying to take care of it , extracting only the necessary and trying to cause the least possible damage .
Starting to an take interest in alternative energy and trying to see ways to use it in your native country is the first step .
The implementation of projects does not need to be only about spending money .
Done in a good way , the implementation of projects helps to improve citizens ' lives .
All those little steps help our nation to build a developed country that is environmentally friendly .
It makes it mandatory for the inter - city buses , commercial vehicles and other heavy vehicles to use Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) instead of diesel .
It encourages people to plant more trees and cutting them has been made a punishable offence .
Burning of leaves and other waste products has also been made a punishable offence .
A large number of huge capacity waste treatment plants have been established to keep the city clean and green .
Recently , for the protection of the environment , the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehicles more than 15 years old .
Gradually , people in the city are becoming cautious with respect to the environment and they are trying their best to keep it clean and safe .
People are inculcating the habit of disposing of garbage at a defined place .
They are conserving rain water using a rain water harvesting process .
They are trying to reduce dependency on private vehicles and switching to public modes of transport .
Installation of solar heaters , solar lights , using solar cell watches and driving electric cars are in vogue in the city .
There are four main characters : the hotel owner , a moody man and his bossy wife , and the workers , a pleasant maid and a Spanish waiter who does n't speak English .
In every episode , new clients go to this hotel and have a lot of crazy , funny and sarcastic situations , between workers , owners and customers .
Particularly when the owner gives orders to the waiter , these situations become hilarious .
As technology develops rather rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon now for us to find that large - scale buildings and transport networks are to be built for the sake of human economy , which means vast areas of farmland , forest and wetland are on the way to being ruined .
First of all , the environment that belongs to both man and wildlife is going to lose balance in the ecosystem .
It means that more kinds of species are endangered because they are unable to adapt themselves to the remaining land .
The planting of vegetables and other food on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of humans may not be met one day .
Moreover , with the decreasing number of trees and many other plants , carbon dioxide can not be coped with by those natural machines , which will melt the remaining ice in the world .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's critical for governments to take measures to reduce the problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principles should be put in place to forbid extravagant expansion in the natural system .
In addition , supervision of the protecting steps needs to be undertaken by the government .
What 's more , the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually , no matter whether it 's on campus or in public places .
Anyway , the key to protecting our living environment from being destroyed is to do it as individuals , step by step .
I 'm looking for a language centre which prepares students to take the Cambridge exams , especially the F.C.E. On reading the newspaper , I 've learned about your classes and your method seems efficient .
I am interested in applying for one - on - one classes in order to study in the most efficient way I can .
Please could you give me more information about it as soon as possible in order to book in quickly .
yours faithfully ,
Anyway , the man was wearing an orange costume , he was surprisingly tall and slim and he was completely bald except for a long black ponytail coming out of his head .
UNFORGETTABLE FRIEND
She was quiet , but interesting at the same time .
We are different , but I think that that is a curious thing about friendship .
8 years later , she has become my best friend , my lost sister , my complement .
She was hard to find , but impossible to forget .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had forgotten he had a doctor 's appointment and he was running late .
He finishes getting ready for his appointment .
How could he forget the time of his appointment ?
He still needs to find an ATM to withdraw some money to pay for his appointment .
On the other hand , public transport is inconvenient .
Pickpockets can have a field day with all the commotion of rush hour .
Furthermore , there are certain forms of transport , such as trains , that do not travel to the suburbs , so people either have to walk long distances to reach the nearest stop or be dependent on one form of public transport to catch another , which can be a great source of stress if there is ever a delay .
There are many dogs who are more loyal and trustworthy than many people on the earth .
For example , my friend has a dog . One day when they were on his farm .
For that reason , I appreciate my pets as if they are my friends .
Secondly , the reason for my tendency to treat pets as family members , is that they have souls .
Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered like human friends .
Many people talk with their pets as if they understand them .
One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pet as if they are their psychiatrist .
After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness ,
I would argue that treating our pets as our friends is an indication of humanity .
They can take care of us and love us in a very interesting way .
I am writing to you with reference to your advertisement which I saw in the " Daily News " .
I am sixteen years of age , pursuing a degree of Intermediate at Imperial College , keen to work .
I would love to arrange fun activities for children .
I have gained some experience of working with children while baby - sitting my cousins last year .
I would feel relieved if you would let me know about the commencement of the program as I can travel this month and the salary offered per week .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if any further information is required .
Yours faithfully ,
My work was very interesting and exciting .
Unfortunately , my scholarship was ending and I was thinking about returning home .
I hung up the phone and I went out to celebrate the moment with my colleagues .
Unfortunately , the process only works for twelve hours .
Our goal was to increase the storage capacity to several days .
We built a pilot plant to test our investigations in the laboratory .
The public authorities helped us when we showed our solutions .
We are going to build an industrial plant to achieve our dream : storing renewable energy without using toxic materials and mining resources from the Earth .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
However , Peter decided to turn down Tommy 's invitation , and continue to do his homework .
He was frustrated .
Maybe the day itself would n't be extraordinary , but , for sure , she would remember it all her life .
The day before , all the clothes which were inside the suitcase had been laid out on the bed : trousers , spring t - shirts , nightdresses and so on .
She was doing all the routine activities automatically , thinking of her next journey .
She was brave and intelligent , so she was going to start a new life with new opportunities in a different and fairer country .
They think that a famous person has a marvellous life with no problems , no duties or worries .
But people should realize , that there are many advantages and disadvantages to being celebrities .
As far as I 'm concerned , there are more disadvantages .
They ca n't go to the cinema or theatre , or just go for a walk without being recognised .
No matter where a famous person goes , he must realize that , next day , he will be on the front page of the newspapers with lots of rumours .
Celebrities do n't have an easy life .
Because , what is proper in living when journalists are following every step the famous person takes ?
In my opinion , journalists and other people should accept and respect it and sometimes they should just let go .
Nevertheless , celebrities decided on that kind of life .
So , I think that they must have known about the consequences and should just live as they like .
I have seen the advertisement for the vacancy in your cafe in the local newspaper and would like to apply for this position .
I am a 22-year - old part - time student of the local university .
I have had two previous jobs .
The first was in a bar owned by my uncle , and the second , in a local restaurant named " Dragon " ( Chinese cuisine ) .
I am an accurate , punctual and trustworthy person .
My employers have never complained about my work .
I resigned from my last employment because the restaurant was closed for a long refurbishment .
I am also ready to work longer shifts on Wednesdays , and on Fridays and Saturdays I can work extra time .
If you need any references , I can request them from the University Student Center and from my last employer . I am available to start work next week .
My mobile number is 0789999999 .
The Colosseum is the most famous and biggest building of Ancient Rome and it is also the biggest amphitheater in the World .
The name of this construction is related to two reasons : one reason is related to the dimensions of the building ; the second reason is because near there is a bronze statue .
And it was inaugurated in 80 a .
The name Colosseum spread only in the Middle Ages . In ancient times it was used for gladiator shows and for other public shows .
The Colosse was often restored because it was often in difficult situations .
Finally , I can say that the Colosseum is a fantastic building as much for beauty as for importance , and if a tourist is coming to Italy for the first time he should see the Colosseum .
I wish to express my dissatisfaction with this course .
We felt hot and we had no refreshment facilities .
Never have I seen such a lack of organization .
When we complained to the course teacher , we were told that things did not depend on him .
Yours faithfully ,
My perfect hotel would be near to the beach , on the Mediterranean coast , because in this area there are many tourists .
The hotel would have many services and facilities , like a good reception , spa , wifi connection and pay - per - view TV in the rooms , a great chef who cooked the dishes of the Mediterranean cuisine , a swimming pool , a bar on the beach and a boat for trips around the Mediterranean sea .
This is the hotel of my dreams , but the most important thing is that the people are happy in their accommodation . If they are happy they will return next year .
The performance turned out to be enjoyable , with a lot of witty jokes .
The acting was surprisingly emotional , but a bit wooden .
After the show , I was introduced to one of the actors , who was my friend 's cousin .
His answer astonished me ; he did not want to become a professional actor .
Moreover , he found being famous extremely irritating .
I , like most people , took for granted that celebrities not only seek fame , but also benefit from it .
They experience gracious living , enjoy glitzy parties and admire their photos in glossy magazines .
Paparazzi make public their day - to - day routine , hobbies and passions .
When it turns out that all the people we got used to idolising are just people with their own shortcomings , we become disappointed .
We watch mercilessly how celebrities topple from their thrones and even find pleasure in that .
Why do n't we want to give people entertaining us a chance to be themselves and to have a real private life ?
I love MASTERCHEF .
It 's one of the best TV cooking programmes that I have ever seen and I absolutely agree with you when you say that this programme promotes individual and collective work .
I have a friend who went to MASTERCHEF and he taught the amateur cooks how to make bread .
He told me that it was an exciting experience .
I think that you give us a lot of information about the programme , and your opinion about it is very interesting .
They are more beautiful and popular than him , all the girls are in love with them and all boys would pay to attend their parties , including Michael and his friends , who were always excluded .
In the end , the party turned out a success . For Michael it was the beginning of his popularity .
But the house was destroyed and the neighbours , furred for the confusion caused during the night , had called the police , who , without his knowledge , were waiting outside the house to take him to the police station .
After everything that had happened , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I 've just finished my teaching degree and I have experience in schools . Could you send me a webpage where I can find more information about how to apply for a job in the UK ?
I think that it could be a great opportunity to improve my English skills and learn lots of things about the UK culture .
I would like to save some money , and at the end of my UK experience , spend my time travelling around your country .
Is it interesting ?
Could you tell me the most important attractions around your city ?
Send me some tourist information if you have some .
In a family , responsibilities increase with age . I have some , but not a lot .
Nowadays , environmental issues have become a great concern for scientists , as the problem is growing .
What can people do every day to help the environment ?
Water and electricity are wasted day after day , while a little change in people 's habits can make a difference .
okay , let us get back to the decorating .
She always believed in such premonitions .
She quickly packed her handbag and ran out to catch a bus to university .
Many people choose to go travelling to relax .
Going travelling , people may schedule various destinations and times .
For the above reasons , car travel is the best choice .
Unlike public transportation , there is no limit on your route , no fixed timetable for car travel .
Car travel makes people feel free during the journey .
Most of the time , pets are not allowed to be on public transportation , which is not a good thing for a pet owner .
Above all , car travel is not only convenient , but also free in your journey , which leads public transportation to a fading future .
The concept of beauty has changed since people started thinking they need to be thin to be pretty .
She has always looked for perfection .
Sandrine always skips it because she thinks it is unnecessary if she wants to be thin .
I had never felt so nervous when , about six months ago , I finally decided to sit the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) exam .
Because I had decided to take my exam in June , it was absolutely necessary to enrol in an English preparation course as soon as possible .
So , I had started to learn English very frequently and pretty hard .
Very soon I had recognized that the process of learning was not as easy as I thought .
But I am a really lucky person . I found a good teacher who supported me all the time . I also had some classmates who had the same aims as mine .
We met to study frequently .
We organized some additional activities , such as an English movies night , a one day trip to London , and a book discussion about English writers and poets .
Because we did n't live in any English speaking country , we tried as much as possible to create an English - speaking environment .
Today is a big day for me and my classmates .
I want to be an expert in such areas as drilling , exploitation and development of oilfields . That is why I want to get a master 's degree abroad , or a PhD at my university .
I think I have the appropriate background , my GPA is good enough .
Besides that , throughout my university education , I have been a participant at scientific conferences and I took pains to practically assimilate everything I had learnt during my studies .
For example , I have successfully completed the " Offshore Drilling " course of " Total " Professors Association and I mean to broaden my outlook in the future .
The main attraction here is absolutely the beach .
I hope everything is great back in Sweden . See you soon !
There 's going to be a competition for a month , with excellent prizes .
The magazine also has a letters page and they pay $ 25 for the most interesting letter or email .
Subject : Opinion on what young people are interested in
Date : 27.10.2015
about what young people are interested in today .
First of all , our generation of young people are more
Television series
programmes young people like to watch .
It soothes them , calms them , aggravates them , excites them .
clothes , not too hippy , but something comfortable .
time , then I suggest some other style . It has to be comfortable but
give those people a good international festival .
With reference to your recent ad about weekend cafe work . I am interested in applying .
I enjoy cooking and am interested in different kinds of food , especially Asian cuisine .
I have experience of cooking and reception for parties / functions as I was a member of the School Parents Association of my children 's school .
As a member , on many occasions , such as Christmas Party and School Open Day , I had opportunities to learn about different kinds of food from other members as well as providing reception duties .
I really enjoyed answering parents ' enquiries and introducing them to our school .
These was invaluable and relevant experience for the job I am applying for .
Whether movies and TV programs made in our own country are more interesting than movies and programs made in other countries has been widely discussed .
To begin with , foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating .
Although the plots are full of twists , they are still very realistic and do not make their audience feel that the plots are very strange .
For example , in the first 3D movie , Avatar , the movie maker spent a lot of energy and time on developing a novel movie genre .
It eventually made a very good impression on its audience , and , most importantly for a commercial movie , it really did very well at the box office .
Additionally , people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies .
Furthermore , foreign TV programs are more international and educational .
What 's more , the National Geographic and Discovery channels also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I ca n't learn from domestic programs .
However , I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture , or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain , they can get more reflection as recreating .
Plus , watching foreign programs also could help those people attain their goal -- relaxation .
In sum , although there are some dissenting views , one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs .
With an intense passion for fashion , I aspire to become a professional product merchandiser in the apparel industry and set up my own branding business with my older sister and her husband .
Both of whom have more than five years of experience in marketing planning and own a large number of fabric sources .
Therefore , I plan to maximize my previous experience with knowledge of psychology , product development skills and design , to pursue graduate studies , and build up my ability in the Master of Fine Arts program in fashion merchandising at Academy of Art University .
It is said that the main objective of television is to entertain people and make their free time happier .
However , television should n't be used only for this purpose but for different reasons .
On the one hand , most people have , at least , one television in their homes , so it is very accessible to everyone .
For this reason , instead of entertaining , television should offer educative programmes .
They are used to managing different technologies like televisions or computers .
I think that children ca n't be supervised by their parents all the time because they have to work and do household tasks .
For this reason , it is important for them to have a good educative programme on television .
I am not saying that television has to educate our children , but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things like numbers or letters .
Television is very important for giving language skills to children .
When I was young , I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things like geography or maths and it helped me a lot .
Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation topic to talk about with friends .
In particular , every week you can find " Il panino più " , a special roll created by the imagination of the cook .
Of course , I prefer to go to this pub with my family or with my friends , especially if I have something to celebrate , for example , birthdays , anniversaries or something else .
I remember when one of my daughters celebrated her eighteenth birthday , the pub 's owner put the number eighteen , made of cheese on a roll , with a little candle .
They have many different cakes : profiterols , meringata , tiramisù and so on .
Especially with their mothers , girlfriends or wives .
But women also think that shopping can be an unpleasant experience .
Particularly when we talk about everyday running from shop to shop to buy lettuce , meat or toothpaste .
It can be really frustrating .
But when we think about going to the shopping centre with our friends it can be fun . We do n't even have to have money , because we can just go and do window shopping .
Without spending money , we can get inspired by new collections or people that we see in the city .
I can understand people who say that shopping is boring .
Especially when we go from shop to shop but we ca n't find anything interesting .
Generally , shopping can be seen as an enjoyable experience or just a basic need in order to survive .
The most famous person from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , who works in a department store and is always planning how to make people 's lives more comfortable and better .
I had absolutely no idea .
She was surprisingly open to the thought that I could try it at least .
I was absolutely excited .
UNEXPECTED VISIT
How dare she come to my door?There were no words to express my feelings ...
Suddenly , he 'd cut the connection between us .
It was an engagement ring !
The words of congratulation below the picture explained everything : He 'd got married to someone else !
" He 's dead . " she said , as if she was whispering .
Now , after all those long years have gone by full of pain , disappointments , missing and regrets ; all I have is the memories which were saved by him in a little wooden box .
I 've never found out the reason that made him leave me , despite all his love for me , unfortunately ...
People argue that today 's television is a load of rubbish . The quality of many programs is absolutely questionable and in many cases the language is vulgar .
There are several reasons why television has inherited this reputation .
Then , the large number of entertainment programs broadcast discourage those who want more cultural or factual programs , as they have been drastically reduced .
It seems to be a result of the fact that , after a long day , people prefer to unwind in front of the television , watching " entertainment programs " rather then news or what 's happening in the world .
Moreover , on television , there is a lot of advertising constantly interrupting the broadcast , and of course , this fact is very unpleasant .
Despite all these facts , it is without doubt that television has changed our lives .
There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before condemning it .
For example , the wider choice of programs from all over the world allows us to discover new cultures , new languages and new societies without travelling , and this enhances our knowledge .
In addition to that , the cost of television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema , the theatre or opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone .
Also , it is very important to remember that we always have the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when .
To sum up , I think television is very good value for money . The point is being able to choose what we want to watch .
Firstly , there are two kinds of famous people : those who want to have a private life and who do n't want everybody knowing each aspect of their lives , and those who sell certain parts of their lives in magazines , newspapers or TV programmes , or even their entire private lives .
Secondly , taking this into account , I think that everybody has the right to have a private life and the right to live without journalists following them everywhere .
Of course , they can control that by complaining in a court .
But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and an embarrassing moment could arrive and , if you have sold things like this before , you ca n't say anything .
It is absolutely rewarding to receive good news from an old friend who has been absent from my life for so long .
I would be so happy to provide you with some accommodation while you stay in my country .
I am currently working at a place where I am getting a great wage , so I have the possibility to accompany you on your journey .
We could go to the most representative places in Mexico , such as Templo mayor , Cancún , Acapulco , among many others .
In Mexico , a foreign person does not face difficulties getting hired by a company . I would be pleased to help you with this part of your experience in my country . I know that you are someone who loves animals ,
Wrestling is a new sport which was unknown to many of my classmates at college .
Wrestling is done by two people while others wait for their turn .
Wrestling is both an interesting and an entertaining sport .
Traditionally , we provide a fire as a means of light at night for the sport .
It takes place in the middle of the village where there is enough space for the spectators .
Refreshments are on sale at a discounted price for the visiting team .
I am a teacher in a high school and the authorities in my country let me stay there , improving my English .
I would like to say that learning any language is complicated for anyone , wherever you come from , but , in my opinion , there are many matters to discuss .
A good illustration of this would be children .
A child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time . This child does n't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language , because they are listening to their parents speaking English , their native language , all the time and this lets them learn without any difficulty .
On the other hand , if you go abroad you will be able to improve your English in an anglophone country . In this case , your knowledge will be reinforced by your stay there .
But if you have an opportunity to go abroad , it would be so good for you and your English .
Since graduation , I have been employed by AECOM Asia Ltd Co. as a graduate engineer since September 2013 .
I was assigned to work on a project of CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd under agreement of Term Geotechnical Consultancies .
I assisted the project engineer with Engineer Inspection for Maintenance .
Regular maintenance is essential for all man - made slopes to avoid deterioration .
The maintenance responsibility of those slopes belongs to CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd.
Before inspection , I need to take the course which is conducted by CLPP for the access permit .
I am writing to apply for the job of summer camp assistant which I saw advertised in the " Daily mail " .
Apart from studying at the high school " Marie Curie " in Meda , I sing in a choir as a soprano and my director would be pleased to speak for me if you would like to contact him to get further information .
I am keen on sports , especially volleyball , which I started playing at an early age , and I suppose I would be able to teach them how to play it and to organise a tournament .
I think I would be a suitable candidate for the job because I am used to looking after my neighbours ' children and I have recently attended a course about first aid so I would be ready to treat children if they get injured .
In addition to my native language , I can speak German as well as English . In fact , I am attending a first certificate course now and last year I spent 2 months in Berlin . My German teacher would be happy to receive your call to tell you more about my language experience .
I hope you will consider my application .
Yours faithfully ,

Construction will be improved .
However the general appearance wo n't be different .
However , I think , that all the systems which work in homes ( electricity , gas , heating system , water , etc . ) will be upgraded .
New technologies are going to seize architecture .
Though it will affect the environment in a good way .
For one reason - convenience .
Huge , bulletproof windows are my biggest dream . I could n't live without them .
Apart from that , every room will be full of interactive gadgets .
Roger O'keefe , 83 years old , is being referred to your care for further assistance .
He is now recovering from Malignant Melanoma on his left shoulder .
Since his discharge from the hospital , we have been doing our daily home visit and wound dressing and also assisting him with his showering .
His wound is healing well and is free from complications .
On observation , they are getting some help from their neighbors . However , they are having problems keeping up their household routine .
Therefore , it would be greatly appreciated if you could organize a home visit and provide further assistance for this family .
Hasselt offers a wide range of interesting activities and has a lot of places of interest .
Hasselt is famous for its great shopping facilities .
Hasselt has it all , from museums and shops with the latest fashion , to shops with local products , such as gingerbread and gin .
In the evening , when all the day trippers are gone , the city wakes up again and all the bars re - open .
THE MOST INTERESTING WEEKEND OF MY LIFE
These are beautiful moments , but now I reckon that there is n't anything more interesting than having all your family together talking about whole background .
Surprising stories that we will not ever imagine .
My family is n't so close and is distributed around many cities in my country . After some incidents in the past , many things changed and each family followed their own way .
We rented a wonderful place outside our city with a spectacular atmosphere .
It was the most interesting and astonishing weekend that I have ever experienced .
Everything was amazing , a lot of memories . We laughed a lot , we did many activities like bbq , table games , watching movies , swimming , among others .
Now I believe that the best moments in life are when you have time with your family . It is the best way to recharge your battery for everything .
Many times we pay more attention to other things . It can do it in many opportunities .
In my opinion , travelling by car is more convenient than travelling by public transport because you can choose where you want to go and the time you prefer to start your trip .
Travelling around the city by car is faster than on public transport .
Sometimes , public transport is useful because you can use it when you want to go to a party and you will probably drink some wine , beer , etc .
I 've seen your letter and I 'm writing this to you to say what I do in my country to help save the environment .
We tried to convince the Headmaster to help us financially , but it was n't enough .
Indroduction
The aim of this report is to outline what are the best places for young people to have fun in Valencia , what facilities exist for them and how these could be made better .
Activities around the city
Also , it would be a good idea to go to the beach to spend the day and play volleyball or sunbathe , because this is always a good plan .
Other activities in the surroundings .
In addition , I suggest going by bus around the surroundings of the city , where you can do adventure sports , like canoeing , climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoying the countryside
Recommendations
I recommend that they should do both activities , Valencia city and also the surroundings .
My favourite kinds of movie are comedy and comedy drama because they have interesting plots and characters , someone and who watches comedy can laugh all the time .
As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) said , playing the lottery is not economically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe , but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibility of escaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
Cohen 's knowledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Some people like to calculate the gain or loss from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dollar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams .
Though this has been an amusing debate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that the lottery should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a tradition , it gives help , hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment .
I hope my suggestions will help you .
The swimming pool in Brunete has customers from all age groups , but it is especially suitable both for young people and elderly people who want to improve their mobility .
On the one hand , everything is very clean , including floor , bathrooms and corridors . In addition , if you are a disabled person , you will not have any trouble getting in there because there are some ramps to help you go in .
On the other hand , you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use the facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .
In my opinion , the swimming pool is convenient because you can walk to swim if you live in town , but it is very expensive , particularly for young people .
Famous people have always been surrounded by a lot of journalists and paparazzi who follow them wherever they go .
Those people could be politicians , film stars , singers , football players and so on , living in constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and , because of this , they have to keep calm and carry on with it .
Therefore , most of these famous people complain about this , but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constantly devoting every minute of the day to them , because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing who they are with , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but , in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people , though they have to accept some critics , because not everybody has to love them .
A shopping centre has many disadvantages .
We live in a time of acquisitiveness and people buy many things , even if they ca n't afford them .
The times in which we live are conducive to addictions .
In Italy there are few cities with an underground and often in the smaller cities there are only buses .
I hope for the next generations for a better public transport service and an increase of its use .
At 6:20 I open my laptop , go to Youtube.com and start to study French with Mrs .
I write down new French vocabulary or grammar in my notebook .
I pack my backpack , pick up my garbage bag and look around my room for one last time to make sure I have n't forgotten anything . I go downstairs and put the garbage bag into the trash bin .
You should n't spend so much time watching television because it is n't healthy .
Actually , I do n't watch much television , because I do n't have much free time , but if I had it , I think I would watch more .
Now that I 'm on holidays , I watch more TV , especially some series like Criminal Investigation or The Mentalist .
The reasons for Greece 's terrible economic situation are that Greece has surrendered its currency sovereignty to the European Central Bank , so that Greece could not apply monetary policy to spur its economy , and the Greek government is very corrupt , so that Greeks could easily dodge taxes .
In contrast , in Taiwan , we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well - organized .
Monetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy , and , from empirical experience , many countries have successfully applied such policy .
In 2012 , the Japanese central bank unprecedentedly depreciated the Yuan , which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation .
Obviously , Taiwan has its own currency , the new Taiwan dollar , and if Taiwan 's economy was worsening someday , the Taiwanese government could simply mimic what the Japanese government did in 2012 .
Not only is Taiwan different from Greece in currency sovereignty , it also wins in government efficiency .
According to a global survey , Taiwan has a reputation for effectiveness , in which the Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Therefore , the Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes .
Without a doubt , the efficiency of the Taiwanese government is beneficial to people 's welfare .
All in all , Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well - known for its effectiveness .
As a country , Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create a lovely and healthy environment for its citizens .
They told every dream to their dad , and they knew he would enforce it even though , under the circumstances , it seemed to be impossible , he would try .
He said that if Nick built a house with two floors , he would buy it and pay for the children 's studies lifelong , which gave a reverse to the impossible .
After months of working on the house , he finished , and his cousin gave him a bonus reward of one million dollars to start with , buying a big house with everything they wanted .
The pie chart shows the principal causes which explain why agricultural lands become less productive , whereas the table correlates these causes with three different regions of the world which had land degraded , namely North America , Europe and Oceania , during the 1990s .
Overall , it is clear that the main causes of land degradation were deforestation and over - grazing .
These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degraded .
A closer look at the pie chart reveals that over - grazing was the most significant reason why land was so degraded , with the highest percentage of 35% .
This was followed by deforestation , with 30% , while over - cultivation had 28% .
It may be explained by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity .
Not surprisingly , these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes , particularly in Europe and Oceania .
In the first case , Europe had the highest percentage of land degraded by deforestation and over - cultivation , 9.8% and 7.7% respectively .
On the other hand , Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% because of over - grazing , which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded .
By contrast , in general , North America had the lowest rates for deforestation and over - grazing , with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively .
For this reason , this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded , with only 5% .
Canton Tower is located at the intersection of Guangzhou New city Central Axes and the Pearl River .

I think that I should have more confidence in my family and remember that they wo n't leave me because of something I have done in the way my best friends could do .
It is much more convenient if you walk to the city centre .
At the same time , you can get fit by walking approximately 30 or 40 minutes , and you will not have a problem with parking your car .
You will spend the same time travelling by bus or walking , but the difference is getting angry or not .
Transportation is a means of movement from one geographical location to another by any means of transport .
We know in the olden days how our forefathers suffered in their movement .
Now , there are many means of transportation .
Technology brought about lots of development in transportation .
The train is also a very useful means of transportation and very economical .
I believe that technology has really improve our means of our transport .
Although I have taken part in many competitions , there was one which was the most enjoyable experience of my life .
First , when I was on the starting line , I felt I could not finish the competition . Then , when we were in the water the coaches did not stop encouraging us so it was easy to swim to the finishing line . I was so excited to see our families waiting for us , clapping and shouting loudly every time one of us arrived .
If you are interested in taking part in this sport , I would suggest buying all the equipment you will need : a comfortable swimsuit , goggles and a huge bag to keep them .

They had n't abandoned him , neither had they distanced themselves from him .

In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I strongly agree with , because the extra traffic caused by the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals causes massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad for the health of the walking and cycling citizens , especially young children and babies .
However , it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway .
All in all , I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than an advantage , because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it 's less important .
Local politicians should focus on sustainability , using vehicles which do not harm the environment .
Because I did n't find any tickets for the concert in London , I bought one for the concert in Birmingham .
As well as the ticket for the concert , I bought a VIP ticket as well , so I had to go to Birmingham before , because the entry to the venue was at 17:00 and , as I live close to London , I had to leave at about 12:00 so I would n't have to rush .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , and then , as I 'd never been to Birmingham , I had to look for the 02 Academy , where the event was taking place .
After 30 minutes , the acoustic performance started , which lasted for about 15 minutes . Afterwards , we took pictures .
My name is Maria and I saw your advertisement and am interested in the job .
On the one hand , I am studying to be a PE teacher , so I know how to organise activities for young people , such as fishing or doing a sport .
I'm good at entertaining . What is more , I really enjoy working with children since they are very active and willing to do any kind of activities .
Yours Faithfully ,
It 's true that commuting to work is n't as convenient as going to work by car .
On top of that , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that you will save time , because both buses and cars wo n't be able to move in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives you more freedom and flexibility to set your own schedule , while public transport limits you to a timetable that does not always meet your needs .
After cars prevailed among the public , our governments have tried to pave rough roads , which encourages people to use cars even more .
Nowadays , it might be argued if the current transportation system will work in the future like it does in the present , while there is a still plenty of room for public transportation remaining as a significant method .
This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be with us or if it will disappear completely .
For a start , the convenience for us for travelling around would probably be one of the main arguments .
In some countries , the amount of transportation such as trains is not sufficient , which forces people to use private cars .
However , it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also , for their parents , it is definitely more reliable .
What is also important is the impact on the environment , which is already considerably damaged by human technology .
If a car which emits no serious global - warming gases were developed , there would be no argument that people had better reduce their use of cars . Yet , as long as we are manufacturing them , we can not find more eco - friendly and efficient modes of transport than public transportation .
In conclusion , it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future , even though travelling by car is more convenient than travelling by just trains or buses .
But as with car development , our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco - friendly .
All of the world is constantly changing - we develop new technologies , people invent new things .
Everywhere , there will be cameras and motion sensors .
Kitchens will be better equipped , maybe with smart appliances , and people who ca n't cook will prepare the meal by themselves .
I think that the differences between homes now and homes in the future will be small .
Personally , I think houses in the future will not be cosy , but very sterile . I do not like that .
Travelling by car is getting more convenient .
Traffic accidents , the main problem of car travel , will be solved by self - driving technology .
Using public transport is cheaper than having a car , especially living in urban areas .
If one wants to go somewhere , one can use a shared car which is parked in a designated area .
If car - sharing and self - driving technology are mixed , it will be much more convenient than both the conventional public transport and travelling by car .
All my life I have practiced sports , but definitely , my favorite sport is squash .
The first year , I went to a tournament in Torreon and I won first place . During the first 3 years , I ranked in the first 10 places in Mexico , but then I had to reduce my practices because I had a problem with my knees .
For someone new to this sport , I would recommended being patient and constant in training , because practice is what will make you better and help to improve your level . And , finally , always enjoy the game .
Never had any serious relationship .
Now he was 35 and he was still keeping on smiling at the news of his colleagues ' and friends ' marriages .
Nowadays , everybody has one or more cars . As a consequence of that , some people believe that public transport is going to disappear .
There are several reasons to believe that . Firstly , many people are influenced by the advertising , which mixes happiness with driving cars and makes people think that public transport is not as smart an option as cars .
Secondly , it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground .
In addition , public transport is cheap because buying a car means spending a fortune and in big cities where people are concerned about the environment , such as Amsterdam or Tokyo , there are many facilities like mobile phone apps or special offers .
To sum up , no one knows the future . However , I believe that travelling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more so , because it is good to save money and to reduce pollution .
" There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient "
In my opinion , fewer people are travelling by public transport and have started to buy their own cars , which are more comfortable to use whether you are in a hurry or not .
In the first place , you feel more comfortable in your own car than on a bus , for example . You do n't need to be afraid that someone could suddenly steal your purse and you do n't have to listen to others when you travel in your car .
Studies have shown that your self - esteem and feelings of protection increase when you are a car driver .
In the second place , not all public transport is in the best shape .
In conclusion , travelling by car is far better than using public transport .

I would like to inform you that I 'm interested in this job .
I love children . I have already worked with them . It was a wonderful experience .
I 'm very hardworking and a fun person .
Yours faithfully ,
Spain must be really incredible !
He was signing autographs and chatting with fans .
That 's all for now , but I will write more when I find my feet ! I will appreciate my dad 's work forever .
I 'm sending this email to get some information because I 'm interested in studying at your university .
I'm supported by the government of Saudi Arabia and the scholarship will cover the tuition and everything related to my studies .
I graduated in 2010 , majoring in accounting , with a degree having an accumulated GPA of 2.49 out of 5 . Since I came here , I have been so ambitious that I will be getting my high studies as soon as I finish studying English . It turned out that I have to jump through a lot of hoops in order to overcome these obstacles which I believe are an ordinary requirement for getting a master 's degree for foreign students .
In addition , there are recent statistics that show that a very high percentage of Saudi Arabian students who come to America to do their master 's degree could n't get into university due to some requirements , for instance , GRE , G MAT , or even because their GPA did n't meet the university conditions .
In fact , I do n't want to be one of those student who ca n't accomplish their dream and have to go back to their home . I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to get into your university .
I would like to have the orientation material to increase my chances of getting into university and I will do my best to get very high grades in order to increase my GPA when it 's added to my transcript . To sum up , what I 'm looking for is to take a preparation class in business to be included in the final accumulated GPA .
Finally , I believe that it it a great opportunity to study in the United States and to improve my education and my lifestyle .
Besides , I 'm an eager , mature student , wanting to study a for master 's degree at your university and I 'm looking forward to getting a response and your recommendations .
In this essay I will comment on one of the last mistakes that I made and its consequences .
First , I want to focus your attention on the fact that , normally , mistakes have no importance , because all things have fix and , if they have not fix why do you worry ?
Every storey has a colored sign ; red , orange , green , blue and an intermediate color between red and orange and that was my confusion .
I left my car on the storey with the orange color , but when , some days later , I looked for my car I did it on the storey with the intermediate color .
When you come out onto the road you need to go straight until you reach a restaurant . Then you must go to the left where you will find a big square with swings and slides .
Recently , studying online has become a very popular alternative way to study .
Although it provides students with lots of advantages , not everything is as good as it sounds .
How can they solve their problems if there is a lack of student - teacher interaction ?
This is impossible if they study online , which means that their only classmate is the computer or the laptop they use .
However , this method of studying is cheaper than the usual way , and it also can be completely free , which is a big advantage .
Nevertheless , I can understand people who choose the second option .
Nowadays , people want to travel at their own conveyance using their own car , bike , scooter or something like that .
In winter , it is fine . We can adjust to the crowd , but if we talk about the summer season , we can not adjust when we are travelling in a suffocating environment .
We need to book tickets in advance if we are planning to go via public transport , because again , there is the issue of availability of seats .
I live in Trieste , a very beautiful city , but this city has a big problem : it has a lot of cars , more cars than inhabitants .
Of course , it 's an exaggeration , but I say this to affirm that in this city the number of the cars is very high .
By the way , the public transport is not so convenient , because at certain hours you can not find a bus .
Another problem with the buses is that if you take one during certain times , it 's impossible to find a place free to sit down .
So travelling by bus is not convenient , not only in terms of time , but also because of the problems that you can have .
The other issue is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia , where the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy , so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fill up their car directly in Slovenia , where they can find much more competitive prices .
He wants to convince me to use alternative means of transport , but having seen the price of this ecological vehicle , I think that I 'll buy one of them only if the price becomes
And after that , it depends on the personality , status ( single , engaged or married ) , and even the ages of people , whether they will decide to study in their own country or go abroad to learn English .
On the one hand , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especially for young people .
They usually go abroad because they do n't have so many responsibilities . It just prepares them for their professional future .
But they can only afford it by working as an au pair , waiter , kitchen porter or porter , because these jobs include accommodation , normal wages and you do n't need a high level of English .
This way is cheap as well and they do n't have to change everything in their life to achieve this aim .
Trapagaran , environmentally friendly
The purpose of this report is to explain that my town has become more aware of the need to take care of the countryside .
In the last five years , many new bins have been installed near all neighbourhoods .
One of these bins is destined for plastics , another one is for wood and paper , the third one is a bottle bank and the last one is for batteries .
This one is very important because it contaminates so much .
For instance , clothes , shoes , toys , electronic devices , etc .
These are a great place where families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside .
Moreover , residents have become more conscious after they have read the leaflets which explain the importance of respecting the environment .
Conclusion
I really think that it is necessary to make people conscious of the importance of saving the planet .
I would like to apply for this vacancy because I think I have most of the requirements that you are asking for .
I enjoy learning new recipes and I try to find different flavours and sensations when cooking .
I worked for more than six years in a supermarket as well , so that is why I am accustomed to dealing with customers and coping with difficult people in a busy environment .
It is not necessary to say I am able to work to a cafe schedule . I have experience working shift days and weekends .
I would be glad if I could have an interview to give you more details about my work experience , my skills or whatever you need to ask me .

Nowadays , people 's lives are undergoing an unexpected change all because of globalization .
Globalization started in the 20 's , so a huge proportion of the population has experienced this change . In my opinion , it is kind of good .
The need for exporting and importing items has increased in the last 10 years . Consequently , the life of the people has been raised in rapid response .
Personal contact shows a decrease in this time , because people do n't want to face their real problems . Instead , they can see all the problems happening in the world on their smartphones .
In the future , people will communicate via their computers , cellphones , and tablets , and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Nowadays , we already have things like smart phones , which can do nearly everything we want to .
But will people 's lives really change so dramatically in the next 50 years ?
Of course , there will be some more electronic things like some new mobile phones with functions we could not expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
But if we speak of the change of people 's lives , there have to be some more dramatic things .
To put it in a nutshell , we could say that our global world will be more electronic , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo n't change our lives dramatically .
And the most comfortable ?
In my opinion , any transport is completely safe . However , people say the plane is the safest mode of transport .
And maybe the car is the most comfortable .
It is true that both have advantages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , dangerous and relaxing . I know this is a contradiction , but I can explain it .
If you are tired , you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax , and if there are more passengers in the car , you can swap with them , so you will feel less tired .
Some disadvantages could be :
- There are n't enough parking spaces and they are very expensive . For example , when you travel to Madrid , it is impossible to find a free parking space .
- Often you can be involved in city traffic jams , especially in the rush hour .
All these bad practices can make them have an accident and other innocent people are in danger .
On the other hand , travelling by plane , people say , is safer than travelling on other modes of transport .
I do n't make sure this affirmation .
I 'm afraid and that started when I was travelling to Mexico on my honeymoon .
At that time , there was a tropical storm , and the turbulence was horrible ; but a not time I have stopped travelling by plane .
I look for the perfect offer , but in summer it is impossible to find it .
I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle lane . In contrast to here in Spain , where few cities , like Madrid or Barcelona , strengthen their use .
Public transport is one part of social development .
It will make people feel comfortable .
The bar chart shows the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. and Jack&Jones Co.
we can see the number of projected sales of jeans of Jack&Jones Co. will be at 450 thousand pairs next Jan , it will be higher than the number of the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. ; about 300 thousand pairs . Then the number of Jack&Jones Co. will drop to 250 thousand pairs in Feb next year .
After this fall , the number of Jack&Jones Co. will rise gradually to hit a peak at 90 thousand pairs in Dec.
The pie chart illustrates the projected market share of Mango Co. , Jack&Jones Co. and other companies for jeans at the end of next year . Jack&Jones Co. will get 30% of the projected market share in jeans , Mango Co. take 20% of it .
As it was quite early in the morning , there was just silence everywhere .
" I encouraged myself .
Although many people believe that our lives are getting better than they were 20 years ago , scientists have proved that , if we carry on with our way of living , using , for instance , modern technology , we will lose control of our lives .
Technology has reached a point where we need to do anything in order to achieve something .
People were given the task of writing a piece of writing of their choice using resources already provided by the institution in charge .
Out of 20 tested people , 17 managed to write their composition within an hour .
Secondly , keeping the main task , they were given a tablet with wireless connection to use instead of books .
This time the study showed that all of the participants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes .
The objective of this study was to see how people adapted to new technologies and how our cultural roots are being forgotten .
If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences , we should start to understand how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it .
My name is Montserrat Márquez , I am 23 years old and I am really interested in the advertisement I saw the other day about working on summer camps in the USA . I have worked before but in my home town , Mexico city , and I think I would be a perfect candidate for this job .
I am a suitable person for the job because I am used to working with children of all ages , but I prefer to play with kids between 8 and 12 years old . Also , I am always trying to improve different activities to avoid getting bored , and I do not mind working in other areas of the camp .
To sum up , I would like to work with you , and I can promise you will not regret it . I hope to hear from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Montserrat Márquez
I promise you will not regret coming , everything here is wonderful and there are many places we can go to visit .
If you want to become an artist or politician , you must be ready for journalists following you all the time .
I suppose that sometimes celebrities enjoys people gossipping about them .
and that is why I do n't understand why is it so important for people to know what happens to a celebrity ?
Also , when you spend time with your boyfriend or girlfriend , you know that someone is taking a photo of you .
WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform you about the ways in which my village carries out measures to look after the environment .
For this , we will analyse several aspects , such as what local residents do with rubbish and how Lanjarón tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people .
Nowadays , there is more and more rubbish because of the huge amount of packaging used to wrap products and the increase in consumption .
A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to attend several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling .
Keeping the village clean and attractive
To achieve this , the council organises different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in .
For instance , every month there is a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village .
At the end of the competition , those whose area is cleanest and most attractive receive an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us .
Others consider that military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary .
First of all , there is absolutely no safety in the modern world .
Therefore , compulsory service in the army gives special military knowledge , which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict .
More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develops organizational skills and practises discipline .
Moreover , it can educate young people to be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents .
However , the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact .
For example , it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service , because during the one or two years of service , soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military knowledge .
Besides , there are accidents , which can happen with guns or weapons , such as explosions and accidents .
Furthermore , there are hazing acts in the army .
Army years often have an impact on the whole family , especially in the case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to a warzone .
Finally , this is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages , but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world .
This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for them to learn .
Firstly , the food I make for myself is more reliable than the food that is made in restaurants .
Because I do n't know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant used .
Because all of the restaurants want to earn money , so they will just use cheap and unhealthy ingredients to cook the food .
But if I make my own food , of course , I wo n't use any kind of unhealthy ingredients .
So the food I make with my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants .
And also , homemade food has a better quality than low - price restaurants .
Secondly , it 's much cheaper to eat at home , because restaurants want to earn money .
Some people think cooking for themselves is too annoying or tiring , so they go out to eat .
Thirdly , eating at home is more comfortable .
When people are surrounded by strangers , people all think they are watching them so they ca n't do this or that .
Also , a restaurant does n't know how much you can eat , so sometimes , they give you so little food you do n't get full .
Fourthly , you wo n't have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and coming back home .
Because of these kinds of advantages and reasons , I prefer to eat at home .
To sum up , the fundamental characteristic of social media is the design of a " Virtual profile " . It takes time to maintain connections between links and friends and be part of groups . These connections will have negative effects , especially on psychological well - being .
This outcome , along with several studies , suggests reasonable use of networking media .
However , it is also likely that people 's lives , such as loneliness and depression , might explain the effects that social media can have .
Furthermore , it is also possible that , in the future , people will be a subject responses , posts and chat rooms , in which there is awareness of wrong vocabulary , poor routines and compulsive use .
In contrast , one positive aspect of social media relates to the education area , in which knowledge , the expansion of ideas , and the discovery of different ways of learning will contribute to the community .
On the one hand , we have technology .
Technology has developed really fast in the last twenty years , so it 's expected to develop the same way in the next fifty years .
Fifteen years ago , cell phones did n't have music or a camera , while nowadays they have cameras with high definition and you can download a lot of music .
Every aspect of science will evolve . For example , new medical discoveries will be made by doctors .
To sum up , I believe that people 's lives will change a lot because everything will evolve .
They help me to develop and to see the world from a different perspective .
People like to watch movies , because it 's a fun pastime and it replaces books for lazy people .
Many people think living in the countryside provides a better way of life .
Most of us think it 's a great idea , but is it better than our comfortable life in the city ?
Would we live better without technology ?
As we know , the countryside has no pollution compared to big towns , because there are n't cars , lorries , mopeds or any other motor vehicles .
On the other hand , technology makes our life easier .
We can get information , chat with friends or even order food instantly over the Internet . However , unfortunately , we do n't have it in the countryside .
However , I think humans have evolved and we are very happy with technology and the Internet .
There is no doubt that using your private car is much more comfortable & convenient for any person .
Your car represents a kind of luxury & comfort , which is clearly illustrated during driving or travelling long distances , as long as you have a comfortable seat with a certain personal space .
Furthermore , you are not accompanied by some silly passengers or difficult people during your trip as you will relish your trip with some adorable friends , nice family members or close colleagues that you have chosen .
Besides , the presence of a car during a trip is very important for coping with the different conditions and environments you face during the journey .
On the other hand , public transport has now become unhygienic , as lots of people are crowded into a small and enclosed area , and so , a lot of breath & air droplets are easily propagated in this enclosed space , and consequently , you are more susceptible to the various contagious diseases , especially in the winter season when respiratory tract infections flourish , e.g. colds & flu .
Furthermore , your actions and movements are limited by the schedule and the route of the mode of transport you are taking .
And so you do n't own your time to do what you want whenever you like , although this is your leisure , your free time , which means a time of relaxation & meditation .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country . The authorities have arranged many procedures to ensure that the town stays clean at the same time as being environmentally friendly .
As a first step to keep the environment clean and healthy , the garbage needs to be separated into 3 categories . That is why the environment department decided to give each house three recycling bins ; one for food and green garbage , one only for paper and cardboard , and the last for the rest .
Another handy rule has been introduced , which is that plastic and glass need to be thrown in different bins that are available for public usage in each supermarket center . In these , people can find these bins at easy locations available everywhere .
All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town 's citizens in order to improve the environment and go together with all the procedures that help them live a happy , healthy life .
We are used to just turning the lights or air - conditioning on when we do n't really need them .
A lot of us just turn on the engine of our cars without considering walking up to the bus stop .
The fares are high compared to other European countries and the fare system is complicated .
The punctuality of trains needs to be greatly improved , too .
In my opinion , we need to save a future for public transport for our future and it is vital to reduce the use of private cars . Travelling by car is more convenient , but with improved public transport , we need to reduce the use of cars .
That is our responsibility to future generations .
And then you always wonder what would have happened if you had chosen the alternative .
You do not particularly like that feeling , do you ?
There is a group of young people who decided once that it is ridiculous to choose if you can have all in one - do you want to meet them ?
The group is going to perform in The Globe theatre and they have promised to meet your expectations .
' Gravity ' is an outstanding , brilliant , sci - fi film , directed by Alfonso Cuaron , starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock .
This amazing film is about two people from a crew of astronauts sent out in space to launch the ' HUBBLE ' telescope .
Soon , one of them is informed that an asteroid hit a satellite and created debris which is heading for the Shuttle where the two astronauts are .
Eventually , the debris hits the Shuttle and thus more debris is created which follows the orbit of Earth and moved around it at a very high speed .
The damage which the impact of the debris caused to the Shuttle are catastrophic !
To survive , the astronauts have to get to the International Space Station , which is very far away from them .
After a long sequence of events , the remaining astronaut first gets to the ISS , then , with a Russian spacecraft , moves on to a Chinese space station called TIANGONG .
Her struggle for survival turns out to be successful !
My hometown , Piliyandala , is probably the smallest town in Colombo district and provides shelter for more than 100,000 people .
The town has approximately 15 villages and all of them are governed by the urban council .
The garbage control service is one of the main supporting subsidiaries of the urban council , which was founded two years ago .
With this garbage control system , household waste is collected on a weekly basis and transported to recycling centers .
The recycling centers sort this garbage and it is put into different categories to be recycled . Categorized garbage is then transported to the recycling process in the nearest factory .
Two years ago , the council started a wastebasket distribution program among the villages , with the intention of easing the garbage collection process .
With this approach , it is very convenient for the workers who are employed in the garbage control service , because they can collect all the garbage of a village from one place .
Meanwhile , the urban council strongly discourage the use of plastic products and other artificial materials for the sake of our own cleanliness .
Nowadays , lots of people are discussing the problems of life in the next 50 years . In 50 years ,
surely , science and technology will
Planes , trains and buses will be faster and maybe , thanks to the progress of technology , we will be able to beam - up everywhere .
This will be a great achievement !
Face - to - face communication , for example , will lose its importance . All the communication will be virtual . People will speak only on social networks .
I think that this will be tragic ! Also , all relationships and friendships will be virtual , and that is absurd .
Everything is going great !
What does she like?(I remember you said she liked chocolate .
Also , we can go to some parks that I think are incredible there .
It tells the story of a beautiful woman , played by the always stunning and talented actress Milla Jovovich , who is pulled off a bridge by a mysterious serial killer .
As time goes by , Milla learns how to identify people 's body gestures . As she becomes more confident with her new ability , her life comes slowly back to normal , but not for too long , because she becomes suspicious the murderer could be closer than she would ever have expected .
To most of her friends in the dorm of University of Education , Mimi is just an ordinary girl , neither beautiful nor smart .
Michael loved her at first sight when he first met her and he tried to take advantage of opportunities to win her heart .
There is no doubt that the Southerners in Vietnam have had prejudices against Northerners for a long time .
It was unfortunate for Michael to get access to her because she was a Southerner .
Overcoming many prejudices and obstacles from her family , he proved to be a loyal and sincere man who Mimi could depend on .
But everything has changed since he came to Danang city for further study .
He began to have intimate relations with other beautiful young girls there and broke his promises - " Wait for me !
Everything was fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises .
Right after getting off the plane , she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view to satisfying her long wait for him .
The more excited she was , the more disappointment she had . Mimi caught sight of her lover kissing another young girl in his room .
Hey ! how are you ? How is life ? Hope your done with your prestigious exams that you told me about .
Anyway , I 've recently been organizing an environment - saving event for our beautiful city by doing a recycling campaign .
Since your dad has a recycling factory , I thought that he would be pleased to get the bottles and the other recyclable material as well .
As you know , in our country there 's trash being thrown everywhere and most of the things that are thrown away are recyclable .
This is the main reason why our environment is being destroyed .
The charity I chose to invest in was the envirosavers charity , as they have recently done a good job of re - building animal habitats , so I thought that they might need money , since they have just spent money on building the habitats .
At the event , there will be charged entertainments for all age groups . There will be live music , and we also have a lottery which will be going on .
You never told me that you were thinking of playing an instrument .
What kind of instrument are you going to play ?
In my opinion , you should try to organise a schedule for your activities .
I hope that 's useful . Good luck and let me know how you get on .
I 'm Vincenzo Manna , an engineering student who , by means of linguaenglish , is going to spend three weeks in Brighton ( as you already know , my colleague Gelsomina Davide and I are arriving on 27th of July ) .
I would like to ask you for just one piece of information .
Surfing the Internet , I have found that if I catch a bus I will be able to get off at several stops ( Coach station , Patcham , Preston Circus and so on ... ) , while when travelling by train , I can choose between Brighton and New Brighton .
I hope to improve my English skills thanks to this trip , and especially my listening and spoken English .
In fact , I am studying a lot to pass the CAE examination ( Certificate in Advanced English ) , but I am facing several difficulties .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly , such as , now it has a lot of condominiums a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station . That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes , so I did n't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital . That can assure safety for everyone who lives in this area .
For this reason , this is the advantage of living in this area but because of many people in this area , traffic in rush hours especially in the morning is very heavy and it takes so long to drive a car to work .That is the disadvantage of living in this area . So , in my opinion , this area should have an improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to cover this area .
Mary and Amber were having lunch at a restaurant .
Mary yelled loudly at the young man to call him to stop and everyone in the restaurant noticed him .
To his surprise , Amber and the manager of this restaurant were already standing in front of the door .
As a result , even though he kept expressing his apologies to Amber , she still decided to call the police .
Although the two movies are from completely different genres , similarities still exist .
The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones , and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life - altering events .
Ali , an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son , saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet .
Once again , their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges .
In sum , both movies portrayed love as a chemical reaction that grows when two people are willing to help each other out of life challenges .
On the other hand , after Ali starts his kickboxing career , Stephanie always cares about his conditions , and then becomes his middleman .
And in Silver Linings Playbook , Pat and Tiffany , who both used to be stuck in their misfortune in the past , leave their past behind and move on with each other 's love and support .
Although they have those things in common , at the beginning of the movies , the depression of the characters came from different situations .
Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psychological difficulties ; Pat 's desire for his ex - wife can not be fulfilled , while Tiffany can not get over her guilt over her husband 's death .
On the other hand , the characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality ; Stephanie lost her legs , and Ali is a poor man .
Although their hearts are all empty , the harsh environment is harder to survive .
In conclusion , every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways , whereas people can always find distinct inspiration .
In my opinion , being included in the latest TV news is a huge contribution , a great opportunity to introduce yourself in the way you like .
They 're being followed constantly by paparazzi , and their private photos are being bought for millions of dollars .
We should n't underestimate the importance of societal and environmental problems .
On the one hand , I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems , including environmental ones .
Their activities had lots of negative consequences , such as air , water and land pollution , deforestation and climate change .
These issues are so burning in developing countries .
Whereas developed countries have become aware of these problems , poor countries have plenty of societal problems , so they continue to affect the environment in a negative way .
For example , developing countries can not protect the environment because of their poverty , low incomes , and population illiteracy .
On the other hand , sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal ones .
Such disasters as earthquakes , floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year .
Unfortunately , we can not prevent natural disasters , but we can solve societal problems .
If people take responsibility for their actions , we will avoid plenty of consequences .
In my view , we can achieve this through developing leadership .
He must inspire others to achieve appropriate goals and to do their best for the world .
In my organization , we strive for peace in the world .
We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and in these ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society .
Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something , but I do n't know how to do it properly .
I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing my country 's welfare .
Though new problems occur quickly in our state , some people and communities try to do their best to develop a civil and democratic society .
We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environmental problems .
Moreover , our country pays little attention to them , so the population has to do everything on their own .
For instance , I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and saving energy .
These skills are necessary for us , and they help us to improve our ecological situation a little .
In conclusion , each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede the further progress of our civilization .
What is more , this project will give me valuable experience , including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendencies in the social sphere and careful attitudes towards the environment .
Television can entertain everybody today . It does n't matter the age . It can be a baby or an elderly person ; we can see that there are interesting topics for all kinds of audience .
It 's a multimedia device so that while you watch TV , you can listen and see other people or cartoons , and it seems the characters are alive talking directly to you .
Today the networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , you can watch the programs at any time you want to , and if you do n't like a program , you can change the channel and watch something else . Through the increase in channels and competitiveness , the audience has also increased its power of choice .
We have the power to choose what we want , but with so many options , we must be aware of our own decisions . I want to say that , although we have so many options , not all of them are effective for us . We are able to decide if we 'd rather see a comedy or a documentary .
The programs tend to reproduce our real life and our desires , such as a soap opera which presents characters with difficulties in their lives , but there are also the solutions to all the problems at the end ; the lady gets married and lives happily with her love forever .
Although they have a nice ending , we need to remember that real life is different and the difficulties are part of our lives . They are there for us to give value to everything we have and to remind us how fragile and , at the same time , how powerful we are .
We can also watch a documentary that teaches us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so much care that they provide us with a lot of information . Sometimes it 's much better than reading a book or having a class .
Many of the automobile owners live in big towns and they often park their cars in the city centres , where they work or study .
Recently , governments in many countries imposed a ban on parking or even a ban on driving in major city centres , because this leads to increasing traffic jams .
Moreover , cars pollute the air significantly and it becomes unhealthy for breathing .
Underground car parks are built in many towns , where you can leave your car when you have some work in the city centre .
Some drivers are not keen on this ban , because this is inconvenient for them .
They do not like travelling by bus or tram .
How does Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' , Shakespeare creates a magical mood and setting by using characters , such as the fairies , and events ( such as transforming Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers ' relationship , as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia . Consequently , Helena is in love with Demetrius .
There 'd be no humour to make it interesting .
The fairies control nearly everything .
The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania 's argument , which makes ' contagious fogs ' ( 2:1:90 ) and ' hoary - headed frosts ' ( 2:1:107 ) .
The fairies also affect nature as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute results in the wind ' piping ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Having fairies as characters adds magic , as fairies do n't exist in the human world .
As a reoccurring theme , Puck 's use of magic creates humour , conflict and balance in the play .
Puck 's magic also adds to his naughty , cheeky , attractive character in this play .
This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her ' sweet love'(4:3:30 ) .
It also creates the comparison of Titania , a beautiful , delicate creature , whilst Bottom is completely grotesque .
The idea of Titania having a ' flowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and the idea of Bottom , at that time , looking ' monstrous ' and ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey 's head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seems ridiculous .
As well as for his needs , he uses his magic to help ' A sweet Athenian lady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) ; namely , Helena , with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is shown as a sympathetic character .
However , Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania .
When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head , he gets annoyed at first at Puck 's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a ' vile thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an ass ' head .
In the book , Titania does n't seem to use her magic much . Nevertheless , she uses it a few times .
Titania uses her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the bride 's bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta will have beautiful children and live a happy married life .
Titania 's fairies are also characters who use magic . They use it to protect their ' fairy queen'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted snakes with double tongue ' , ' newts and blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , like Oberon 's , is used to help people , and not for themselves .
She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies .
The food they eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as well as not being our daily meals or snacks , which also shows another contrast between the humans and the fairies .
The fruits , mentioned above , also sound like ones that would be found in a forest ( berries ) .
The language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us probably haven't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
He talks about ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beautiful land , with green grass and all sorts of flowers .
Let her shine as gloriously
OBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language used in this spell contains many references to nature ( ' Venus ' and ' Sky ' ) .
This is how it creates magic and creates the setting , as in William Shakespeare 's time , they did n't use many props .
Just by reading this , you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called ' love in idleness ' and you can understand Cupid ( the Greek god of love ) had blessed this flower with his archery , giving you an understanding that this is a love potion .
Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as ' let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky ' to create the thought that Helena should look like a ' goddess , nymph , ' in addition to being ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
Shakespeare says ' Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid 's archery ' , causing mystery and making us think about what he means .
Shakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters . For example , when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nature many times .
She refers to the moon as ' the governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasons quite a lot .
She describes the winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of as a miserable season .
Spotted snakes ' and ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are references to animals .
Animals , insects and plants are commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to the magic .
The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical .
After all , the book is called ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' .
Due to the magic , the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream , as there 's no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened .
Thinking of it as a dream creates innocence and vulnerability .
Also , Shakespeare uses the thought of plays .
He adds the play ' Pyramus and Thisbe ' which is a bit like a mini - play based on the storyline ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' , as there are two lovers whose parents do n't permit their marriage .
When the ' mechanicals ' , or workers , change into their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The characters in the play , like ' moonlight ' , are basic ideas of transformations like the ones that magic creates .
Also , there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) into expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world .
At this time , the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion creates magic .
The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play .
To summarize my points , I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations , spells , potions and aspects that do n't exist in the human world .
I personally think , without magic , this book would not be as popular or engaging .
Shakespeare has done it again !
You will enjoy the friendly atmosphere here .
If you like artworks and antiques , you can go shopping for stone sculptures and papyrus there .
You will never forget this amazing experience and the fragrance of the land of the pharaohs , legends and history .
Nowadays , most schools and universities help students to find their most suitable jobs .
This is caused by the changes that the labor market has experienced recently .
Businesses want to recruit young and experienced people and universities and schools have noticed that , so they are hands on the task .
It has been suggested that businesses offer " work experience programs " .
It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but also because of the experience that it could bring them .
Some businesses require experienced employees and if young people have it , they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
So , including experience in the CV , seems to me , a step further in the student ' s career .
Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualifications .
Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a job involves .But sometimes , universities give them more theoretical training instead of the practical training which businesses are looking for .
Generally speaking , students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience .
I would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of " training " for their work life and some theoretical knowledge .
They have to learn the skills that a job involves and the only way to get this is by practicing .
Nowadays , we have " n " number of international sports where one can prove one 's own talent and socialise .
The fun in this game is that you need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait until the opponent responds to it .
My suggestion for people who want to start badminton as a hobby , firstly one needs to know the rules and regulations of the game .
As it 's a mind - set game , the player needs to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
To be a successful player , one has to learn some tricks which help make the game easier .
Thus , pushing themselves leads to success .
I am very pleased to hear that you finally managed to open your restaurant .
I 'm really sorry that I can not accept your offer to work at your restaurant .
But I have someone in mind that can help you at the restaurant . It 's my sister Sorina . You met her at my party . She is a lovely girl , hard working , flexible . You will love working with her .
She has a lot of experience . She worked in a restaurant for 5 years and can also cook .
Let me know if you are interested in getting to know her better .
In Vietnam , many places are worth travelling to , such as Da Lat , Sa Pa , or especially Ninh Thuan .
VH Bay in Ninh Thuan is seen as one of the best bays in Vietnam , so I especially recommend you to go there .
To experience it well , you should stay there at least three days .
Besides , you could sell your own food on the streets , which sounds very interesting .
Every Monday a different guest speaker is invited to the Film Club to manage the discussion over a good drink , thanks to the Coffee Bar 's special late opening .
For the next season there 's going to be a new cycle about WWII and Tom Hanks and Matt Damon will visit the Film Club to speak about the film in which they appeared : " Saving Private Ryan " , and their process for getting involved in their characters for realistic acting .
CONCLUSION
If you love the cinema or if you only want to take a break from your daily routine and meet new people and make new friends , you should n't miss this great opportunity to turn a grey Monday into an amazing start to the week .
I 'm suggesting you choose between two different places : the beach or the mountains .
First of all , remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess ( Spanish omelette , fried chicken breast , sandwiches , chips ... ) and , also , you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming , jumping the waves , surfing and so on .
Playing in the sand , burying one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors .
However , if you do n't like sand at all , you can choose the other option in the mountains .
Furthermore , going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy city life , too .
So , which one of these two places would you choose ?
In my opinion , no matter where you go , just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful , amazing even unforgettable time .
The purpose of this report is to showcase the ways in which energy consumption is reduced , together with the saving of natural resources in my city .
In Cluj , each year , during the summer , the local authorities give citizens the opportunity to rent bicycles , something that can reduce the air pollution produced by car exhaust .
Surprisingly , people support this project and every year the number of bicycles rented rises .
The local authorities could also organise events in which they can encourage people to start saving natural resources like water , or to convince people that power consumption can be reduced in many other ways .
La Cacharrería is a small , Spanish restaurant in the old town of Cáceres .
The tables are small and tall but they are comfortable .
The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed .
La Cacharreriaes is a tapas restaurant , so you can choose lots of different small dishes and share them .
The service at La Cacharreria is very good .
Another thing about this restaurant is that it is cheap , about 20E per person .
La Cacharrería has a disadvantage : you ca n't reserve a table and it is very popular .
I recommend La Cacharería , because it is a great place for a quiet meal with friends .
Different factors such as stress , psychological problems , noise , lights , do not let you rest .
I do not have trouble sleeping , or suffer from interrupted sleep .
I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and , that way , I will see improvement .
There are different medications or even natural things to improve these conditions .
Implementing each piece of advice and telling others about your improvements , is a good way to help others .
Some people think there is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars actually have many advantages .
The main reason to think there is a future for public transport is that , according to ecologists , we must cut down the massive use of cars .
So , public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport , but we 'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in acceptable conditions .
Please find below clarification related to the below issue :
During a meeting with the head of department in MOH , I was complaining about servicing of the microscope by their staff ( almost 99.9% from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract , and handling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested providing the required training for all his staff , in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service .
The next day I received a call from one of the technicians , Mr. Humam Altannous ( who has a compliant against us ) , asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lab ( which are not under warranty or contract ) .
But he is not ready to accept this and is asking us to go and repair the unit without any repair request being issued . Please note that our telephone conversation was for only 2 minutes and during this conversation he was misbehaving and mistreating me and hung up the phone ) .
He did not ask any manual / trouble - shooting instruction during our call , which he mentioned in his email .
The next day I complained about him to the head of the department . It was only during that time I got to know that he is one of the technicians who is taking care of repairs of the microscopes in the department , and his manager requested me not to repair any unit without an official request , and he would come back to me regarding my complaint against his employee .
We hope that the above explanation is sufficiently clear and exhaustive .
Thanks for your kind understanding
Because there will be an international festival for young people in our region , I have written this report in order to find out the their preferences and the trends which are in nowadays .
Firstly , I asked about the music that is listened to and about their favourite styles and groups and the results showed us that they are n't similar compared to the music they liked a few years ago .
In fact , they can hardly ever define themselves as pop fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plenty of girls who were interviewed told us they could n't stand reggaeton music , but they usually want to listen to it at discos because they can dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't have a musical culture and magnificent bands like the Rolling Stones are going to have to remain in oblivion .
Secondly , I debated with young people about the television programmes that are watched currently .
Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people , in order to gossip about them .
However , documentaries are being forgotten and only twenty - six percent of them would like to watch more interesting TV series like Lost .
Actually , unlike music , young people feel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by which clothes are being worn .
Nowadays , everyone uses the Internet and apps everywhere .
In addition , it is very easy to make friends and communicate with somebody .
Furthermore , if you are a shy person , this way is very useful for you because you can talk more directly with someone .
Secondly , if you use the Internet to meet new people , it 's a good way to find people with similar interests . You can enter an app and you can describe what you look like and someone will be interested in you .
In conclusion , I agree that the Internet is a good way to meet friends because you can get to know a lot of people around the world .
The statement - ' There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . ' can be discussed in relation to two different aspects .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and this can be attributed to a lot of factors , such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
On the other hand , if I were travelling to see my friends or family in a nearby town or just on a holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
If you are travelling in your car , it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination , you can make any number of stops , and even stop for your favorite ice cream .
In future , the environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these modes of transport .
Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints ; they are trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative will definitely help countries to reduce pollution .
This is the reason why government decisions about education play an essential role . I have always thought that it should be accessible to all .
I studied in a state school and I believe that I got a good education , not only academic training but also strong principles to live in society .
From my point of view , I feel like we are losing important things like the effort to achieve goals or respect for everyone .
For instance , knowing other languages , like English , is increasing day by day .
There are many reasons for travelling , and to travel from one place to another people use different means .
The users of transport means differ . The public ones are able to carry large numbers of travelers , whereas the private means are used by very small numbers of people .
All these points support the importance of public means of transport , and demonstrate how useful they are .
In my view , public transport will keep on offering their services , and will never be affected by the appearance of private means .
Introduction :
This report is intended to evaluate the Active Leisure Club and to give some suggestions regarding the Club 's new facilities .
I believe that should be borne in mind when the new facilities are built .
The Club offers a wide range of activities to spend time doing .
Those activities developed my interest in sports and nature .
The staff must also be congratulated .
Everyone in the organisation is kind , helpful and cheerful .
Recommendations :
Although the facilities are well organised , they are too small , because more and more people are becoming members of the club .
However , the advantages outweigh the worst aspects and I will be happy to join the club again next Summer .
Thanks a lot for your letter ! I am pleased to hear that everything is well with you and that you are coming to Poland .
I 'm very sorry that I haven't replied earlier , but I was having a hard time at university .
In my opinion , Poland is beautiful country , so you will not be disappointed ! I would recommend you starting your trip in Poznan .
If I were you , I would start looking for a job by checking local advertisements on the Internet .
I am writing in reference to the advertisement for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , in order to apply for the job .
I am also a talented cook for kids . My view is also trying to convince them that cooking is fun and sometimes they ask me to teach them how to make basic dishes , such as omelettes , spaghetti and more .
I appreciate your attention to this letter . Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions .
Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life . You focus on the competition and it is like having a rest from everyday life .
In conclusion , personally , despite the danger of some sports , doing sports is by far better than just sitting in your house and watching them .
I 'm so glad to hear that you are giving me an opportunity to make your club facilities better .
It would be a great chance for your club to share my ideas to improve your facilities .
1 . All the people who work in the club are attentive and professional
2 . The facilities are cheap to use
The temperature of the changing room is too low
The problem with this mansion is that it hides a lot of secrets and mysteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners , who are a family whose husband went to war and died . So the real occupants of the house are Nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister Anne , who turns out to be one of the most important characters in the film , and their mother , who is called Grace and has a particular obsession with catholisism .
The other characters that also play an important part in the movie are the servants .
The film describes how the love that a mother can give to her children can easily turn into an obsession . However , what makes this film so special is that it pretends to be a typical horror movie , but in its final scene , there is a sudden change which makes it more interesting .
It was made in the right place for such an unexpected film as it was made in a big manor on an abandoned foggy island .
I would recommend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared , because it is not like the rest of the horror movies . It is a film in which you are continuously discovering secrets as if you were another character .
At first , this transport was greatly appreciated .
Everyone felt so delighted , but unfortunately , now people feel uncomfortable when it comes to travelling by public transport .
Today , every single person is keen to earn as much money as they can and the interesting part is that this eagerness is increasing day by day , and so is their income .
And people feel comfortable in their own vehicle .
The main advantage of having your own transport is that you do not have to wait for public transport . You can save time as you only need to accelerate your own transport and drive to your destination .
Public transport is slow now , even though it is very comfortable , but unfortunately , people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class were to travel on public transport , it would affect their status .
But still there are so many people who use public transport frequently , but that is only their compulsion and poverty .
If they were financially stable , they would surely buy their own vehicle .
Exhaust fumes are one of the great problems for the environment .
Firstly , many people think public transport has no future because travelling by car is faster and more independent .
Secondly , people think buying a car is a cheaper option in the long term than travelling by public transport every day .
However , a lot of people are becoming more and more conscientious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of the most important reasons is precisely to take care of the environment .
Public transportation is the most popular way of travelling to places .
These modes of transportation can easily be found anywhere to reach your destination .
On the other hand , travelling by car is more convenient and safe .
Travelling by car is preferred by some people because of its convenience and advantages .
In addition to this , we do n't have to spend too much time looking for a bus which will go specifically to our destination .
But we can not deny the fact that public transportation has been around for years and in every country as a means of travel .
Most people prefer this kind of transport , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
I disagree that there is no future for public transportation as it is still widely used all over the world .
Moreover , this has helped a lot of people , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
However , public transportation in the future might be improved and developed and will still be used by many people .
The side effect of depending only on cars as our main means of transportation are remarkable .
We should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has a huge number of cars on its streets and this number is going up rapidly . Having this huge increase in cars will impact badly on public health & the environment and infrastructure .
It is more convenient with modern lifestyle to travel in a car because of the privacy and independence.the remarkable development of cars ' luxury features and other options .
However , it will be over cost in full , car service and the effort of concentration on driving . All of these negative points can easily be avoided by using public transportation . It should be cheaper than using your own car , you do not have to look after it , and you can do activities while you are on it , like reading or chatting with your friends or making important phone calls .
The environmental impact is an important factor we should consider . Having this number of cars is like having thousands of factories on our streets giving out tons of CO2 gas and many other polluting gases . The speed of new trains or planes or even buses is now competing with car speeds and is even faster than cars in a lot of places .
Using public transportation is better than using individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury facilities . Extending the use of electric cars and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environmental pollution as much as we can .
It was so impressive .
Hope my thoughts will be interesting for you .
As for my personal experience of sports , I do n't do it professionally .
Most of all , I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton .
There was a time when I used to visit a volleyball club , but I gave it up .
It 's easy , interesting and fun .
It makes my day more productive .
It 's also good for the cardiovascular system .
I 'm absolutely convinced everyone should realize that the most important thing is their health and sport really can help .
Predictable , some of the solutions will remain intact .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comfort .
Nonetheless , changes will be visible on the interior as well as the exterior .
Buildings will become smaller , yet more functional and organised .
Furthermore , they will be ecological , the main reason being the use of renewable sources of energy .
As a matter of fact , reduction of living space will not be noticeable due to thinner walls .
The electronic devices will undergo the most obvious changes .
All electronic devices will be controlled by the voice or thoughts .
I am writing this letter because I am concerned about facilities for shoppers in our area .
I also appreciate that it is located near to the housing estate .
Unfortunately , I think there are some aspects that demand improvements .
Furthermore , the shopping area lacks restaurants and entertainment facilities .
People usually become hungry after shopping , so opening eating places in this area would be very beneficial .
In addition , the shops arrangement is actually very messy and finding the store I need is hard .
Moreover , you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area into certain sections ( e.g. clothes , food , and house ) .
Finally , opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainment facilities like movie theatres and gyms should be considered .
Yours faithfully ,
My favourite sport is undoubtedly jogging .
They can begin to jog for 15 minutes and then increase the time so that their body can get used to the muscular effort .
Furthermore , it would be useful to have a chronometer to check out your improvement .
If you prefer , you can substitute stretching with a few yoga exercises as well .
Personally I do not completely agree with this way of thinking .
The prices in the shops are often very high and clothes are not good quality .
Also , you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets .
Otherwise , you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need , everything on the rack is calling for your attention , after a while you want to buy everything .
Also , you can always return it , like in the physical stores .
The diagrams illustrate the process of making bank notes .
The first step is design , which includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then they move to the next step ; preparation of metal plates . Skilled machinists are needed in this process .
Printing is quite closely related to the first two steps , because the design and skilled machinists should both be considered .
The most important step is inspection , where printed sheets have to be inspected manually and carefully .
However , there is a big difference between these three types .
If the quality of sheets and bank notes is good , then they will be packaged and distributed .
Conversely , bad sheets and bank notes will be destroyed .
Dear Sir / Madam
My name is Elvira Vergara and I am applying for the job in the summer camp in your advertisement .
In addition , I am very keen on children and teach them the marvels of the environment .
I have worked in out - of - school activities before and in other summer camps in the south of America , too .
There are so many options on television that sometimes it 's hard to make up your mind , do n't you think ?
You can watch international channels and live shows around the world , something that in the past would have been too good to be true .
Even knowing that not too much has changed our options nowadays still make television a very good tool to get the family together and have an enjoyable time .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received when I spent a night at your hotel on 20th March 2014 .
Firstly , I must inform you that I was dissatisfied with the hotel receptionist , because he forgot to place my wake - up call and , as a result , I overslept and I missed my flight .
Furthermore , I was late for a very important appointment and I lost a lot of money .
I am writing to inform you about one of the most interesting places in our town .
There are a lot outstanding views and places worth visiting but let me tell you about the Warriors Museum .
The breathing landscapes you can see from the museum are also a great advantage .
Yours faithfully ,
The first time I did Muay Thai was 5 years ago . At that time , I was n't sure about doing it because I did n't consider myself strong enough for fighting , that 's what most young people think , at least in Mexico and some other countries , and that 's one reason why people do n't do Muay Thai and it is not well known .
It was hard at the beginning , just like when you start doing anything new , so here are some tips if you want to start doing Muay Thai .
When you do any sport , you have to be confident in yourself , without confidence you will not have any progress .
You know you like a sport when you enjoy it and you feel comfortable doing it , that 's what I recommend you do . Enjoy yourself and be happy doing it , because Muay Thai is a beautiful sport !
I am an economics student at National Chung Cheng University , which is in Taiwan .
I would like to be a graduate school student of Financial Accounting at The University of Texas at Austin .
The reason why I want to change my major is that I found that I had a bigger interest in Accounting than in economics when I studied in the first year of university .
So , if I can join your school , I will cherish this opportunity and work hard in school .
At university , my accounting grade was better than others .
As a result , I enjoy studying accounting .
Also , I have some work experience that is relevant to Accounting .
My first job was as an assistant to my financial accounting professor .
My job was to find the company 's financial statement that corresponded to a news report .
My work was to close the accounts every day , so my carefulness had to be improved during the time , because the money did n't belong to me .
I think patience and carefulness are two pivotal personal traits to major in financial accounting .
I believe my work experience can help me to be a better graduate school student of financial accounting .
This is a nervous and exciting decision for me , but I wo n't regret it and I am ready to join the field of Accounting and to be a graduate school student .
He 's been doing great in both academic and extra - curricular activities in the school .
He has been one of the players of basketball from when he was an elementary student until now he 's in college .
As the tournament began , he 'd been getting high points for his team , and because of that nice contribution they had won the game .
It had been a very intense and tiring day for all of them but Mike felt he had achieved something really good because fortunately he was the most valuable player too .
He 's not only doing excellently as a student , but he 's known as one of the most popular students because he works voluntarily as a coach for the younger kids in his town .
He wants other kids to be inspired also in everything they are capable of doing .
So in their generation they have something good that they contribute to society at their very young age .
For him , it 's absolutely right to begin doing something meaningful in their lives .
A mistake is something you may do unintentionally . However , people believe that mistakes can later be improved or ignored , whereas sometimes we may make mistakes that could break somebody 's heart .
Who was not only fair but a very attractive girl .
And they both had a great understanding . However , this innocent girl had caught the attention of all the viewers including these two .
Michael could not digest this fact , since he could not compromise on anything .
Do not do such a thing that would make you regret it later " , Henry said .
Henry fell down and his head was injured . Michael left him to bleed profusely and later a pedestrian saw his body , tried to check his pulse rate , but found that he was dead .
Later , the girl discovered that Michael was behind the incident .
If you are old enough , you can see how far technology has progressed in the last 20 years .
As a rule , a friend or psychologist plays this role .
We must pay to receive a psychologist 's attention , but friendship is free of charge .
What if you 're alone and no one can understand you ( and you have no money and insurance to visit a psychologist ) ?
He is still in his twenties and he has studied computer engineering .
He had everything that any person would want to have : living abroad , earning a lot of money , having a partner , working for an international company , and so on .
At night , we can stay at home , as you said , and also we can buy chocolates and watch a movie . That 's great for me !
Finally , I 'm afraid my parents ca n't bring me to your home on Friday evening because it 's my grandfather 's birthday .
The population grows , with more business skyscrapers , residential houses and advanced transportation , at the cost of diminishing farmland and wetland as well as deforestation .
Though the modern cities are emerging rapidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the environment are severely various .
The red coral reef off the coast of Australia , for instance , serves as a shelter for algae and other tiny sea fishes and an index of environmental fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there is cut off and environmental variations are gone away .
On top of that , it is the regulation capacities of the environment for temperature , moisture and even sandstorms are eroding as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen into the whole system .
What 's more , extreme weather occurs with EL NINO periodically causing catastrophic floods in northern cities in China and long - lasting drought in South American .
Because the population density is increasing all the time currently , the losses triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family .
In a bid to address these side effects that civilization has brought about , governments must take measures step by step to tackle them .
Firstly , governing authorities should set up protection areas for animals and plants , banning hunting or even leisure activities like hiking .
Secondly , the government must fund environmental organizations , in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop illegal hunting , deforestation and animal extinction .
Furthermore , the government should go out of their way to stand united in such a way that joint endeavours can be effective globally .
In conclusion , governments are supposed to balance modernization and sustainable development .
We prepared for it for a long time , but I had a wonderful experience .
The course is going to finish , so the teacher wants us to go out to a restaurant .
The choice was n't easy because the teacher is vegetarian .
In the end , we decided to go to a restaurant near the school .
The atmosphere is friendly and familiar .
Therefore , I want to say a special thank you to our teacher .
There are many kinds of cafes , ones for those who like sports , art , literature or music .
In this place , there are guys and girls attending pedagogy who organize activities to entertain children of every age .
The most popular restaurant is " Mario 's Pizza " , where you can eat delicious pizza with the topping you like best .
Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter for discussion .
At the moment of choosing , very different aspects , like ecological effects , economic viability and even time uses , take part in the decision .
Firstly , the car option is the best one in terms of comfort , because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities .
Then public transport is not as comfortable as the former , because if you 're lucky , you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour .
On the other hand , traffic is the biggest problem when talking about transport , the car 's conveniences are replaced by the need for punctuality and , depending on the city , delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or train .
However , the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience . Cars are the most expensive mode of transport .
Not only because of oil prices , but also the costs of insurance , the car , the parking fees , etc .
In comparison with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come .
To sum up , neither cars nor public transport are considered the perfect option , but considering the long term consequences , as is common nowadays in some European countries , bicycles are the best way .
Riding a bicycle reduces traffic , costs , ecological impact , and even car crashes .
it 's so kind of you to send me my favourite Glaswegian postcards !
I fancy living in a family and not in a college or in a shared flat as it will give me the opportunity to be continuously in touch with English people , day and night ; then , it is the ideal solution for me : you know I 've recently been given the sack !
What about looking for colleges which offer Wi - fi Internet connection and a proper meal at lunch ?
Looking forward to receiving your next letter , and on tenterhooks about the information you 'll provide .
Fashion , clothes style , trendy appearance , make - up , hair ...
Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our lives ; but , should it be like this ?
It is certainly true that people are very critical of appearances .
We have subjective opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconceived idea .
We match clothes style with a lifestyle and a personality .
That is why appearances should not have consequences in our lives .
However , there are people who do not follow that , and they wear the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most .
Overall , my personal opinion is that we give too much importance to clothes and appearance than we should .
Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have the freedom to choose what clothes they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our lives .
The death of public transportation
People do not think about the environment , they only think about the time that they will spend in the traffic . Scientists say the new society can be called " the fat society " because the people do not want to do any exercise , people do not walk anymore , people just use elevators , etc .
A lot of convenience , this is the reason why there is no future for public transportation , people do not want to spend a little time walking to the bus station or to get a cab . Also , the service on public transportation it is not very good because of many things like the inflation of prices , the way that the bus or cab drivers refer to the people , the way the bus or cab drivers drive , etc .
In countries like Mexico , some people have the opportunity to use Uber , which is a service that you can use if you have a credit card . It is an amazing service , but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly . In Mexico , the public transportation , in particular the cabs , are not a very secure services , because some of the drivers steal and kidnap , in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions . But despite this , it is very sad that in that place people can not do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more , so they have to take public transport .
In countries like the United States of America , people have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged social status , so for the American people , public transportation does not matter . They have the possibility to take public transportation or not , they can decide , so they decide for convenience .
The future of public transportation can be death or can be in growth , it depends on your point of view . In Mexico , maybe it will never die , but in the United States the public transportation is now dying .
She went to the kitchen and saw a beautifully prepared breakfast .
Suddenly , she remembered that for three days she had been living with Chuck - her boyfriend .
It was the first day of spring and everything was coming to life .
Fortunately , there was a mother with her child strolling behind them , and she saw Sarah get hurt .
Stephan went to the hospital immediately to see how Sarah was .
After these incidents , not only Sarah but also Stephan realized how dangerous it is when you focus on technological gadgets instead of the things around you .
They are both determined to pay more attention to their surroundings .
When I started reading I could not put it down because it is a fascinating story that grabs you .
Katniss , the protagonist , is a teenage girl of 16 who has been forced to poach to feed her family since her father died
An increasing number of people have begun to discuss success in school or work , and whether having an ability to adapt or adjust to conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge of a field of study .
The majority of people tend to claim that having excellent knowledge of the research field is the most important for school or work success .
However , does the claim really ring true , conforming the real situation ?
I find myself not in agreement with such an idea .
It is my contention that people who have the ability to adapt or adjust to conditions or circumstances have a higher likelihood of being successful in school or work .
As far as I am concerned , there are a number of reasons to support my view .
That is to say , the invention of the internet made it available to everyone in the world .
That is why it should not be the key point that is considered the key to success .
To explain , there is a trend that many universities all over the world set up free courses for people who thirst for knowledge , also often inviting famous scholars to give a speech to the public that is open to everyone .
People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interested in .
Excellent performance in the field of study is not a determining factor for your success .
A case in point would be the latest news broadcast recently .
According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank , the percentage of people using the knowledge in the world of work that they learnt from school has surprisingly decreased in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent , a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of a half - century ago .
This phenomenon had been curiously many experts .
However , after deeper analysis , we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast changing world and the text book can not catch up with it . Knowledge changes from time to time .
Hence , this research reminds us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor for success rather than of having excellent knowledge of a field of study .
Nowadays , the statistics show that many parents are younger than in generations before .
Previously , most women used to have a baby after marrying their partners . But today , it is not so important anymore .
Actually , teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children .
Apart from this , the small difference between ages is also an advantage .
Although they have less experience , they recognize what a child wants to do .
On the other hand , a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their children without having experience of that .
However , progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life , so I believe both are good at bringing up their children .
He started to do his homework , but he had trouble concentrating as the memories came back to his mind .
It is very important to think about possibilities that could create your fortune .
In conclusion , if I have to think about one thing , which is more important in my life than the other one ,
I will always choose health , because when a person is healthy , he or she can do anything .
There are some solutions to prevent the rise in the consumption of sugar - sweetened drinks .
The National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) points out that most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar - sweetened soft drinks .
The limitation of this solution is the public may not be satisfied with this size of soft drink .
To overcome that , the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it .
This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverages decrease sugar intake efficiently .
Family education would be introduced to their kids .
The National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) reports that teenagers are the main soft drinks consumers and the most popular beverages are sugar - sweetened drinks .
In conclusion , increasing consumption of soft drinks is one of the issues to protect people from obesity .
A number of strategies could be efficient to address these problems .
If we take these measures soon and keep them up for a long time , obesity will not happen in the next generations .
We can say that Coyle 's idea is well developed thanks to two features that run through the chapter and the entire book : first of all , many significant references and specialized people are mentioned to define what " deep practice " is ( a psychologist , some experts in their own field , authors who have already analyzed that particular topic … ) ; secondly , but no less important , Coyle himself collected most of his information while visiting at least nine places , nine " hotbeds " ( 12 ) where talents grow , as a sort of collection of data gathered from laboratory experiments .
As a consequence , theory and examples proceed together in such a natural way , that the reader must undoubtedly exclaim , as if she / he were before a Sherlock Holmes investigation : " That 's it !
In my day friendships were easily made with neighbours , schoolmates and social club friends .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other , more than these virtual friendships prevailing today .
I have already experienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a charitable association established for youth friendship .
In which we had to wait more than thirty days to send and receive one message that can be exchanged these days with one button press .
I have personal experience that dates back to 1987 . In that year , I started a pen friendship with a German girl called Claudia who was 17 years old then .
The surprise is , today I am 44 years old and Claudia is 40 years old and we still correspond with each other through the modern means of Facebook and Whatsapp . Of course , we can no longer wait for thirty days when we can chat and see each other live .
In my country , I hav had two close friends since we were about 7 years old and we still have a strong friendship now .
It is not necessary to agree with each other on everything where we always debate and challenge whose opinion is correct .
Real friendships that are ever - lasting like what I actually made with my two best friends , should be founded on trust and faith .
The best of all in real friendships is to always believe in your friend 's abilities and be his real mirror for good and bad actions . He will be the same for you .
As I am in my late 20s , I 've found it hard to find a sports activity that would be neither as competitive as those in fashion in my country nor as demanding , so I could do it in my free time .
In one of the windows I found a skateboard and along came the memories of the year 2000 and the MTV channel that I was brought up on .
Recent studies found that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient when combining a bike with a train .
In addition , travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee .
On the other hand , studies showed , in many other cases and especially in irregular trips it is more convenient to use a car .
A car is unbeatable for its flexibility .
It is much easier to use a car when going shopping , or making a leisure or occasional trip .
Although there are some disadvantages to using a car , such as traffic jams and high maintenance costs .
The popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , studies say there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable .
There are those who try to avoid the use of public transport and prefer driving their own car due to the advantages it offers .
Firstly , it allows you to go somewhere directly , without finding out information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains .
Moreover , the use of your own car has more advantages . Travelling by car prevents you getting wet when the weather is rainy .
If you travelled by bus or train , you would probably spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination .
Despite the bad weather , if you travelled by car , you could park your car near your destination , so that you could arrive comfortably .
The government usually advise the population to use public transport to cut down pollution and the amount of gases which damage the atmosphere .
In addition , it is often claimed that it is cheaper than travelling by car .
Although it has some benefits , in most parts of the country , especially in the smallest towns , the public transport is not developed enough .
In my opinion , it could be useful hardly ever times , so a great number of improvements will be necessary .
.H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the needs of the people regarding a high number of properties .
First of all , to a certain degree , I agree with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in one 's grasp , because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family .
This speaks to the idea of the government or another organization having control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods .
This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and does n't necessarily break any rule of personal space .
Secondly , as I said , " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling people 's choices regarding house choice and what they can do with their houses takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should do .
In conclusion , I can not say whether or not control over people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only speaking hypothetically , without any form of testing . However , it does have its strong and weak points .
My English is improvable but by speaking I hope that I 'll do it well .
I think that I 'm good for this job , because I really socialize with children .
I like organising activities and games to make people enjoy their time .
Also I 'm very responsible and hardworking , so I would take care of the children and I would do my tasks the best I could .
Finally , I want to say that this is an important opportunity for me to learn and to do new things .
It is the world 's biggest youth cup and is held in Gothenburg in Sweden .
This centre offers various activities , like swimming pool , paddle , tennis , ritmica gym , judo , ballet ...
Furthermore , it has various coaches and a perfect timetable for parents that are busy in the daytime and for young people that need to go to classes after lessons .
This building is near the football pitch and basketball court .
In my view , it is a good location because children can do different after - school activities without moving too much .
I want to emphasize that , thanks to its full schedule and the number of coaches , adults , as well as children , can do different activities at the same time instead of having to wait .
On the other hand , the only disadvantage I can see is that there are n't activities for old people .
This centre should provide activities that do not require much physical effort for these kinds of people , like petanque or something like that .
Finally , to say that it is a perfect sports centre and inexpensive , including a range of activities .
A friendship that ends never started
Thomas , David and I were neighbours and grew up in an ordinary quiet village .
He is one of the most persevering people I know .
Thomas is a calmer person and has control over circumstances .
It 's the fastest and most comfortable way to get to your favourite destination .
I especially like to have a first class seat on a plane .
It really feels like you are in a five - star Hotel in a luxury suite and not travelling 10000 meters above the ground .
I do n't like to travel by boat , because it 's uncomfortable and it takes ages till you arrive at your destination .
I would like to talk about a diamond jewellery set that I gifted to my wife on our last wedding anniversary .
The tool to communicate with foreigners .
From my personal experience , I can say that if you learn a foreign language like English , you wo n't have a problem when you go abroad on holiday .
However , I must pay the fee and every evening it 's my commitment to study something or do my homework .
I suggest that all youngsters who want to learn another language ought to go abroad .
Young people should have an experience like this .
If you would like to spend some time travelling , my country , Spain , is a fantastic place , because the weather is good most of the year .
The main attraction in Córdoba is the Mosque . It is a building where Catholic and Arabic elements are mixed .
For a job , i recommend you travel to the coast in Cadiz , Malaga or Huelva and look for a job on the beach , because at the same time as you are on the beach , you could earn money .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Only a few long seconds spent thinking about what he had to do : he had to save the passengers .
He desperately ran through the train towards the driver .
Desperately he started to kick the door , furiously , blind with rage , harder , faster .
Fortunately , a voice from the radio was trying to contact the man .
In a hurry , he dashed to the microphone and answered the control station .
I played basketball for three years and it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun .
I enjoyed playing basketball , not only because I wanted to play a sport , but also because it 's a healthy way of living .
The advice that I would give people that would like to start playing this sport is that they should have a bit of experience of working in a team that is full of new people .
The most important thing that a person should know about this game is that a lot of intelligence is required , because you must know how to reach , how to get nearer to making your aim become reality , and that is that the team should score as often as they can to win the match and have fun .
In my opinion , this sport will always be my favourite , because it made me feel happy and have a great time with my friends , and it also kept me in good shape .
I am writing to you in response to your advertisement which I saw on the noticeboard of your school .
I like managing the conversation in a group .
I enclose my CV , which gives full details about my experience , ability and skills .
I strongly believe that research has valuable benefits for society and the environment .
For example , making life better and more comfortable .
Bachelor 's paper [ 1 ] is one of the good sources describing what research means .
First of all , researchers should be interested in what they are doing .
Being interested in the area of research leads to innovation and optimizes ideas that already exist .
Second , critical thinking , which is deep thinking about the problem and the way to solve it , is an important factor in successful research .
Also , honesty , originality , which is the ability to think critically , independence and creativity , and precision make research more valuable .
Moreover , working as a team for research , allows researchers to gain lots of research benefits .
All members of the team will get benefits and push each other to achieve the goal by giving some advice and more information .
In addition , clear , easy to understand , and precise scientific papers are one way to present , share , and discuss the ideas and results with others in a scientific environment .
Exchanging information with other researchers , via scientific papers or seminars , sometimes provides solutions for other researchers ' problems .
Researchers should not give up when they face difficult problems with the research and should keep trying different ways to solve them and they will do it in the end .
To conclude , there are some important research principles .
Whenever researchers consider most or all of them when working on the research , researchers will get results with a high precision .
Researchers experience their research as an enjoyable activity .
Second , I feel comfortable when I travel in my own car . I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy .
Furthermore , I do not worry about theft or any crime which used to happen when I traveled by train .
However , I find traveling in my own car has many more advantages than disadvantages .
Therefore , I think public transport will disappear in the future .
Immediately , I contacted their manager , asking if they could do with some help .
She said that they would need someone who can take care of their performance outfits .
In the spotlights , they all looked so beautiful !
That was what I particularly liked about that experience !
So do other people in my country , especially old people who have not got their own cars .
We can help our environment to be healthier !
I was absolutely thrilled to read that you 've got a job as a tour guide in the Congo rainforest !
I 'm sorry it has taken me so long to write , but I have been working my fingers to the bone preparing for my exams , about which I 'm annoyingly nervous .
Speaking of nervousness , I think I 've found a solution for you to shake off your nerves about using the English tenses correctly .
However , there 's no need to worry any longer , if you have a look at www.elihinkel.org/tips/tenses.htm .
On this website , you can find a clear , detailed explanation of the tenses , with illuminating animations .
I 'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there , you 'll have mastered the tenses next time we see each other .
Keep me posted on your experiences in the jungle !
Getting into your car and giving the directions and then having a stress - free drive towards your destination and letting a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore .
But are driverless cars as safe as old - fashioned cars ?
It is surely a fact that autopilots in car 's sure are handy .
It takes hours to drive to and from ; hours where one just has to concentrate on driving , hours that are futile .
Although it must be admitted that driverless vehicles are expected to help children , the blind , the elderly and others who currently can not safely drive themselves .
The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption .
It was an immense amphitheater .
Thousands of people fought as gladiators .
Today , not many amphitheaters are standing .
It is the most popular amphitheater in the whole world .
During the last year , I watched a lot of famous and priced films , so that I am prepared to follow discussions about them .
I am a communicative person and I often meet with my friends .
Among my acquaintances I have a reputation for being a friendly , positive and talkative woman .
In my job , I have daily work with groups of people and I give presentations in front of them .
I have good organizational skills and can explain things clearly in order for people to understand them easily .
Many people consider them indispensable .
In fact , a significant number of people agree that computers have made our lives much easier than before .
Computers help us with organizing our data . Also you can find any information you want very fast as it has lots of search engines .
Computers can help you with your homework by finding the information you need .
The truth is that everybody had really high expectations of him .
I have read your hotel 's advertisement about the Niagara Fall s romance package in a newspaper .
I am writing to you because I am interested in booking this service at your hotel and would like to receive some further information in advance .
First of all , could you provide me with information about the total cost of the package ?
What I am most interested in , is a room with a fall s view .
Since I want to spend a night with my partner at your hotel at the end of December , I need a confirmation on your part of providing a room at that time .
In addition , could you provide me with information about the nearest airport and about the way to get to your hotel from there ? We must know this for any case since we are going to travel by plane from Budapest , Hungary . I would be pleased if you could assist me in booking a cheap flight as well .
Yours faithfully ,
Now we are spending too much time waiting for public transport and , of course , we would like to get to our destination as fast as possible , but public transport does n't provide such a possibility for us .
Furthermore , we use personal vehicles or rent cars for travelling , because it is more convenient and gives us the feeling of independence .
I understand completely that some types of public transport such as airplanes and ships , will exist for some time .
But this is an exception , because existing technologies do not allow the usage of such personal transport as we want at this time .
First of all , my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help others .
For instance , one day I was walking in the park when I saw a girl falling down from a children 's swing in the playing area . I helped her immediately , and after I was sure that she was fine , I called her mother and told her about this incident . She thanked me a lot .
I thought she was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the same every time .
In addition , young people display altruistic behavior from the 18th month .
For example , last week I was stressed out , so I lost my phone at the university . I did not realize that until I returned home . While I was on my way to the university , my little sister prayed for me to find my phone .
Finally , scientists hypothesize that our brains are helpful enough when we can help out other people .
How are you ? I hope everything is alright .
Saving the environment
This is because human activity releases into the air substances that damage several things on our planet , such as the atmosphere and ecosystems .
Global warming , deforestation and drought are some of the consequences . Therefore , we should do countless things that appear to be meaningless , but if everyone does them we can live on a much healthier planet .
Every day , scientists try to develop new ways to improve the way we live , so that we are able to pollute the planet less .
One of the things discovered by these scientists is Eco - homes . Eco - homes are a type of home that helps us cause less damage to the planet and atmosphere in our everyday life .
It sounds a little bit strange , but by installing solar panels and other features in these homes , we live a much greener life . Undoubtedly , there will be some changes but , because we know why we are doing it , there would be no problems .
Also , the effects of those actions would be huge and would help improve the environmental situation . Nevertheless , we will still have to change some activities and be less self - centred , so that we can all work for a greater objective .
I enjoy playing this sport because it is very funny and competitive .
Furthermore , football gives you the opportunity to make friends because it is a team sport .
So wear comfortable clothes and good trainers .
There are a lot of opportunities .
You 're right , in fact it was very difficult for me but I finally took this decision because I want to have new experiences .
I'm very excited ! I 'm going to the United Kingdom in a week 's time , but I 've already made some plans for it .
Do you know any language schools ? They 're very expensive , so I will need more money .
And my parents refused to give it to me because they say I must become indipendent .
I definitely ca n't get a full - time job 'cause I want to relax and have fun .

The Vietnamese education and study system is completely different from the Australian one .
Like Asian countries , such as Korea , China , and Singapore , the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive for all students , especially for primary students .
These subjects mainly focus on math skills , grammar , writing , but there are not any courses related to life and communication skills or innovative science .
Meanwhile , the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than the Vietnamese system .
Additionally , the subjects in the school are given with the aim of developing the thinking and creativity of students .
They also play many interesting sports .
Secondly , it is not only the school but also Vietnamese parents of primary students who are expected in the education of their children .
Therefore , outside school , Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes , such as math , writing , grammar , … .
Consequently , Vietnamese children do n't have any life skills and have many health problems , such as short - sightedness , tummy - ache , spinal column … Sadly , the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short - sighted has tended to increase in recent years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents also care about their children but in a different way to Vietnamese parents .
Outside school , they send their kids to sports centres or social activities .
To sum up , Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children . I think that primary students need to spend more time playing and enjoying their childhood .
My first time was an exciting experience I will never forget : the touch of the rock , the height , the pain in your fingers ... I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive , even if sometimes I feel fear .
But do n't think that climbing is a dangerous activity!. Although you climb to the top of a rock wall , you always do it with checked safety equipment .
Moreover , climbing is a sport in which it 's not too important if you are a man or a woman , because you do n't only use your strength but also your balance .
You should try this amusing and thrilling sport because it 's a sort of competition with yourself : every day a little bit higher , every day a little bit more difficult .
I love holidays and summer , the season I like best because of a lot of things . In summer I always go to the mountains , to my grandparents ' house , where I have fun with my uncles and cousins .
Grandma 's food is great and I spend days staying outside , playing badminton or volleyball or having a walk in the woods .
But what I love best are the afternoons with my favourite cousin , Sara , and her brother , Luke .
I have recently watched The Ultiamtum of Bourne and I 'm so excited to share it with you . I believe you 'll absolutely love it .
Eventually , he reads about a journalist who is writing about him and a program called Black Brare .
Just before the assets get the journalist , Jason Bourne helps him to escape .
He tries to get some information from the guy , but unfortunately a sniper shoots him dead .
I will not tell you what happens afterwards so as not to spoil it for you .
Throughout my life , I have lived in a few cities and villages located in the South of Russia .
Each of the cities has a unique set of means of transport .
In villages , the only means of public transportation is small buses , most of which can carry up to twenty passengers at any moment of time .
In regional centers , most people commute on trolleybuses and trams .
The latter is the transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely waste time in traffic jams thanks to dedicated railway lines .
Those who are not satisfied with the public transportation system may use private vehicles .
I absolutely love children and they honestly love me ; I think it is a sort of a gift , because not all people love children and can get on well with them .
I 've had a little bit of experience of summer babysitting for some kids . In Italy it is more difficult to be a babysitter because , if you are underage , parents should take responsibility for you , so it is better to be over 18 .
During those few times through which I built up my experience , we all played together and we cooked together , so I taught them how to make some chicken and some pasta in the Italian way .
One of my characteristics is that I 'm a very precise person . For example , I enjoy making lists because they make my mind clearer , and I strictly follow what I wrote so everything , hopefully , ends well .
It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship with the horse you ride .
If you provide confidence , the horse will trust you .
With this reliance , you can go through everything together .
Surely this is not everything .
As the production of cars has increased , it seems that the need for public transportation has declined .
Unfortunately , there is a certain limit to space , so it is not possible that everyone can use their car every day , especially in mega cities like Seoul , New York , and London .
It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway , because you do n't have to worry about your car while working .
It is related to the environmental issues .
There are so many kinds of problems which environmental pollution causes .
Surely , the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means .
Moreover , it is quite likely that people will need more public transport than private transport .
I am a very active person and I am accustomed to doing different kinds of sports activities , such as swimming and riding .
I consider myself a responsible person with the ability to face any kinds of problems .
As for languages , I speak native Spanish and Catalan and also I speak French and German fluently and recently I passed the First certificate in English .
I feel that I have the right experience and qualifications to do this job .
If you think that I am the most suitable person to be recruited , I would be interested to hear from you .
Yours faithfully ,
This topic leads me to think of the professional skill " Architecture design " .
This results in different views on whether people agree that the best things for improving people 's lives have already taken place .
I hold the belief that the topic is completely wrong for me , even if some improvements are easy to use and solve most problems .
First , the growth of the population still continues , the space for living is still a serious problem , although the skyscraper has already solved most problems related to the population crisis .
On the other hand , the skyscraper causes more problems , such as pollution .
For example , I designed the high - rise architecture in a highly populated city in Taiwan .
The skyscraper provides more space for excess population . However , the building will produce more pollution if the skyscrapers are constructed from modern materials , such as steel and concrete .
They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site .
The pollution will harm the local people and the environment from the site of raw materials .
This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only moves to other regions and types .
Second , computer systems look like they solve most problems . However , these systems are more dangerous in specific situations .
A " BUG " may appear from a man - made system because of incomplete coding .
That is why our personal information always leaks to the " hacker " .
For instance , when we enjoy the electronic commerce and shop for goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal private information at the same time .
They will use that information to steal people 's money over the phone and we will trust them because they have the correct personal information .
This is a normal phenomenon in Taiwan . However , the police ca n't do anything because of the hacker 's anonymity .
That is why I said that the best improvements still do not exist , even though computer systems have already solved some problems .
That being said , I still feel the reasons I have presented are strong ones , such as architecture and computer systems .
As soon as I read the letter about your problem , I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions , since I have a similar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongly that daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be in shape .
For example , you could go on foot or on your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead . By doing this , you will burn more and more calories daily without special equipment and having fun with your pals .
Furthermore , if I were you , I would go with joining a health club .
As a result , you will save time and embarrassment , especially if you are out of shape .
You will not feel self - confident and happy , but your outward appearance will be better .
Friendship today
Friendship is actually a really important issue nowadays .
In my opinion , the best way to develop your new friendship is meeting them ; having a coffee , a drink or whatever .
For all of these reasons , we have to take care of our friendships these days and social networks are OK for being in touch with your friends . But if you want to make new ones .
Money : essential for youngsters ?
A new , tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for college or to embark on their professional career .
We have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this younger generation .
Why do we call them youngsters ?
I 'm not dismissing the idea of financial aid , though .
What I 'm doing is challenging the way we approach it .
We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time as we help the next generation to succeed by their own means .
If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid their growing lazy , then financial relief is welcome .
Undoubtedly , I 'm presenting a major challenge to every parent : will we be able to take care of youngsters and yet teach them that money does n't grow on trees ?
Money is almost essential , but the way young people learn to interact with it is essential to shaping a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort .
The Tuesday was an extraordinary beach day .
All day I was lying on the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredible time with them .
Those two day were family days . I had to go to the church to a mess which represents the last days alive of Jesus Christ : the last supper and the passion .
Travelling by car is so much more convenient if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
Imagine going by car to cities like London . Is the car more convenient ?
In the last few years , public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology , flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables , tickets and destinations .
Besides these , public transport is better for the environment , especially the electric bus .
The electric bus is an option in many countries as a way to improve the environment .
This type of transport is a great contribution to the environment , because it 's cleaner than those that need petrol or diesel to work .
The subject of the environment is very important nowadays and can cost a country a lot .
A country has to pay for their carbon footprint and this means the more pollution is produced , the more the environmental damage . In other words a , bigger carbon footprint means more has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental policies in order to decrease the cost of carbon footprints .
Such policies will involve taxes on polluting cars , the increasing of fuel prices and the introduction of benefits for those who opt for more environmental means of transport .
So , the convenience of travelling by car is not entirely true .
Of course , you are in control of your time and destinations , but is it enough ?
Think about its impact on your finances and on the environment . Would n't it be better to take a bus , the underground , or a train ?
I have worked in various activities like this . For example , in a famous basketball team as a volunteer , or in the hospital with children and their parents who live there .
I consider myself a fun , communicative and responsible person with experience in these kinds of activities , and who can help with all the things you need .
These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading throughout mankind 's history .
Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea , this article focuses on the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain .
First of all , the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimuli .
However , reading is the most important stimulus to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind .
For instance , when you read , you have to associate characters and places , and memorize details .
Those kinds of things help the brain to be more active and process information faster .
Secondly , there is some research that proves that , in general , people who read are smarter than people who do not .
This statement is based on the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain by reading books .
This is another big reason to care about reading , because in this competitive world , only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society .
Thirdly , when people read , they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what 's going on .
That situation is another example of how reading is an excellent brain exercise , because when people have to imagine things , the brain has to be creative , and that kind of process is very important to improve yourself in problem solving and the creation of important ideas in real life .
There are many good movies , thrillers , especially , are always enjoyable in my opinion .
One of those is the movie ' Silence of the Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBI agent in training , has been asked to talk to an imprisoned Hannibal Lecter who has information about a serial killer the FBI has been trying to catch .
First , I was really impressed by the performances of Jodi Foster ( Clarice ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
Not only in their individual roles , but also in the scenes they did together .
Secondly , the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and , because of that , really enjoyable .
You had to pay attention throughout the entire movie to keep up with the story .
This movie is outstanding . I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it .
As I mentioned before , both the acting and the storyline are really impressive .
How was your first English literature lesson at school ? I hope it was loads of fun with plenty of new knowledge acquired !
I learnt about the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London , as well as the life of William Shakespeare .
You may think theatres were fashionable place for royalty , courtiers and merchants .
During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I , play watching was an entertainment for the locals to relax .
These actors paid full attention to convincing the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting .
They used props , thick make - up , gowns , wigs and all sorts of accessories .
The ' Juliets ' even had to shave their beard and moustache and enjoy their role throughout the play .
What a gargantuan sacrifice of self - esteem and reputation they made !
One more interesting fact is that both the lovers in the play were Italians , but their playwright had never been to Italy .
It could reflect the fact that 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in contact with Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors .
Three trumpet blasts were given to symbolize the start of a play , yet none of the respected silence would be given .
Cannonballs were rolled around to make the sound of thunder .
Pig 's blood was used for casualties or deaths in sword fights .
Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter , romance , and tragedies .
The play lover King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men .
By now , I have widened my horizons and increased my interest in the spotlight on playhouses .
As you asked I am going to give information on how my village looks after the environment .
My village has been working on this project for decades . They have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort , we started with the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an area where the population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when it comes to taking care of the environment .
All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) . Every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy that provides part of the energy to each house on the days that the sun shines , but if there is no sun , the village has a dam beside it which provides us with enough water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only do we have hydraulic energy , but also wind energy ; on the outskirts of the village , there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .
Also , our water has one of the best purification methods . After we use it , we clean it so we do n't contaminate the water of the river or dam .
To try to keep the environment clean , we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking up all the rubbish and checking the whole area in case there is something not normal .
Apart from this group of volunteers , every person in the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as low as possible . Here the bicycle is the most popular mode of transport . Cars are n't common . They are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances .
Some people think that buying things is very boring and unnecessary .
The first advantage of buying new things in shops is that it is very satisfying , in particular for women .
Many of them are relaxed when they are searching for new , remarkable clothes .
We would buy next , impractical high - heel shoes , which will spend a couple of years in the wardrobe .
The last but not least disadvantage of doing shopping , is that in the mall could prowl many pickpockets , and they could rob us .
In conclusion , buying new things is a good idea to spend an interesting time with friends , but we could also lose a lot of money .
Personally , I do not agree with the statement " shopping is not always enjoyable " , because I like this way of spending leisure time , for instance , with my mom or friends .
This bar chart deals with the costs of three different photocopiers .
Interestingly , the purchase price of " Carde " and " KD " is almost the same .
All the photocopiers show a very low warranty price .
The reasons for this are its low warranty cost and in particular its low running costs .
The kenn running expenses will compensate for the purchase price in the future .
Many people claim that wearing fashionable clothes is very important .
They spend a fortune on outfits and wait to be admired and appreciated .
I agree with the idea that clothes can help with expressing ourselves .
It is very important to choose those items which represent your personality .
In this way , they represent originality just by using their creativity .
The most significant thing is that it is not what makes you beautiful .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter ran into his father 's arms , but he disappeared and he promised himself that he would never ever tell anyone about the secret .
I do not think that there is no future for public transport because not all people can have a car , especially poor people in a developing country .
In addition , some people do not like travelling in their private cars on the highways because they fear accidents .
But on the other hand , l agree to some extent that travelling in my private car is much more convenient .
I can travel at any time without being restricted to specific times , and l can rest at any cafe to drink my favorite coffee .
I enjoy using GPS when travelling on my own to explore new places .
Consequently , we can not dispense with public transport , even if some of us would rather use our private cars .
Some non - building areas , in some countries , are now occupied by housing and other residential buildings .
Human beings need more natural environment to live better and to ensure the standard of living .
Inhabitants can go to the countryside to have a picnic or excursion with their friends or families to relax .
The consequence is that they can easily get sick in modern buildings , which will influence their mental health , and even worse .
Without a pleasant place to live , they are facing extinction .
As a result , some of the most vulnerable species will face dying out .
For governments , restrictions on exploring human land is one of the ways to solve these problems .
Policy - makers could enact a law to reduce land development .
In conclusion , a wide range of buildings and constructions can not only destroy our own living environment , but also that of animals .
Governments are responsible for solving these problems to achieve harmony between man , nature and animals .

Eventually , they came to the lake on the suburbs and then she saw something unexpected .
First , she noticed only a big tranparent with the title " Happy birthday Anna ! "

It is hard to believe during the time of segregation , black people were treated as second - class citizens not only in real life but also in the constitution .
The movie revealed the ironic reality and the ignorance and stupidity of some unkind people during segregation .
I had heard about slavery , discrimination , hate crimes against black people , but I did not know what really happened at that time .
I know the first person who ended segregation in the south was a 9-year - old girl .
What if I was an African - American ? What if I had been born during segregation ?
Would I be brave , determined ?
I was born and raised in China . Being a Chinese person , it is our obligation to remember what Japanese soldiers did to us during World War II .
It was the first day of Max 's school excursion to Patagonia . They had arrived there the night before , but today was the day they would actually go exploring .
When they got to the location , the guide decided to call the wildlife protection in that area to come help .
Once the wildlife protection had been able to help the puma , everyone congratulated Max for his bravery and help .
The last documentary I saw was a documentary by National Geographic called Ocean .
It was about life in the ocean and the consequences of climate change .
The first thing I learnt was that we are destroying the Earth and , especially , the oceans .
So , overall , I would recommend this documentary to everybody because everyone must know what we are doing to the Earth and they must learn to look after it because we only have one Earth and if we destroy it , we wo n't have any place where we can live .
I conduct group and individual training in Hatha Yoga and Thai Yoga ( Ruesi Dat Ton ) .
I am also a Therapeutic Thai massage professional .
All my yoga lessons and massage sessions are conducted in line with the Correct Approach to Spine ( CAS ) method , so they are very safe and based on scientific theory .
Safety and knowledge of body mechanics are very important to the CAS vision as they give a feeling of confidence and understanding to yoga practitioners .
I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of yoga and four years of teaching .
I practised Ashtanga and Iyengar 's styles of yoga and Ruesi Dat Ton ( yoga of Thai hermits ) , learned different approaches during my training in India and Thailand , and my practice brought me to Classical Yoga - Correct Approach to Spine school , the way of exercising I found the safest , the most beneficial for health and scientifically grounded .
For me , the practitioner 's safety is one of the most important things , as ahimsa ( non harm ) is one of the crucial principles of yoga .

My husband and I appreciate very much that you are receptive to new ideas .
As you know , we frequently visit your Health and Fitness Club .
Can you imagine that we were a bit disappointed when we read your plans to build a second sauna cabin beside the swimming pool ?
For them ( or do I have to admit us ) , it would be a better idea to build a changing room with more space in that particular place .
In addition , your proposal to provide additional equipment for the gym and a widescreen TV for the snack bar did not get applause in our home .
Maybe you could consider updating it with new classes , such as kickboxing .
Thank you once again for allowing us to give our suggestions for your wonderful place .
I read your advertisement on your internet Website .
I am good at organizing and I am able to get to know a lot of people in a short time .
I would like to have a meeting with you to explain my skills to you in more detail and I 'll also bring you a copy of my Curriculum Vitae .
They began to plan some adventures together .
He must go to a certain place , recover a suitcase and send it to Casablanca .
She said it was a present for her aunt , who lives in Casablanca .
He took the case and planned to travel to Casablanca the next weekend , taking advantage of a bank holiday on Monday .
This would cause global warming , causing the disappearance of winter .
I live right by the sea and I 've been working in restaurants and pubs since I was 16 , where I learned to cook and serve tables .
I am the eldest of four brothers and sisters and I used to take care of them when my parents were at work , especially because I love babysitting !
I can cook and I like organizing sports and different types of activities , so I think I would be really suitable to work for you .
I can speak English and German and I am a really hardworking girl , always happy and cheerful with everybody .
I attach my English C.V. so you can read my references and my past experience .
Homes of the future will definitely be different from those in which we live currently .
For sure , technology will play the main role in every home .
Everything will work remotely ; lightning , heating - probably there will be a possibility to program everything by time , day , month and so on .
All appliances will be eco - friendly .
There will not be a home without air - conditioning anymore .
Room configurations and style will be somewhat different - more glazing , more open spaces .
Unfortunately , we ca n't know that for sure .
One year ago , Robert Stromerg directed " Maleficent " , from the film " Sleeping beauty " .
The film is about Maleficent , who becomes bad because she is abused by Stefan , her true love .
Later , Stefan becomes King and decides to cut down the magic forest , where lives Maleficent .
Maleficent finds Aurora and they become friends .
When Aurora is sixteen , she falls asleep because Maleficent had cast a spell when Aurora was young .
Maleficent is sad and she makes apologies and she kisses Aurora .
Finally , Maleficent overpowers Stefan .
At the end , Aurora lives with Maleficent in the magic forest .
The cast is excellent and the color in the photography is spectacular .
I think learning is like a weapon for any individual and enables him to be like a champion .
Learning has no end . We spend all of our lives learning from circumstances we face .
Learning not only means studying in schools , universities , etc .
This can be easy only when you are determined to achieve what you want .
This composition is about a famous person from my country .
I chose this man because he was a significant player during the slave trade .
He fought for the liberation of slavery in West Africa .
This has led to many black Americans visiting the Gambia for investment purposes .
He was captured while hunting with his colleagues in the forest .
He worked very hard in the sugar plantation for the slave master .
He was later given the opportunity to learn English .
He did very well during their exam and was given another opportunity to teach English to other slaves .
He was famous and respected in the slave camp .
He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolition of slavery .
He died during the demonstration .
Because of his efforts that led to the abolition of slavery and freedom for captured slaves in the camp .
The Gambia is well known to adventurers and tourists .
Most people use public transport to go to their workplace and travel around the city .
Mostly , they prefer to use public transport more than the car because it can avoid the traffic jams and save time to get to their workplace earlier .
In view of all of these points , it is not wrong to say that public transport is still available and very useful in our daily life ; even though there are many types of car , which are more convenient .
So , there will be a future for public transport because of its benefits or advantages to human society .
It is very friendly transportation where people from all places meet on one transport system and they can build a relationship between them .
Additionally , the pollution , such as haze , will be decreased because fewer people use the car .
As a conclusion , there is a future for public transport and it is also convenient to use it for travelling .
I have seen your advertisement for the job at the USA Summer Camps advertised in the local newspaper on the seventh of June .
I believe I 'm a good candidate for this job because I have passed the FCE examination and in a few months I will be taking the CAE exam .
I also speak Spanish and Portuguese due to the fact that I have family in both countries .
I am particularly interested in this job due to the fact that I have already worked in summer camps ( In Spain and France ) for two years and I 'm very passionate about being with children . I would be able to organise sports and evening activities too , because I have helped with many events at my school .
Unfortunately , I do n't have much experience of working in kitchens , but I think I 'm hardworking enough to pull it off .
With reference to my character , I am very organised , friendly and determined .
Yours faithfully , Laura

Subject : Application .
Dear Mr Cunningham ,
I am writing to apply for one of the camp monitor positions you advertised in last Monday 's Daily News . I am interested because this post will give me complementary experience .
I am 18 years old , and I am quite self - confident and a reliable person . I used to take care of my young brother quite often and I get on well with young children .
I have been working in several camps during the last year . For this reason , I have some relevant experience in this area . In addition , I am doing a degree in teaching at the University of London , and during the last quarter I have been in charge of a group of six children during activities related to sports and cooking .
If you require any further information , do n't hesitate to contact me on 666777555 in the evenings .
I would be very grateful if you would consider my application for this post .
I 'm not a sportsman . I like watching basketball , tennis , football , but my favorite sport is running .
We need only amazing running shoes , and that 's all . OK ... ,
For me it is like meditation . I can think about everything or nothing .
It is very good for the circulation . Running helps me to be in good shape .
The restaurant I would love to review for the class is one of the most popular restaurants located just near the downtown plaza .
It is called the ' Egyptian Cuisine ' and its name actually represents what it has to offer .
It offers a delicious Egyptian menu which provides enough dishes to cover all tastes . As an example , their delicious fresh eggplant traditional salad .
If there is anything that favors this restaurant , it has to be the quantity they serve ; a surely sufficient quantity along with the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town , if not in the whole country .
What about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer ? With a soulful live band and an elegant dining set , their atmosphere adds to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit the whole class , professionally named the meeting table .
This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons . Firstly , it offers a traditional menu which will be sure to cover all different tastes .
Secondly , the lively atmosphere it offers will surely keep the class entertained during the entire dinner .
At the end of my essay , I would like to devote this paragraph to thanking my wonderful teacher for this opportunity to offer my sincere opinion on the topic .
Many thanks and I hope for a wonderful trip , regardless of the restaurant voted for .
It was a very different experience to learning in Korea .
Participation in class by asking and answering questions demands more active thinking from us .
Nobody would deny the significance and effectiveness of modern technology , having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable advantages , such as mass production , information and communication devices , as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs .
However , it has also created some alarming problems , namely environmental destruction , and increasing unemployment and health concerns .
This essay will attempt to analyse both sides of this controversial phenomenon with some applicable supporting ideas .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhanced quality of individuals ' lives , contributing to the economic growth of numerous nations .
To illustrate , machinery and the use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop mass production and increase the availability and quantity of various types of food , having made them cheaper and more affordable .
It is played in a box drawn on the ground the size of a volleyball court .
A central line divides the box and a line is drawn inside each box about 2 feet from the line which ends the box , and this line is proudly called Ellai kodu(Border Line ) in Tamil .
The rules of engagement are quite simple .
The first and most important rule is you do not let the opponent player who raids your field ( the box ) touch your border ( Border Line ) . The second rule is you do not let the opponent cross over the ' No man 's land ' ( The centre line ) , when the opponent touches your border .
The opponent must raise a leg when the other one touches the border to tell them " Lo , I am in your territory " . If the opponent touches the border , he can retreat to his field , no shame in that , but he does n't get any points .
But before retreating , if he touches anyone among them and leaves their field without getting caught , then the raider gets a point and the person who was touched by the raider is dead ( Out ) .
Each team gets an opportunity to raid the other 's field alternately , and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin , as is usual in most games .
One might wonder , but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature , written circa 300 BCE .
It says the bravery of a man is reckoned by the number of scars on his body , except on his back , because they thought to be dead on the field was far better than retreating .
I love to play the game with my friends in my village , a very refreshing game , I would say .
It is a popular English science fiction series and it tells the story of the adventures of the " Doctor " .
The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and he travels in all of time and space with his companions , who are normally humans . In his experiences he saved whole planets from other bad aliens .
I think Doctor Who is totally different from other science fiction films . It has always done the unthinkable , the impossible , things that no one else has even dreamed of .
Doctor 's travelsmachine is a Policebox ... it is small and blue outside , but it is bigger on the inside .
I like Doctor Who very much . I have always dreamt of travelling everywhere in time and space since I was a little child ! ! !
! If , ( one day ) I have the possibility to do it , I will go to distant galaxies and I will see how the universe began .
The 2014 expenditure for collections is taken out of the library budget in 2015 .
For the rest of 2015 , the library will not be purchasing any collections from its budget .
We recommend you to consider the electronic content available through these library subject guides .
My apologies for any frustration you may have .
Thank you very much for your understanding .
The Headmaster had asked his school 's teachers to begin a class in English and she was one of them .
I think that people will live more ecologically .
In The Home of the Future everybody will segregate waste and take care of the environment .
People will have a device that puts out the light when we leave the room .
We will also discover flowers that irrigate themselves and machines that walk the dog or wash it when we do not have enough time to do this .
We will all have vacuum cleaners that will dust everything without our knowledge .
If the place where you live is a relatively large city , you will say indeed : " We obviously need public transport ! Everyone knows what happens on the streets in the rush hour ?
Your attitude to public transportation strongly affects the quality of public transport itself .
I mean the timetable punctuality , time interval until the next bus and so on .
Finally , how big the crowds are on the bus or subway car in the rush hour , how convenient it is for you to be there , rather than sitting in your own air - conditioned and perfect looking car .
" Resolution number one : Obviously will lose twenty pounds . Number two : Always put last night 's panties in the laundry basket .
Equally important , will find sensible boyfriend to go out with and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of the following : alcoholics , workaholics , commitment phobic 's , peeping toms , megalomaniacs , emotional fuckwits or perverts .
And especially will not fantasize about a particular person who embodies all these things "
I was always fascinated by this American tradition of making a resolution list .
The idea of writing a blog triggered my mind as well .
I had a copybook where I wrote some interesting facts about that remarkable trip for me .
Since then I have been dreaming about collecting my impressions and memories .
As my sister constantly says , " You 're lucky because you have the memory of a goldfish . You remember absolutely nothing . "
In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory ) , I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures .
A year ago , the idea of beginning a blog came to me as advice from an English teacher .
He recommended me to write in order to apply my English knowledge .
Maybe it 's really time to make a resolution and to begin writing it .
It was a family tragedy when I got a task to write a composition for my literature class .
Humbly and respectfully , I would like to inform you and your organization that I am the appropriate candidate for you .
I have recently finished my undergraduate program .
Which is in sport management and I also have experience of kitchen work .
I have completed a 6 month vocational cookery course .
I am a 24-year - old male , and I love to do challenging tasks .
I am the best candidate for your job to execute high result of excellence .
It will be my great pleasure to work with you and your organization .
If you could give me a chance to work with you and your organization , it would be a great pleasure for me .
The cosmic era , communications , easy access to the Internet - all of these things will become common in the distant future .
For example , the spread of IT technologies will change economics and the financial system .
People will start purchasing all items from the Internet .
New methods of transportation may speed up the delivery to the purchaser 's home and , as a result , it will improve the quality of service .
The new communication networks will transform the whole world into a big village where everyone will be able to contact any person .
The development of space technologies and companies connected to construction of spacecraft may give rise to space tourism .
I believe that public transport does n't have a future because travelling by car is so much more convenient and comfortable .
The seats are more comfortable in a car than in a bus or the underground .
That 's why I prefer travelling by car instead of public transport .
I am very glad to read this good news . It is the first step towards the final result and I will try to do my best to give you useful information for your interview .
Remember this is fundamental for each interview .
Try to be spontaneous and not too sliced .
Maybe you can give some general information about your last job .
Do n't worry about the people who will interview you .
I worked on that team more than ten years ago ( new employee recruitment ) and I can guarantee that for the first interview it is important only to make a good impression .
If you do it ( and I 'm sure you will do it ) you 'll receive another appointment .
I hope to have said everything .
This film is about the kidnapping of two little girls .
The man is really frightened and this situation makes him more and more desperate and he can not control his reactions .
In my opinion , it is really exciting , because you are constantly thinking about where the girls are or who could be the kidnaper .
I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller , this thriller is the right one .
We want to know and understand what is happening nowadays and , for this reason , it is important to know what happened before .
Because that can give us a lot of new information about ourselves that we did n't know .
On the one hand , it can be funny to imagine and create the story of how everything happened formerly .
But on the other hand , we can have too much imagination and be disappointed with the truth .
Consequently , there will be constant research into the field of our origins .
I enjoy playing it so much because it 's really challenging .
There are so many options for which card to lay and which colour is trump .
If you are very good , you can take part in competitions .
There are German championships every year and there is a league , too , where teams of 4 play against each other .
I really ca n't understand why chess is considered to be a sport and skat is n't .
When it comes to helping communities , people have different attitudes towards whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities or not .
Some people think young people spend enough time on helping their communities . However , others disagree with the idea .
Although young people are required to help their communities every week , actually it is still not enough .
It is true that young people are required to help their communities by their schools or companies .
It is also true that these kinds of requirements really work , and many communities are benefited .
Actually , there are many communities that still do not receive enough help , otherwise many social issues and events would not be discussed again and again .
Many factors result in this phenomenon .
The world is becoming more and more competitive . Young people have to spend a lot of time educating themselves to survive in this society .
Young people not only have to spend a lot of time making themselves qualified in one specific subject , they also have to have a wide range of knowledge .
For example , to be outstanding enough to go to the best university , students have to perform well in their curriculum , such as literature and science , they also have to be good at music or doing exercise .
Therefore , they do not have much time to help their communities .
To sum up , the world nowadays makes young people survive by themselves , and they do spend a lot of time helping others .
Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rather thorny .
This is not surprising .
While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the thespian art flourish in England , in Russia it was the very dark and sinister period of Ivan the Terrible 's reign .
So , in Russian print , the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748 .
First translations appeared at the end of the 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actually , because they are translated from German or French and the translators changed the plots as they wanted ( and turned them into tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations , the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia , in the meantime , turns out to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet 's torture completely unbearable ) .
It is close to unbelievable , but at first critics and educated people found Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and narrow - minded people !
But everything changed quite rapidly then .
The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original was published in 1828 .
By 1855 , only six plays had been left untranslated .
It came into fashion and became honorable to translate Shakespeare .
Russian society gradually began to appreciate Shakespeare 's skill at portraying the greatness , depth , and complexity of a human being .
" The sun of Russian poetry " , Alexander Pushkin , took English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare .
In the poetical drama Masquerade by another famous Russian poet , Mikhail Lermontov , we clearly read Othello 's features .
And these are like branches on the tree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Since that time , Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists .
We love his simplicity and veracity . We adore his multiplicity and imagination . We appreciate his straightness and audacity . We prize his delicacy and his sense of humour , of course !
First , I want to explain to you what happened to me on Saturday morning . I had to meet up with my friend Matus at 14 am , so when he told me that he could n't come over and could we meet up later , you can imagine how angry he made me , because I ca n't put up this kind of person who is always late .
I got cold feet . I could n't understand what was happening .
All in all , he apologized and in the end , everything was resolved .
Hello , my name is Sebastian and I will talk about Azul Historico , which is a restaurant in Mexico City .
The restaurant is on Isabela Católica number 30 , suburb Centro Historico in Mexico City .
Azul Historico is a different restaurant and is located on the patio of an old building in the zocalo . The type of architecture of the place is colonial and between the tables are some trees , and these trees shade the diners when they are eating .
When you are eating you can see some birds that are in the trees , so it makes this restaurant unusual and different than others .
The cost of the restaurant dishes is expensive and is around 150 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to choose the three best dishes of the place but these three are some of the best typical dishes in Mexico : the " Cochinita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carne Enchipoclada " .
" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to choose the meat ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deer meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chille chipotle with potatoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dish and you need to choose one of the three types of meat that I mentioned , but this is accompanied by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating from Oaxaca and the last dish is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexico .
If you want a different and unique restaurant , you must go to Azul Historico , because it has delicious food , sometimes has regional music and the service is excellent .
If we consider the potentiality of this means of communication , the television would be one of the most important inventions of this last century .
On the other hand , despite the numerous documentaries , news and cultural programs which are broadcast every day , another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of so - called rubbish TV , which has been impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children .
Furthermore , I should probably mention the enormous number of advertisements that people are forced to watch every single day once they have switched on this box .
In my opinion , the real problem of this potentially useful tool is the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication .
As a matter of fact , viewers are not able to decide the script , but they can still decide to switch the television off .
Over the past years , humans have renewed and improved scientific progress and this causes a big change in the life of every day .
First , technology has radically changed the daily life of a simple family : a computer seems to be necessary and in every house there is more than one TV .
Conversely , with the latest medical discoveries , doctors are able to treat many of the world 's diseases .
Finally , with the exploitation of new renewable energy , humans have an infinite source of energy .
Well , there are a lot of different opinions , but I do not agree that the effects of scientific progress may be dangerous for the individual .
I am writing to apply for the position of floor manager in your large department store .
As you can see on my CV , which I enclose with this letter , I have studied International Trade and have a degree in Economics and Marketing with high grades from the London Economics School during four years .
I did a Master 's in Business Management in the prestigious University of Harvard .
Also , I have a degree in IT from the Google University . I did that course online .
I am looking for the chance to work for your company because I know that your store is the leader in large department stores in the UK and last year your company won the prize of " Best place to work in 2013 " , and I want to share my knowledge and my work experience to improve your profits every year .
Nowadays there are a lot of different forms of conditioning that deeply influence people so that they feel the need to buy specific brands of items , object , cars and so on .
For example , every day we are invaded by facts from news on TV but it very often happens that some information is left in the background , whereas less important information is broadcast in its place .
For this reason , I think that every day we are continuously surrounded by information , news , advertising so that we do n't have enough time to think what is really important and what we really need in our life and we can all be influenced very easily .
I am writing to you regarding your advertisement for a job in the USA , called USA SUMMER CAMPS .

The film I would like to review is an old film I 've always enjoyed : Young Frankenstein directed by Mel Brooks in 1974 .
This comedy , entirely shot in black and white , is a parody of the classical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of those films based on Mary Shelley 's better - known book , and presents a lot of elements that give this film a really hilarious mark .
The performance of Gene Wilder , as the main character Dr Frankenstein , Marty Feldman , as the hunchbacked assistant Igor ( pronounced eye - gore ) , and the other members of the cast is amazing and has made Young Frankenstein one of the top comedies of all time .
I am writing because I would like to attain the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) .
Yours faithfully
Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?
It has its own rules , tools and people who are specialized in it .
We need music most of the time or even every single day , to enrich our days with happiness and joy , and also to melt away sorrows or depression that can affect us and prevent us from doing our best .
It has many branches and types . Some are traditional : owned by any part of the world , and the other international types that all people throughout the world share .
The traditional or local music of a certain area has its thumb print on the people in that part of the world .
And the instruments used in that local music may vary from one sort to another .
For example , In Northern Sudan , people have been using the " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .
Internationally , the kinds of music are many . However , most of them share the same instruments .
In particular , the piano is a universal instrument that is used by many musicians as a primary controller of the rhythm of the orchestra .
Last but not the least , music is a sort of treatment for those who are suffering , so , regardless of its type or nationality , it 's a kind of medicine for the soul .
The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods like the inquisition . Knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies , since knowledge through books had become a threat to their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .
Although some ideas were maintained , ( for instance , the astronomy of Galileo Galilei ) , the book - burning caused a delay in knowledge because , if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the movable type printing press by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) because it gave access to knowledge , recovering significant books by Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues could spread their ideas to more people who were becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .
In addition , it produced collective readings through the ecclesiastical method , with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in books to all social classes .
On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet , in which access to knowledge is easier and faster , leaving aside books .
People die , but books never die " , it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time , taking into account that knowledge revolution is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the spread of the information . For instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
Although there was an oral tradition , the knowledge was adapted to the political and religious thought of the speaker . So , the most efficient and objective way to transmit knowledge was through books , and it was not possible because of the burning .
Nonetheless , with the invention of the movable type printing press , knowledge was different for the access to it .
If one book was burned , there were ten books more without restriction .
In contrast , nowadays , books are not necessary at all , because the internet facilitates knowledge even more .
That is why I could adapt the phrase by Franklin , saying that " knowledge can not be killed by people because knowledge is infinite . "
Nowadays what we most need is to find ways to prevent childhood obesity because nowadays it is a very common sickness that attacks more and more children every day , causing them to feel bad about themselves .
According to the CDC , the percentage of children aged 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years in the United States .
This means that in the past three decades , obesity has more than doubled in children , same that had diseases just like diabetes , asthma , cardiovascular risk factors , mental health disorders and musculoskeletal problems .
This disease is not just about all the physical and health consequences that sufferers have , but also the mental ones .
The best way we can prevent childhood obesity is by recommending all families a special doctor that can help them to give a safe life to their children .
Nutritionists are specialists that know a lot about all the types of sickness that can attack children and even the ones that will kill them .
Giving them the opportunity to take care of you and your situation will change all your life in a good way .
So it seems that these people can live happily and peacefully , without problems , but this is not true .
I have little cousins and sisters so I 'm very good with kids . I 've experienced all kinds of situations , so I think they wo n't be a problem for me .
As I said before , I have young cousins and we meet on Saturdays so I need to think of activities and games to keep them entertained .
I 'm an outdoors person , so I will be very happy with the accommodation . I would be very thankful to work for you if you decide to accept my application .
I have seen your advertisement on the internet and I would like to apply for the post as activity coordinator .
I am 16 years of age and , due to having a sister , I really like working with children and also know their interests well . I have enjoyed and practised swimming since I was eight years old and I have also won some competitions , so I believe that I am suitable for the job .
In addition , I go jogging every Sunday morning with some friends .
My reason for applying for this position is that I am good at combining my experience of swimming with my broad knowledge of the countryside , which I think will be interesting for the children .
Today , human civilisation is changing at a higher speed than any time in the past .
If this will also be the case in our future , then I think that today we underestimate our future .
I am only sure about one thing : technologies will have a more important place in our lives .
Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that will solve all our problems .
Maybe by doing this we will be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
That morning his , grandmother had gone to the hospital because she had to have an operation and she told him to buy some magazines for her , because at the hospital she 'd be bored and she could n't get out of bed for a few days .
So Peter went home to get his wallet , but before that he decided to take a nap because he was tired , so he started to sleep , but it ended up that he slept for over 3 hours and his mother started calling him on the telephone and she was really angry because he forgot to buy the magazines for his grandmother .
So he woke up and looked at his watch and knew that he had to buy them immediately or his mother would be even more angry than before .
Unfortunately , the hospital was already closed to visitors , so he had to wait until the next morning .
But I do n't think that in ten or twenty years scientific progress will be able to produce this type of transport , so we should imagine something simpler .
And how will our way of travelling change ?
Transport will also respect the environment and nature .
For decades , man has preferred to use another way of getting around than using his own feet .
Scientists have been able to provide , in recent years , new means of transport , from cycles , to motorcycles , motorcars , trains , metros , which have been used to arrange and accomplish complete public transportation networks throughout a country , and sometimes extend it beyond another country 's border by agreement between those countries .
Many people say that they prefer using their own cars , but they are being forced to use public transport for many reasons , such as , the complications they face with the driver 's license , in addition to the high cost of fuel .
Let 's not forget the hard times during cold weather , especially in winter , while going to the bus stops , or their low chances of having a good place to sit . Maybe there is another important reason that raises private transport 's score compared to public transport , which is molestation .
Moreover , I went to Vilnius primary school and invited schoolchildren to come to the concert .
I had to make one hundred invitation cards .
The cards included the programme of the concert and some photos of children from all over the world .
It was a very good and useful experience .
I gained a lot of experience while organizing the event .
Also , I learned that you have to be very enthusiastic and self - confident because finding the sponsors for a concert is quite a difficult task . I liked that the teacher trusted me .
I did everything by myself because everyone had something to do on their own .
I hope that I will use this experience in my future .
And now I can easily speak about many shopping facilities in my city .
If you have enough money for Kiev luxury shopping , called ' gold shoppping ' , you 'd better go on Khreshatik Street .
In conclusion , I have to say that in Kiev you can find everything , if you really want to .
Art / Music is less important than science / technology .
In my opinion , technology is becoming more and more important than art and is a necessary part of our lives .
Most people in this world ca n't live without technology .
As soon as we open our eyes every day , we begin to use technology , such as alarms , cell phones and lights .
The more technology we use , the more important it is .
Technology makes it easy to connect with our family , friends and co - workers .
We can talk to our family and friends immediately , which is not limited by space .
However , technology made it easier ten years ago and it has become more common in recent years .
Technology is one important part of our lives which has made life more convenient .
Therefore , we use a calculator to count numbers in a few seconds .
In the old days , we calculated numbers with our brains and that could lead to some mistakes .
Our life has been transformed into an easy life by technology .
It is easier to contract entertainment which can release our stress immediately .
Pressure exists everywhere ; for instance , your boss was angry and shouted at you or you have to carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father - in - law .
When you ca n't breathe in your life , you need some entertainment ; for example , you can listened to music on your cellphone or watch some funny videos after all the things that bothered you .
Technology enables us to access entertainment immediately .
Technology has changed our lives in many ways , which brings many advantages for us , such as convenience , making it easy to connect with friends and easier to access entertainment .
In conclusion , in these three premises , I consider that technology and science are more important than art and music .
With modern technology , we can see a game which happened on the opposite side of the earth .
Activity makes people excited and remember their memory .
This activity also makes us enjoy watching and playing the game .
However , in soccer , every single player touches the ball , even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
The second reason is that soccer involves all players participating in the game .
Can we say these players participated in the game ?
If somebody wanted to play soccer , I would recommend that he or she has to do some stretching because soccer is a very active sport , so you always have a possibility to be injured .
We need to respect other sports and other people 's perspectives .
When she came back from school , her parents and all her classmates were hiding in the living room and waiting for her .
Anna did n't understand what had just happened .
She slept all the day after this big celebration .
For example , in our capital city , Prague , there are many historical buildings like Carl 's Bridge , the Cathedral of St. Vit , the big clock called Orloj , and so many others .
If you go to south Morava , you should definitely try some wines or the drink called Slivovice .
For example , near Prague is the castle called Karlštejn , where Karel IV lived , or the castle called Buchlovice , which is in the south - east of our country near the city of Uherské Hradiště .
Otherwise , the opportunities for a job here are quite plentiful .
If you would like to ask anything or get to know more information about some place , just let me know .
I am Melina and I am interested in your job vacancy .
In my opinion , we should build a perfect world for them to grow up in a safe and environmentally friendly place .
I have experience of taking care of children .
I have enrolled in different courses about child development and currently I am working as an au pair where I have to speak English .
I belonged to sports clubs at my high school .
Although I am very keen on rugby and basketball , during university I took belonged to the badminton club .
English will not be a problem because I know how to communicate with young people .
My favourite sports are gymnastics and martial arts .
I 've been doing martial arts for eleven years but I haven't lost the passion I feel for it .
I have been doing gymnastics for 4 months and am fascinated with it , I like to be tired from doing stunts , and I also feel very healthy because I exercise daily . If it 's not gymnastics , it 's kung fu .
I like those sports because you need a lot of strength and dedication to get better . I like kung fu weapons and hands - free forms . To do something spectacular in kung fu , you have to do acrobatic gymnastics .
I invited my friends to try these sports and apparently they liked it , many did not because they did not know what it was , but after experiencing it for yourself , you realize that they are very beautiful sports .
I tried to renew my membership twice yesterday and there was an error message both times .
I received a call from my credit card company this morning to confirm and authorize that payment , telling me that there were two attempts to charge my credit card .
After authorizing my credit card company , I tried to renew it , but again , there was the same error message .
I am waiting for some instructions about what I have to do now to renew my membership .
One more advantage of owning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and caring .
On the other hand , there are a lot of disadvantages to owning a pet in big cities .
Television can be capable of both entertaining and educating at the same time .
Environmental protection for instance , or more practically , the correct use of the water in our houses .
Another example could be represented by first aid activities and so on .
The topics can be easily focused on if we have in mind a model of society where individuals have a central role .
Various contents could have an educative value . For example , those concerning our relationships with others , or our relationship with nature and with different cultures and religions .
All these topics , by using creativity and new technologies , can be dealt with in a way to make them soft and able to entertain .
Here is some basic information about the news .
A charter plane carrying 72 passengers , including players from Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense , crashed near Rionegro , Colombia , according to the country 's civil aviation department .
The civil aviation agency had initially announced that six passengers , three players , two crew members , and one journalist , survived the crash .
I think it is a catastrophe to victims and their families .
To avoid accidents , the government and airline companies have to do something to prevent tragedies .
Next , when you are in a class , focus on what the teacher says , she / he will teach you and give you a clearer understanding about grammar .
And they will also remind you about some key points you did n't understand when you previewed it .
In the class , you should take notes and write down what is important . If you have any questions , then you should ask teachers to help .
If you do all the things above , I promise your grammar will improve and you 'll master it eventually .
Usually I go there with my friends or colleagues for dinner or lunch .
Surprisingly , they serve it with a half cut bone which is quite fun in itself , even before you taste the dish . The mashed potato is creamy and full of butter .
Try one of the cloudy ciders on tap and you will not be disappointed !
Taking care of our environment is considered , by many of us , one of the most important things in our lives .
Nowadays , in order to have the best for the current and future generations , there are common international ways for individuals to contribute to solving environmental problems .
Recycling is both a popular and an undervalued method .
Using respective light bulbs , household appliances and any other thing that saves energy is the only way that individuals can help but , it is not effective .
Although an entire town or city contributes to saving energy in their homes , it can not be compared with the waste of energy that industries are responsible for .
In this case , restrictions should be implemented by the government .
Taking everything into consideration , there is a good argument for supporting recycling , which is the following one : the biggest waste of energy takes place in primal resources industries . If we reused all the materials that had already been exploited , we would reduce its costs by at least half .
The chilis restaurant at 123 Street , Toronto , is really a great place to hang out .
The scrumptious food served makes me go back there often . If you want to have a lip - smacking dessert , this is the ultimate place .
Everyone will love the appetizers and main courses served there .
Also , the ambience of the restaurant is marvelous .
Whereas if you are going there to party with friends or watch a game , you get a table in a suitable place . I believe that if we could all go to this restaurant at the end of our course , we will surely have a great time .
For several years , the number of secondhand clothing stores increased and a lot of people use them .
There were many specialists to repair , recycle and collect products in the Edo period .
In 1723 , there were 1182 secondhand clothing stores .
That was just the number of union members , so in fact , there were more secondhand clothing stores in the Edo period .
However , secondhand clothing stores have been increasing in recent years .
There are many secondhand clothing stores now .
The media , also known as mass media , is one of the most powerful means of spreading information .
It gives people the opportunity to get to know what is happening all around the world regarding every issue , such as poverty , occupation , discrimination , suppression of human rights , and so on .
Nowadays , we can easily get information we need through the Internet , in the newspapers , on the TV .
As European citizens , we are surrounded , directly or indirectly , with loads of social problems and issues in Europe , so we have to acquire our right of free access to information privately and randomly in order to stop corruption , to acquire knowledge about our rights .
So that we can be active citizens and help the EU continue to develop .
Nevertheless , today I usually go to the cinema when I really want to watch a particular film .
Nowadays , I try to choose films with good actors or actresses , special scripts and plots , documentary stories or special renowned Directors ' films , like Almodovar , Sanchez Arévalo or Alex de la Iglesia .
On the one hand , comedies are my favourites because I need to laugh when I have finished my work .
Once , I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours . I did not manage to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others did not seem to be valuable for fixed prices .
Second , shopping malls have places full of advertisements and loud songs playing .
He hears different kinds of songs , advertisements for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality .
Finally , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriately .
There are some assistants who , if you ask or even do not ask , start suggesting the best products as well as the most expensive ones to you .
This can make your shopping really annoying , because some types of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of a product .
To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoyable thing , because it takes time , the shops are often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products .
If I were you , I would join the one in the avenue , because of the facilities
I really do hope you get used to the neighborhood .
Football is the most beautiful sport in the world . It 's the dream profession of almost all boys when they are kids . When you play in your neighbourhood , you are playing that you 're Messi , or Cristiano Ronaldo or your favourite player of your team .
But the passion is not only when you are playing football , you can increase your passion by supporting a team in the good times and the bad times , going to the stadium , and when your team achieve glory , you can also feel that , and in those moments , you are the happiest person in the world .
So I invite you to experience the love and passion that you feel when you are playing or watching a football match . And if you share this love with another person , the passion increases a lot , your feelings are at a higher level , in this sport you can feel the glory , and in the next second , you can start to cry because you r team ca n't finish the journey to the championship .
There are lots of interesting sports , but there is normally one that you like the most .
I am talking about dancing , specifically ballet .
I consider it one of the best sporty and cultural activities because you keep fit at the same time as you express yourself making an artwork .
You have to be a disciplined and well - balanced person . That 's it .
Both characteristics will help you in other types of tasks and will improve your future development .
The start is the hardest part , considering that your body is not used to doing this kind of sport . However , once you are into it , everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active .
So , if you are starting it , do n't give up because difficulties arise , just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity .
You will notice how the improvements come without thinking too much .
One of the things that I enjoy the most is that you dance in a group , so you meet people and you can make friends after a while .
You must not be on your own , otherwise you can not dance in a company , so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that makes a strong relationship forever .
4 . Everything was kept neatly .
Nothing was found difficult or struggling .
Nevertheless , I would like to improve some skills and although I did very well , I still got confused .
1 . I overthought every so often , because I was not sure if what I was doing was alright .
2 . I should stop thinking in Spanish and think more in English since translating might be confusing .
Choosing a sport to practise is a complicated thing . You should choose something that you enjoy , but at the same time , something you can afford to pay for .
Although you may think that is a dangerous sport , which it can be , the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in the water makes it worth the danger .
If you are going to start doing it , I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor .
Nowadays , people are aware of environmental problems and they will try to figure out solutions .
For example , all future houses will use solar cells to produce electricity .
Moreover , there will be important technological advances in our lives , like intelligent mobile phones which can help us with day - to - day tasks .
They will check your empty fridge and if you run out of any vegetables , your mobile phone will warn your supermarket and they will bring them .
To conclude , it is impossible to argue against the fact that people 's lives will change in the next years , but these changes will help to improve our environment and our daily life .
It is often said , that shopping is a pleasant activity , but sometimes it becomes bothersome .
However , there are situations we do not find enjoyable at all .
I will mention some of the reasons why and times when shopping can be unenjoyable .
Shopping may cause frustration , mainly when we have to squeeze through the crowd .
Secondly , shopping definitely become unenjoyable when we are not able to find products we want and desire .
Also , overspending .
Nevertheless , people try to save money by every conceivable means .
To conclude , we have to know when and to which shop we should go to avoid stressful and not enjoyable situations .
Researchers have proved that human activities such as industrialization , deforestation etc . can trigger global warming .
In this essay I will be highlighting some of the dangers of climate change and different ways through which governments and individuals may help to overcome this challenge .
One of the most obvious effects of global warming is the depletion of the ice at the North & South Poles , in turn causing the sea level to rise and encroachment of land .
These phenomena cause serious damage to ecosystems and sea life .
Further , continuous rising temperatures are impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters .
There is scientific evidence that disasters like Katrina and Hud - Hud can be linked to global warming .
Governments can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints .
For example , governments can impose limits on emissions produced by manufacturing plants and force industries to help with reforestation .
Individuals can also play their part in controlling global warming .
For example , individuals can reduce the use of plastic materials , use public transport to control emissions , recycle waste etc .
Governments & individuals both have a role to play in facing this the biggest challenge of the time the Earth is facing .
I have two kids ; one is 8 years old and the other one is 10 years old , so I have plenty of experience with kids .
My tasks there were working with children of all ages to organise events , sports activities and evening activities . I also helped with cleaning the centre , helping in the kitchen with cooking and working closely with clients and customers in our Café .
It would be a great experience for me to work so close to the countryside .
Yours faithfully ,
Michael is an editor for an international student magazine .
He held a short story competition to improve students ' writing .
When I saw that message , I was excited about persuading my friends to enter this competition .
I thought , no matter who wins the competition , we all must get 1 dollar as a prize .
But my friends were not interested in that competition , they thought writing was boring and getting 1 dollar was small .
Finally , they copied my article for this competition .
When he read the contents of the article , he discovered many of them were similar .
Academic culture refers to the attitudes and values that are shown by the people who work or study at universities .
After I joined ACU ( Australian Catholic University ) , I found vast differences in teaching methods between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , students study individually and do not ask questions of the tutor even if they are confused .
Meanwhile , Australian education is based on making students learn new skills .
Students need to take active participation in discussion with their peers .
Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement .
It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks .
According to Hamp ( 2002 ) , the goal of an EAP ( English For Academic Purpose ) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree .
It helps to share ideas and knowledge , among students and make them think critically , by using formal language while writing , and so on .
In conclusion , the adoption of the Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning .
I have become an independent learner and started to raise questions and share my opinion with the tutor .
In the future , I will improve my learning strategies by working actively in groups .
I want to talk about a restaurant called " Bierkeller "
It 's a restaurant located in Villa General Belgrano , Cordoba and its speciality is German food .
The restaurant is beautiful , it 's of a normal size , with a lot of space and very well decorated , you have many photos and paintings to look at .
People at the restaurant are very kind , they treat you in a very polite way and it is worth going there
If we go to Bierkeller , we wo n't regret it and we will have a great time trying different types of food , learning maybe a little bit of the history of the town and being happy as a group
Almost everybody has at some time thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but do we really know all the advantages and disadvantages that it entails ?
On one hand , a large proportion of the global population consider this year off a way of learning and gaining experience while you enjoy travelling all around the world and you get to know people from all the different cultures .
Nowadays , employers are looking for experienced people who know how to adapt to all the different situations they could be involved in , such as an international lecture or a difficult plight .
It is also said that at the time of heading to college , those people who have taken a year off are the ones who have least difficulties learning and relating with other students because they have got used to it before .
It is a fact that those who spend a year abroad working on something can save money for university and they become more independent .
But taking a year off has its downsides as well , like the time people waste working on something they are not going to do in the future , because with any kind of extracurricular studies , people strangely find a good job .
That is why it is recommended to wait until you finish university to look for a job .
Another fact that should be highlighted is that while you are working for a year , people of your age are at university , and that means that they will probably finish their degrees a year earlier than you , and this could be an inconvenience for you , because you will have to have classmates who are a year younger .
Many automobile companies are working for a new future of automobiles .
For many years , Apple , Google and several traditional automakers have been running prototypes which drive by themselves and nobody needs to steer the car .
The question arises if driverless cars will be a boon or a bane to us ?
This has a devastating effect on their independence and living freely .
When these people can drive a self - driving car , they feel more comfortable and they can live more freely .
Self - driving cars are very modern and drive with highly technical software .
The automobile companies have to work on a plan so that self - driving can be bought by people from the middle class too .
When this happens , self - driving cars will be an enrichment in our lives .
The Reading museum in Berkshere has visitors from all age groups , but is particularly suitable for young people who need help with school projects or want to take up creative things as a hobby .
They have a number of workshops for young people from beginner to semi - professional , and most of those are not so expensive .
You can learn various interesting such as painting , photography , ceramics , from the lifework professionals .
Their lunch menus are gorgeous and the prices are reasonable .

subject : the transport in my local area
introduction :
As requested , I have investigated the features of the main means of transport which are used in my local area .
These are very cheap and people who do not have a car use them to go everywhere . However , this mode of transport is not so comfortable , because sometimes you have to travel with lots of people .
People use their cars for travelling a long or short distance . This is really comfortable because you can manage the speed and where you will direct .
These are a combination of buses and your own car .
Conclusion
The other reason why I like playing football is because it is a team sport .
My advice to people who want to play football is to be passionate , to like and feel football .
And for those who like football but are scared of getting injured , they still have the opportunity to watch games on TV and play video games .
During summer it is common to see many people in parks practising sports , like running , cycling , or just doing every kind of physical activity .
So , when I wake up every morning , also pushed because I am a very active person , I get such motivation to go out and do something .
But , I do n't only do sports in summer , because in winter I also do fun sports , like skiing , snowboarding , and Ice skating , among others .
So , when my friends ask me which is my favourite sport , a problematic decision comes to my mind , simply because I like them all .
If you want to do this sport , you can simply take a pair of sneakers and any light sportswear , and start to run anywhere .
Nonetheless , if you really want to get into this sport as a pro , you can invest a lot in clothing and gadgets .
Nevertheless , once you start to go running , and want to really get into it , and improve , I do recommend you to take care of your health and to find professional assistance .
Injuries may happen as a result of doing it often if you do not know the way you run , or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistance that your body needs , for example .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The relationship between famous people and journalists is an attractive focus in our society .
Famous people need love , family , entertainment and support .
As we all know , technology is making life better .
Society is growing and as it grows it gets more used to technology being everywhere .
They just prefer to travel long or short distances in individual vehicles , known as cars .
This is because technology has given us this opportunity , and as time goes by , more and better modifications are made to cars .
The clients benefit from professional coaches , who train them in order to perform the exercises correctly .
There are appliances such as treadmills , bikes , weightlifting and many others .
You should build one to improve the popularity of your leisure club .
Those people who use the spa can benefit from treatments of the highest quality .
However , their children do not have a special place , so it is recommended you arrange a safe place for them to play .
I hope that my report helped you and Active Leisure Club will improve its facilities .
But something happens unexpectedly and the new chapter is completely different to what you had imagined .
In my opinion , a good book has to have surprise , has to have a good plot , a good variety of characters and , as I said , has to involve you .
On this CD , the singer expresses all her feelings and tells us about her experiences during recent years .
Firstly , you can find songs about her children , lack of affection , broken heart and some commercial songs which have interesting lyrics .
People might think that if you buy this type of music , you will waste your money and it is just commercial music .
Time passed and John had an unimaginable inspiration for his experiment .
One night , he went to a party with his colleagues .
He thought it would be good to be distracted for a while .
It was already night when he was at Luck 's house ( Luck was an old friend ) and all of them were talking about life things , but then Luck remembered that John was working on an experiment and he did n't know what it was about , so he asked John in front of everyone :
I heard that you were working on an experiment ! "
When Peter heard that , he was interested in knowing about John 's experiment .
He had the feeling that the experiment could be something vital to human life .
John accepted his help and told him to come to his laboratory .
After four months of hard work , they took the experiment with all the information for inspection .
They decided to design a vertical field to expand the laboratory .
Everything was going very well ; nonetheless , Peter 's intentions changed and became riddle .
Furthermore , the court has walls and the ball can bounce off them .
This letter is in regard to the summer camp job advertised in the newspaper .
I would like to work as a volunteer in the upcoming summer camp in Arizona which you are organizing from 20th March to 30th March .
I am a 32-year - old Computer Science graduate currently working as a software consultant .
So I would like to take this opportunity to work as a volunteer .
With my experience as a teaching assistant , I can easily handle young kids and keep them busy learning . I follow a lot of sports channels on TV during my free time and that helps me with setting up the rules for the sports activities and ensuring they are organized well .
It gives me great pleasure to help kids with their activities and teach them through play .
It makes me feel content that I am contributing to society by participating in the tasks that shape their future .
Having an energetic and cheerful attitude , I would like you to consider me as the best fit for the camp volunteer and accept my application .
In my opinion , public transport has been improved over the last years , because cities have been putting a lot of investment into it .
In big cities , such as New York , the main public transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
I do not agree with the idea that there is no future for public transport , because it is a perfect means of transport for commuters and , nowadays , a lot of people are conscious of global warming and the environment , and refuse to use the car every day .
In addition , the price of fuel has increased over the last years .
In summary , I think public transport is a good way to get around and the number of users is increasing every day .
If I am not travelling with my parents , I will come to your city .
Nowadays , travelling on public transport is an experience who none has failed .
However , there is now a discussion about what people prefer , public transport or their own vehicle .
In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has its own pros and cons , but in my opinion , the difference between both of these is that in the second you choose your own way .
Extremadura is a small place where you can not find many transport types .
First of all , most of the people in Extremadura use a car for going to work , to university or school .
When you use a car , you do not have to think about timetables and you do n't have to pay for expensive tickets for travelling .
However , I think that this mode of transport has some disadvantages . For instance , if there are a lot of cars in a small city , pollution will increase and the environment will be damaged .
Also , if a city is small , people should walk to different places since everything is near to their houses .
Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that Extremadura 's roads need a big repair programme because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive on it .
In Extremadura , the second most used mode of transport is the bus .
On the one hand , there are buses that connect the various neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them .
On the other hand , there are buses for travelling long distances .
Finally , in Extremadura , the least used mode of transport is the train .
Hello , dear guests ! We are glad to see you in our city . I want to tell you about interesting places in my city .
We are in Moscow . It is a very big city , so there are many interesting places where I usually do some activities .
That 's why I decided to tell you about an interesting place in our city .
In the summer , it is a place where you can play volleyball in the special court with sand , play ping - pong , or if you are tired , you can sit in a special hammock .
Guys should not go snowboarding .
I think it is a good place for other activities .
Most people eat scrambled eggs and drink a cup of tea .
I would prefer to eat lighter dishes , like vegetables with rice .
Supper always comprises sandwiches .
I ca n't stop studying the English language . I 'm a sort of ' English addict ' , but I wish I were an English native speaker , I do n't know why .
, later I took my degree in Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures , starting my to and from England to improve my skills .
While studying at University , my idea was to move to the UK to work there , but I got married so I could n't realize my dream !
I found myself teaching English in my country , far from the language competence I longed for .
Nearly every institution will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
In addition , on placement , the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .
In a natural work pattern , you have to do , like school , your tasks , but the communication is also an important part of it .
This important way of communicating is lacking at school , because it 's a nearly a one - directional way of communication from the teachers .
While on placement , they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
However , public transport has been criticised more and more in recent years because of its inconvenience .
Especially in the countryside , public transport is no alternative to cars , due to the lack of frequency .
Consequently , people prefer taking the car .
Firstly , because they gain independence by doing that .
Secondly , they can visit each place without any problems .
It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is leaving .
In addition , the car is also more convenient in terms of timing .
Furthermore , ticket prices have been increased rapidly in recent years .
Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car .
Nevertheless , public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car .
Sitting on the bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
The purpose of this report is to inform you about how the city of Granada takes care of the environment .
And there is a big university community involved in recycling .
Clean Infrastructures
As has been said , Granada has a decent public transport system and now it is being improved by adding a metropolitan train .
However , Granada can not be considered as cycle - friendly . There are fewer cycling lanes than in other cities of a similar size .
In addition , the old town is not as involved as it should be in clean behaviour , it being the university that make the biggest effort .
I consider that Granada scores 6.5 out of 10 for taking care of the environment .
When you get to the highest tower , you will see the most breathtaking view .
It is a place where you can always find lots of tourists and foreigners .
When the weather is good enough , close to the castle take place many kinds of parties and entertainments .
Unfortunately , tickets are expensive but they are worth buying . I also strongly recommend you to see all the places around the Big Castle such as the Town Museum or Folk village .
Tomorrow , I 'm going to visit my grandparents in Galicia .
It 's a long trip but it does n't matter because I 've good friends there and I want to spend some time with my grandparents , David and Gema .
Nowadays , almost every person in the world watches movies sometimes or all the time .
Regarding my preferences , I would like to admit that the silent genre has conquered me .
Of course , the unprepared viewer ca n't understand the inner beauty of this genre and will choose something mediocre .
However , simplicity in some cases can be very good and smart .
I do n't enjoy melodramas or love stories much , but they should be paid attention to .
In my opinion , very few people use movies for broadening the mind .
That day was a terrible day for Michael . He woke up and felt totally exhausted after an overwhelming birthday party .
His mom was disappointed about that , too .
He did not answer at all , besides , he hit the chair near her , and unfortunately , that chair hit her in a serious way .
She could not even yell a word , just looked at him disappointedly .
The aim of the site is to get together people interested in cars .
On this network you create a profile of your car , write a list of improvements you have made to it , upload photos and movies about your car and , of course , you meet a lot of people with the same interests .
So they often need the help of professionals .
I think that it is necessary to involve some professional mechanics to give advice to users .
The other website I often use is Google.com , because it is the greatest search engine ever created by human beings .
I think it is better than other search engines because it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing extra .
I think that many google users will be happy if the developers bring more useful information to the main page , for example , weather information , currency rates or hot news .
Moreover , google map service needs some improvements , such as street names , map accuracy and more city panoramas .
I hope your arrival was successful and you have been enjoying our town .
If you want to spend your time visiting a famous and very beautiful place and seeing for yourself the main sights in Moscow , I recommend you to visit Red Square .
Your group will see many well - known monuments of architecture , which you will admire .
There , you will be able to find out a lot of information about the history of Moscow and Russian rulers .
I hope you will enjoy seeing this place and become really excited by this excursion , seeing the great architectural monuments
I enclose my CV for your information .
I have had extensive experience working face - to - face with customers .
I have worked two years for a well - known coffee franchise and previously for three years in a famous patisserie as an assistant chef , which has given me varied skills , like the ability to work with many different types of people and an extensive knowledge of cooking .
I am a conscientious person who works hard and pays attention to detail . I am flexible , quick to pick up new skills , and eager to learn from others .

I am keen to work for a company with a great reputation , like Green Pepper Cafe .
Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the future .
My brother only has one child , but my grandfather has four children .
My grandfather had to work hard to support his children through additional jobs .
They had no money they could spend on entertainment .
Second , more and more public services appear in our cities .
These kinds of places can make parents comfortable and able to concentrate on their children 's care .
On the other hand , the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system .
This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care for their children .
That being said , I still feel that the reasons I have presented are strong ones , such as more resources and infrastructure .
Having a healthy lifestyle is one of the most important things for our health , because it reduces the chances of getting sick and it gives you the energy and concentration you need .
Eating according to a schedule is a very important tip you should take into consideration , and also , trying to avoid fried meals or fast food .
Unhealthy food and neglecting physical exercise increase the chances of getting fat and having problems with your heart , liver and other organs .
Fruits , vegetables and water
Your body requires many types of vitamins in order to function properly . These are found in fresh or boiled vegetables and fruits .
However , drinking 2 litres of water every day is essential for your health and has a lot of benefits , such as helping energise your muscles or keeping your skin looking good .
Another thing you should take into consideration if you want to live a long happy life is doing physical exercise , such as walking in the park , going to the gym or playing team sports .
Besides that , you should also sleep between 8 - 10 hours per night , so that your body can function effectively .
-eat fruits and vegetables
-drink alcohol excessively
In conclusion , you do n't have to make a lot of effort to have a healthy lifestyle and there are plenty of benefits from it .
You will feel great , concentrate better , have more energy and have fewer health problems .
I am writing in connection with the advertisement for a job in the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I am a really cheerful person , I like taking walks to the countryside and taking photos there in my free time and , in my opinion , I am a very energetic youngster .
Besides , I have plenty of availability and I am responsible , patient and sociable , and I have good communication skills .
My qualifications include broad experience as a childminder and of organising sports activities .
Furthermore , I have worked as a catering assistant for a year .
Also , I would be grateful for information about the tasks I would be called on to do if I got the job .
Thus , the state makes no effort to fight it . Transportation now is very overcrowded and difficult , especially in the rush hour when people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock . The main reason for that is the increasing number of people in our country ( housing problems ) and the result of that is a lot of accidents have happened and a lot of people have died .
According to a study published by the journal " American Journal of Medicine Brevintev " in August / August next that there is more public transport in cities where the population has become leaner and healthier .
The U.S. researchers from two universities in the state of Pennsylvania and the Foundation " Rand " American research and development staff to monitor regularly use public transportation or go to work by car in a year .
The study results showed that people who use transportation .
The public decreased their weight by three kilograms on average , compared to people who use a car to travel and the study attributed this result to walking to the bus stop and running to catch the bus in the expected position requires goer public transport more traffic , while this does not happen with motorists .
It appealed to experts in political circles in the United States to invest more money in public transportation and improve security in the ways of the infantry in cities and make them more attractive to encourage people to use public transport .
The supervisor of the study , John M .
MacDonald of the University of Pennsylvania , " investment in public transport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity " .
The transport sector in Arab countries suffers from many shortcomings and poor performance and is a cause of environmental pollution and this is due primarily to a lack of the capacity of public institutions to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately and allocate investments effectively and improve the organizational capacity and result .
So it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate costs and , in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries , public transport systems are still undeveloped and compel people to rely on private cars .
It has been observed , for example , that the increase in the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of severe congestion in urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
The optimistic opinion , some people say that " there is no future for public transport " , saying that the future of public transport is clear and the proof of that is that in ancient , times there was n't any transport and by the time people started to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle , cart , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars to the plane , so they hope that the transportation be best by creative people .
On the other hand , the pessimistic view , in developed countries like Japan and Kuwait we do n't find problems like these because they have good planning , they make routes underground and overground , then they have routes only for people and routes only for cars . Finally , we should have a good plan and the government should care about that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .
I recommend you , too , to visit the castle because it is very interesting .
I 'm not sure which is the most expensive restaurant in my town , maybe there are some near the beach because the tourists normally go there .
In my opinion , a trip will be fascinating because of the fact that the building of the Brewery was originally a German - owned brewery which has been brewing beer for almost 400 years .
It is a good purpose , to see and get to know the place where in Poland is produced a traditional and well - known beer .
I hope you will take it into consideration and go to see our local and famous brewery .
Yours faithfully ,
The Asian restaurant Tian review
For our dinner at the end of the course , I 'd recommend the Asian restaurant Tian .
The atmosphere seems exotic and calming .
Finally , to add one more touch to the experience , you can take a ride in their tuk - tuk .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He got that mysterious look in his eyes .
He just realized how to solve one of the biggest physical challenges mankind has been interested in for ages .
Time travel !
Time is running , seemingly continuously , the same as the second hand on his clock .
But we got this perception just because our eyes can see only a limited number of images in a time period .
If a time period is long enough , like a minute , we can see a strict distinction between one and two .
Peter grabbed his notebook and immediately wrote all this down .
However , some people say that public transport has no future . They might be right . ple do n't like it . They prefer travelling by car .
Considering that companies are now moving to the outskirts of cities and there is a lack of more flexible timetables , some people discount the public transport option .
It is believed that travelling by car is more comfortable and convenient for everyone . Consequently , car manufacturers look on it as a new opportunity to create new hybrid cars in order not to damage the environment .
I personally believe that , because of all this , the public transport will have no future in our society .
She woke up in the morning full of enthusiasm and zest for life .
She was sure that everyone would remember about the celebration and have a gift for her .
She went to school very disappointed .
All of them were waiting for her with lots of gifts in a beautifully decorated room .
In the past , technology was poor and only a few people had a smartphone or a computer .
In contrast , today , everyone has the latest model of telephone or computer or whatever .
In the last ten years , technology has made a big jump and , thanks to the Internet , we can search for everything whenever we want .
In the past , it was better than now because grandparents or older people could tell you how to do something for the first time . They could give you some useful advice and you could establish a relationship with them .
Today , everyone knows how everything is easier with technological devices , but it 's sadder because you ca n't share your thoughts with anybody .
For that reason , I think that for me , young people in the past learned a lot from their grandparents and it should be the same today too .
Children are supposed to be the future of their countries , but in Africa , especially in the countries in sub - Saharan Africa , there are many cases of famine - extreme cases , so children have many difficulties .
Unfortunately , this is the sad reality .
Besides that , the lack of food and clean water are responsible for many diseases , which are responsible for a large number of deaths , because there are n't enough resources to treat the populations .
Here we have some of them : anemia/ anemia ; rickets and malnutrition …
The principal cause of famine in Africa is the ethnic conflicts , which cause wars , the decrease of fertile land and the use of ground only to produce monoculture to export .
At that moment , he understood that the mayor was going to build a big motorway there , next to the river .
Suddenly , he thought that the workers would cut down all the trees , and the squirrels would lose their refuges , so he thought that he had to do something immediately .
He wrote a letter to the town hall explaining the situation and asking them to stop the construction .
Firstly , the primary cause of bushfire is human activities .
The lack of a sense of civic responsibility leads easily to bushfire .
For instance , some people discard cigarettes or matches which are unattended , like barbeques or campfires .
In addition , in many developing countries , unemployment they also migrate to forest and set fire to enhance cultivated surface .
Bushfire is caused by numerous human activities but also started by the carelessness of people ( Roland as cited in Schauble , 2009 )
On Thursday I went with my family to Strasbourg Cathedral .
It 's big with many activities .
On Friday morning we did canoeing and paddle boating on the small river that ran along beside the center and in the evening we went to a restaurant .
She measures about 30 centimetres .
The lesson did not go very well ; she was interested in other dogs and she was not listening .
It was perfect . She jumped sixty centimeters .
The Alhambra gives you this opportunity !
The Alhambra is a group of palaces , gardens and fortresses built by Muslims and occupied by them for over four centuries .
Its true attractiveness , in addition to the decoration which is at the pinnacle of Andalusian art , is also its location , which is unique .
You will be impressed by the stunning views which are considered by some people to be the best in the world .
If you are lucky enough to visit this wonderful place in summer , I recommend you attend the Granada International festival of Music and Dance , which is celebrated in Genelalife 's gardens , where you can enjoy amazing artists and orchestras in an unrivalled setting .
The graphic information presented in the flow chart illustrates the procedure regarding the making of bank notes , which can be sorted into 6 main phases .
At the beginning , the format of the notes should first be designed considering the background color and security issues .
At the same time , skilled machinists prepare the metal plates in order to set up a fixed mould .
The most significant procedure is called inspection , which means manual checking by special machines and staff , and then they are classified into 3 different categories , including good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets , and bad sheets .
In the final stage , the well - produced sheets are packed and distributed to each branch , while the damaged ones are safely disposed of .
Namely , Design , Preparation of metal plates , Printing , Inspection , Packaging and Distribution and Disposal .
When you need bank notes , the first thing you should do is to design what aspects of information you want .
Afterwards , you are able to print the sheets of bank notes ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) .
The most significant part of the
process is inspection , where the printed sheets are
manually inspected by officers .
If they are not very good , we can destroy them securely . However , a few sheets may be partially damaged . That does n't matter due to the fact that further separation will assist you with getting rid of the wrong sheets .
Overview . It is clear that the process of making bank notes begins with Design and ends with Disposal or Distribution .
Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable .
This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances , but on long journeys , that will be very uncomfortable .
Travelling in your own car is much more comfortable .
There is the possibility to set up your seat .
It is your own decision when you get up , because there are no time limitations .
There is the risk that you will not get the connecting bus and , so , you are stressed .
In conclusion , travelling by car is the easiest and best way . I think that it is not possible to use public transport , because there are no buses or trains .
Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport .
There are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans .
As a result , there is a debate about whether educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing a field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement , with qualifications , for the following reasons .
Admittedly , some of the research needs investment in many resources that educational institutions can not afford .
Educational institutions should dissuade students .
However , if there is not a lack of resources for the field of study , educational institutions should support students in their field of study .
In addition , students , in the course of research , may create serendipity .
Like Alexander Flrming Alexander , the inventor of antibiotics , discovered Penicillin accidentally from research into the germ .
The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility into a possibility .
Therefore , educational institutions should encourage students attempting research which is unlikely to succeed .
Remember when in school you learned the three essential things for living ; reproduction , nutrition and interaction ?
Well , humans have become more and more sedentary with the passage of time and have forgotten about interaction and movement .
But that 's not my goal in doing a sport .
Apart from obviously having fun and socialising , the way you feel after running and burning feels really good .
Personally , I think the best time to come is in the summer .
Because at this time we have a lot of interesting activities like concerts , festivals and so on .
Thanks also for your invitation to join the group .
I will be able to show you and your friends the most interesting places in my area .
When I was in high school , I loved to go to different kinds of activities .
So , having good time - management has become important in my studies .
However , instead of focusing on my studies , I paid more attention to rehearsals .
At that moment , I felt regretful and frustrated .
From that experience , I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for successful studying .
Therefore , I avoided social activities during the exam period .
In the same way , Rowh ( 2006 ) points out that it is important to get control of ourselves .
In my case , I planned the activities into a proper timetable , because the planners clearly show me an outline of the near future .
Without a doubt , this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility for my own learning .
More significantly , I understand that time - management and planning are crucial in academic life .
Therefore , in the future , I will keep improving those abilities and become a more organized person .
Football : The most incredible sport in the world
It 's a great party and we can have real fun watching a football game even if it 's on television .
If you want to start practising this sport , you have to get fit and run a lot because you have got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
The aim of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in my town and make recommendations to try to encourage tourists to visit the shops .
Some of the information was collected from the shops , and from the web .
According to the investigation , the majority of the shops are in two areas ; Firstly the Puerto shopping center , it is located in Puerto Marina , and the the shops on offer are mainly fashion , coffee shops and pubs .
The other big commercial area is in the city center , with a more varied offer : fashion , bars , supermarkets , local food shops , wine shops etc ....
Alternatively , every Friday in the parking lot next to Tivoli World , there is a street market where you can find every kind of product : local products , food , CDs , DVDs , etc ....
In light of the results , I feel it would be to our advantage if we did promotions of the city center as a good destination .
I would recommend the tourist office to increase the variety of shops in Puerto Marina .
In conclusion , the tourist office should have more adverts for the city center .
I was stunned by her words and became speechless for a moment .
Let me introduce myself . I am Luis from Spain and I work as a civil engineer in a Spanish infrastructure company called Acciona .
I completely agree with you , maybe each word you say .
My company is making redundancies and I am always worried about that .
The point is that I completely focus on my projects , so I spend ten hours every day making a tremendous effort with my budgets , trying to increase profits and I am doing well .
I manage risky projects and , eventually , I get high revenues .
There are also many historical buildings in my country .
As you know , my country is made up of different races , so there are many different traditional foods in my country , so you can try different cuisines like banana leaf rice and hainanese chicken rice .
There are many interesting films with valuable plots and famous actors .
Most of them are extremely interesting and worth seeing .
My favourite actor is Tom Cruise and , consequently , the best film I have ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he plays the starring role with his ex - wife Nicole Kidman .
I was impressed by the production because of its valuable plot .
They both go through a lot of difficulties and live a poor life .
The aim of the two characters was to win a piece of land in America .
They take part in a competition riding horses .
Only the fastest competitors were given the land .
Most people in Bali rely too much on their private vehicles , hence they have totally abandoned public transportation .
They say , " there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In order to do that , there will need to be a huge transformation .
Aside from a great blue - print of a well - organized transportation system , which covers a good 25 to 50 years ' planning , it also involves local culture .
It is definitely a hard job to do if we want to change people 's culture .
The consciousness that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live in should be raised first .
People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling on a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to having two to four of them trapped in a car . In other words , one mass transportation means against twelve or more cars on the same road .
The next is an understanding of what we can do for the environment by changing our transportation means .
The world is constantly changing and technology is advancing fast .
This affects people 's lives considerably , so we can say that in 50 years , the lifestyle will be completely different to what we have today .
We can say that 50 years ago we had not thought of having the technology that currently exists , such as the Internet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Also , the lifestyle was completely different ; the industry had not developed technology that now allows you to be more efficient and many people did work that can now be done by a few of them .
So , if technology continues to advance as it has done until now , our lifestyle will change too .
Perhaps in 50 years more , we will live in a world where technology makes our life much easier , but at the same time , we will be depending on it .
I was very surprised to hear that you want to spend your year off from university in my country and I am also extremely flattered .
I would recommend a job as a waitress because you do n't need much experience , and I know you do n't have any , and if you get a job in the summer as a result , you 'll be at the beach most of the time and you can spend the rest of the year visiting other places .
It 's one of the most beautiful castles , in my opinion , and it represents the most important thing this country is known for , and that is Dracula .
Another attraction which is a unique one is " the merry cemetery " . It is famous for the colourful paintings on the tombstones describing , in a very original way , the people buried there and their lives .
The first reason is that I have already studied there three years ago and it was a wonderful experience . I met very nice people from all over the world . I improved my English level thanks to very skilled teachers and I really enjoyed my stay in Oxford .
The second is a pragmatic reason . I have a five year degree and I worked for two years in a medical devices company but now I am unemployed .
In Italy , it is quite hard to find a job at the moment and I want to try work experience in the UK , but it is necessary to become more confident with my English and that is what I hope to obtain from the IELTS course .
I already know that it could be tough , especially to be far from my family and my girlfriend , but it is something that I feel could be right for me , and for my career .
However , as countries develop and the economy grows and life changes , people change and standards of living change too . The factors that lead people to have their own car are dependent on and limited to several factors . There are also factors such as social and financial conditions that tend to influence people to have their own car instead of travelling by public bus / train . We should also consider the conditions of roads , access and traffic , giving people an opportunity to chooses to travel in their own car or on public transport . In some countries , there are separate lanes dedicated to public transport which help and ease the traffic in conditions of heavy traffic . With traffic technology solutions , owning a car is always better .
Another factor we should consider is the public transport stops on the way to destinations , which require planning and catching public transport to avoid late arrival at your destination .
The subject , no future for public transport is ambiguous as the advantages and disadvantages are both consider on .
First of all , I want to explain travel links with the town . A lot of people come by train , It is situated at the top of the town and is the best way to travel to yours because it is the quickest , but if you prefer to come by bus , the bus stop is near the train station .
There are many shops around the town . For example , we have one where children can make teddy bears while the parents can see them from the restaurant ; many children said that it was the best place in the world .
Apart from that , the town is near the beach , and there we have many restaurants where you can eat while you are watching the waves on the sea .
Our personal recommendation is the " Sir Hotel " . It is a muddy hotel because many years ago it was a castle , and you can sleep in the king 's bed and every night it has theatre , where you can take a part in a play .
I am writing in reply to your advert , which was published in the local Newspaper on 31 May 2008 .
As you can see in the attached CV , I have experience working with children of different ages .
For three years , I babysat my neighbor 's two daughters .
In addition , for the last three years , I have been a volunteer at my tennis club , where I have developed different skills to organize activities , sports games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 years old .
Working with children , I have learned to be more patient and , moreover , I am able to motivate them to give the best of themselves .
Also , I have gained communication skills through speaking with the children and the families .
Public transport is a useful way to commute from place to place , especially in big cities .
Besides its advantages , which are that it is cheap and fast , there are many disadvantages to taking a bus or train , such as time , quality of service , and overcrowding .
It is said that , instead of taking public transport , commuters will travel by car because of its convenience . In my opinion ,
public transport will hardly be replaced by travelling by car .
Secondly , the infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars .
That makes petrol 's prices increase every day .
It has been affecting the environment , causing climate change , increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to the increasing demand for using petrol for private cars .
In conclusion , public transport will be an excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the available local transport and possible improvement .
The town is covered by more than thirty routes , most of them with a duplicate following the same route in the opposite direction .
Children often use them to go to school and back , and the older population , with increased problems seeing far away , prefer to use the bus to travel around the city .
Most of them do n't have air conditioning , meaning that in the summer they are tremendously hot , and some have problems with the windows that cause the bus to be extremely cold in winter .
The alternative - Taxis
Taxis are available throughout the city , and can be called by a simple phone message .
Recommendation
There have been rumors of the construction of a Metro in our town .
That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation , since it is fast , is n't affected by traffic , and it is generally cheaper ( since it relies on electricity ) .
I 'll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting to them for sure .
First of all , if they are staying in České Budějovice , they can spend at least three days there sightseeing .
Anyway , they must visit our main square , which has many historical buildings .
There is a huge number of shops in the centre , so what about going shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is very convenient for tourists because they can reach everything on foot .
If the weather is nice , they should definitely take a trip to Kleť .
It 's the biggest hill , where you can go up the lookout tower and it 's not far from České Budějovice .
There is an interesting observatory too , and what 's more , the best restaurant I have ever been to .
They must definitely order the best soup in the world .
There 's a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle located on the big rock .
I hope your friends will be satisfied with my tips .
If you want to know more about the destination , just write me a message or give me a call .
First of all , vehicles designed to carry large numbers of people can not be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megalopolises are suffering because of a surplus of automobiles .
This happens not only because of environmental aspects , but mental aspects as well .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of the average person , who spends most of the time downtown , to replace a car with a bus or an underground train .
Whatever type of journey you take , you would be more likely to prefer to use a train or plane , because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical exertion .
Overall , there are a number of causes for disagreeing with the suggestion that private transport is becoming more and more popular in comparison with public transport .
The only thing that definitely should be changed in the future , is the approach to the usage of cars powered by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Concert Hall , you will find a Japanese restaurant named " Ichiban " . Opened a few years ago , it 's not well known yet , but this does n't prevent it quickly getting busy at lunch time at the weekends .
Although sometimes it might be rather noisy because of the people gathered there , I find its decor quite attractive and , as usual in this kind of restaurant , relaxing .
I have to mention the soups , especially the seafood soup .
the great variety of rice and noodles deserves to be mentioned - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes are served with careful presentation , are highly creative and very attractive to the eye .
A negative point of the restaurant , in my view , is the lack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusion , I recommend visiting " Ichiban Restaurant " , you 'll have the chance of enjoying a delicious meal in a very agreeable atmosphere .
Reflective Writing
I have done to take responsibility for my own learning .
Independent learning has become an indispensable part of finishing tertiary - level education successfully .
However , traditional teaching methods , force - feeding students , have made me overly dependent on teachers in China , which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately .
Compared with EAP course , it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently , especially for academic writing .
Firstly , it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time , because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers ' supervision , so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently .
Following this trend , I have become a procrastinator in the end , which made me unable to face the problems of time management .
In this sense , the term " time management " means the ability to control time by prioritizing tasks and planning the effective scheduling of time to balance study and work , and to keep concentration on motivating yourself to learn towards a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Rowh ( 2006 ) states that you will stay up late to complete assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance .
Based on examining my current experience and research , I noticed that a gap , unsuccessful time management in independent learning , is the root cause of these problems .
Then I made a few conscious changes where I began to manage the deadlines for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks , as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life .
As an independent learner , it is my sole responsibility to autonomously learn , which will be a very important factor in future for passing EAP1 successfully , as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of my future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
The most historical place in Spain is the city of Cáceres .
Therefore , it is a multicultural and multiracial society .
As well as the historical city , which has short and narrow streets .
The center of the historical city is the Big Square . There are mixed Arabs and Roman buildings , and two cathedrals .
In the third place , this year , Cáceres is the capital of gastronomy in Spain .
My favourite restaurant is Chinese .
Some people do n't like this food , but at this restaurant you can eat other types of food . For example , Spanish food and Mexican food .
The atmosphere in this restaurant is very good and it 's very clean .
This restaurant is very big , so we would n't have a problem .
This restaurant is buffet style . We paid 15€/person and we could eat and drink all that we wanted .
From my point of view , this restaurant has one drawback ; the waiters and waitresses do n't come to the table , you have to go to get your food and drink .
I love this restaurant . The food is absolutely delicious .
In this set of materials , the listening passage discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it contributes to improving health and personality , and the reading contradicts this by revealing the downside of it .
In the listening passage , the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent , due to the fact that it reduces blood clots and slows down the deterioration of brain function .
In addition , moderate drinking helps to maintain healthy movement , because some research has shown that people who drink moderately have a lesser proportion of body fat , because alcohol speeds up the metabolism , which makes calories burn quickly .
Moreover , it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior , which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non - drinkers , and they are more social , popular and they are more likely to be married .
On the other hand , the reading contrasts with this by mentioning the disadvantages of alcohol .
Furthermore , studies have shown that alcohol stimulates the appetite , which makes people consume more than they need .
For example , researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol .
Second , alcohol can cause some serious health issues , especially cirrhosis of the liver , heart failure , brain damage and a variety of cancers .
Third , people who drink alcohol tend towards aggression and violence .
With the development of globalization , there are varieties of impacts on different aspects of daily life .
People also discuss its advantages and disadvantages .
This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China using some examples .
Firstly , there is a benefit of globalization that people can buy some special products from various countries on the internet instead of buying in the production site .
So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses .
In recent years , some different sized logistics companies have been hold , and different modes of transportation have developed rapidly .
For example , in the past , the main modes of transportation were ships , trains and trucks , so people had to wait a long time for their parcels and letters .
However , now , an increasing number of consumers and logistics companies have chosen airplanes , which can save a lot of time for transporting their parcels .
Secondly , there is still a disadvantage of globalization relating to transportation in China .
The reason is that the development of globalization has let our country improve its economy .
However , because of the increasing standard of living , a growing number of people have chosen to travel , which has put heavy pressure on transportation .
So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people , the government and experts have to think of some different ways to solve this problem .
For example , some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centres .
In conclusion , globalization of transportation has brought both positive and negative effects for Chinese people .
So in my opinion , people need to find the right ways to let globalization raise the standard of living while discussing its advantages and disadvantages .
Bra really takes care of the environment .
If you visit it , you will probably appreciate all the innovations applied to save our environment .
These engines use bio fuels , so the environment is not affected .
I think if we want to protect our environment , we should start with the little things .
You should speak accurately and also fluently .
Last year , I was in Poland and I could see how important it was to speak English . With this language , you can communicate with other people , not just English people but with all people around the world .
When I was a child I did n't understand why I needed to learn English , but now I can see how important it is . For this reason , I 'm motivated to learn .
On the other hand , I love travelling and if you know several languages everything will be easier .
You can understand the guide , the signs ...
It could be nice and give you more opportunities to do whatever you want . And do n't lose heart , at the beginning it could be difficult but , bit by bit , you will see your progress .
With strong patriotism , the Vietnamese people nowadays are trying to develop the nation , to get into the globalization process .
Each nation has their own historical place . Vietnam is not an outcast , we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand about the past .
Those places will help them to take a close look at the roots of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture , customs and tradition .
We can mention many places , such as Sword Lake , Hỏa Lò prison , the Temple of Literature ...
It is the Temple of Literature , the first university of the nation .
The Temple of Literature was built in 1070 , in the Ly dynasty .
In spite of wars and the destruction of time , the Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape now .
We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time .
Like many other Asian countries , in the past , we were greatly influenced by the ideology of Confucius , a philosopher from China .
He built a system which was based on 4 essential relationships in society .
Apart from that , they learned mostly about literature and poetry .
We can briefly describe the overall structure of the Temple of Literature , which consists of six parts .
Firstly , there were 3 main gates , the center one only for the king , the left side one was for administrators , the right side one was for the military .
Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside .
One remarkable feature of the Temple of Literature is that the people who passed 4 rounds of examinations then gained position titles would have their names engraved on the stone grave carried on stone turtles .
Right at the moment of entering , you can see them from two sides of the courtyards .
The Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now .
Before the university entrance examinations , many students come here and wish for luck .
The Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy ) can be seen as the most well - known historical place in Vietnam .
I do a lot of sports , for example , cycling , karting , football and basketball but my favourite sport is swimming because I have been doing this sport with my grandfather since 1995 .
Actually , this sport is very healthy , so some doctors are recommending this type of sport .
If you begin to do this sport , you should wear good snorkeling goggles and you should warm up five minutes before you get into the pool .
Also , you should have a cold shower after and before you swim . This is good because your body temperature is hotter than the water in the pool and if you get into the pool very quickly you could have a problem with your body temperature .
In Japan , there are many interesting places to visit .
For example , Kyoto is a popular place to visit because it has a lot of invaluable temples .
Sapporo is an attractive place because the raw fish and vegetables are fresh and nice to eat .
Fuji is the most wonderful place in Japan . Because its scenery is so beautiful , it is a popular place and it offers several exciting activities .
Fuji makes various beautiful sights and it always fascinates many people .
Fuji offers several exciting leisure activities .
Climbing to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters .
However , numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful views , such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt .
This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope , so people who are proud of having a strong body try this marathon .
Furthermore , around Mt .
Fuji has beautiful scenery , it is popular and it offers exciting activities for people .
Fuji will continue to make a wonderful impression on many people forever .
The next time such a thing happened to me I felt no wind but smelled this particular stink .
It was as if somebody was cooking some cauliflower .
At that time , I was unemployed , so I was n't able to move house and as I was n't afraid of it I had to put up with those strange events .
These are quite interesting and have helped me to know deeper children 's pleasures .
I have learnt a lot of activities which let them have fun at the same time as they get in touch with nature .
My grandmother used to run a restaurant and she taught me some Italian recipes .
Please contact me if you need any more information about me .
My name is John , I 'm twenty - nine years old and I live in Romania .
This month , on the 9th , I 'm going to have an oral and writing examination on my English language knowledge .
I am particularly concerned about my speaking skills and I hope I will not be too nervous in front of the teachers .
The exam is supposed to be on professional matters .
Subjects like passports , travel documents , third country citizens , inhumane treatment or punishment will be the main criteria of the exam .
I 'm going to travel all the way to the capital of my country , approximately three hundred and fifty kilometres .
In fact , she will also participate in the exam .
Afterwards , I will have the right to take part in the international missions to maintain peace under the patronage of the European Union .
I am writing in regard to the environmental problem you are researching .
First of all , I am going to present to you some general information about the environment in our village .
- Our village has only 200 citizens , therefore the amount of rubbish produced in a year is insignificant to the environment in our area .
Lastly , I am going to explain how our village is kept attractive .
- Last year there was a campaign to renew and repair the most attractive parts of the village .
In conclusion , I would say that our village is an example of an environmentally aware city .
I hope this report informed you fully on the environmental situation in our village .

Report : How Budapest takes care of its environment ?
In connection with the first issue , Budapest accomplishes the task very well .
In Budapest the rubbish is collected separately .
So , almost everybody who lives in Budapest has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection .
In that area , Budapest is really awful .
However , it would n't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often - it 's just a matter of organisation .
The ecological situation is seriously bad , not only in my city , but in my country in general .
All the rubbish is taken to a huge dump a few kilometres away from the city .
We keep on generating rubbish and using harmful things .
We still use plastic bags and bottles , phosphate detergents , throw batteries away .
Unfortunately , we do n't separate rubbish .
I have just read your advertisement on your page for recruiting people for summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , I have provided experience working with children in that age range .
I have taken courses in First Aid and I am even doing a course as a personnel trainer for children with some delay and disability .
Secondly , I have been working in a restaurant for more than five years .
Starting there , beginning as a dishwasher , being promoted until I got the main position as a Chef .
In my spare time I work for a not - for - profit organization as a clown .
I have been learning English for 8 years and after I sat r the FCE exam two years ago , as soon as I passed the exam , I started preparing for the certificate in advanced English exam so that I could demonstrate my English skill even more , both written and spoken .
I have further professional and personal references .
Finally , I am available to have an interview if you consider my qualifications positively .
Yours faithfully ,
The fact that " shopping is not always enjoyable " might be considered a universal truth .
Although it is true that shopping might not be a very interesting topic , it must be stated that it is necessary .
There are many different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furniture , instruments , etc .
Groceries and furniture , as well as instruments , follow the same pattern .
It all depends on the type of person buying them , their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now .
Lastly , it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are shopping ( i.e. the room , the organization , the prices , the distance , etc ) and the unknown people who are in it , who may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable .
In conclusion , shopping might be both : enjoyable and not .
Owning a motorbike has advantages .
One very important positive aspect is that , thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is very economical .
In addition , as it is smaller than a car , parking becomes much less complicated .
On the other hand , motorbikes do also have drawbacks .
For example , the lack of safety , which raises the probability of getting hurt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage this kind of vehicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike . Consequently , not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable to own one .
In conclusion , owning a motorbike can be useful or useless depending on the lifestyle you have , your economic status , and the number of people you need to travel with .
If you must go a long way , then you 'll probably opt for travelling by plane ...
It 's a good idea , but ... I 've got aviophobia !
But this mode of transport is n't so comfortable , especially when we must travel onshore ; then it 's complicated because travelling by boat is allowed only on the sea or any sizeable river , the courses of which are usually placed less conveniently than roads or even railway tracks .
For me , it has some very important advantages , like that you do n't stand in traffic , there are reductions for students , low risk of accidents , possibility of sleeping , possibility of travelling with a bike or other big luggage .
Most railway lines are quite spruce and , for me , travelling by train is a pleasure !
In my opinion , everything depends on our preferences , but the train is a general - purpose means of transport , I recommend it !
At first , I was not interested in it , since I did n't have any idea how to play , as I had only played basketball and volleyball . However , I did n't enjoy those two at all .
Moreover , I also did n't like to do exercise which was tiring and my strength was extremely weak so that every time we did 800 kilometers , I always ranked in the last three .
The funniest thing to me was that I thought I was a kid who was studying in kindergarten because of the way he taught .
When hitting the ball back successfully , he would say ' ' good , keep going " or " you did it '' .
Hitting the ball again and again , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , because it not only includes running , but also concentrating .
I am writing to apply for a chance to work at weekends in your cafe as advertised .
In addition , having been equipped with my rather good English - speaking skills and cross - cultural communication skills obtained during my time working as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company , I feel very confident and approachable when dealing with customers .
Another reason I am applying for this job is that it will be really a good chance for me to help partly increase my income at this time and improve my family 's living conditions .
Your consideration and acceptance of my application will be much appreciated .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admit that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advances that older people tend not to understand well .
Also , because of the fact that urbanization has not helped most countries to adapt the cities into more accessible places for senior citizens .
The new technologies are something that we can not live without anymore .
But , unfortunately , the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master , especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university ( older people ) .
I am one of the fortunate people who was born in the technological era , which means that I have had access to computers , gps and mobiles , for example , since I was a little child .
The technological devices help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them .
On the other hand , to someone who did not have these when they were younger and more active , such as grandmothers and grandfathers , the new devices are just things that they can not use or understand .
The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home , on the street , in a museum , etc .
Another transformation , which is related to the advances that humanity has been seeing lately , is the changes in the cities and our living habits .
Since last century , the world population is more present in the bigger cities , which , as a result , have been increasing in size and in problems .
The urbanization implemented by governments across the decades in the cities is sometimes not suitable for all members of the public .
For instance , older people or people with disabilities have great difficulty using the metro system because of the number of stairs .
My mother is a perfect case study for me because she can not use the transportation system in Paris or New York without getting lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting .
Sometimes , the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement in big cities compels the older population to stay at home .
In this case , they do not have the possibility to go out and enjoy the benefits that cities may bring to their lives .
Therefore , the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who are capable of understanding how to manage the modern devices and use all kinds of transportation .
On the other hand , for older people , the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle to them enjoying all that there is out there .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give my opinion about the facilities and services of the Active Leisure Clubs .
Facilities
In general , the facilities are well maintained but the majority of the users think that the installation should be improved in the basketball and tennis courts and maybe the bathroom should be remodelled .
Advantages
The workers are very kind and sympathetic and enjoy teaching .
Disadvantages
The activities are expensive .
I believe that it would be a good idea to reduce the cost of some activities .
Recommendations
It 's recommend that you improve the facilities , reduce the prices and open every day until 10.00 p.m.
Since the car was invented , we have been seeing a large increase in car production and in car use .
However , as time went by , improvements were made to public transport .
Nowadays , they are modern and comfortable and they are n't as late as they used to be .
Travelling by car might be more pleasant , but it can also be costly , because fuel can be very expensive , depending on the current economy .
With regards to traffic , travelling by public transport can also be quicker , as there is a bus lane and no traffic for the tube .
However , over the past years , people have been travelling mostly by car , which seems to have led to higher levels of air pollution .
This is undoubtedly an important environmental issue that should definitely have our attention .
Celebrities and their lives take intrinsic place in the lives of contemporary people .
The process of this fact becoming real and common in our society began about 100 years ago , and what is really interesting , nearly 95 percent of people in advanced society can not imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all .
Probably , if you hear about heroic attitudes you will be able to do , without doubt , something magnificent as well .
In this way , I think that it is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous .
There are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them - it is called low self - esteem .
Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities ' private lives and professional careers , you have to remember that the media distorts reality .
Of course , you can look up to celebrities but you have to be aware of the consequences .
INTRODUCTION
The school provides lots of different activities for those who are interested in music , drawing , dance and theatre .
The atmosphere at school is very creative .
During the whole school year , a great number of exhibitions , concerts and performances are given by pupils themselves and by invited musicians and artists as well .
Children have to take an entrance examination .
The other thing is that students are not able to refuse to attend some classes they do not like because those are considered to be a part of an educational standard for the particular artistic area .
CONCLUSION
It is definitely worthwhile to study there , although it is advised to let students choose the activities they prefer .
The phenomenon of homeless people has become a serious problem and many countries can not solve this problem .
The number of homeless people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world .
One of the major reasons for this problem is wars , especially in the Arab countries like Syria , Libya and Yemen .
In addition , financial crises . Most companies have financial problems , so the ideal solution to them is downsizing .
Furthermore , street children are a result of family troubles .
Cases of divorce are increasing and many children run away and prefer to live in the streets instead of in a home full of problems .
To conclude , the world has a complicated problem , so governments and charitable organizations must take a quick decision and put in place a real solution to solve this problem .
After the second false start you 'll be disqualified and then you can kiss victory goodbye , - that 's how I mentally tune myself , - Take it easy !
I look around tribunes : there are n't so many people , despite the fact that today the Australian Hurdle Champion of the season will be decided .
Although who am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervously stretching out my stiff neck .
Everyone 's nervous except for Jerome Tanny , last year 's champion , famous for his threatening pre - start grin , that we all call the " Shark 's Smile " .
That 's strange , but before the start my thoughts are as if an old steam locomotive is going to those depths of memory which are really hard to get to in ordinary life .
Owing to the increase in the population , human beings use more land to build houses , which leads to the decline of forest areas .
Floods , droughts , and famines . All of these have great effects on humans and animals . For instance , the loss of property , the disappearance of people , which is not good for the development of human beings .
For one thing , animals do not have homes , so some of them become endangered species , worse still , die out .
I think that efforts must be made quickly by governments to protect our homes .
Firstly , the population should be controlled . If humans continue to increase rapidly , there will be no more room for humans .
Secondly , governments should teach their people how to protect the environment , such as making them aware that destroying too much farmland is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be set up to provide room for animals , and we can help the endangered animals in this way .
Finally , governments should use the space properly , for example , making plans before building buildings , estimating the effects on humans and animals .
Faithfully yours .
Personal experiences
This is a question that I struggle to answer , but I have to say the most important person in my life was and is my marvellous father .
He is always on my mind , even though he is not physically present .
This should be enough to make you feel happy like a comfortable blanket does .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty sure that you do n't need much money to be happy .
The urban myth that statues can move makes contemporary people frightened .
And the Doctor Who Sci - Fi TV series from the BBC externalized this terror with the Weeping Angels .
After Blink was broadcast , it raised common fears about statues among TV - viewers in Britain and all over the world .
According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine , Radio Times , the Weeping Angels were picked as the scariest villains of the Doctor Who series twice by about half of respondents .
These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of the Doctor , like the Daleks , exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe , or the Cybermen , transforming all living things into cyborgs .
Then , what makes the Weeping Angels frightening ?
This uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originating from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar .
This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - living as life - like .
In Blink , the Weeping Angels ' uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make the audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
They look unnatural , in spite of their similar appearances to humans .
And the expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre , due to the lack of pupils .
Also , they have deadpan expressions .
But when it comes to their interior factor , the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning an unconscious physiological reaction into a conscious one .
After the Doctor 's warning , we may not turn our backs , look away , and blink as we are protagonists of the episode .
In several scenes , Weeping Angels , the lonely assassins never shift their positions and postures , even though the protagonists and supporting players blink , look away or turn their backs .
The reason is that TV viewers are watching them simultaneously .
To change the pose of the horrific statues technically , directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally , for a moment .
Finally , directors fade out the scenes by flicking out the light in the basement to maximize the threat of the Weeping Angels !
Finally , Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar .
For instance , the angels camouflage themselves as monuments or tombs in graveyards , carvings of the cathedral on the streets , and ornamental carvings in front of an old police office .
Consequently , it makes the audience unfamiliar with their circumstances .
Then TV viewers are terrified at the basis of their livelihoods and people grab blankets tight !
She began to study at a prestigious University .
That was a great responsibility for her , as well as bringing great prestige .
Anna feared that she would have difficulties coping with the expectations .
However , acquaintances of hers , the students at the University , comforted her .
Her grandfather , the first doctor in the family , was her role model .
From now on , Anna would have to direct her attention to making her grandfather proud of her qualifications .
Surprisingly , when you are playing this sport you improve your speed and coordination too , so that could be an interesting reason for taking it up if you are not involved in it .
Personally , what I can say is that playing this sport makes me feel really alive and not only when I am playing it , it also happens when I am watching it , especially during the World Cup .
I am encouraging those people who do not like doing sport that it is the best way to maintain your health .
Potential issues such as rule violations and conflicts may arise because foreigners may not understand the rules .
Japanese , as pointed out by Trompenaars ( cited in Morrison , 2006 ) , is highly influenced by the values of universalism .
Similarly , the high level of uncertainty avoidance and the low level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) cause Japanese people to seem to be obedient and self - disciplined .
Also , Japanese people think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment .
As a result , in Australia , conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) . People may usually emphasize their self - satisfaction and think of themselves first , instead of the public .
They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users .
Consequently , the bathing pool may face hygiene problems , such as someone not washing before bathing , and scrambling issues .
In order to achieve cost efficiency , the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered .
The location , whether it has a sufficient quantity of water or not , is the essential consideration .
Rental cost is also a limitation , as it is relatively high in Australia .
I am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit while you 're in Poland .
It is a majestic castle conveniently located on the river .
It 's a huge , breath - taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens .
The place is fascinating , because it is loaded with history and it 's nice to spend a day and relax in the royal gardens .
The Wawel Royal Castle is must - see place , while visiting Poland .
It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners come to Poland just to see Cracow city and , among other things , Wawel Castle .
I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit , because it is beautiful , full of other worth - seeing monuments , cute little cafes , a varied choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside .
I hope you will describe your impressions of the city after visiting it .
Yours faithfully
Evidence s that many natural systems have been affected by climate change , particularly by temperature rises .
I think it is time we started adopting environmentally friendly attitudes to help the planet .
First of all , as dioxides and carbon gases have been increasing ozone pollution in big cities worldwide , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative use of transportation .
Also , the adoption of bicycles and walking , for instance , seems to be a responsible attitude to the planet .
In addition , water pollution is a global problem as well , as so many industries dump a large amount of waste into rivers and lakes and also human waste and rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be found by improving recycling , waste disposal and even , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moreover , life may not be possible for future generations , unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy , like green , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency , avoiding side effects for the planet .
To conclude , I firmly believe that we can reduce the damage and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .
During the lesson I was very impressed by Socrative ( www.socrative.com ) , therefore I decided to devise a quiz about HTML and CSS .
At the end of the test , the teacher shows the results ( correct answers percentage for each student ) .
The teacher asks the students to comment on the results and the activity , and discuss the opportunity to repeat the activity .
This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant , which is situated in the heart of Cannes by the seashore .
All this can be accompanied by different selections of white wines .
All the produce is fresh and the chef takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
In addition to that , the service well accompanies the high quality of the cooking .
Despite the high price of the food , I had a pleasant dining experience .
This is the reason why I highly recommend going to the Astoux restaurant .
His brother Paul had been searching for something in his bedroom and it seemed to be a complete mess .
Suddenly , Michael saw his brother crying and he asked him . why " Where is my Playstation ? ? " , said Paul , inconsolably , and he ran to the kitchen .
When both of them started to search for clues around the house , they did n't find anything interesting , but after a while , they had seen several paw prints and , at that moment , Michael remembered a fact : he had left his dog inside the house , but the puppy had disappeared !
Obviously , he knew their dog Spooky had been into Paul 's bedroom and taken his Playstation .
Suddenly , Spooky turned up and ran away with some keys in his mouth , but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
First of all , they are supposed to be designed with great care and many considerations , such as the background colour , artwork and security issues , all of which are crucial for bank notes .
Secondly , skilled machinists will make preparations for the metal plates that are one of the most vital ways to ensure the quality of bank notes .
Next , it will come to the most important step , inspection .
If they are good quality sheets or partially damaged but still in good condition , they will be packaged and dispatched .
I hope the charity event you organised with your school was successful .
I know how much you care about animals and love them , especially dogs .
We decided to organize a play and donate the money we earnt to a Dog Foundation .
We tried to involve as many students as possible , since we needed actors , costume designers and technicians .
The event was very successful as we earned € 2,000 in just a day .
Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would be additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
On the other hand , aside from my bedroom , I would love to have my own reading nook , where I could read peacefully .
So , if my mental estimates are correct , there should still be enough space available to also place a little armchair , where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my desk chair , not very far from the window .
As far as television is concerned , well , to be honest , I haven't watched much TV for years .
Nevertheless , it 's something dispensable for me and , for this reason , I think I could get by without having one .
Now that I have already finished describing the arrangement of my hypothetical bedroom , I am going to talk about its lighting .
Firstly , I would only use energy - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .
Since the desk is just beside the bed , the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head ; that way , placing another lamp on the furniture would be unnecessary .
Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted in a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colour as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than them .
Lastly , I would like my curtains to be red , given that that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains , because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
My son is 13 years old and we understand each other very well .
He does not conceal anything from me , as I try to understand what he really needs and support him .
We speak about everything and respect each other .
I completely disagree with the statement " there is no future for public transport " .
I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities being convenient for everyone .
Although a private car is more convenient for its owner than public transport , it is not in use the majority of the time and that means wasting city space on parking while it could be used as a public space .
At the same time , it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously .
For instance , a network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine the comfort of a personal car and the work - load of public transportation .
Nowadays , all the car manufacturers have accepted the task of designing a robot - driven car that in future would resolve the issues of safety and availability of taxis 24 hours 7 days a week .
Unfortunately , the main method is to make private cars , if not a luxury , then to make their usage economically less efficient compared to public transportation .
And the underground , and light tram system are still more ecological and faster .
The aim of this report is to describe the training course that I attended last month , for a week , and the activities in which I was involved during that period of time .
It turned out to be a disadvantage for me , given that I am interested in the theory .
I managed to find out very few things about the theory , due to the large number of participants .
I realised there is no time to think much when it comes to practice , because you have to act quickly and to prove to yourself and the others that you use your knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .
Efficiency is one of the most important things in terms of time management .
I would strongly recommend this training course on time management , because it is useful not just to gain some theoretical aspects for those who want to be more organised , but also if you want to really manage in a daily situation .
As a result of useful activities putting theory into practice , you will have a better chance to achieve your goal .
You may think that I met them or I got an autograph , but I must disappoint you .
But I loved this experience , I really enjoyed it .
It 's an unforgettable experience and it gave me a lot .
Yours faithfully
This picture illustrates the process of producing bank notes .
The first step is to design the appearance of the bank notes and then prepare skilled machinists for metal plates .
The next step is the most important and it involves inspection , which means good and bad sheets are separated during this process .
The good quality sheets are cut into individual notes and dispatched after packing and the bad sheets and notes are destroyed for security reasons in the very last step .
Overall , the whole process of making bank notes has six steps and they are design , metal plate preparation , printing , inspection , dividing sheets into three groups and distribution or disposal .
Greenhouse gases have put a red light warning on the planet , and countries around the world are starting to realize the importance of reducing these gases .
Big cities are crowded with vehicles and , as a result , levels of pollution are dangerously increasing .
This is causing diseases and allergies that are affecting the citizens .
Plans and programmes are being developed to reduce the number of cars driving through cities .
Some of these have the same aims .
From the Metro system , the bus , the train , to the high speed rail , all this public transportation has become more and more popular .
Lots of people really enjoy the time when taking public transportation because it is more convenient , costs less and is more eco - friendly .
In my opinion , taking public transport is more convenient .
We do n't have to drive ourselves , and we do n't have to think about which way we should go to reach the destination .
Additionally , taking public transport costs less .
Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time , which leads to the greenhouse effect and a rise in the average sea level .
Taking public transport can efficiently reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and will help the earth to recover from those disorders .
The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statement that public transport has no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Can you imagine transportation which never appears ?
For a century , many modes of transport have been invented . Therefore , our lives have become convenient .
What transportation we need and should be invented now is hard to imagine , because there is no place we ca n't go .
For example , the speed of transportation could become faster , use green energy sources , increase the capacity of the public vehicles and so on .
With the advance of technology , a lot of problems have arisen . Natural resources are becoming in storted , and the air pollution is getting worse .
This is harmful to everything in the world .
So , we have to consider how to solve these problems for the next generation .
Learning another language is very useful these days , because of globalization and also cooperation between countries .
It is important when we work or study in international areas .
People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their lives .
They can have a better position , work for a foreign company , communicate with foreign companies , etc .
It can be a benefit at school as well , because if you need some information for some project , you can look at foreign literature too .
Also , you can take part in travel and work experience which your school can offer .
If you want to try this option , you need to have a very good level in a particular language .
Another very important benefit of learning a new language is that you can travel . You will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them .
It helps you to ask people for a lot of important information which you need during your journey .
For example , which way you should go , where is a good restaurant , how to travel in a country , how to solve your problems , where is the cheapest accommodation and much more .
Thanks to learning another language , you can also have friends from all over the world and you can better understand the culture of a new country .
I think that there are not many disadvantages of learning another language .
One of them could be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them .
It can be really interrupting if it continues for a long time .
In conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will always be important for today 's people and the next generation too , and in addition , the need to communicate in another language will increase .
I am writing to you in reference to the First Certificate exam .
I found a bilingual Spaniard ( with several international certificates and now he 's teaching in a bilingual school in Madrid ) .
Also , I found some books on the internet with Cambridge 's exams .
With the process of globalization , people are eager to know about other countries more than ever .
In the past , most people considered a museum the best way to get to know an unfamiliar country .
First , as technology has developed , we may find visiting museums is far from convenient .
People using new techniques have gradually become the majority .
It leads to an increasing number of people choosing to use the online museum .
On the other hand , needless to say , the limitation of a museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings . It is far from an enjoyable visit when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and not touch it .
Admittedly , a museum has its own merits ; it is easy to find on a map and is always emphasized as a symbol of a country .
A documentary , a book about the culture is cheap and easy . We can consider it an economical method .
Visiting a museum is undoubtedly a good way to learn about a country , but not the best way anymore .
If you decide to find out some information about a totally unknown country , a museum is not a wise option .
But do n't panic . Let 's think rationally .
Technology will control our homes .
With technology we will clean our house , technology will protect us , we will spend our free time with technology .
In every room we will have a big screen , where we 'll be able to see where our children are and if everything 's OK .
Do we need friends or family members if technology can take care of us ?
Machines can tell us lots of important information .
I would really appreciate it if you could give me a piece of advice about what course I should take .
I 'd like you to take into account the following requirements :
Secondly , I 'd like the college to be located not too far from accommodation if possible . I would n't like to spend too much time on public transport every day .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I 'd like bed and breakfast included in the price .
Summer camp is all about providing fun activities in a safe environment .
In my opinion , to be a suitable person for the summer camp job you should have qualifications to create fun activities and to keep kids safe .
Creating fun activities is an important role of summer camp workers .
As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7 - 10 years , I have the ability to create and perform fun activities .
In the morning program , the kids enjoyed playing football , soccer ball , basketball and water ball .
The program included many competitive activities that were full of fun and cheerful .
In the afternoon , the kids enjoyed a multi - dance program that had different international dances .
Safety is a core component in the summer camps ' activities .
While designing fun activities , the camp workers have to take into account the safety level of those activities , the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed .
As a retired nurse , I have a high sense of safety and harm prevention .
In addition , I have experience of providing basic , advanced life saving , and airway protection .
While these situations are rare , they need effective fast intervention to save kids ' lives .
In conclusion , I think providing fun in a safe environment is the main component of summer camp that each family is looking for . As a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun , to provide safe activities , and most important is my ability to intervene in emergency situations .
Foster Hollywood is an American restaurant in the center of Caceres .
The interior is spectacular because it is decorated like a Hollywood film .
The tables and the chairs are very beautiful because they are like in the American films but they are very uncomfortable .
The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed but it is always crowded .
I love this restaurant because the food is really good . It is the tastiest food that I have eaten .
My favourite dishes are the " Nachos " and " Catarapi " , the second is a dish of spicy pasta , it is spectacular .
I think this restaurant would be suitable for us because it is a great place for everyone , it is in the center and most importantly its food is really tasty .
We can get a lot of up - to - date information around the world through watching television .
There are many channels on TV , not only entertainment , but also technology , health , environment , weather forecast and news channel , etc .
Discovery Channel is a knowledge bank and Animal Planet is very interesting .
Moreover , nowadays , many education channels are being developed to help students .
Mathematics , English and environmental knowledge quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children .
We can also improve our moral attitude by watching discussions and speeches by outstanding leaders .
So , I think the advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the person watching .
So , we need to try to get an equal balance between entertainment and education from TV .
I have seen your advertisement on the Internet and I am really interested in it .
Because of this , I have learnt many activities and games that I could use in your summer camp .
I always work with a lot of children , so I have experience managing and organising groups .
About my personal characteristics , I am friendly and self - confident but I have another quality that children love : I am really creative . I can make costumes with not many materials , so they will enjoy dressing up a lot .
I usually do sports like tennis or running , but I am especially interested in having adventures , and I would like to have this one together .
I enclose my CV to complete the information .
Yours faithfully
It would be incredible if you started your trip in Cartagena , which is a Caribbean and tropical city .
After that , you should go to Medellín . At that time of the year they will be celebrating some traditional holidays .
To finish , if you want to , you can be an English tutor at my University for the whole time you stay in the city .
Please write to me and tell me if you are interested .
By the way , my boyfriend will finish a PhD program this summer :-) , and then he needs to do compulsory military service beginning 7th August for one year .
Fortunately , he is assigned to substitute services , so he does n't have to join the real army .
We think that it will be convenient for him to apply for a Postdoc position during his military service .
His ideal plan is that he will try to apply for a Postdoc position this fall or winter , and then he can work abroad after finishing military service ( August 2015 ) .
To take public transport or not , that is the question . Travelling by car is convenient , however , it
ignores the car congestion problems and the pollution because of CO2 .
preference .
Public transport reduces the car congestion problems .
going to work or travelling by car .
For example , taking the train from Taipei , a city in Taiwan , to Taoyuan in the New Year only takes half an hour in contrast to nearly two hours owing to the car congestion on the highway .
In terms of protecting the environment , taking public transport may cut down the carbon emissions .
Because there are nearly 70 billion people in the world , if everyone traveled by car even the half , the pollution would be a burden on the world .
It is urgent timing to avoid the greenhouse effect that people should think about how to decrease the carbon emissions .
To be brief , taking public transport not only avoids congestion problems to save time but benefits mother nature 's future .
Admittedly , travelling by car has its merits , such as being more convenient to go anywhere we want , and we can enjoy time with family in a car .
Nevertheless , it causes a lot of problems and pollution .
He competed in a local motorcycle race and won the $ 5000 cash prize .
Three consecutive years he had competed in the local race , but at most he had managed get second place .
Tom asked him about insurance and the old man said the insurance only paid 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease .
He thought he should perform a show jumping over several wrecked cars , but it was too risky because he had not had any experience of that kind of show .
We need advertising and to find a suitable place for the show by 3 pm " .
Short - term and enticing Russian loans are very attractive for Serbian politicians who are struggling with financial difficulties .
As an Orthodox and Slavic country which is yet to become a member of the EU and does not want to become a member of NATO , in a difficult economic situation with the public exposed to strong propaganda , Serbia is an easy target of Russia 's soft power .
People have been changing for ages and , at the same time , they have been building an astonishing history .
They have been thinking about what the world will look like , and with that thought , civilization was created .
Our curiosity is not restraining .
Many buildings , like skyscrapers suggest we will live in flats which exist above the ground , and that is not extraordinary , but how about whole cites prospering under the water with their own source of light which could replace the Sun ?
Despite the fact that the visual aspect is the most important thing to most people , in my opinion , in this case , everything has been said and no new forms can be created .
The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters . For instance , Cyclone Tracy in Darwin , Australia , the Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America , etc .
It concisely depicts the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters .
The book is also very readable , not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply giving us an overview of handling natural disasters , so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon .
The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is about the people who live along the Yellow River , how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and found a better solution .
At the beginning , the Yellow River was always unleashing terrible floods that swept through towns , villages and farmland .
After days of heavy rain , the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed can not contain the water when it is out of its limitation .
The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas . Fortunately , the flood also makes the plains fertile and feeds millions of people .
While I was flicking through the pages , I let my imagination run wild with the story .
Even though mother nature is complicated sometimes , she will give us a light of hope .
People will continue to suffer dangerous floods and there will be no end after many years unless the government take effective action to stop flooding .
It is hard for people living in devastating surroundings .
The Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization .
Reading this book is like unwrapping a present which is packed in layers of sheets .
My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people along the Yellow River .
Meanwhile , a surge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with lots of thought - provoking words .
That 's all for my presentation today .
I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity .
The World Cup , the Olympics and other international games work to ease tensions between different nations .
During that time , the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship .
The fans shout , they even cry together .
Sports events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between nations .
On the other hand , some sports matches can make international relations worse .
Patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way .
For example , during the semi - final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia , the players played quite violently , and the supporters of the two teams were very tense .
Even after the end of the match , assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams .
I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the best ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely .
However , I believe that games can not be fundamental ways for sound patriotism or peaceful international relations .
I am very interested in this management trainee - marketing position with your corporation , and believe that my education and employment background are appropriate for the position .
During my tenure at the University of Economics and Law , I have noticed my growing interest in marketing and public relations .
Last month , I did an internship at the Hoan My Medical Corporation in Ho Chi Minh City .
My position involved developing marketing content on the web pages and slideshows publicizing the success of the company 's events .
I was able to utilize my marketing skills to assist the organization in their goal to promote SEO .
The marketing department also gave me the responsibility of publicizing events via Facebook .
I believe that my experience in marketing and my interpersonal skills make me a prime candidate for this position . I am a diligent worker , and passionate about my work . I will be a valuable asset to your company and will use this as an opportunity to grow and further the development of my marketing skill set .
Thank you very much for considering my application for candidacy .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
First of all , we can define ourselves as " slaves of technology " , because now we all have a telephone that has lots of functions and that turns us away from real life .
In this way , everyone is the perfect copy of someone else and originality or a creative mind is considered as something bad .
Yes , they will , and I hope that we will improve our thoughts and we will have the consciousness that we are not " supreme " and that we will never have the right to imposing us in the world .
Taking acceptance the strength of music , it is hard to imagine human life without it . "
To my mind , the beauty of music does not depend on its varieties .
For example , there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which are organized in many countries .
People from almost all over the world attend to participate in it .
Being at the core of the culture of a country , it influences national reputation .
For instance , in our country , music consists of two main parts : Mougam and Folk music , which have been gaining popularity in all regions of the world since they began .
However , modern music is not always acceptable to different people .
To take account that it has been improving day by day , we can notice the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music in almost every country .
Most countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music .
This process makes people closer to each other , encouraging them to cooperate and become friends .
To sum up , it is necessary to point out that there is not any negativity or perfection of national or modern music at all .
It is essential to treasure music as one of the significant kinds of art .
She was always involved with school trips connected with political places like courts or government .
One day , she decided to abandon all of these things and get started on something completely different .
Unfashionable clothes turned into fashionable dresses .
I think that Spain is an incredible country since it has all kinds of landscapes : mountains , beaches , lakes , and you can enjoy adventure activities , for example , trekking routes , climbing , bungee jumping , surfing ... You can do different kinds of tourism depending on the city where you want to go .
First of all , I would like to talk about Extremadura .
Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has good weather all year .
However , I recommend travelling to Extremadura in spring or autumn because in summer it is too hot .
In Extremadura , you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfragüe National Park or Tajo - International Natural Park .
In addition , you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones ( I recommend this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it ) or small natural lakes in the North of Extremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many towns and cities with impressive ancient neighbourhoods , for instance , Cáceres , Mérida , Trujillo , Guadalupe , Alcántara ...
Other places that I would recommend are : the towns of the South of Andalucia , which have clean beaches , cold water and good leisure facilities , with many restaurants , shops , parks , zoos , aquatic parks ...
On the other hand , near the Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches where the water is very clean and warm .
In particular , I recommend you to go to the Baleares Islands .
In addition , you could visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches .
However , you must go and discover these unforgettable places .
The first one was very boring for him because he was very tired and he was n't listening to everything that the teacher was saying .
When the time for science class arrived , he felt really excited because John , the science teacher , told them that he was going to explain to them a very interesting thing .
It was about what problems we are going to have in a few years if we do n't change anything related to polluting our environment .
John talked about the serious problems caused by not recycling things like plastic bags , bottles … that end up floating in the sea because humans do n't take care of their environment , and all this is causing loads of aquatic animals to die .

This is to apply for the position advertised concerning the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
Due to my background , I believe myself to be the ideal person for the above - mentioned job .
I have been involved in summer camps with children from different backgrounds and with diverse needs .
In particular , I have been dealing with children with disabilities for 10 years .
This experience has been an eye - opener for me .
I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at everyday life through different eyes .
Children can indeed teach you a lot , being able to express their feelings with the spontaneity that adults often lack .
It was impressive to see the strength shown by those children .
Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core , children with disabilities were growing up very independent and strong , despite all the challenges they could face along the way .
During the year in Ghana , I was part of a team of volunteers working with children .
After consulting some children 's representatives , we organized Olympic games for the children attending the schools of the area .
You do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition .
As volunteers , we also helped the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room .
In conclusion , I believe myself to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it .
My experience with children of different ages and countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your esteemed company .
There seems to be nothing better , nothing more interesting , exhilarating , breathtaking or stunning than taking up this sport .
Being on the court is fun , gives me a feeling of fulfilment .
Not everybody knows how much devotion and determination is required to be a good player .
You just have to work your fingers to the bone , but it 's definitely worth it .
Despite all the obstacles , I would n't swap this hobby for anything else .
The amount of pleasure I can get is simply incomparable to anything else .
ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS
There are a lot of bargains and cheap items on the market , which very often catch our eye , but I definitely want to warn you against them !
In terms of differences is that this houses will be modern , more secure , economical .
Most of the furnishings will be machines and domestic activities will be done for us .
However , they will lose the atmosphere of houses with antique furniture and interior which create a unique and homely atmosphere .
Everything is going forward , so everything will be changed .
First of all , it 's a man 's sport , simple and at the same time complicated .
Being a fan of an NFL team is a very special experience .
If you plan to play this game , you definitely should be an outstanding athlete . You should understand the " pros " and " cons " of every move you make on the field .
I 'm a friendly , open - minded and quite easy - going guy who lives in one of the most beautiful cities in Russia - St. Petersburg .
I love my city and I love to travel , try new things , socialize and experience new cultures .
Introduction
the aim of this report is the desciption of the shopping facilities in my home town - Vienna .
Vienna has a lot of great shopping areas , and that is why I am going to focus on the three most popular places .
Conclusions
I would like to start off with one of the most well - known malls , called " Donauzentrum " .
The mall is linked to an entertainment section , called " Donauplex " .
The entertainment section stays open after the mall closes .
There you can find a cinema , some restaurants and bars .
In the countryside , you can find a recently built mall named " G3 " .
It contains nearly the same shops as the " Donauzentrum " and several restaurants and cafés .
The " Mariahilferstraße " is the perfect place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls .
Even the most illustrious shops can be found there .
As well as the shops , some nice bars and restaurants can be found .
Recommendations
Especially on a rainy afternoon , the " Donauzentrum " and " G3 " are the perfect way to spend your day .
For people who prefer spending their time in the outdoors , I would recommend a visit to the " Maria Hilfer Straße " .
Yours sincerely ,
I 've just read your advertisement for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , and I 'm really interested in it .
I 'm also a volunteer for the Red Cross , so I 'm used to looking after children and organising all kinds of events .
Does the accommodation belong to the summer camp structure ?
We do the collection , to recycle as many things as possible .
All the buildings here have been built to respect the environment . In fact , every house has photovoltaic panels on the roof .
These panels are used to harness the light of the sun to produce electricity .
The first Sunday of every month , a group of volunteers goes to the parks of the village to clean it and to cut the grass .
I always participate in these events because I love the environment and I 'd like to keep my village clean .
We all know that the Roman Empire affected Italian culture and history a lot . In fact , if you want to go on a tour around the most beautiful cities in the country , you should definitely go to Florence , Venice , Naples and many others .
You will be able to see ancient and modern buildings such as theatres , churches , cathedrals and civic buildings built by the most famous artists in the entire world !
Cities are full of museums where tourists can see all the customs and traditions that have characterized Italian culture .
That 's why Italy is such an interesting and historical country .
So , I think that both hobbies have their advantages and disadvantages .
Many people feel that learning English , especially in ' England ' or in ' the USA ' , is better than learning that in a country that does not have English as its mother tongue .
For instance , in Peru everybody speaks Spanish , so you are not accustomed to the language .
The advantages of learning English abroad are the daily practice which you should have if you are in an English - speaking country and all the people who you get to know from all over the world .
One argument in favour of this idea is that Peruvian people who learn English for a short period and then travel abroad show an improvement in just one or two months .
However , the disadvantages are that you do not know how to behave in another culture .
In conclusion , I am of the opinion that people ought to study abroad if they have the opportunity , because apart from your lessons , you can interact with native people and learn common phrases .
She did not appear at the club , and she did not come to the hotel on the following days .
If a person is going for an interview for a job , punctuality is a must . Hence , he can drive his car fast or can go earlier in his car to get there early .
But he could not travel very fast on a bus in order to reach his destination very quickly .
In conclusion , use of public transportation is decreasing day by day .
In order to boost the use of public transport , the government or the governing body should consider these factors and must find a solution to these problems .
Technology has changed us much faster and more dramatically than we used to think .
Nowadays , all we need is a fully charged smartphone with the Google Map application .
In the past , people could only make a purchase from a store by themselves , now we can browse almost hundreds of goods online and buy them via a simple click .
Because of this tremendous outcome , I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , with greater extension to every aspect of our lives .
In my imagination , the future will be more messy and crowded with fewer species of creature but more of us , human beings .
We will face more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental damage .
Some countries will be submerged entirely under the sea , some will survive , and there will be less space for an increasing population .
Fortunately , the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living , to clean air for breathing , and to purify water and food for supply .
If we have dementia ( a steady degenerative disease of our brains ) , we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of online " Big Cloud " memories .
No longer do we suffer studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we know through a link to the huge online database .
We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects on our personalities .
Moreover , our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns or even physical functions corresponding to the changing environments or simply in response to our specific commands .
However , the more we feel comfortable , the more the damage to our intellect .
We do n't have to think too much about almost anything , needing no person for company since we have all these distracting devices for entertainment and relaxation .
The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of this unrealistic convenience we have .
For example , saving the endangered wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient .
Time - saving and convenience are admittedly considered two essential values of modern lives .
Nonetheless , we have to confront the truth that resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly .
We may think that depends on how you like to travel , as they all have their advantages and disadvantages .
But personally , my favorite way to travel is by plane .
It is faster than the other two , it is not difficult to travel on it and it is quite comfortable .
Also , you can travel to different places and longer distances , whereas while boating , for example , you can only travel to places where there is a connection to the sea .
I 'm really glad to know about your future plans . I definitely think that this year of travelling and exploring will be a great way to grow up and meet new people from different cultures .
If I have the opportunity to help you with your planning , please have no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Firstly , I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital , which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites , such as museums , art galleries , monuments and churches .
If , at some point , you are fed up with art and culture , the city offers you a lot of leisure facilities such as concerts , exhibitions , festivals and so on !
As you will arrive during the summer , you should then have a vacation in the south , where the beaches are breathtaking , with such clean water and long golden shores .
In connection with your desire to find a job , you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field : as you wrote , you 're searching for a job for a month and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly meet your expectations .
If you are interested , I could give you his phone number and e - mail so that you two can speak about the matter and maybe reach an agreement .
My statement to apply to a university
I graduated from AL - mustansiria University / College of Arts / Department of Translation in 1998 .
I started working for the Ministry of Oil as senior translator in 2000 .
My country 's history inspired me all my life . The important role that my city ( Baghdad ) played in the history of education and translation especially affects the history of human civilization .
Which inspired me to study translation , which considers science and art at the same time .
I pursued my life 's dream of higher education by searching for the best universities in the UK .
I found your Translation and Interpretation program for a master 's degree meets my requirements and needs .
Since my graduation , I have acquired broad experience in translation .
After my graduation ,
I spent two years translating hundreds of essays in different fields for higher education students .
I worked in the OIL MINISTRY 's central library on foreign scientific books which mainly concerned the petroleum field .
This gives me broad knowledge of petroleum jargon which opens endless horizons of experience and of how to work on developing my knowledge and skills .
My enriched experience in the English language and my knowledge of petroleum expressions qualified me to work in the Training and Developing Directorate mainly in training abroad .
I did many important translations for training manuals and petroleum institutions student description .
In addition , the higher administration in the Training & Development Directorate selected me to join a focal committee to build up a competency system for petroleum staff in cooperation with the British government .
I want to study at your university in the pre - sessional courses to meet your standard in English language .
All the above - mentioned crystallized my ambition to continue higher education at a respected university .
I want to specialize in translation concerned with the petroleum sector .
It goes without saying that I am from a petroleum country and I want to work in OPEC as a representative of my country and enhance the Ministry of Oil 's translation staff with highly educated translators .
I plan to help the freshman translators in the Ministry to further their career under my supervision by coaching and mentoring them .
First you should visit sights like the churches and cathedrals , then move to the town centre and go through the town park .
There you will find beautiful countryside and gorgeous swans , which stay there for the whole year .
It 's quite an architecturally important building , I think , plus there are about a million books , so you can learn something new about our culture .
There are also good pubs and restaurants .
There you can taste our national cuisine but their international cuisine is also tasty .
In front of the building are enormous reflectors which shine into the darkness .
You definitely have to visit it .
Their novels have a lot in common : first of all , the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heights by E. Bronte ) , and so are the characters , who are always well described , especially on a psychological level . Furthermore , both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class .
There is also a lot in contrast . Most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities , while Bronte prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , . In fact , Dickens mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of the lower classes and the bad consequences of industrialisation , In contrast , Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroines do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prudery .
Then we can notice that the narrators of the novels have different roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient ; Bronte 's one is part of the story itself and can change , revealing other characters ' perspectives .
We feel happier during a conversation when someone has a good sense of humor .
Also , people can have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor .
I would like to provide examples to illustrate my thesis .
Consequently , we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor .
To illustrate , my nephew did not get a great score in his test .
Also , people can have a good relationship with their humor .
Furthermore , sometimes people with a sense of humor can help others to conquer difficult issues .
In the trend of globalization today , the success or failure of a business depends on many different factors .
First of all , the products that are manufactured must meet the requirements of customers perfectly .
In addition , good products with reasonable prices will always attract the attention of customers .
The price of each kind of product must be suitable for consumers that the business is targeting .
Second , the management of business leaders plays an important role in the success of the company 's business .
The head of the enterprise must have the knowledge and experience to make the right and reasonable decisions .
The leader of the business must also have a way of handling active and innovative work to save time and money .
Himselves of leader must have discipline , know working on time , and know how to create a group - working consensus , seriously .
Marketing 's job is to deliver content to customers so that they learn more about the company and the products and services , in order to increase their advantage in the consumption of goods and increase profits .
Companies can create a site dedicated to introducing the value of the products , prices and service deals .
In addition , an enterprise may do marketing through advertising , newspapers ... it is important to listen to feedback from customers to understand and supply what they need .
Good products with reasonable prices , a good manager with strong leadership and an excellent marketing plan are the factors that lead to success in business .
Importance of outdoor games
As we know , every person wants to achieve success in their lives .
Students have started to forget their physical games and get stuck in this internet world . They are spending so much time on using the internet and they engage in only meaningless gossip on social networking websites .
If they want to use it , they should try to focus on getting important information which is beneficial to improving their knowledge .
By playing physical games , they will not only improve their health but they can also gain concentration .
They should try to understand the importance of physical games and also play them regularly .
I am writing to you to ask if I may be considered for a place on your program .
I have all the characteristics which you require and , so , am an ideal person for the job .
As I 've also run the marathon three times and play in the local netball team , I am quite energetic , plus , I 'm also hardworking , as I try my best to achieve my ambition .
I become especially happy when I 'm with children !
Jeyatharini Deshpande
country , Indonesia , is full of natural attractions .
It is an archipelago , so there are definitely many tourist spots here .
Also , you can interact for longer with other passengers , especially native Indonesians , just in case you need to find out more about Indonesia as you would like to get a temporary job here .
Indonesian people are famous for their friendliness , so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia ; they will answer your questions with pleasure .
Here are a few tips for starting a conversation with Indonesians : an Indonesian person will respond to a smile with a smile , so you can start with that . Not all Indonesians speak English , but most students can speak English .
I suggest you choose college students , because they are more familiar with English . Besides , they will welcome you with pleasure to practise their English skills . When you use public transportation , you can ask for the information you need from the official employee in the station or from students for the same reason ; not many Indonesians speak English .
Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people . Many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia .
The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than on the other islands mentioned above , but other islands are more challenging and natural .
It can be a little bit difficult to find a temporary job here , unless you have got any connections with agencies or local people .
Personally , I think this development has both positive and negative sides .
Thanks to increasing living standards , people are able to afford a bigger and more expensive wedding .
If , in the past , they just held weddings at home to save money , now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead .
Secondly , it is likely that , nowadays , people focus more on appearance , so a luxurious and elegant wedding is an opportunity for them to show off .
Finally , people have more relationships in life as well as in business .
As a result , more new relationships are created , people get more chance to co - ordinate in business and help each other in life .
Those who lose contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again .
Furthermore , modern weddings bring people new experiences of food , lifestyle and cultural exchange .
Grooms , brides and their parents usually have to book a restaurant , a hotel , invite a singer and a famous master of ceremonies to make the wedding serious .
Last but not least , in some cases , only for the sake of showing off , many couples , after getting married , have to work hard to earn money to pay the debt of wedding costs .
To conclude , marriage is a landmark for an individual .
However , a wedding on a reasonable scale would both satisfy the guests and reduce the burden on the couple and their families .
Some days before , we had decided to organize an excursion to a nature trail nearby . As soon as we arrived at the railway station , we were so fascinated by what surrounded us that we walked for three hours along a path , Suddenly , our surroundings appeared to be far wilder than they had been before , so we stopped trekking and we had a look at our map .
We immediately turned towards the bushes . We were worried , as we had heard on the radio that a bear might live there .
Fortunately , it was a beautiful deer like Bambi , which looked at us and ran away more frightened than us .
Eventually , it was a special trip !
I am interested in the job because this would be an opportunity to spend my summer in a more fun way .
Another thing is that I would improve my skills in working with children and I would find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications .
I also take pleasure in playing tennis , for the benefits of practising sports and staying active .
Besides , I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor ones .
I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons : I am familiar with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one .
Another reason is that I have gained experience of taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a great sense of leadership , as well as the social skills needed , from being a scout for five years .
Because of that , I hope my letter will be taken into consideration .
At the end of the third school day , one of my classmates caught me in the hall and asked if I wanted to join them that night for dinner .
There was only one problem : I could not communicate well in English and I was really shy about it .
But when the dinner started , there was nothing to worry about , because my classmates appeared supportive and patient .
That evening was so delightful !
I told them about my country and family , I was speaking English and they were understanding me !
I am going to France this December , and Francois will show me independent Paris !
The artists invited all the staff to a big party in a restaurant .
It was unbelievable to speak with the artists and ask them questions about their life and habits .
Nowadays , it 's common to think that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport , but it 's not true at all .
Some surveys have demonstrated that travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by public transport .
Moreover , other costs will act upon the cost of travelling by private vehicle .
In the same surveys , the researchers show how travelling by public transport is safer than travelling by car .
As for the pollution , it could be reduced if people used public transport ; it is well - known that CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by public means of transport are 80% less than a car .
Significant changes have to be made to ensure the quality of service and the conditions of the coaches , trains and other public means of transport .
In this way , the customer can feel as comfortable as they felt in their own cars .
The latest research carried out by The Health Department in Spain shows that young people are not as healthy as twenty years ago .
That could be a bigger problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could rise 60 % in the next 10 years .
Finally , it is proved that youths are devoting less time to doing exercise than they should and , as a consequence , they are not improving their general health enough .
As far as I am concerned , I think the Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertising campaigns in order to improve health in the young population .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should pay more attention to this matter and teach children how to develop a healthy lifestyle .
Travelling by car is only convenient in a restricted sense , while public transport is more convenient overall .
What is meant by a restricted sense , is that for adults , who are healthy and able bodied , having access to personal transportation is arguably quite attractive .
However , note my emphasis on adult , healthy and able - bodied . For young people , for older people , for people with disabilities , being able to drive brings more costs than benefits .
A public transport system is much more convenient for this group of people because they wo n't need to worry about the skill and attention needed for driving .
Furthermore , the monetary costs in the long run are much lower using public transport , both for individuals and for the wider society .
They ca n't do trivial things such as shopping or going to the cinema with their family without being aware of the fans and paparazzi .
Even when celebrities are having holidays , people ask them to give them an autograph .
The complexity of human behaviour is critical in sport .
As a result of this , many studies have shown that athletes should be motivated to push themselves beyond the record .
You need motivation to believe in yourself , that you can achieve it .
This attitude is especially true for sportsmen and women .
One of the most difficult sports on Earth will teach you what hard work , sacrifice , pain , strain but also satisfaction , determination , pride and struggle mean .
The complexities of swimming are not only for the body workout but above all for the mind .
If you want to swim every day , pushing yourself beyond your limits , you definitely need a strong psyche and solid motivation .
Furthermore , as Michael Phelps said : " There will be obstacles , there will be doubters , there will be mistakes , but with hard work ... there are no limits " .
People have had a need for communication since the dawn of time .
Every human being has a need for socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends .
Personally , I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It usually starts with small talk or compliments , as at school I was taught that expressing appreciation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationship .
A true friendship forms itself on a foundation of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time .
Mr Smith was found on the floor with a glass next to him which was completely broken .
She opened the room with some keys that all the waitresses have , and saw Mr Smith lying dead on the floor .
The detectives analysed what was in the glass and it was poison .
In fact , I discovered that Mr Smith 's nephew wanted all his fortune .
At first , I completely agreed with this , but then when I started to think about it I realized that it 's not like that .
Firstly , I think that if you work as a team , you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation with you can have a better and more complete answer , because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
In conclusion , I believe that it 's better to work as a team than to work on your own because the team give you love , companionship and you can have a very good time .
It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words , and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years .
However , this choice may not be the wisest , as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications .
I am referring to the Internet . Born in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect missile facilities and the central headquarters , it soon spread to universities and educational centers .
This fact , along with the spread of personal computers , quickly led to a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century .
Nobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements .
For more than 50 years , it has been the main entertainment channel , displacing others like radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In its first years , television was also an important channel for culture ( theater plays , classic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in recent years , television has lost this educational focus .
The Internet , on the other hand , has become more and more popular , not only for entertainment , but also for business , and today it is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet does n't play a major role .
The Internet has also replaced television for watching films and TV shows , especially among young people , who prefer to download and watch videos instead of watching to the fixed schedule of TV .
This experience is unbelievable and unforgettable for me .
While the fire was spreading all over the bedroom , I woke up and Matxi was unconscious because there was a lot of smoke in the bedroom .
Fortunately , we managed to wake her up .
At the beginning , we could n't stop the fire , but although this night sounds impossible , we managed to put out the fire .
That day I was afraid , but now I remember this experience as a good time .
Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always room for further discussion .
Now the question under discussion is whether public transport has a future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages .
In smaller towns without an underground there are usually a number of bus routes to cover the city area , so , all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you 'll reach your destination .
It is obvious that it is safer for the environment than thirty cars with a single person inside .
You should take into account that thirty drivers ( often inexperienced or aggressive ) pose a greater danger to road users than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other people in the traffic .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage the development of public transport because it creates employment , lessens the impact on the environment and contributes to road safety .
So , my opinion is that public transport does have a future . Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long - lasting life as well .
Peter was already there and he immediately told Michael about a trip to Italy that he had planned for them .
Everything sounded great , they only needed a little bit more money and a car .
He knew that Peter was a little bit irresponsible , but he thought that the arrangement sounded perfect and nothing could go wrong .
He was thinking that this time it would be different , everything was planned and they would have a great time .
Alison read the note , smiled and immediately put on her coat .
Occasionally , her older sister would watch her from the hall and poke her index finger at her forehead . " What a jerk " she 'd mutter under her breath .
Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless of his young age of seventeen , he would quit school and start earning money .
She was weak , but preferred to be called fragile , as if that made a significant difference .
Her major health problem was asthma , as well as anemia , a poor immune system and being underweight .
But there 's something in her big bright eyes , circled with long brown eyelashes and freckles , that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom 's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing gaze .
Small snub nose , full lips and high cheekbones .
The rest is completely different .
That 's why Mary is constantly surrounded by a bunch of fellas , meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back .
ROMEO AND JULIET , Franco Zeffirelli ( 1968 )
The best known love story of all time - Romeo and Juliet - has been adapted a number of times for the cinema and also made into successful musicals .
One of the most renowned romance films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968 .
The script is a faithful translation of the original text and the plot , as well , sticks to Shakespeare 's work .
This remarkable story is set in Verona in the 15th century .
The film , instead , was shot in central Italy and , surprisingly , the scene on the balcony was n't even filmed in Verona .
The young bridegroom is then involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The play becomes tremendously thrilling until the couple 's death .
The acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task , and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their roles very convincingly .
Believable costumes and location , unforgettable soundtrack and outstanding performances celebrate a gripping and moving story that will charm you .
If you fancy travelling back in time , do n't miss this piece of art .
The aim of this report is to make suggestions about the facilities of the club .
The swimming pool is big enough and the temperature of the water is fine .
However , the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are currently in use .
Apart from the above - mentioned points , there may be so many other ideas which can make a big difference to the club .
Her family and her homeland had disappeared .
But , just as hope almost disappeared , she had remembered the words of the old lady .
As unbelievable as it seems , it had been a gate of time .
It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed , but Alice 's desire had been stronger than her fears .
She , without any hesitation , had gone through the gate .
More specifically , it was Alice when she was starting her journey .
And finally , she went on to her destination , her beloved homeland .
Had you told me that I would win some literary competitions and that some people would speak well of me , I would n't have believed you .
The year was 2012 , and I had n't written anything until that day - I had just been translating some stories and , once , even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
But that day - it was in spring and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us about a literary competition .
And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email address .
For the first days I was a little bit nervous , but day by day , I started forgetting about any competition .
And the more I won competitions , the more proud I was of myself .
Disassembling games , building things of wood and playing Lego were my favorite hobbies .
Through the years , my interest in machines and electrical devices increased , so whenever a device stops working I try to fix it before calling the maintenance , and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke something .
When I was in secondary school and my friends were dreaming of being doctors or dentists , I decided that I would be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
During my studies , my parents and I noticed that I understood kinetic physics more than electrical physics .
Also , I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry . That is why I decided to study mechanical engineering .
Since I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my Master 's studies in Europe or America .
After searching and asking , I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities , and it offers a great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways .
Moreover , Germany is one of the biggest industrial countries in the world and it has many huge factories .
Additionally , the living costs are quite affordable .
I have been working as a teacher of mechanical materials in a vocational school since my graduation .
I really like this profession and how good it feels to spread science and knowledge to new generations .
Therefore , I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate studies and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I have been looking for a while for a suitable university to apply to .
First , I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering Master 's program .
Second , TU - Clausthal has a very good rating in engineering on many websites like ranking.zeit.de .
Third , TU - Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a language center .
Finally , TU - Clausthal is located in beautiful countryside .
I hope that I get the chance to complete my studies at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
The most common reasons to study a language are work and travel .
Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand and you will be able to make simple sentences in a few days .
All things considered , I think that English is the easiest option when you want to study a language .
Whereas there are a lot of options , we rarely start learning other languages before we can communicate well in English .
Digital advertising ; an exciting but undesirable business
It is indisputable that advertising has become a permanent fixture in our daily lives .
Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment , it was welcomed as fun and informative .
It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore .
But we have now entered a new era of the attention - grabbing business : its digitalisation .
Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from minuscule to vast has made adverts all - pervasive .
Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day .
Those involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them .
Multimedia , advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused by the speed of life in the new age , unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully insinuated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
The result is insincere , misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject .
I am writing with regard to the campaign that you are promoting in favour of an international sports competition that could be hosted in my town .
As a matter of fact , Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition , which will last one day .
The marathon runners coming before or staying after the competition could take advantage of visiting the city , which offers a great number of attractions .
There are two separate communication networks in the city , that of the waterways and that of the narrow streets .
Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day , although less frequently at night .
Hotel receptions and travel agencies are always ready to help their guests with a wide range of information on the city 's entertainments , exhibitions and so on .
Sightseeing and excursions with private local guides are available on request .
In addition to this , there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city , such as theatres , cinemas and night - clubs .
On the other hand , participants will find a wide range of restaurants , trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus offering local food .
Some of these restaurants can be quite expensive .
In conclusion , I think there will be no obstacles and objections to hosting this sports competition in my town , which , on the other hand , is also a cultural event for many of the participants .
Yours faithfully
I asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed .
It was NICKELBACK !
My name is Lorin and I am 13 years old . I live in Djursholm at Riddarvägen 42 , close to a field .
I compete in skiing and I think it 's great fun . I often go skiing in Åre , Vemdalen and in Ramundberget .
Once every year , I ski with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt .
In Zermatt you can see the Matterhorn ( the mountain that you see on Toblerone packaging ) .
In the summer holidays , my family and I just spend time on the west coast on a small island called Kålhuvudet .
That is one of our summerhouses . I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish for crabs and just have a lot of fun .
My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree . I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them on .
My favourite song is a song called Chandelier by an artist called Sia .
I like sushi because the combination of fish , rice and soya makes it delicious .
I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with béarnaise sauce . It is a very good combination .
My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called Dahlboms in Åre , because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever .
The moment he reached the light , everything changed .
Local people were invited and a talent competition was held .
Everything started on Saturday afternoon on the main square in Krakow .
The number of people exceeded my expectations !
Generally , bands played really well , but , of course , there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it did n't matter so much .
Unfortunately , not all of the food was tasty , so one of the things I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoid hot dogs .
It was a fantastic experience , especially for the people for which it was intended .
You wo n't be disappointed .
To be honest , I 've never understood why you enjoy boxing anyway .
Having said that , I also must admit that I know how hardworking you can be .
You 've been suspiciously quiet about that recently .
I discovered the English language when I was eight , and it amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course .
English was also the key to my passion for technology . The more I understood the language , the more I understood how to use computers and the internet .
That is why I wish to work in the area of Computer Sciences , and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language , the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area because of its great universities and educational system .
I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and algorithms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact science courses .
To bring back from this exchange technical knowledge in programming , as well as new methods of teaching , would be outstanding .
Although I write and speak English at an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic contexts and interpersonal communication . As all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good materials for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .
In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals in the field of information technology in both academic institutions and the job market . Travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
Although I prefer the academic field , working in a company related to software design and creation would be a marvellous way of gaining experience in the field .
I would be happy too , if , by any chance , I could apply to summer jobs or internships as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher 's assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market works for both academic and commercial careers .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. because of its differentiated educational system , for the work and research opportunities that I might find , to know better a culture that amazes me with its capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language that I love , to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here , and , in the long - term , become a better professional or teacher , with a good and solid background in computer sciences , information technology and finally , system analysis and development .
I am writing to inform you about the most beautiful places and interesting buildings in Vilnius .
This castle is very old and it is surrounded by water .
It is very beautiful and there are many interesting things to see in this castle .
This castle consists of many buildings and even underground tunnels .
Yours faithfully ,
" Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
Installations are usually placed in big spaces because they have an important structure with the main task of making people reflect on something important that the artist needs to communicate to the biggest number of people .
Personally , I have seen only one " installation art " .
The second , in the centre of the stand , was a column made of coloured plastic baskets , surrounded by plastic bottles .
The artist wanted to represent the difference between the ecological recycling of plastic compared to the common collection of trash .
Seeing it for the first time , it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .
Only after having read the explanation was it possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have a complete understanding of its meaning and shape .
Despite their beauty , new forms of art are very complicated to understand , especially compared to the classical arts .
Seeing a Da Vinci portrait or a landscape painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted .
At first sight , those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece helps to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looking at installation art , it is harder to have a clear emotion at first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist .
In conclusion , I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason ; to communicate something .
In every historical period , artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways .
Classical art was easier for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous , while modern artworks are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion , the difference between installation art and classical art resides in the feeling that they can inspire in the audience .
My name is Melissa , I am 14 years old and I can speak English . I love summer camps because you learn so much in them and have wonderful experiences too .
I have experience of looking after children .
Kitesurfing - this sport is getting more and more popular , not only in countries such as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , but also in other ones , like Poland or Germany !
A feeling of being completely free , the joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board , the incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy .
When I tried kitesurfing by myself for the first time , I was a little bit scared . "
Despite the fact that it seems hard , kitesurfing is one of the easiest water sports !
My only advice is : go to the seaside , find a nice camp for surfers with a good instructor , and enjoy your moments of freedom !
During the concert , I was responsible for supervision of sort - out in the toilets .
By the way , I met your ex - girlfriend there with her new boyfriend .
Tell me everything about your new girlfriend .
Thus came the question of what I was going to do next , but I was n't ready to make that decision back then , so with the agreement of my parents , I decided to take a gap - year .
The journey to the United States was surprisingly good , I had some friends on the plane who were going to the same destination as me and I actually did n't miss my family that much .
I also got to know myself better and I have reached a decision about what I want to do next year . I am going to study at the university .
So if you are ever even considering the idea of taking a gap - year , do n't hesitate , just do it .
I was thinking that maybe it was just my imagination .
Eventually , I slowly opened the door and went out of my room .
It was reassuring to hear a familiar voice .
We at Madhura Nagar , understand the need to protect the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on them , so that people can use them instead of plastic bags .
Each year , we encourage school - going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment , so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment .
We encourage people who come up with any innovative ideas about how we could further protect the environment .
Besides this , we often visit our neighbouring towns and educate them on the issues of global warming , the threat to ecological balance etc . , and guide them on how to protect our environment .
I would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook - post of the 18th of July .
With these experiences , I can safely escort people who are knocked out or a bit ill and ca n't stand the concert anymore out of a concert and help them .
I haven't got a family so I am independent and able to work wherever I can .
I feel I have the right experiences and attitude to be a great member of the crew and I hope you will consider my application favorably .
The only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I do n't even know why .
But I love basketball and handball - especially the former - every time we play basketball at school during Physical Education , I 'm so happy about it and I do my best . I do n't know how to explain why I love this game so much .
Maybe it 's because , in basketball , you have to run a lot and you have to be really fast , and my second favourite sport is running .
Anyway - if someone asked me for advice about basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't the best player in the world . I 'm also not .
But no matter how fabulous it looks , it brings some consequences and even problems .
One of the biggest disadvantages of being popular is that they are on everybody 's lips .
The public love to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details .
Whether they like it or not , they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them at every single moment of their life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interfere with their personal lives .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi should n't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate affairs .
For example , when a popular film star goes to hospital because of his relative 's illness , reporters and photographers in particular should stay away and leave the celebrity alone .
Even though they are well known , they have a right to have free time and they should be able to spend it however they want to , without anyone disturbing them .
It has been an important subject especially for writers from the ' ' first generation '' like William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as a reality inseparable from man , where it comforts in sorrow and teaches to love and to act in a moral way .
It is associated with strong emotions caused by natural spectacles , like hurricanes , waterfalls or starry sky .
The sublime inspired many writers , like W. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the sight of infinite spaces , like the desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sublime that Wordsworth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Romantic sublime : forms of nature that inspire feelings of awe , danger or weakness .
Also , Coleridge had a concept of the sublime , but for him it was associated with infinite spaces and the sense of perdition and suspense .
It was an amazing and very instructive summer camp and I must say that I am the proud owner of the captain camp assistant badge .
It was my duty to make sure everything was running smoothly , according to the program , and I had to supervise and direct the other assistants if any problems should occur .
I have been volunteering for St John Ambulance for 6 years now and I can say that it is a truly amazing and eye - opening experience .
Thank you for taking the time to read my application and I am looking forward to hearing from you .
The art of making a good impression .
An old saying goes ' You never get a second chance to make a first impression ' .
That 's always important when you meet someone for the first time , but especially when you come to a job interview .
Here are some tips to help you make a positive first impression .
You should dress appropriately for the job that you want to get .
Men should wear a suit and a tie , and women should wear an appropriate blouse and skirt or pants .
Everyone should have clean hands and fingernails .
When you first meet the interviewer , shake his or her hand firmly .
Then you should thank the interviewer for the invitation .
Instead of that , you should show that you have experience or specific education in the area .
Try to avoid using filler words such as " like " , or " um " because they tell the interviewer that you 're nervous .
Never use monosyllabic answers .
Going to a job interview can be a stressful experience for even the most job seekers , but if you use these tips , the first impression of you will be positive .
I am writing in response to the article about friendship that was published in your magazine .
I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and , furthermore , evaluate the reasons why it is especially complicated to maintain long - lasting friendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily . Consequently , I do not have a large circle of friends .
However , I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person .
Although it is true that this is not a long - term friendship , I can say that I have found a true friend .
Throughout this friendship , I have been given the support , the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two - way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendship and it is of great importance to me because it is a balanced , one - of - a - kind relationship .
Secondly , I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort .
A reason for this may be the fact that , over the years , people change and grow apart .
For this reason , not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants , simply because they are not the same people as they were before .
As you gradually grow up , your world expands , your personality changes and so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo , but there are others such as enrolling in school , getting our first job or changing an old one , travelling or moving to another city .
All these situations may impede us staying in touch with old friends , but , on the other hand , can give us the opportunity to make new ones .
To summarize , I would like to say that even though we are incapable of remaining on friendly terms with everyone , we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors that makes us human and we should always embrace it .
Yours faithfully ,
Viña del Mar is a wonderful city on the west coast of Central Chile and boasts a number of shopping facilities and different sorts of attractions for tourists of all ages .
The biggest and best one is the Marina Arauco Shopping Centre , located on 15 Norte St. It has two anchor department stores , Almacenes Paris and Almacenes Ripley , one at each end of the mall which is two blocks long .
There are four floors , each of which contains different departments of the anchor stores , and a number of small shops which sell a variety of products .
There is also a food court on the third floor , catering to all sorts of customers , as well as a few restaurants on the first and second floors .
There are two underground floors for parking , which can get a bit crowded in peak seasons , but which are very reasonably priced .
Nearby there is also a large supermarket and a home store which offers products for building purposes , also connected to a shopping gallery .
This street runs from the Viña Square towards the sea for about six or seven blocks , and has many small shops and businesses which attract a lot of people .
There are several supermarkets and two anchor shops at one end of the street , which are convenient shopping venues for people who live in the city centre .
There are also other areas in Viña del Mar where groups of shops have concentrated so as to offer facilities to residential areas , also convenient for people who live in the surroundings .
All in all , I think there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town , so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer .

Conclusion :
Zaragoza 's population is aware of the importance of keeping the town clean and so they 're willing to do plenty of things to avoid pollution and its environmental consequences .
I 've always liked to play with kids and do fun activities with them .
My favorite activities would be painting , and making up fun games .
I can cook anything , really . Just give me the ingredients and I 'll make you whatever you want .
-Help organise sports and evening activities .
They announced that the Big One would occur that afternoon at 7:00 PM approximately , so they warned that people had to leave the city or go to safe places in the next few hours .
Peter and his father were very busy solving the problems of neighbours and it took them some hours .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I have really enjoyed SAWAN 2015 , and I would definitely participate in it again .
Narwal Ji has supported me throughout the preparation of this program .
As someone who hasn't sung classical before and has no background in Hindi Singing , I found it very confronting to sing at a concert after only four months of training .
He has given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginning singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate .
He has given me a large amount of motivation , which led me to come all the way from Canberra to Melbourne to perform in this concert .
The night has been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence greatly .
In addition to this , the night was beautifully organised and each performance was professionally executed .
An original mix of cultures were represented consistently .
Overall , the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching .
We will take great pleasure in helping the students to get around and feel at home in their accommodation .
We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations , and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour in and around the Grand Place of Brussels .
Away from busy and noisy roads , the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries ; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houses and shops in light colours and with old - fashioned roofs .
We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students , so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to .
Most of the year I live in Poznań because of my studies at the University , but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends .
Last summer I decided to do something more than just relax and have fun , so I started to look for an interesting summer job .
Like I previously said , Kętrzyn is a rather small town , so there is only one old movie theatre and it 's closed for most the time .
You know how much I love watching movies , especially in small and cosy movie theatres .
The main reason why I loved working there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted .
There is only one auditorium , so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there was a 15 minute break in the middle of the show , for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks .
This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere , regular visitors and the people I worked with .
I bet it is an interesting story .

The line graph illustrates the amount and type of fast food eaten by teenagers in Australia between 1795 and 2000 .
As an overall trend , it is clear that consumption of fish and chips decreased over the period while the amount of pizzas and hamburgers eaten increased during the same period .
In 1975 , the consumption of fish and chips was ten times higher than the consumption of the other two types of fast food .
In contrast , the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975 , and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times , respectively , in 1995 .

The place is very near where I live , and I 've worked in a lot of Cafes before , but unfortunately , I had to leave them for school and college .
Work in the Cafe will also allow me to meet people from the neighborhood , which is very important for me right now , since I just moved in .
I can show all my recommendation letters from my previous jobs , but I 'll say right now that they all say good things about me .
I try to never let my personal problems interfere in my professional life , and if it does some day , I would ask you to tell me , so I can change .
I 'll take my time to practise everything I can at home .
Set in in late 1950s France , Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different : whether they are gypsies , women that do n't depend on men , or people that do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a single mother and chocolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a small , closed - minded French village , the mayor of which decides to boycott her .
During Lent , the protagonist gets to know other outcasts ( mainly women ) and helps them .
One of the strengths of the film is its star - studded cast : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Dench as a grumpy , elderly woman resented with the oppressing society of the village , and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan .
Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors do n't fail in bringing them to life .
Besides the cast , I would like to highlight the original soundtrack .
It suits perfectly the theme of the movie , with a little bit of jazz manouche , a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminiscences of Mexican folklore , as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Mayan ancestors .
If I had to find a downside to Chocolat , it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their story lines .
Had it not been written in the year 2000 , but today , I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters .
All in all , this is a gripping , moving , and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues .
A must - see if , like me , you enjoy cinema with strong female characters in the lead roles , but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michael Clifford was a lucky man who had everything he could ever want : he was a thirty - year - old English businessman married to a sophisticated mathematician with whom he had two sons and a pretty , talented daughter . He owned a successful corporation and had a gorgeous chalet near the sea .
One night , having ended a meeting with an important sponsor , Michael decided to enter a pub with one of his colleagues in order to celebrate the successful meeting .
Travelling has become a great part of our daily lives , whether we only go to the nearby grocery store or choose to visit our relatives who live in another country .
Modern means of transport are constantly improving , being faster and more comfortable than ever before .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and private transport , because they both have advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel to .
Another advantage of cars is the fact that they are family friendly , meaning that people who use them do n't have to worry about travelling with strangers who might be dangerous .
Travelling across the Atlantic Ocean , for example , requires an airplane or a ship .
Trains are a great mode of transport across intercontinental distances , especially since they have become faster .
Statistically speaking , car accidents are much more frequent than plane crashes or train accidents , so public transport is not only cheaper sometimes , but it 's also safer and faster .
Airplanes , busses , trains or ships are here to stay because they are more practical in some situations .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter flew from the classroom and tried to squeeze himself between the multiple students that were evacuating their classes .
All of them anxious to get outside and relax for a few hours , suffering from an endless punishment : knowledge .
As he got near his destination , the density of students seemed to grow and it was becoming even more difficult for him to advance in that sea of moving bodies .
Fortunately ,
Besides their past , we can , fortunately , adore their beauty .
One of these places is , undoubtedly , Kazimierz , the Old Jewish district of Cracow .
In this small part of Cracow , you can meet with Jewish culture and architectural style .
It was established in 1800 .
For those who enter , it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
Then , you really must visit the synagogues : The Temple Synagogue , Isaac Synagogue , The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue .
For the history lovers , I recommend going to the Historical Museum of The History and Culture of Jewish People .
It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XVth century .
Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts , graphics and paintings .
You can buy almost everything there : fresh fruits , vegetables , and household products .
I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets , especially in terms of their personal development .
Specifically , they learn to take responsibility when taking care of pets .
I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then .
So , according to my personal experiences , I think that children can benefit from keeping a pet .
Some people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time , instead of children themselves .
Nevertheless , what those people have claimed is a digression from the topic here .
In other words , taking care of pets is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they are given an opportunity .
Moreover , children can also learn to sympathize with others by keeping a pet , apart from leaning to be responsible .
After that day , I started to be able to sympathize with people who had lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation .
Thus , keeping pets does enable people to be able to put themselves in others ' shoes .
Based upon my personal experiences , by taking care of pets , children can not only learn to take responsibility , but can also learn to sympathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personal development .
On the other hand , if children are not allowed to keep a pet , the parents will have to come up with other ways to make the children both responsible and sympathetic .
We always believe that a city should never compromise the environment for the sake of development .
Not only financial development , but also the environment are essential to a healthy city .
With this belief , we endeavor to keep our city as clean and attractive as possible .
Here , we are proud to report our accomplishments thus far .
Reducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of the utmost importance in this regard .
Hence , we have incorporated the concept of environmental protection into our curriculum so that students can develop an awareness of the matter at a young age .
Different activities , including seminars and exhibitions have been held in different districts to spread the message of environmental conservation across the community .
Public Housing Estate Recycle Competitions have also been held every year to promote the concept of recycling plastic , paper or tin and to help the residents cultivate such a habit in daily life .
A tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tours are also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and , above all , to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature .
With concerted efforts , we have made great strides in environmental protection in recent years , as seen in the declining amount of waste and increasing amount of greenery .

People often forget how important it is to help save the environment on a day - to - day basis , yet I believe it is not only the first step , but the most important to public awareness .
Living in a big city , I can cycle to work every day , which I believe is a great way to exercise and reduce my environmental footprint .
Besides , cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .
However , I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources ; we are , obviously , very careful with turning off the taps when we wash our hands , brush our teeth and so on , and we recycle as much as possible .
We feed worms our food and organic waste , which has drastically decreased it .
Composting has made us more aware of our waste and the amount of packaging in the items we buy .
I 'd definitely recommend it to everyone , whether they live in a flat or in a house with a garden .
We live in the century of mass consumption , when shopping requires more and more time out of our daily routines .
For some , this activity is a torture ; for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
First of all , shopping is unavoidable as it is necessary to shop for food .
It depends on the person how often he goes to buy groceries , probably according to individual needs .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer a greater variety of goods , but require more time , while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly .
Secondly , shopping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before annual celebrations , or during seasonal sales .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces are full , again facing long queues in stores - no matter how unpleasant it sounds , it is the reality nowadays .
Afterwards , some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it causes more tension and destroys your mood !
Also , some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential . They are attracted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything , as they are excited by the shopping process itself . It causes regrets and financial problems afterwards .
Finally , it may be very tiring , as you may waste precious time just walking around and not finding the thing you are interested in and need .
On the other hand , the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions , without any rush , they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes , best quality garments , stylish items .
Although shopping may be entertaining , it is still a time - consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare products , especially for women , may be a perfect way of spending even all day .
On the other hand , searching for your favourite brands , non - seasonal products , some special goods , just looking through shelves , trying the garments on , asking for advice , testing products , there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it after entering a colourful and attractive store .
Fortunately , this unavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore , as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save time , money and energy for those who are not that keen to hit the mall .
It all began with my older sister Jennifer , as everything used to begin with her .
She always wanted to be in the spotlight , and she had always succeeded , since everyone adored her .
Quite understandable , because Jennifer had the most beautiful , big blue eyes as well as thick blonde hair , a magnificent smile and an outstanding shape .
Until we received that remarkable letter , I had always been in her shadow .
Oh my God , I look absolutely gorgeous in this dress ! , " she shouted . "
Jennifer had auditioned , and she was 100% sure that she would be the lead woman .
I had also auditioned , only because my best friends pushed me very hard , and I was 100% sure that I would n't even get a small role in the play .
She immediately ran to the doormat , ran back to the living room and showed me the envelope in her hands .
Unfortunately , your audition was really bad , Jennifer , so we could not give you a role in our play .
I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carly Brown , the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in town , had been chosen to become the lead woman in a big play !
The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of the 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place .
The English economy changed from an agricultural one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygiene conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .
These big changes influenced poetry a lot and we can see that , for example , in Blake , because in " The Tyger " he uses a lot of colors referring to industrial life ( red , orange , silver .. ) and he describes the Tyger 's creator as an artisan that creates it in a furnace .
In contrast , the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the ideas of freedom , fraternity and equality , so these concepts also strongly influenced the poetry of the period .
We can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to the West Wind " , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; in contrast , in the " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners on the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present also in " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud " by Wordsworth , because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During the last thirteen years , the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries .
This essay will examine some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food .
First of all is convenience .
People who have just done their work are very hungry ; they can not go home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided with energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs , so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger .
There are numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built everywhere .
On the other hand , eating fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer 's health .
Junk food contains a lot of unhealthy chemicals and a high percentage of fat and cholesterol , which are the biggest factors leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists , people who usually eat a lot of junk food will have more than 50% risk of becoming obese and even dying soon .
Furthermore , most junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
Finally , there is the loss of traditional meals .
As a consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is gradually lost .
In conclusion , there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of fast food .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger of white - collar workers , but it can also harm their health .
Facebook is the most popular social networking site of all time .
First of all , I think Facebook , for example , is a great way for shy people to socialize , because it can boost their self - esteem , considering the fact that they do n't have to meet anyone face - to - face .
It 's also great if we want to manage our friendships , or create new ones .
As a shy person , I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interaction .
Social networking sites also benefit those who have " unusual " hobbies or those who have a hard time finding people with similar interests .
On the other hand , we are also exposed to many risks , such as cyberbullying or online predators .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems for teenagers , such as depression , suicidal thoughts or even worse .
To conclude , although social media seem flawless , we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up .
I saw the advertisement for a job to work on this summer camp .
I am really hardworking and love kids . I used to babysit for my neighbour 's kids , so looking after kids will be easy for me .
I am also very cheerful and energetic , and am very good at organising fun activities .
Working in the kitchen does not seem so bad either , because I know that everything depends on our attitude and if I have a positive attitude . I 'll have a good time no matter if I 'm doing a fun activity or cleaning dishes .
I hope you think I 'm the right person for this . I think this would be a great experience for me as well as for the kids .
This is certainly true and corresponds with my experience .
I feel that this can be attributed , in the first instance , to the changing nature of modern societies .
In the past , it was the norm for people to live in a limited geographical area all their lives and be involved in the same type of occupation all their working lives .
There was simply no alternative to this , especially if you lived in an agricultural society .
However , with the rise of industry and specialized companies , it became possible for workers to move jobs , often to places far away .
With the opportunity for change comes choice , although circumstances , economic and personal , can often force people to do what they might not normally choose .
This might be because they have strong obligations to family , might need to look after someone or might simply not have marketable skills to find a livelihood somewhere else .
It is perhaps the majority nowadays who find change refreshing because of the new opportunities it holds out and the possibilities of getting on professionally and socially .
Even though the boat was ready to go , Jessica was afraid of it breaking into pieces again . She could almost foresee that forthcoming heavy rain destroying her boat , so she had an idea .
Meanwhile , Jacob was completely in love with that girl he met weeks before . Her name was Scarlett . She said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high - tech portable device that would change gravity to low levels and for a short period of time , like a fraction of a second , but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive . But as her dad continued with the experiment , his boss got so mad he kicked them out of the city onto that mysterious island .
She also explained that they did n't know how the majority of people on the island got there , because not all of them spoke the same language , but they learned how to communicate with signs .
Abortion is a controversial issue in our society today .
Some Pro - choice groups and individuals believe that a person has the right of choice . This includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not .
Contradicting the Pro - choice groups , Pro - life supporters consider terminating any pregnancy unjustifiable .
Even though in some circumstances , such as life - threatening and sexual - abuse pregnancies , it could be the best thing to do .
Abortion can be given as an option in life-threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mother is important in a child 's life , especially in the first few months .
During the first months , the relationship between a mother and a child develops rapidly .
The baby 's inborn capacity for imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation , is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother 's empathetic response .
( Lier.l,1988 )
This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child 's development could be negatively influenced in this case .
Development of emotional and psychological problems because of maternal deprivation can be a result .
The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult life .
Because of this risk , abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in the case of conception as a result of sexual abuse .
Conception as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and , in these cases , abortion should be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims , all areas of a victim 's life are affected .
Recovering is a hard and complicated process and when you add a pregnancy to this equation it just makes it even more painful .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist 's child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even if abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solution to accidental pregnancies .
It is for the person who decides to have coitus to make sure they use an appropriate contraceptive .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situations where abortion is given as an option .
Abortion only has to be approved as an option in life - threatening pregnancies or if the mother has been sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it is still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist 's child .
I am pleased to recommend Dr. Oscar Montés for a teaching position at IHME and the Department of Global Health within the School of Medicine and the School of Public Health at the University of Washington .
I had the opportunity to be a student of and work as a research assistant with Dr. Montés in the same field .
I can definitely affirm that he has excellent teaching skills .
He taught people from different backgrounds , undergraduate and postgraduate students , and managed to explain difficult public health topics marvellously .
Also , in Master 's degree final project II , Dr Montés helped us to accomplish the master 's degree thesis with excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Montés , I experienced great learning in many fields , not only in Public Health topics , but also in research methodology , public speaking , and writing .
I witnessed and learned from his ability to work with other faculties , such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Economics , and School of Law .
Moreover , we developed projects with multidisciplinary teams for the following institutions : the Colombian Ministry of Health , and the World Bank , with excellent results .
I think Dr Montés fulfils the requirements of the position you offer .
Since he has great expertise in teaching , and is an excellent boss , respectful of the opinion , time , and personal background of everybody .
In the letter he complained about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to succeed in a future job , but I do n't agree with this statement .
As a matter of fact , students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as much information as they can contain .
They should make their students experience school as a pleasant experience , as something their future is based on .
I agree with this recommendation because I think it 's important for schools to make the same progress society does year by year , always offering new materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy society 's needs and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
However , it also has some disadvantages .
On the one hand , I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information in textbooks because they have existed for many centuries .
Furthermore , if you go to a library , you could spend all day reading books and learning about different things because in these places there are many ancient books .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoy working with textbooks more because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Taking everything into account , in my opinion , every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education .
As a writer - to - be , I admire her work creating a fantastic world of magic and epic as well as dark characters who are recognizable all around the globe .
His ' Song of fire and ice ' saga has been brought into the television world with the title Game of Thrones and it is currently receiving awards as the best TV drama series of all time .
However , when talking about great achievements , I will always talk about people like Nelson Mandela , Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks .
My fascination for those people is that they fought for their people 's rights , the black race 's rights , in a world of white people treating them as slaves and bullying them .
That is why , nowadays , I feel a huge admiration for Malala Youszafi .
Our house is clean and comfortable , me and my family love to spend time at home .
Every weekend we leave everything and meet to spend time together , to share news , love and plans .
Sometimes , our kids invite friends and today my son came with his girlfriend .
Friends , colleagues , family all those people who were next to me on my way to this wonderful day .
If you 've been following my blog , you 'll know that I 've been on a journey of discovery and creation concerning using technology to create materials and using technology to teach .
I checked the equipment : I had a computer and projector , both in good working order , a fast internet connection and a full class .
As soon as the lights went out , the atmosphere changed in the classroom and I felt the tension rise .
One student said that she could n't see well , another student complained that the writing was too small , another felt she was getting too hot from the projector .
This is a group of beginners , the experience of a first lesson with a new teacher is daunting enough , without adding unfamiliar technology and teaching methods .
So I switched off the projector , took out my whiteboard pen , dusted off my flash cards and reverted to traditional methods of teaching .
We 've had three lessons so far and I 'm thoroughly enjoying teaching this group ; it 's a pleasure to teach face - to - face and a challenge to teach adults at this level ; it 's really great to get ' back to basics ' .
This experience has reminded me that although there are many advantages to using technology in the class room , it 's not always appropriate and it 's helped me to establish some equilibrium in my teaching methods .
Instead of creating some online lessons for this wonderful group , I have taken the opportunity to create some new printable materials to hand out in class .
This post will be the first of three on the topic of the Present Simple tense , it contains a printable infographic covering the basics of the Present Simple and two printable worksheets .
Nowadays , there is an increasing concern about the health of young people , since there is no doubt that it is getting worse .
To begin with , recent statistics reveal that the number of obese adolescents is rising .
And last but not least , it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop young people 's social and intellectual skills .
The reasons could be , firstly , fast food is cheaper and very accessible for young people .
In addition , spending too much time on activities like watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports .
And finally , teenagers may be becoming more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers .
Actually , it is not complicated to change habits in order to be healthier .
For instance , filling the fridge with a large amount of fresh fruit and vegetables , doing some exercise and having some fun with friends regularly .
I 'd like to find a part - time job but , first of all , I have to find an apartment to live in , so I was wondering if you could look for a small apartment where I can live . It would be better if it 's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time .
Would you be so kind as to let me know if there are some restaurants or pubs that need staff ?
Advances in computer science have created a tremendous leap in technical innovations .
One of the most recent outstanding innovations is robotics .
Lavine , Voss and Coontz ( 2007 ) define robotics as the combination of " automation with action and at times a considerable amount of mobility " which is " becoming more and more humanoid"(p .
The more computer science influences humans ' lives , the more important a status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade ago , robotics was limited to scientific research .
However , today , it is used in more fields , such as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as well as education .
This essay will discuss the current social consequences of robotics in the area of education , and then conclude by commenting on its possible future implications .
In the first place , robotics activity could provide learners with real situations which are related to irrelative courses , especially in scientific and medical ones .
2012 ) described an experiment by Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situations .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% of students gave the diagnoses correctly .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training , whilst 63% of them thought it had great value in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in this experiment , students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also identify weaknesses of students specifically .
The University of Southern Denmark conducted an experiment which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic building block system ) could do at language tests .
Surprisingly , the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in the right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are able to react to their surroundings , and build binary expressions to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying , and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate , which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots for doing tasks .
Two groups of participants were asked to do a suture - tying task and a secondary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - task .
They are Group A : ten medical students aged 19 - 27 who only had general knowledge about surgery , and Group B : four experienced surgical postgraduates .
It was found that there was an apparent difference in average speed and completion time when comparing tasks by students with basic knowledge and those from another group .
Moreover , in the task with distraction , the experienced group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster at analyzing .
It is possible that robotics will be a normal part of individuals ' lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) conducted some examples into robotics in daily lives : social human - robot , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitment robot , care robot , robot - therapy .
For a country , robotics could be a new weapon in the future technological wars .
However , there is some debate that it is unethical to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
However , the disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully when robotics is contributing to humans ' lives .
In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , the application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .
Besides its influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design for future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve the application of robotics .
Public transport is so necessary in big cities that the car industry is continuously developing new means of transport .
Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute in , but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes .
On the other hand , public transport is not so accepted in small villages , as it is not possible to offer a wide range of services and timetables .
Some places have scenic beauty in abundance , while many are famous for their architectural wonders .
In addition , every person has different tastes , choices and preferences .
Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interest .
I have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries , like Belgium , Great Britain , Spain and others .
But the visit which made a lasting impression on my mind is the visit to Red Square .
An enormous 400 by 150 metres , Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin , GUM ( Department Store ) , the State Historical Museum and the Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos ( aka St. Basil 's Cathedral ) ; centres of government , commerce , history and religion .
The must - see place is St. Basil 's Cathedral , the beautiful architectural symbol of Russia .
At the northern end of the square you will find the State History Museum with its huge collection of artefacts charting Russia 's past right back to the stone age .
Indeed , the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and has a unique spirit .
All these Victorian novelists use very detailed descriptions of places , people and feelings in order to make their novels as realistic as possible .
Anyway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixes comedy and pathos , while the Brontë sisters ' realism is full of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors , where they grew up .
In addition , Dickens , as well as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels , quite frequently uses first - person narration .
For example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's most autobiographical novel , the story is told through a first - person narration from the point of view of the protagonist as an adult .
Charlotte Brontë uses the same technique in Jane Eyre , her masterpiece .
Tennis is made of several ingredients : suspense , emotions , physical skills and training are combined with tactics and intelligence .
Athletic performance is definitely enhanced by having a fine physique and natural skills .
Nevertheless , a strong and balanced mind plays a huge role in the game of tennis , as shown by famous tennis champions , like Michael Chang and Justine Henin .
Much shorter than their fellow tennis players , they have always been able to compensate for their physical shortcomings with an extremely good technique accompanied by a strong head .
You must never surrender : until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground , you have to keep fighting , regardless of the score .
Tennis is considered a very individualistic sport .
Nonetheless , it helps to shape your own personality .
I would definitely recommend anyone who would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit .
Although it might look difficult at the beginning , with time , you will come to realise how tennis will positively impact on your personal well - being .
I 'm pleasantly surprised by you visiting this part of the country , but let 's have fun together !
Also , there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together , since they 've got some very exciting films coming out .
I 've had lots of things on my mind recently , especially after my mom died .
It was very considerate of you to send condolences , so please , have my thanks .
Because I love talking to people and spending time with them and that job gave me that opportunity .
Also , the staff there was very nice and they wanted me to stay , but I needed more money , so unfortunately , I could n't .
It was a cold night in November . I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael . We had been looking for that temple since our teen years : the temple of the silent cartographer .
The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden in the temple , protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer . He is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
At the entrance of the temple were two statues . The first was white and the second red . The statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds . Those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer . Once we passed the sculptures , our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
Then we heard a loud noise coming from inside the temple . It was Soneka . His appearance was glorious ; a big warrior wearing golden armor and carrying a big sword , his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the speed of sound . Our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer , but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer . Michael decided to stay outside the vault . I ran into the cartographer 's temple and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including a Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components , and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever have imagined .
On the one hand , owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want , without being tied down to a set timetable and , furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter , which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
One piece of good news is that I finally gave in and bought my first Smartphone .
I can answer my e - mails immediately .
It 's very handy because I read the newspapers online and for free , but only the Spanish papers .
I also like to have a look at the foreign newspapers but they only let you read the headlines and the beginning of the article .
It 's like a blog but it 's written by many people who write their impressions of beautiful sights .
1 . INTRODUCTION
The aim of this paper is to show , through a transitivity analysis of the lyrics from three different songs , how language has influenced roles of gender
• Although the performers are women , is the language used sexist ?
- Method : Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzing and the reasons why we 've chosen them
- Theoretical background- A review of our knowledge .
Our tools will be transitivity analysis and language .
Furthermore , we will give some examples of clauses that represent the meaning of our songs better .
- Conclusions : The questions we asked before will be answered .
With our analysis done , this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning .
- Bibliographical references : The part where the sources are revealed
These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look , we will find some sexism in some parts .
Still , women are the victim in three different ways . We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret , created by some specific situations .
Usually , in these types of songs , the performers describe actions in the relationships as well as at the end of it .
We have found this kind of agent in songs with a love relationship as the subject .
In this category of processes , there is another participant known as the affected , because the action of the verb affects or concerns it .
In our research , the cognition verbs have been the most common in the group of mental ones , followed by the affection ones , which is quite normal when describing a love relationship .
The main participants are the woman and the man .
The processes that appear more usually are mental and relational ( attributive type ) .
These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man .
The mental processes , specifically the cognition ones , tell us that she has thought a lot about what she did and that she was wrong .
The other participants appear a few times , but these participants tell us important things about the relationship .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to understand the situation better , but actually they just confirm what the girl feels .
She is regretful because their relationship got worse and it was n't what she supposed it could be .
She says " swallowing my pride " .
Maybe she feels bad , but not completely guilty .
He is confusedly in love .
Finally , the woman tells him that she will understand that he does n't want to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
This sentence and some others sound like they were spoken by a man …
Learning a new language is always an exciting experience .
There could be many reasons that lead to the need to learn new languages but , the advantages are vast .
You will thus broaden your way of thinking and in the end as you learn you will enhance your intelligence .
However , you need to understand that learning a new language is not an easy task .
There is a lot of stress associated with it , bearing in mind that in most cases a new language will revolve around a culture that is different from what you are used to .
Enthusiasm to learn is all that you will need so as to get the first few steps done .
After the first few words , you will like the experience and it will be hard for you to stop .
It is always interesting to communicate with native - speakers of a foreign language comfortably .
Encouraging yourself that you can work perfectly well for you .
To speed up the learning process , you need to read many comic books in the language that you want to learn . It will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you .
This is important because you understand their way of writing and they will be easy to understand . Enrolling on different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great help to you .
I 've got a lot of assignments to work on .
And this depressing weather is just making the situation worse .
So , what 's the typical English approach to nutritional needs ?
Proposal for the introduction of a sports activity .
Introduction
Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practise these kinds of activities .
In my opinion , running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to starting to move and get fit , in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time .
This activity will not demand huge amounts of money to be done and , with an insignificant investment , would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
Minimal investment with huge benefits
To begin with , it is important that the government develops a program which creates social awareness .
A significant part of the population in this town do not know the importance of practising sports and having a healthier life .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space to practise it comfortably .
With this in mind , money would be spent on constructing a running track where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacles in their way .
There are almost no contraindications to practising this sport , so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .
Conclusion
In my opinion , improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives .
The lecturer 's second argument involves capturing and destroying the toads using volunteers .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs , which are endangered .
Because the young frogs look alike , it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads .
In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that we could prevent the spread by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
The lecturer says that if the virus was brought to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it would cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the method mentioned in the reading whereby a specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
To conclude , the lecturer disagrees with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
National fence , volunteers , and virus are not good solutions to the problem of cane toads spreading .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again with stunning fifth outing !
It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself and carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the " Mission : Impossible " series , much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties , and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25-year - old " Days of Thunder " .
To start , " Rogue Nation " follows the same basic formula of the movies preceding it : fast - paced action , a focus on the espionage and gadgetry of the core team , and some of the most breathtaking set pieces Hollywood has to offer .
Together with a solid foe and the deft and stylish hand of director Christopher McQuarrie , all elements combine to give this fifth outing a refined sense of urgency , perfecting the pace to deliver constant , ever - topping thrills .
Finally , a special mention goes to Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling score , just a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
With all things considered , the bottom line is that Cruise & Co have delivered what has to be considered as the finest film in the series yet .
The social debate between progress and traditions has been going on for centuries .
One of the main advantages of cultural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability .
In most Latin American countries , millenary practices such as silversmithing , not only keep the region in touch with its heritage , but they have become the sole source of income for many communities .
Nations like Mexico and Peru , with internationally recognized cuisines , have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods , like chipotle peppers and quinoa , to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors .
On the other hand , the greatest disadvantage of traditions , is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress .
Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments , all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community .
In conclusion , traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations .
However , the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the wellbeing of the collective .
Progress and traditions are not opposites in a society where respect and tolerance for others is the priority .
What is the recommended source for extracting the prepaid roaming revenues ?
" Prison has long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes .
Some people believe , however , that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases .
In recent years , the most common punishment for criminals has been prison .
People who break the law , should be ordered to work in the community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally .
Community service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally .
This is unfair , because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to society .
This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lie down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered to be " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have committed a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
The last movie I watched was House Next Door , a captivating thriller that stars Jennifer Lawrence , Elizabeth Shue and Mark Thieriot .
As soon as they move in , they hear the rumors of the incident : a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared , and the other child of the family recently moved in there .
As the movie develops , it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer draw his / her own conclusions .
I myself am a fan of horror movies , which are highly predictable , so it was a great satisfaction to see such a complex film .
The end completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it .
Although it had bad reviews , the movie was well received by the audience ; not to mention the fact that Jennifer Lawrence 's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising .
In conclusion , I highly recommend this film for those who like drama and plot twists .
I think that a law degree is such a practical degree and legal knowledge is applicable almost everywhere .
I believe that every human , organization and company has their own rights and it is my duty to use my legal knowledge to protect them from infringement of their rights .
My study plan is to undertake a pre - university programme locally to prepare myself for further studies overseas .
I aspire to further my studies in Law at the University of Cambridge .
I would love to be in an intellectually stimulating environment , being surrounded by the brightest young minds from all over the world .
One of the main advantages is the time that can be saved by using a computer .
This is especially beneficial in the workplace , where employees can do their work far faster than they could in the past .
In addition to this , computers can be educational and fun .
From a very young age , children can gain basic computer skills through programs that allow them to learn , draw , paint and play .
In today 's technological world , this knowledge can only help them in the future .
Many jobs have been lost due to the fact that computers can do a lot of tasks more efficiently than humans .
This has led to high unemployment in many countries .
To sum up , it seems that computers are a useful addition to our fast - moving world of high technology .
However , it must be remembered that they are here to serve us - not to replace us .
Social networking technology is a tool used by people all around the world .
Its purpose is to promote and aid communication .
However , I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good .
It is not only changing how we communicate , but how we interact with each other in daily life .
In conclusion I can say that the social network that affects the population the most is Facebook .
It may be on the verge of replacing traditional personal interactions for the next generation .
It affects our lives in many ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolation , friendships , and even our very own sense of humanity .
On this networking site , users create pages that represent them in some way .
They post pictures of themselves and their friends .
Facebook has more bad effects on adolescents than on adults , who are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online .
It is more likely that adults would use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves , their family , find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took .
Teenagers , however , use this technology in a way that could be dangerous .
Adults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abusing social networks , especially Facebook .
Teachers at school may impose more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extreme way .
At work , bosses may reduce employee 's salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are caused by social networks .
Proposal to improve the school 's facilities for language learners .
Introduction :
The aim of this proposal is to make recommendations in order to improve the school facilities .
Aspects such as space , internet access and materials will be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the service for students learning languages .
First , an inspection of the school 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premises .
From the visit , it was concluded that even if the majority of students express satisfaction with the space , some of them wish to have more classrooms that allow a more reasonable number of students per class .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one - on - one activities that enhance their learning process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building , which offers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondly , it was surprising to discover the absence of internet access in the computer room .
Even if the room has a considerable number of computers , the absence of internet access does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites that would be useful to improve their language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access , which does not represent a high cost for the academic board .
Access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages .
Magazines and newspapers allow learners to have direct contact with language in real contexts .
Thus , I suggest making subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school 's library .
Conclusion .
I strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention , the service provided to language learners will be strengthened and enhanced .
How would the entire world in general and the mountaineering fraternity , in particular , judge my decision ?
I needed to survive in light of the fact that it was impossible to haul Joe up to safety .
I needed some consolation to return to a state of psychological normalcy ; it was a step towards survival .
Ever since I started learning English , I have found watching TV series quite handy , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the plot properly .
In fact , it is quite useful if you are actually interested in improving your skills , when it comes to listening and speaking .
Although the story is focused on the Lord 's family , the service staff has an important part to play , as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is becoming old - fashioned .
The main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed , with their own characteristics and personalities .
Even the background is cleverly chosen , which enhances the intriguing and dramatic script .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie Smith , who is one of my favourite actresses .
I wish to apply for the Assistants & management support for the " Asset Allocation & Macro Research " ( AA&MR ) position as I believe it is in perfect alignment with my skills and professional experience .
My penultimate position was as chief executive of a company with photocomposition , which was followed by the creation of a publication service serving the " Sell Side " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sense of organization and easy adaptation to new environments .
My goal has always been to combine speed with quality , using good organization skills and an excellent mastery of different technological tools .
Furthermore , I am fluent in the English language , with good writing skills .
Conscientious by nature , I always strive to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consistently complete my tasks .
In addition , I am a team player with good interpersonal skills .
Yours faithfully ,
NB : In addition , in case of employment , I would receive an allowance of a participation of 50% of the salary for a period of two years .
Well , first of all , there are a lot of activities you can do for fun , such as visiting some historical places that are attractive for many tourists .
Since you are coming in summer , you should visit Sharm or Hurghada for some sea activities like swimming , diving and snorkeling .
They will pay you a reasonable salary .
And it will be good preparation for your studies at college .
Brazilian people are known for their creativity and enthusiasm for soap operas .
As a typical Brazilian , I have a favorite soap opera . It is called Floribella .
The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress . She has amazing friends and they have a band together .
He is arrogant , but Flor is the only one who can calm him down in difficult situations .
She falls in love with him , but unfortunately , he is engaged and his fiancée is an awful person who always tries to humiliate Flor .
I 'm afraid to say that this soap opera does n't have a happy ending and I did n't enjoy the end either , but I still recommend it , because it 's a beautiful love story and the characters are really amusing and the story is funny and lovely .
Despite its ending and all others odds that it may have , I 'm still a big fan of Floribella and I ca n't wait to watch it again on Netflix .
And by the way , the soundtrack is awesome , you 'll be addicted to it .
Taking care of environment has become an essential need in our daily life .
Countries , states , cities and even municipalities are focusing on how to include green plans in their future work plans .
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) is indicated in more than 90% of mission statements around the world .
Saying that taking care of the environment is not only the concern of citizens but also the national and international organizations .
As for my city , the mayor gives the environment his top priority and a budgeted plan under the process of implementation .
awareness sessions have been made to explain the difference between re - use , recycle and reduce .
Different color trash bags were distributed to citizens to be used at home to separate the trash according to each material .
Also , films on soaring birds were played to explain the importance of birds in cleaning the atmosphere .
It is worth mentioning that schools are considering the environment as part of the education system that should be taught to students .
Finally , I 'm proud to say that taking care of the environment is part of my and my family 's daily life .
Trash distribution , using green products that respect the ozone layer , not wasting water and many other actions .
I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor of English with an emphasis on nineteenth - century American literature that you advertised on the February 20XX MLA Job Information List .
I am a Dean 's Fellow and Ph.D. candidate at XYZ University , currently revising the final chapter of my dissertation , and expecting to graduate in May 20XX .
I am confident that my teaching experience and my research interests make me an ideal candidate for your open position .
I have taught a number of American literature survey courses , as well as writing courses , including technical writing and first - year writing .
I have extensive experience of working with ESL students , as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and disabilities like ADD and ADHD .
I pride myself on creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thinking and writing skills .
Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts through a combination of individual sessions , class activities , and group discussion .
I know I would thrive as a teacher in your college , due to your belief in small classroom size and individualized support for students .
Not only does my teaching experience suit the needs of your school and department , but my research interests also fit perfectly with your description of the ideal candidate .
My dissertation project , " Ferns and Leaves : Nineteenth - Century Female Authorial Space , " examines the rise and development of American female authors in the 1840s and 1850s , with a particular focus on patterns of magazine publication .
I argue that , rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher , female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than has previously been assumed .
I apply recent print - culture and book - history theory to my readings of novels , magazine articles , letters , and diary entries by various female authors , with a particularly focus on Sara Willis ( known by her pseudonym Fanny Fern ) .
I plan to develop my dissertation into a book manuscript , and continue to research the role of female writers in antebellum magazine culture , with a particular focus on the rise and influence of female magazine editors on literary culture .
My research interests have both shaped and been shaped by my recent teaching experiences .
I combined readings on theory and literature that addressed issues of print with visits to local historical museums and archives .
My students conducted in - depth studies on particular texts ( magazines , newspapers , novels ) for their final papers .
I believe my interdisciplinary teaching style , particularly my emphasis on material culture , would fit in well with the interdisciplinary nature of your English department .
I am therefore confident that my teaching experience , my skill in working with ESL and LD students , and my research interests all make me an excellent candidate for the assistant professor of English position at ABC College .
I have attached my curriculum vitae and the two requested sample publications .
I would be happy to send you any additional materials such as letters of reference , teaching evaluations , and past and proposed course syllabi . I will be available to meet with you at either the MLA or C19 conference , or anywhere else at your convenience .
Thank you so much for your consideration ; I look forward to hearing from you .
The main hero is a mysterious stranger , betrayed by everyone , sold into slavery , chosen by fate to exact revenge , who will become one of 47 warriors that defy death .
They were very different and very colorful , but at the same time corresponded with the time period of the film .
With this film , I was able to get a clear idea about traditions and customs of that time .
And I just ca n't forget to mention the beautiful scenery and realistic special effects .
I think other people will like it as much as I did , because it is a very interesting and exciting story about true love that lives through time and space , and about real friendship and loyalty .
A transportation vehicle that has changed people 's lives .
That transportation exerts a far - reaching influence on people 's daily routines and lifestyle is true .
Not only that , what prides itself as the most influential vehicle - as most people recognize - is the automobile .
It is generally believed that the invention of the car has led to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers , to the growth of the suburbs .
Prior to the automobile , is the horse and wagon life , it was not feasible for people to live far from their place of work .
Moreover , it has led to an important expansion in commerce , resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls , department stores , serving as a powerful pull for tourism .
What greatly increased mobility leads to significant changes , additionally , lies in various lifestyles .
Being able to live far from one 's workplace , people can travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip .
In the urban city , the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted on the growth of the tourist industry .
Though good enough , the growth of the population and mobility do not tell the whole story .
This powerful vehicle is considered vital for another reason : being an indispensable factor in many respects .
It is the key that supports many industrial fields , such as steel , machinery , plastics .
The whole business success would not have reached perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well .
Last but not least , the booming prosperity often parallels the numbers of job in the city .
Although other forms of transportation may be more comfortable , none has changed the way we do business and live our lives more than the car .
Thanks to the speed , excitement , and convenience of cars , our lives are enriched .
Travelling to Japan through food !
The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant - is the place to be on a Friday night .
Its atmosphere is that of an old Buddhist temple situated on a mountain somewhere in Japan .
The staff 's clothes are beautifully coloured and , believe it or not , all of them are Japanese and can speak English fluently .
What I particularly appreciated was that you can sit around the chefs and watch them prepare the food .
Unfortunately , the music was a bit too loud for my taste .
After eight o'clock , a professional band of musicians start playing traditional Japanese music and it can be a bit loud .
However , overall I think that this new restaurant has the potential of becoming very popular in a short time due to the food and the great atmosphere .
You really should go and try this amazing restaurant at the first opportunity .
In my opinion , my social interaction balances my life more than my working experience does .
With the increasing competition in the workplace , people bear more and more stress .
The companionship of our loved ones is always the best solution to release our pressure .
For example , every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me and making me breathless .
Therefore , the happiness derived from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work .
In addition , attending social activities widens my life 's experiences wholesomely .
This might suggest that being surrounded by people at work with whom we need to socialize would have more of an effect on our emotions .
However , most of the time , people maintain a good relationship with their co - workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
For example , we talk about something trivial , such as gripes and gossip , with our colleagues .
Conversely , we share our deepest worries and problems with our close family and friends because we are not afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust .
Therefore , the more deeply our emotions interact , the more greatly our happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate support , growth in life experiences , and emotional interaction , I agree with the statement that my social life has more of an effect on my happiness than my occupation does .
In other words , even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co - workers , personally , I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love .
As a result , I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than my job does .
The only post ever sent to me was a birthday card , sent by my grandmother before she passed away .
Nonetheless , I managed to remove the box from the ground and staggered through the doorway , in the direction of the living room .
Anyway , I did n't notice the skateboard which lay in front of my feet .
Immediately , I opened the box and found a short letter , saying : " Dear Jane , here 's the inheritance from your grandmother : her glass tea service ... "
There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable option , but claiming that public transport has no future is too much .
Travelling by car is also very detrimental to the environment .
In big cities , the air is very polluted because there are too many cars . Travelling by public transport reduces the impact on the environment , something that most people are aware of , but still they prefer to use their own vehicle .
I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future .
In general , shopping is associated with something pleasant , but unfortunately this is not always true .
For some people , shopping is one of their obligations .
For others , it is overall a pleasant experience they can not enjoy as much as they would like .
Firstly , shopping may be uncomfortable , because more often than not we can hear tiring music there , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queues are usually very long .
To sum up , doing shopping is unavoidable , so we can make everyday shopping more enjoyable .
This is a great opportunity to spend some quality time together , exchange ideas and opinions ; opt for evening shopping , specifically about half an hour before the stores close if you want to avoid big crowds ; if possible , choose only one store for your everyday shopping .
Going from one store to another can waste your time , cost you a lot in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaust you ; when it comes to products that you regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price ; or just choose online shopping - a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home , without having to go out on a rainy day , deal with noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , spend money on gas and wait in huge queues .
First of all , I would like to begin by giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting is located .
The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey , which constitutes the country 's economic , cultural , and historical heart .
The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within the city limits .
The Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires were ruled from .
There are many historical places in the Historical Peninsula such as mosques , churches and palaces .
The most important ones are Hagia Sophia , Topkapi Palace , Sultanahmet Mosque , Suleymaniye Mosque , Yeni Mosque , the Grand Bazaar , Basilica Cistern , Beyazit Tower and the Spice Bazaar .
I would like to touch on some of them .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meters tall located in the courtyard of Istanbul University 's main campus in Beyazıt Square .
Actually , I was asked to recommend only one place , but the Historical Peninsula is an area where those historical distincts got together .
I hope the information given is useful for you .
The following conversation was so engaging that I forgot the time and , as a result , I was late for my departure for Chicago .
I am not completely certain , but I remember that the last time I saw them was near the tiny blue table located in the left - hand corner of the room .
I am contacting you because those papers are sensitive to my company .
As you can imagine , they are confidential and they should be handled with caution .
Yours faithfully ,
Having goals in life will make one 's life meaningful and purposeful .
They are studying at an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
First , I want to attend an English university abroad .
Being able to study at an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience .
As we all know , nowadays , English proficiency is on the list of the required skills to be employed and the market highly demands it .
Secondly , the experience one gets from a multicultural medium is very valuable and makes one more mature ,
and I feel that only an overseas English university can offer that .
Second , I want to be employed as a programmer .
There are many reasons why I want to be a programmer .
Primarily , because being a developer is my dream job and , secondly , because developers make a lot of money .
I have wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old .
I was fascinated by this field of science .
To sum up , graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my main aims .
With the advent of privately owned vehicles like the car , an individual 's dependence on public transport has certainly been reduced .
I 'd like to highlight the factors that would support my opinion in a certain order that pertains to a wider acceptance .
First of all , from a cost perspective , public transport is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost - reduction concept like ' car pooling ' is not followed .
The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none , especially in common situations like long - distance commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and at lights .
From an environmental perspective , the use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented , helping to preserve the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi , where the carbon emissions are very high .
Cookery programmes , films , documentaries , talkshows … It 's clear that there are lots of different programmes on TV nowadays .
Maybe you think of television as a waste of money .
In that case , I can guarantee you that today 's telly is definitely worth the money .
It 's true that there are lots of repeats on TV and there may be many programmes you regard as poor quality .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find some programmes you like amongst all the trash because of the wide variety .
In addition , the price of watching television for a whole month is much lower than the price of tickets for the cinema to watch a film for only two hours .
In my opinion , TV provides something for everyone 's taste nowadays , including good quality programmes , for a reasonable price .
It should be possible for everyone to enjoy watching television !
I am writing in response to your advertisement in today 's edition of " The China News " to apply for the position of Club Organizer .
During the past five years , I have been organizing various events not just in England , but also in the United States and Portugal .
I have a great deal of experience working mainly with people between the ages of 18 and 30 years old .
However , I have also previously worked with older people .
As well as being hard working and methodical , I am organized .
Furthermore , I have an excellent relationship with the people I work with , although I very often strike people as bossy and unfriendly .
I very much hope you will take my application into consideration and I look forward to hearing from you .
We use cash every day and it is of great importance to our daily life .
Firstly , some things about design must be taken into consideration .
Not only the background colour , but we also need to choose the artwork .
Secondly , we have to do some preparation of metal plates .
Some good quality sheets will be packaged and distributed to the market but the bad sheets will be disposed of .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter tried to stop them but it was impossible , so he tried to find somebody to separate them .
Lucas wanted to apologise and forget what happened , but Louis was really angry , so Lucas decided to go home .
The police went to school to talk with Lucas and try to find a fair punishment .
Peter knew that Lucas was n't guilty but he and Louis had been best friends since elementary school , he had to make his decision and he only had two minutes until they took Lucas to the police station .
Louis had to pay for the window and also clean the school 's canteen for two months , but he realized that what he did was wrong , so he apologised to Lucas .
It seemed that the man in the wheelchair was looking for something but suddenly , he took a couple of books and put them into a hidden pocket in his wheelchair .
Unfortunately , the thief was more intelligent than them because while they were speaking , he could run away with the books that he had just stolen .
When it seemed impossible to catch him , a girl , who was crossing the street in a wheelchair , crashed into the thief and he fell down on the pavement .
To express her gratitude , Angie called the girl an " honorary customer " of her bookshop and gave her a crime novel collection as a present .
When the American series ' House ' was first broadcast on TV , it immediately hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the great actor , Hugh Laurie , made the result really innovative for a TV series .
It is based on Dr. Gregory House , a reputable diagnostician who uses strange and sometimes inappropriate approaches in order to find out what is wrong with his patients .
Due to an unsuccessful operation he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson , but he never really wants to , so he gets addicted again .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do literally anything to save a patient 's life , although he sometimes goes too far .
The series had a great appeal in many countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series ' huge success .
Also , the medical cases are intriguing and , although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much , the struggle to save a person 's life captures everyone 's interest .
The innovative aspect of ' House ' is that he often takes illegal actions , for example breaking into a patient 's house to investigate environmental factors which may have caused the particular disease , and he is hardly ever punished for it .
I believe such popularity is well deserved , as apart from its scenario , it was , on the whole , qualitative .
Nevertheless , it is distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks outside of the box .
The first time I heard about volleyball , I was in my last secondary school year and we were invited to cheer on a local team during a regional tournament in Lima , Peru .
I was amazed by the atmosphere at the Coliseum , with its shiny wooden court , the noisy people around it , that sharp sound of the referees ' whistles ... Then I decided to take up the game .
Once I got fit enough , I started enjoying the game , learning its strategies , developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time .
They will soon be engaged in a healthy , defiant and never boring activity and also will develop strong bonds with each other , responsibility and compromise .
Volleyball is the best sport ever !
Introduction
The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used for the benefit of the students and , indirectly , for the benefit of the local community .
Needless to say , in order to combat the rising tide of social problems in Hampshire , the Education Authority decided to increase funds for the educational sector .
Sporting activities might boost the student s ' overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary .
It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health .
A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeare 's more enjoyable than solely studying them will .
Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking in order to manage themselves and live an independent life .
As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms , without their parents , they are obliged to fix malfunctions by themselves .
The information they acquire during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives .
Citizenship classes
Another kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field .
Conclusion
The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra - curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue .
Organising clubs and courses such as the ones mentioned above would ensure the improvement of the situation .
Today 's television is the paradigm of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly popping up and only very few controls are done on the quality of what is actually broadcast .
So , TV , which could be an invaluable source of information and entertainment , actually is becoming a big issue for the development of our society and younger generations in particular .
The potential risks for our younger generations
Having easy access to such a rich offering before having developed the ability to make correct choices or filter the information received , our children and young people are constantly under attack from dangerous role models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .
It 's not too late , though , to try to bring our beloved TV back to the importance which radio had for our parents and grandparents , we only need to see it as a potential new social problem and start a process of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving the most virtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I believe that if public transport has no future , then our environment will not have one either .
The car is sometimes represented as an icon of freedom ; moreover , owning a modern car is sometimes related to wealth .
Compared to the use of public transport , one can not deny the convenience of using a car for moving around .
However , the use of public transport , especially in densely populated cities , allows people to save time while commuting to their study or workplace , as trains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It not only helps reduce pollution , but also allows users to save money in a world where the cost of gasoline is exponentially increasing .
I believe that people should limit the use of their cars to special occasions , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so will we help to keep our atmosphere free of CO2 emissions and all the grim consequences they have .
I 'm 16 years old , tall , extroverted , very energetic and cheerful and friendly .
But I am doing this because I really enjoy creating activities with kids and having a great time with them .
In the historical , there was a dynasty called Jin , during which this story took place .
On the contrary , the reality was inconsistent with what he expected .
Lucky Wang 's stepmother was such a snake - hearted woman that she did as many cruel things as she could to torture this poor boy .
One day in an especially chilly winter , Lucky Wang 's stepmother got sick suddenly .
Not concerned with the harsh environment but her own appetite , she demanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish .
In desperation , he walked to the river bank .
It was exactly when he was hesitating whether to go home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two carp leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him .
Surprised and delighted , the boy took the fish home and prepared delicious fish soup for his stepmother .
Moved by this little boy 's filial devotion , his stepmother changed her attitude and started to love him from her deep heart .
After listening to the short story , some people were deeply moved by the happy ending , however , others thought it was unrealistic .
No matter what the fact was , or even if it never happened , the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it was a fiction , the goal to make all the people in society be filial could also be achieved , which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time .
Only through this cultural education combined with other ways , could they keep their government generation by generation as they expected .
How to ensure an adequately financed retirement ?
Our society is becoming an increasingly elderly one .
It does not boost their confidence in future prospects .
We often hear that no obstacle is ever insurmountable . However , is it true ?
Only in that moment will we understand that we are one of the millions of pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent a life as we deserve .
The taxpayers try not to go against the establishment .
They help our ageing population , but we should make some new reforms to subsidise the shortfall in our budget .
Otherwise , this situation will have a detrimental effect on the taxpayers .
Yesterdays ' petrified men will become confident .
The pensioners would receive their money when they retire .
Our state would have a large sum of money , which is an invaluable resource .
On the other hand , the pensioners will be sure of their futures .
The law of the jungle is not appropriate here .
We can not make a killing immediately .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree with the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening to music or reading a book .
Finally , travelling by public transport is generally cheaper than travelling by car .
Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it is worth it , because you can save money .
So , I think the statement should be like this : " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller - scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complicate its field of possible actions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic value " if you will ) also plays an important role , again , intensifying the relationship between the team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences , finishing a play , or just stylishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the social bonding ability of it , while game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no - strings - attached nature of streetball events always compensate for its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , appear to be shared between every single sports event ) .
It is a fun , culturally - enriching experience which I recommend anyone interested in going beyond the competitive aspect of sports to try .
Researchers have claimed that new generations are likely to suffer from more diseases .
Firstly , teenagers today eat lots of junk food , which is definitely harmful , as it leads to obesity ( Summerfield , 2013 ) .
Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which causes serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , teenagers have changed their lifestyles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
Nevertheless , governments claim that nowadays they are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
For instance , in Chile , the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students while integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
Lastly , everyone must understand that good health is above wealth .
Parents and children should be informed about the use of drugs and junk food consumption , in order to raise awareness and improve their quality of life .
Travelling by car is great .
We can personalise our needs and wishes , such as listening to songs , talking to our friends and family members , eating and drinking and stopping for food or toilet needs anytime , anywhere .
On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides a service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and this problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
The world is getting smaller for people with so many cars around ; it 's about time everyone thought about the community and not about themselves .
The government ought to plan campaigns to make people aware of that and try to find ways to reduce transport fares .
With both sides benefiting , the future of public transport will be safe .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitively substitute the car .
When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is only taken when no other option is possible .
As I see it , drivers really appreciate the freedom of choosing their destination , the time to leave or to arrive , even the people to go with .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car and pay for its maintenance costs and fuel .
More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase , and so does the price for public transport ; the economic policy of importing countries tends to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage , because it is an individual decision .
In the near future , this fact will be seriously taken into account by governments .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and , certainly , public transport will play an important role .
He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rushed , where you have to queue up for an hour and finish eating in 20 minutes before they kick you out .
There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 , while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting , so I asked the chef for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate , which was perfect for me !
Each dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse your palate .
The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt , which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat .
The salt brought out the sweetness of the watermelon while working as a balancing agent so the juice would not be too sweet .
I was told that the drink / soup changes frequently depending on what would be suitable at the moment .
Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited about tating his artful presentation as it came to life !
This was a chocolate themed dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .
The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet , while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy .
He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in a very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraints and timing .
The dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea , so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea on their recommendation as well .
The smell of the lavender was wondrous , while the flavor was almost mint - like and refreshing to drink .
Verdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant , as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth !
It would be perfect if they served alcohol as well and they told me that they are in talks with the building management to do so .
The price was n't cheap for dessert , but if you take into account the entire experience and compare it to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day , so stay tuned !
As the days go by , more discoveries are being unearthed at a rapid pace .
Some advantages are given in the following passage .
Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class , Einstein in his first science class , and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time .
Nonetheless , there are some disadvantages . If a person possesses a magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves against , he or she can basically rule the world .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if one group of magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people 's powers .
Undeniably , the food culture disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancestors originated from the same ethic .
Due to the geographical conditions where Japan is located in the Pacific Ocean , people here have adapted to eating raw fish and like to offer it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially under - cooked fish .
Apart from the eating culture , everything is going well as people here are generous and hospitable .
My host family take me to different hot spots and teach me how to speak Japanese , in order to facilitate the
progress of integrating into their culture .
That was magnificent and mind - blowing .
I enjoy playing football with my friends as it can strengthen our friendship and bolster our love .
When we play football , we definitely cooperate with the other teammates in order to be the winner .
This clearly shows that football needs strong cooperation from all of the team 's players .
My advice to those who are starting this sport is to practise a lot , as football needs continuous practice to master the game and be the king of the field .
My second piece of advice for them is to always have a cooperative game with your teammates .
Who does not want to feel like an astronaut on our own planet exploring the magical underwater world just on a recreational trip ?
I definitely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiastic members , not only bringing a unique experience into our lives , but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues among the broader public .
The downside of this is that hordes of eager newly trained divers populate the underwater world , often with little clue as to the life - threatening risks that they are taking .
I am writing this letter as a wake up call to those who think that their recently earned certification gives them the skills to go out diving wherever they want .
How thoughtless is that ?
Consequently , I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport .
To my great astonishment , I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again .
I saw dive - buddies and even professional dive masters pushing and encouraging novice divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
Unbelievable !
Please , let everybody take their own responsibility !
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal training and practice .
I also love to see the spark flashing in students ' eyes when they understand a concept , try to express themselves with Chinese and finally use it correctly .
For me , learning a language is not only translating the forms to express oneself , but a way to understand how the native speakers describe and interpret this world .
Successful communication between different cultures will happen only when we express ourselves precisely and interpret the information accurately .
Meanwhile , students should have deeper understanding of Chinese culture and viewpoints .
Acquiring a language and culture is a long - term process which includes learning , practicing , making mistakes and correcting .
As a language teacher , I hope my students will have a deeper and broader understanding of this language , their interest in this language will be stimulated by the course and they will learn the language constantly .
So at least it 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live . "
Let 's take into consideration the last sentence , " It 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live . "
Fame is a side effect of work in the media and so is spine disease for people who work in an office or threat to life or health for firefighters .
It would be completely pointless if we were judging people on the basis of the job they have .
They lose their anonymity , become recognizable ,
which is an inseparable part of this kind of occupation .
Because of their fame , they also give employment to other people , like paparazzi and journalists .
We live in times where people are very curious about other people 's lives , so the above - mentioned occupations are necessary ,
but let 's think ... is it really so interesting to know , for example , what Madonna 's second husband eats for breakfast ?
I think we all have our own magnificent lives and we should focus on them .
So , let politicians , film stars , singers and others be .
Besides being in charge of organizing his younger sister 's surprise birthday party , he had also been put in charge of the entire Information Technology department of the company he worked for .
His former boss retired and nominated him for the position , claiming he was more than qualified and had the appropriate skill set to keep the department on track as well as make any necessary changes .
Michael did n't mean to sound ungrateful , because he was delighted , but the timing could n't have been worse .
As soon as one problem in the company was solved , another one , just as infuriating , would come up with the party planning .
The scope of this report is to give readers an overview of the historical development of water treatment , the changing perception of standardization of water treatment , and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored .
This report is an introductory document meant for students interested in the field of water treatment .
Clean and adequate water supply system is a vital aspect in public health and social prosperity .
It is essential for all forms of life in which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients , removal of metabolic waste , and body temperature regulation .
Water treatment must meet the requirements of public and industrial standards .
Mithen 's ( 2010 ) research shows that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport .
Although the importance of water quality was not well understood , the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Siculus provided early documents about purifying water , such as through boiling and sand filtration , dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greece .
Since microbiology was not yet studied , people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water .
The main precautionary measure was purely judging the turbidity of the water , and this false practice has remained ever since , even nowadays .
Figure 1 A qunat at the National Library of Iran , Tehran ( http://media-1.boo.britainica.com/eb-media/72/987654-004-03E63A41.jpg )
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 2,500 years ago in Iran . They were sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater .
For example , in 1933 the capital city of Iran , Tehran , drew its entire water supply system using the same principle of qunats , though with a lot more complications added into it .
These complications were primarily caused by pollution in the underground water which was previously unknown .
Unlike the past , where people had little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene , with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .
2.3 BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
The history of water treatment continued in 1670 , as two Dutch glass makers investigated magnification glasses and that led to the invention of the microscope .
This scientific discovery broke down barriers and enabled biologists to observe organisms that were invisible to the naked eye ( Figure 2 ) .
In 1676 , Scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ,
The Chachas Restaurant
The " Chachas " is a restaurant situated in a mall on the outskirts of Bern .
The restaurant 's slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with a high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially when you set foot in the restaurant for the first time .
There are no walls separating the foyer from the dining room or the kitchen from the guests .
This said , you can imagine the atmosphere is comfortably airy .
Additionally , they offer a monthly alternating " special menu " card presenting five main courses .
They avoid using convenience food and any kind of artificial flavors .
Definitely worth pointing out are the excellent fruit juices .
They are courteous and industrious .
The restaurant offers good quality food for reasonable prices and the atmosphere is very welcoming .
And , as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food , I highly recommend going to the " Chachas " restaurant .
There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people present a different identity on Facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .
He asserts that language choice and identity are not " predetermined " and are prone to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; their change is derived from the context where discourse is negotiated and how " interlocutors interpret the identities being projected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Therefore , context , including the participants , their social purpose , their means and channel of communication , plays a role in language choice and identity construction .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in social media and having the sense of an audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online as a result .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a means of self - expression that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three methods of self - presentation in most social media : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
In Boyed 's terms , profile is an important space where writers tell the audience " who they are and how they want to be seen " ; a link that connects people 's " offline and online identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining teens ' identity construction on social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " , that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " , that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a method of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
Whether the weblog - writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle , through using the first person pronoun , or tell their stories through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammatical subjects , is among the focuses of this study .
It seems that checking the Subject , as an interpersonal element in the clause , can provide evidence of my student - writers ' self - presentation and involvement in the discourse constructed in their blogs .
The children were playing outside , old and new couples were enjoying their love , and everything seemed to be completely bright .
In the busy streets , a student was walking fast , apparently unaware of all this .
And then everything had crashed .
Her voice was weak and feeble as she said " .. and I was really depressed , you know , and then I thought ... we always talked about going to India ... and I thought ... maybe we could fix everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. will you go to India with me ? "
I 'm glad to hear that you are having a great time abroad volunteering for this international cultural organization .
I think that it is a wonderful idea to collect different experiences before starting university studies .
As you know , I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have hands - on experience of organising a cultural festival and particularly a musical concert .
I loved my job there and if I had an opportunity to do it again , I definitely would .
During my staying there , I was responsible for taking care of the musicians and contacting the media .
What I especially loved about my job there , was the opportunity to work with such a diverse group of people .
I learned how to respond to different people 's needs resulting from cultural differences and expectations .
I also really appreciated the practical experience I was able to get there - how to organise work in the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want , how to use social media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate with the press and television etc .
I look forward to hearing from you soon and I hope that you 'll find this experience as amazing as I did .
It is well known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear , or even the tattoos they have .
This happens because some people are famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do on their holidays , for example , if they work properly when they should .
I mean , it would be better that there was more transparency as far as how they spend " our money " is concerned .
I think journalists should follow famous people only when they do something related to their profession or the fact that has made them famous .
Every week we watch a different type of film so that we can please every member and improve our cinematography knowledge .
This is followed by an animated discussion in English , accompanied by drinks from the coffee bar , which is open late , of course !
Every now and then , we have special guests coming over , such as professional reviewers or independent directors .
Next week we 'll be watching " Dancer in the Dark " , by Lars von Trier , a distinctive Danish filmmaker .
It was a bright sunny day and the birds were peacefully singing .
When Elena took it off she was blown away , completely amazed at what she saw .
That morning , Michael woke up full of energy and feeling very optimistic about his first day in his new job .
Every single detail should be perfect to make the best first impression .
You only have one opportunity to make a good first impression , he said to himself .
He went out of his little apartment and walked full of confidence to the bus stop .
When he arrived , the receptionist told him to go to his boss 's office .
She was a very kind and intelligent woman , and Michael was sure that she was going to be a perfect boss and they would work very easily together .
And congratulations on the baby ! " His boss looked at him angrily:- Do you think that I am pregnant ? " .
Our city offers visitors a huge range of possibilities to go shopping .
For example , people interested in cooking have some gourmet shops where they will be able to taste our traditional products .
This magnificent building is situated in the city centre and it was built seventy years ago in an ancient palace .
When the weather is good , especially during spring , street markets are really popular .
You can buy all you can imagine there but one of them is really extraordinary .
It is celebrated on mother 's day , in May , the first Sunday and it is located in the city 's longest avenue , around a kilometre full of flowers , where you can make your own bouquet for your mother 's present .
Yes , it 's true that the car is far more convenient than public transport .
You are sitting in a comfortable seat .
The temperature level is exactly what you like .
Well , there can be some pretty girls among the passengers for sure , but it 's far too often that you will have to sit near some stinky bum .
The high cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation .
People may say that travelling on public transport is the future for our lives .
But in truth there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more and more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seeking and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to dealing with the day - to - day tasks , we very often find travelling in our own car is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling with children is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved .
There is no easy way to carry our weekly shopping , stuff for the gym or instruments on public transport .
I hope you 're doing well and everything is ok .
I 'm writing to you because I want to tell you about my experience .
You wanted to know what I was said to do before and during the concert , so I will try to explain everything .
Everything about helping at this concert was so exciting .
Starting from sending the invitations to the most famous people in the city and calling the shots .
I had to take care of other volunteers .
Dealing with other people is the hardest part , especially when they 're the same age as you .
Another good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists .
She 's a journalist from the New York Times .
She 's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show .
Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything worked well : the sound , the lighting and the instruments .
I particularly enjoy the sense of freedom that it gives me : there 's nothing better than being out on the water with only the sound of the waves , and of the wind in the sails .
I find that people consider sailing either a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
I guess because I 've been practicing for such long time , I do n't agree in either case .
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able to get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on . For me , a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also the kinds of people s / he might possibly have to deal with .
If you take the time to ask around , you 'll find out that a lot of the most experienced sailors never took classes .
and if the first time is not so good , try again : in different weather conditions , with different people , and different kinds of boats .
First of all , public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities .
Nowadays , environmental pollution is also important . That 's why public transport should be promoted as an environmentally friendly means of transport .
A car is not always much more convenient . For example , in a big city it is far more convenient to use the underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport , we can read a newspaper or book and when we drive a car it 's impossible .
Driving a car is also more tiring . A driver must concentrate all the time .
Of course , public transport is not always more convenient .
When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside , a car is irreplaceable for families with children or animals .
Also , going on holidays by car can be very convenient .
With a car we are more independent than with public transport .
This summer I am bringing a group of 12- to 14-year - old students to Athens and I am looking for suitable accommodation .
While we are there , we not only want to see the many attractions in the city , but we would like to visit some of the beautiful places nearby too , so we are looking for a reasonably priced hotel , in the city centre , with good transport links .
Furthermore , I would like to ask you if there are any individuals who would be able to look after groups like us ?
Are you able to arrange activities and local transportation for us ?
Also , it would be great if you could inform me of some special discounts , such as cheaper air travel .
Introduction
The principal objectives of this proposal are to outline the main problems that the company 's website has , and suggest ways that the web designers can deal with them .
The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to improve the website aesthetic and improve user - friendliness .
A survey was conducted among the 200 people who filed complaints .
The majority of people were of the opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised .
Other problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website , connection issues and login problems , particularly correct credentials not working .
As for the server and database administrators , they should immediately resolve the issues regarding the backend part of the website .
Recommendations
I would like to make the following recommendations :
Implement a tutorial to facilitate better usability for new users , and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request .
I assure you that if these recommendations are implemented , the website will improve significantly .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss , the latter was quite astonished .
That evening , she met with a local guide . She was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization .
Sport not only helps people to become strong and to develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities .
Many people do morning exercises , jog in the morning , train themselves in fitness clubs and gyms , and take part in sports competitions .
Other people like sports too , but they only watch sports competitions , listen to sports news .
They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sports events , but they do n't go in for sports .
The summer kinds of sports are , for example , swimming , athletics , football , volleyball , basketball and others .
Among the popular sports in our country are football , basketball , swimming , volleyball , tennis , gymnastics , figure skating and others .
Speaking about sport , I ca n't help talking about football , because this is very spectacular kind of sport .
Some football players are world famous ; they have excellent careers and take part in every championship .
Football matches attract a lot of spectators , who come supporting their favorites .
Perhaps they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting .
It is also known that extreme sports help to build character and form a strong personality .
There are different types of extreme sports . For example , rock climbing , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboarding , parachuting , hang - gliding , bungee jumping etc .
These activities usually involve speed , height and a good level of physical training .
Doing such sports , people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency .
More importantly , it gives the sense of achievement .
In skysurfing , you jump out of an airplane and use a board to " surf " the air , doing gymnastics in mid - air !
For example , snowboarding , which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even than skiing .
Ice diving is for those people who are absolutely crazy .
You should control your body very well if you wish to skate gracefully .
Of course , I watch sports competitions on TV from time to time , like swimming or running .
Television is not an issue of general consensus .
It is definitely a way of spending our free time .
It is possible to watch documentaries , the news , concerts , plays and learn about current affairs .
On the other hand , there are programmes which bring nothing new into our lives .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others of that kind have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entertainment .
All in all , it is my belief that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose what to watch , television can have an important role to play in the learning process of every one of us , and in particular , in the lives of people who can not afford to travel , buy books or live in an educational environment .
The film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about four magicians , known as " The Four Horsemen " that are joined together by a mysterious benefactor , and during their presentations they do all kinds of illegal stuff , such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss .
The characters in charge of the four magicians are Jesse Eisenberg , Isla Fisher , Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson .
The shots of Las Vegas , New Orleans , Paris and New York are wonderful , and the fact that nothing is computerized at the time to witness the magic tricks it absolutely amazing .
Sadly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga or Justin Timberlake .
I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during the vacation .
Staying at home all day is regrettable and not being kidnapped by aliens gets really boring .
After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York or hang out with her and Justin Timberlake .
We three could n't sing together or make fun of Kim Kardashian .
But , let 's face it , doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or singing a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
Just a few more days and then we will be on our way to our holiday destination .
We will be travelling by car to a campsite in Germany .
One of the sights we definitely want to see is the former border between West - Germany and East - Germany .
The region where we will stay has a nice system that encourages people to hike .
For somewhat younger children this is a nice incentive to participate in these hikes .
They live in New York City and have a lot of comical and romantic adventures , all of them related to their friendship .
What could I say about the characters ?
Well , Ross is a paleontologist that works in the Natural History Museum , and he 's Monica 's older brother .
Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she has been Rachel 's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marries Chandler ) .
Rachel has always been daddy 's little girl but , when she breaks off her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera , she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gets a job related to the fashion world after a few years ) .
Joey is ... well , he 's Joey : not so clever , a great one for the girls , and -the most important- Chandler 's best friend .
The most interesting thing about ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the love story between Ross and Rachel : the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her .
But there are a lot of funny stories , like Phoebe having her stepbrother 's children , or Joey becoming a great soap opera actor .
Secondly , I have many friends living abroad . I communicate with them using Skype .
Will I have to start buying magazines and newspapers to be informed ?
In conclusion , my life will be completely changed .
My daily routine is based on having access to the Internet : talking to my friends , reading the newspapers , the weather forecast , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
So , he decided to ignore him completely .
The work was done and Michael was proud because everything was done by him .
The poor boy said he was inspired by Michael 's enthusiasm .
It was perfect and he would be glad just to improve some things , to change the structure , to exclude unnecessary facts , to add some bright illustrations and so on .
The boy had changed everything in the content of the work by the end of their conversation .
Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought about why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organization ?
I 've never understood why most people see a closed set of charitable organizations to choose from when they want to donate money .
When I think about donating money , I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the last people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?
Then I look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on to find their cure .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the less well - known charity organisations ; to the ones who need more help .
It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their faces .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient 's airway is open .
An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .
Also , this practice is the primary consideration for efficient post - anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majority of patients that have had general anaesthetic , like Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post - anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , especially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours post surgery is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse needs to maintain cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission to PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should carry out , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery , Mr Sharma is in a supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and can also impede the air passage , This is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation is restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is being given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and , at the moment , he does not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help with this issue , the nurse should make certain that Mr. Sharma is comfortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover from his respiratory instability faster ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
I realise walking is not considered a sport by everyone .
Therefore , I am going to explain the advantages of walking .
This could be seen as something minor , but being able to do the sport you love without paying is an incredible advantage .
Thirdly , walking gives you a longer life expectancy .
Nevertheless , you learn a lot of things about any sport once you start doing it .
You can start walking as you like , despite that , you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes .
Sightseeing is very important once you start walking .
All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles , learning levels and achievements , as well as motivation , personality , and pace of learning .
When there are students with varied levels in English , it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course .
First of all , determining the needs of the students is always the top priority .
While conducting a needs analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation for learning English .
After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet the individual 's needs .
Through teamwork , students at varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .
It is beneficial for both the higher and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proven to be necessary in a class with varied levels of student .
Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students at different levels .
Moreover , instead of using a core textbook , or using different levels of textbooks , carrying out a theme - based approach is more appropriate , and it also saves teachers ' preparation time .
Finally , preparing supplementary materials for both the upper and lower levels of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn at their own pace of learning .
Young people in Ukraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in USSR .
Now youngsters have open access to knowledge and information through the Internet .
Students have more opportunities to learn languages , discover foreign experiences , pass internships and study abroad .
Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including art , music , literature etc .
The most valuable thing is that there are so many supporters of different trends in all these areas .
That 's why it 's difficult to define one general style for the generation .
Discussing music styles , people in my country prefer pop and rock .
There are a lot of Ukrainian executives .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and is now developing very fast .
If we speak about TV programs , Ukrainian youngsters like popular American and Russian serials , like the Theory of big bang , Suits , Breaking bad , the Game of thrones , the Kitchen and so on . I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian youth watch too many serials and waste a lot of their time .
In clothes , youngsters prefer to wear famous fashion brands .
It 's interesting to mention that there is a fashion for Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " now .
I hope after reading my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality .
Also , I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sights , to feel the culture and speak to nice people !
It 's a small town and there are not too many options for travelling by public transport .
My town has got a lot of little villages around it , and it 's very difficult to create a public transport service , because there are long distances between the different places , and there are not enough people to make it profitable .
The train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages would help a lot of people , especially the older ones .
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement ( Club organiser ) which I 've seen on the noticeboard of my language school .
As a member of the student club at my college , my responsibility is to organize events and collaborate with many students from different departments .
Working on projects helps me improve my organizational and planning skills .
In order to create and maintain a team spirit , I use different tools like icebreakers and energizers .
Watching movies in groups is a great way to discuss different topics , like justice , personal identity and discrimination .
At the beginning , short and animated movies would be the best , such as the movie " Validation " , which teaches us how words have the power to change our lives .
With my experience and range of skills , I am sure I can contribute to your idea and organise great movie nights .
If I can provide you with any further information on my background and qualifications , please let me know .
Thank you for your consideration .
First of all , I would like to share with you my thoughts on travelling in Brazil .
As a country with one of the longest coastlines in the world , I definitely would recommend you to visit the beautiful beaches we have .
I would also recommend you to visit the city of Rio de Janeiro , there you will find beautiful beaches , wonderful weather and the wonders of nature in a modern and international city .
About working , I think you have a great chance to find an opportunity to work in one of many multinational companies we have in Brazil .
Most of the biggest American companies have been in Brazil for a long time and , as an English native speaker , it will be easier for you to find an internship .
The nine months that you will spend travelling around Brazil will give you a better understanding of Portuguese and that will be an advantage to you when finding a new job here .
You will find top notch electronics and general goods .
If you want typical souvenirs , you can go to Buckingham Palace , you will find a lot of small shops that sell souvenirs for a reasonable price .
It was a really exhausting but illuminating experience .
The main task of the volunteers was to collect money .
There were a lot of visitors from other countries , so we often had to translate the conversation and help with communication .
Everything was new to me and very exciting .
Apart from that , everything 's fine here in Poland .
I agree with you that I 'm brave , but I think I need this time to relax after all the problems that I had with my grandmother .
I 'm planning to improve my English and I have already registered on a course .
Besides that , I would love to travel to other European countries .
I 'm writing to apply for a job in summer camps advertised on your website .
I have graduated from Teacher Training University of Saint - Petersburg ( Russia ) , where I completed a degree in education .
I had penfriends in the United States of America and Australia .
I have some relevant experience , as I have worked in a kindergarten and done some babysitting simultaneously with my studies at the university .
After graduation , I spent two years working as a supplementary education teacher .
My tasks included organizing sports and other activities for children .
I was also in charge of providing safe and entertaining activities .
References are enclosed .
I am very enthusiastic about working with children and would welcome the chance to make new friends .
I believe I would be suitable for the job advertised as I am a sociable , resourceful and industrious person .
I would readily meet the challenges of the job and handle the responsibilities .
I attach a full CV and if you require more information , I would be very happy to provide it .
Therefore , I do n't feel embarrassed to admit that I love ballet .
When I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so gracefully .
For me it was the perfect combination .
Just as my enthusiasm for ballet thrived , my grades in school kept falling .
Consequently , I had to leave .
There are some things you should take into consideration if you want to try this sport .
Furthermore , ballet is expensive . Supposing that this type of dance is n't a tradition in your country , prepare to open your wallet .
Some of the selected aspects for this assignment were the characteristics that Holden says he likes in others of his favorite books , since this is one of them .
He does not like that his brother is " prostituting himself " by writing scripts for movies , since he does not like movies .
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the possible short story D. B. wrote and that Holden liked so much .
This was achieved by using as a reference the information that Holden gives us about this short story and including things in it that he might like .
After giving instructions for stage three , I was busy checking the register . I did n't monitor Ss for the first four minutes .
Also , Ss were writing the sentences individually in their notebook instead of choosing only one person to write for the whole team .
When I approached them , they said they could n't remember the exact words that were dictated .
Ss could hardly hear each other well because of the rectangular layout of the room .
Additionally , one team had finished reconstructing their story while other teams needed more time to finish the task .
I enjoyed every aspect of the experience : the people , the music , the atmosphere , ... When I first arrived at that building , I could not find the entrance .
From the corridor an underground pathway led to the basement of the strange building opposite .
It is still a mystery to me how so many people managed to find their way inside , but when we were in the concert hall at last , hundreds were there already and people were obviously laughing about the fact that the main entrance had magically disappeared .
The atmosphere was really nice ; the people were so light - hearted and I just felt like I could be friends with anyone immediately .
Of course , I originally went there to work : putting the chairs and tables right , ensuring that everyone in my appointed space was well fed , and keeping an eye on the cash counter .
Raising the academic performance of Students
The principal is dedicated to developing a favourable learning environment .
Given the learning experiences in the past two year s ' school - based support , some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs , ELPS and Thinking Tools .
All of the above have been making good progress in developing the P.1 - 4 school - based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for development in the P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum .
In view of these favourable conditions , higher expectations could be set to improve the learning process and enhance the learning performance of NCS .
The improvement of TSA results and internal results celebrated the success of teachers ' efforts .
More collaborative efforts should be made to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS .
5.2 . Sustaining capacity building through CLP
Given the experience gained in the support services , many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS .
The school could consider stepping up collaborative efforts in developing coherence in curriculum development .
More professional opportunities could be purposefully arranged to explore some effective strategies and promote discussion among teachers .
Sharing among teachers could be encouraged to understand the learning of NCS .
Technology plays a key role in our modern lives .
Nowadays , with the development of genetics , we might be able to stop world famine .
The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans . Unfortunately , there is no evidence of GMC 's being completely safe for human consumption .
It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the control of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports , leaving a cluster of questions without any answer .
Companies like Monsanto that engineer plants with sterile seeds , encourage non - sustainable production models that promote the extinction of independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era .
According to an article published by UNAM in 2001 , the introduction of GMC 's has had a huge impact on the global market .
The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with global food security .
The usage of genetically modified crops has proven to be dangerous for humans as well as for the environment .
In their quest for the perfect seed , genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds ' biodiversity , as stand by research led by Greenpeace , GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non - modified crops .
Consequently , we must be careful with the decisions we make .
It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have on our lives , but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them .
In conclusion , I would rather say that companies must reinforce our humanity before manipulating the environment in such a radical manner .
ENGLISH - LANGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN ITALY .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to analyse and assess the impact of English - language television programmes on Italian culture and to make suitable recommendations .
Popularity of English - language TV programmes
The presence on electronic devices of English - language TV programmes is becoming more and more prominent .
A survey was carried out in the most populated Italian cities and 2000 citizens were interviewed on 22nd October to quantify their interest in this segment of the national TV schedule with the following results :
• 40% of those interviewed , most of whom have proven to be young people , declared that they watch English - language TV programmes at least five times a week ;
People enjoy listening to the original audio , which entails realism and naturalness .
Although the importation of such programmes has had positive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also had negative outcomes .
Italian companies must face the challenge set by the market demand due to the importation of many foreign traditions .
Recommendations
It is highly recommended that the government should provide adequate financial support to traditional small businesses .
I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised , to be able to respond to the threat represented by low - price imported ones .
An intelligent person once said : ' The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page . '
I totally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lot , because our world is incredible .
First of all , of course , travelling by car is much more convenient than , for example , by bus .
Even just in cities , let alone travelling long distances .
But , on the other hand , a traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient .
Secondly , travelling by public transport is much cheaper .
Not everyone can afford to travel by car every day , so they choose public transport .
Thirdly , we should take care of our environment !
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( or at least , use public transport ) , because it is environmentally friendly !
The difference in work meetings between the British and French are that the British want to make decisions and the French like a debate way more , as is written in a guide to Franco - British business relationships .
The opinion of Simon Kuper is that the main reason for the misunderstandings are different languages .
This is in contrast to the guide " Light at the End of the Tunnel : Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business " published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain .
The booklet published in 1944 by the UK 's Foreign Office , " instructions for British Servicemen in France " is still useful for most , nowadays .
When you get hired by a British employer , it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports .
International relationships are built by people who can speak the same language and who are at the same level in their vocabulary .
I live in a small town called Grycksbo and I 've been part of Unga Kris volunteering programs since the summer of 2010 .
At first , I joined Unga KRIS and started volunteering to have fun and meet new people .
Now that I have been volunteering for a while , my expectations have changed : Unga KRIS is still a place where I expect to have fun and meet new people , but I also expect to grow even more as a person , to take on responsibilities and face my fears in different social situations . »
Volunteer work provides an organization with free resources to help it achieve goals .
In many cases , volunteers are crucial to helping support life , as when meals are delivered to housebound people .
Sometimes volunteer work , such as renovating a playground , benefits the broader community .
And while volunteer work is important for the individuals and communities served , it also benefits the volunteer .
At first , I found it an exhilarating and rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
In fact , I was responsible and I had the determination and the skills , because I learned it from my parents .
It was exhausting ! !
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the possibility of hosting the European football championship in my country .
This report outlines the benefits and the possible objections .
As a matter of fact , Budapest , the capital city of Hungary , could be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event .
Margit Island is a favourite destination for runners and lovers .
Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and an attractive tourist location .
Transportation system
Regardless of the mode of transport , fares are very affordable .
The transportation system is effective .
The underground system can ease congestion .
Facilities
Puskás Ferenc stadium has ample seats for the spectators .
2 . ) Airport Hotel is the closest accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport .
This inexpensive hotel has 112 rooms .
3 . ) Le Meridien is set in the city 's fashionable business hub .
The flourishing cultural life will fascinate visitors .
The admission tickets to most of Budapest 's museums are comparatively cheap .
Objections
The main concern is related to petty crime , especially pickpocketing .
Suggestions
Old historical buildings are in disrepair .
The government should renovate the buildings , which would be great shelters for homeless people .
In conclusion , it would be a good idea and a viable way is through sponsorship .
Moreover , this would be advantageous both for the host city and the tourists .
By that time I had attended six interviews , but nobody was interested in my candidacy .
I decided to go to my parents ' and spend a few weeks helping them with the renovation of their house .
I opened the envelope and found in it an offer of employment .
At first , I did not understand anything and I had decided that it was a mistake .
But then I remembered that when I was 15 I 'd sent my scientific work to the Patent service .
It turned out that they sent my work to a few institutes and one of them was interested in me .
That day was the start of my scientific career .
They say that the Earth 's population will need to find and colonise two planets as our forests and fresh water supplies will vanish .
Of course , all of this is unrealistic .
It 'll be impossible for people to live on other planets in 50 years ' time .
Technology wo n't have been advanced enough by that time .
But it 's not entirely impossible .
There is a little truth and possibility in it .
I 'm completely certain that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth , although our lifestyles will have changed a lot .
Many young students who have finished their secondary education wonder whether they should take a year off before they make the most important decision about which university course they find suitable for their future .
Firstly , most teenagers who are against this idea are convinced that the university course they have chosen will be the future career in their lives .
Moreover , they feel they have to make the most of their time , to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love .
Conversely , there are many teenagers who need to take their time and see much of what the world has to offer them .
Others , by contrast , choose a country or trace an itinerary to travel to the place of their dreams and set off to live new experiences .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and taking a gap year before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people 's perspective on life and will help them become more confident about what they really love .
I 'm not sure if this is true or not , because I 'm not here to judge or comment on the authenticity of the statement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through writing .
How can they know they have the guts ? What I believe , and I think it 's true , is that courage , boldness and callousness make people write truly what they think , without any lies , without any camouflage and without any kind of burnished layers .
Writers often make their masterpieces shiny and glowing in order to make them more acceptable to people , less shocking to them and less close to the reality from which readers had the intention of escaping when they picked that piece of writing in the first place .
While some people argue that bad human nature is the reason , it is undeniable that social problems and indigence are responsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings .
To begin with , it is true that humans are often born with greed and selfishness .
These crimes may be committed by sensible people who are not able to control themselves at crucial times .
Thus , bad personality can be the seed of crime .
On the other hand , I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst of criminality .
This means that a number of offenders can not sustain their livelihood , and they desperately experience limited options for earning money .
As a result , they are easily attracted by the allure of wealth , which leads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnapping or drug trafficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency , which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
The proliferation of these crimes undoubtedly has a negative effect on the city 's life .
In addition , the prevalence of media such as television or the internet is partially to blame .
Also , films and video games containing violent scenes can stimulate audiences to imitate those acts and commit crimes .
This is particularly common among young people , who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the position that crime occurs due to the media and poverty .
In the past , people used technology as a tool for making survival an easier endeavor .
Nowadays , we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it has turned into a means of communication and entertainment .
Mass communication technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people .
At the same time , this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society . Is the use of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communication between people ?
Whenever you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube , you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it makes face - to - face interaction and communication between people nonexistent .
This is true in many respects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people through texting and social networks .
This leads , among other things , to the possibility for people to be lonely , as having too many virtual friendships causes an inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The young generation in our society are participating in a massive , unintentional social experiment the results of which are not entirely predictable .
I personally believe that imitation is just the sincerest form of admiration .
Flattery is different . It is easier to recognize .
If someone depends on you and s / he is constantly paying attention to you and being , in a colloquial way , a " brown nose " , you notice and become aware of it quickly .
Just because of their attitude and aptitude , their behaviour … simply in the way they act , we can see their intentions .
Nowadays , in some specific cases , people , if they want to get a good position or be promoted , flatter .
And we can see these examples in many situations , when we find inept and incompetent workers .
When getting these jobs is not through civil service exams , I think there are only two ways : influence or flattery . And to be honest , I do n't know what I prefer .
To sum up , I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be .
The line separating you from the people you work with .
You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world .
If you 're willing to take the chance , the view from the other side is spectacular .
There 's another way to survive this competition .
I am really interested in martial arts , such as Aikido , Judo and self - defense , which I have already practiced .
These kinds of sports have some advantages and disadvantages .
The first advantage of martial arts is to improve self - confidence .
You will get ready to fight with others , regardless of their strength , age and so on .
When you use a technique successfully on your opponent , you feel more confidence .
Every time you use a technique you have to show your respect to your opponent , and also other ranks , regardless of their age .
The third one is movement and coordination between different parts of the body ; eyes , hands and legs .
When you use a technique or defend against a technique , you control your body 's movement and coordinate them to work at the same time .
Some people think there are some disadvantages , like injury , and getting aggressive .
People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice controlling their inner energy , and also respecting others .
And when you are starting , follow the discipline and find the ideas and thoughts that are hidden behind the movements and techniques .
In the other words , try to understand the philosophy of the sports before learning the techniques .
Last night I had the opportunity to attend a marvelous play based on the book " Alice in Wonderland " which was enthusiastically received by both adults and children .
The original work was written by the mathematician , logician and British writer Lewis Carroll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created through logic games , and , therefore , the success it has achieved in the most varied environments is understandable .
The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent to the present time , such as , the White Rabbit , Mad Hatter , the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts .
One of the biggest differences compared with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters .
The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to use your imagination in the same way as when you read the book .
" Encourage learner autonomy - the teacher wo n't always be there to provide answers " . Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish .
This lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to their classmates what activities need to be done .
This time , in order to further reduce my TTT , I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well .
I hoped that by handing over complete control to the class , this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negotiation techniques .
This made everything seem less cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required action from me on my copy of the clues , e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise .
I found that the class challenged the student who had the answers , if they had written down something different .
I found that they challenged each other more than they ever do me .
They used a lot of language that they would be able to use in everyday discussions ( arguments ) outside of the classroom .
They enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off .
I decided to cut an exercise in order to let the students continue their discussions .
In hindsight , giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point ( past modals ) was not the best choice .
Despite having timing issues , I feel that , thus far , this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT .
It 's a city where you can recreate a part of European history , thanks to the ancient and magnificent buildings , and where you can enjoy the latest technology and have fun .
Inside it , we can find the well known Sistine chapel . I ca n't tell you what it 's like , because last year when I went , there was a changeover of pope , and it was closed and I could n't enter .
Furthermore , if you go in summer , you should go to a lively area and be with the interesting and nice people , but like every city , be careful in the rough areas .
Despite people 's opinions , if you have the opportunity to go , do n't throw it away , and check it out for yourself .
FRIENDSHIP TODAY
At some point , all of us have benefited enormously from a real friendship .
Counting on someone capable of understanding your needs , who shares with you their innermost feelings and who is able to discuss possible misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
Nevertheless , a friendship depends largely on sincerity and empathy .
Curiously , you never know where you will find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe go to the same sports lessons as you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprising the amount of nice people around you sometimes , and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you now have new friends .
After we ate the cake , I found my mom looking at me and screaming : " Oh !
When I looked in the mirror , my face was spotted with red spots and it kind of turned purple , when I looked at my hands and my arms , they were all red from my fingers when I was scratching them , and the parts that were n't red , they were spotted like my face .
Anyways , mom gave me a medicine ( I do n't know what it is ) , and a cream for my arms and hands because they were turning blue .
And do n't be afraid , I 'm okay , and I decided to check everything for blueberries .
What is the experience of learning another language like ?
However , anyone who is skilled in speaking a foreign language has a huge advantage in a competitive and global society .
I had the opportunity to have different language classes , such as English , French and Spanish .
On the one hand , I have been learning English for so long that my good proficiency has given me the chance to get a position in an international team .
I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about myself .
As a student of these classes , especially , of English , I realized that , although the classes were important , systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and , moreover , for maintaining it .
Therefore , the hardest task of learning another language is to keep a high level of motivation to work on it and to pay for it .
Nevertheless , learning another language has many benefits , such as the ability to live in and visit countries with different languages , meeting foreign people , working in an international environment , reading books or websites in other languages , etc .
The RUBBERNECKER novel review by Marian Greco
Bauer 's fourth novel is an originally surprising thriller which includes an astonishing view of Asperger 's syndrome from the perspective of Patrick , a trainee medical student .
At the tender age of 18 and coping with his eccentric social code and all the possible courage , Patrick moves from his mother 's house to a rented flat in Cardiff to pursue his greatest dream ; work in the Anatomy Department at Cardiff University .
The writer lets us observe the fear , anxiety and the defencelessness of Sam , a neurological patient who is just beginning to emerge from his comatose state and who has yet to deal with the reality of his new situation , sorting out pieces of memories involving relatives and not quite understanding why a woman he does n't know anything about claims to be his wife .
Patrick performs the autopsy of Sam brilliantly and finds out shocking information which leads the reader to the discovery of tragic and incidental deaths of neurological patients involving doctors , nurses and patients ' relatives .
In this task , Patrick will be helped out by Lexi , the daughter of his autopsy corpse , to throw some light on the creepy suspicion of medical mistreatment and its darkest consequences .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Everything started with some attacks here and there , but no one really knew what was happening , so the attacks were tagged as " animal attacks " .
But when they became more frequent and witnesses described huge , furry , dark and terrifying creatures with blood - shot eyes , panic grew in the population .
Government authorities told people to stay calm and a curfew was established , but Peter was on a camping holiday with his best friends and only heard this when they met another group of people who , fortunately , had a radio .
They told them everything .
In order to be stronger in number , they befriended those people and they helped each other .
I 'm 23 years old and love to cook and I also love to be outdoors and play sports with the kids , I love organizing activities for children and actually playing with them . I 'm always cheerful and in a great mood . I do n't smoke or drink . I have a good level of spoken English and I 've always been hardworking and energetic .
My plan is simple , I want to make the best of this British experience by studying English and possibly by finding a little job .
At the moment I am struggling with the translation of my CV .
I am wondering if you could help me by giving me some tips to write a perfect , of at least acceptable , CV .
I have just found cheap accommodation in a hostel which is very convenient for all the facilities .
Even though I am shy and I like my privacy , I think that during this experience it will be better to have contact with foreign people to practise my spoken English as much as possible .
The aim of this experience is also to have fun and a great time with you .
For example , what about going for some walks in the countryside or renting a bike ?
OK , I have told you everything and I really should finish packing !
I am rather lazy as a person . I ca n't say I really enjoy sports in general , but I definitely love walking .
There 's no special advice to give to somebody who wants to start this activity : if you aim to do something good for your health and for your mind , just wear comfortable clothes , put a pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiring place and just go and enjoy every minute of it .
You may want some nice music with you , so an Ipod is a handy solution to collect all your favourite songs and set up the perfect soundtrack to your walking activity .
It 's very cheap as well : apart from your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortable trainers , it does n't require any extra cost for technical or sophisticated equipment .
Actually , now I 'm staying in New Zealand , but I can give you some advice about travelling and working in Korea .
I think this will be a very good experience for you because you can learn about another culture and another people 's way of thinking .
Also , if you want to work a in more specific place , such as an electricity company , public office and so on , you can apply to an internship programme .
If you get the internship , you can work as a real businessman .
Normally , summer is the best season for travelling .
In summer , you can enjoy many activities on the beach and you can also go hiking .
In particular , I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
If you want to know more information about Korea , let me know , and I do n't mind checking your plan to go to Korea .
When I opened , I was handcuffed straight away and I pretended to be surprised .
Nevertheless , the police had found the buried body .
Fortunately , Michael , who had n't thought of that option , left the interrogation room .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Travelling further down he found his destination , a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog .
His panting turned into a magnificent grin as he looked out the window and saw a black helicopter heading in his direction .
To begin with , I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday or to get around the city or town because they feel free and do n't have to pay attention to a timetable .
But , on the other hand , when they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train or a plane because you arrive faster and you need n't find a place to park your car and , if you want to go somewhere , you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground .
In conclusion , from my point of view , if you are in your own town or city , you use your car more often than when you are visiting another country and seeing the sights .
This diagram illustrates the complete process of note - making .
While background color and artwork are thoroughly considered , security issues are one thing that we can not overlook either .
After this , metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank note printing , in which stage sheets are used to print ( each containing 50 bank notes ) .
Then comes the most important stage -- inspection .
Sheets in the second group then get separated into good ones , which , together with good quality sheets , enter a process of packaging and distribution where separate notes are cut and finally enter the market , and bad ones , which go to disposal with bad quality sheets , where both groups get securely destroyed .
This leads us to the conclusion that the process of bank note creation is secure as well as simple .
That day is one of the memories I appreciate the most .
Because I want him to be my daughter's / son 's dad , and to share an apartment with him , so we can buy our first Christmas tree as a couple with a real engagement , and spend every holiday , birthday , day , minute with him by my side .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
" It 's time for us to shine , " His handwritten words came to life in her mind .
She could distinctly hear his low , manly voice in her head .
His deep chuckles still gave her butterflies in her stomach .
It was not an absolutely pleasant experience .
Disgusting .
The person was holding her wrist , preventing her from wiping any sweat from her face .
Wide eyes , red lips , rosy cheeks , broad build and a little stubble on his chin , he looked incredible .
Those blue eyes , were much darker with insecurity , doubt and mystery .
Alison swallowed her laughter inside her , knowing this was not the appropriate time to joke around .
First of all , let me tell you the advantages .
They are obvious , nevertheless , I feel I should repeat them .
The former does not need any explanation .
I have them because I have paid for them , not for any other particular reason .
Last but not least , we could create an association that could be in charge of receiving books at the beginning .
Later , it could support other school initiatives .
In conclusion , we should provide free books for our students .

Again , thank you for your consideration .
The streets were calm and the lights were pleasant . Travelling at night was a pleasure in this town .
He was making preparations to make a huge deal with the other person .
They said in a delightful and evil tone .
They controlled his mind .
She looked on her laptop , where all the information in that man 's mind was displayed .
The building was luxurious and covered by the most wonderful structures ever .
They went up to the receptionist .
The receptionist nodded and conducted both to the main hall .
What was inside was dangerous but fascinating .
It was disturbing , as kids were also included .
It was impossible . They deleted every bit of information about themselves .
Just as a coin has two sides , television , too , has its pros and cons .
It offers unlimited entertainment as well as food for thought .
To quote an example , the prime minister of India recently launched a new channel called DD KISAN - the first television channel dedicated to farmers in India .
This would help the farmers to know the latest techniques and trends in agriculture and will also enable them to put across their queries to the concerned specialists in their field .
Of late , debates on news channels are the talk of the town where you get to know what is happening in your country or neighborhood .
Such programs also allow us to participate by giving our feedback .
Gone are the days when Tom mindlessly chased Jerry .
These days , we have many educational cartoons that teach kids how to draw , make crafts and even learn languages .
Hence , I conclude that television entertains as well as educates .
However , I believe that their functionality will change .
Even today , processors are in almost every device : dishwashers , vacuum cleaners , television sets , even blenders .
It may sound silly , but I think it actually will make those devices more user - friendly and functional .
Even now , we can buy TV sets with an Internet connection , so development of technology is not a problem .
You come back and dinner is cooked , all your favourite programmes are recorded and ready to watch , your bath is full of hot water and you can just relax .
Reassuming , while the design of houses may look different , the most significant change will be in technology , which will make our life easier .
It has already done this , but we still ca n't see an end to the possibilities .
I have read your advertisement in the local newspaper and I am writing to apply for a job at USA SUMMER CAMPS .
Apart from that , I have been studying English for 10 years and I am sitting for Cambridge First Certificate in English next December .
Firstly , I would like to say that I have some experience of looking after children because I worked at a local summer camp last summer .
As for my personality , I would like to mention that I am a funny person who enjoys telling jokes , making people laugh and even getting dressed up as a clown to entertain others .
Furthermore , I do not mind working long hours .
I hope my application will be taken into consideration .
If you require any further information , I am available for an online interview .
Yours faithfully ,
It 's no secret that there has been a decline in the use of transport such as taxis ever since cars became more affordable and your common Joe became capable of keeping one , two or more per family . However , does that really mean that the future of public transport like buses is hopeless ?
People are becoming more and more aware of the strain the carbon dioxide emissions of their cars put on the environment , and many municipalities have already outlawed the circulation of certain types of vehicles in given parts of their cities to reduce atmospheric pollution and improve the quality of its air .
Many affordable bus and metro passes and other systems have also been created in order to motivate the citizens to use them , providing a quicker , and sometimes cheaper , alternative to their own transport .
The recent focus on public transport , along with the certain technological improvements and innovations that will follow it , are going to revitalize the public transport sector and hopefully make cities more eco - friendly .
It was n't only the smile , but the way she talked to him , the look in her eyes and her flirty attitude that had filled his stomach with tiny butterflies and , as he was going home , he started to realize the love running through his veins , right to the heart .
As Michael approached the house his feelings dropped down .
He took the keys from his pocket and approached carefully , holding his breath .
The problem with this movie is not the story , because the book is fantastic and when you read it , you really can feel the emotions of the characters .
Furthermore , the main actors ' performance is not very good because they are not completely inside their roles .
Although there are a lot of things which could be improved , not everything is bad in this movie !
An example of that is the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song by Pablo Alboran , a Spanish singer .
Other good features are the costumes and the landscapes , which give the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time .
On the one hand , you 've been doing sport since you were seven years old and I understand it 's very important for you .
On the other hand , you love playing piano and , in my opinion , you wo n't be able to keep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't have any instruments at home .
Besides , I do n't think your parents would buy you a piano , since it would really annoy your neighbours .
However , I see sport as a physical activity , where I constantly challenge myself to achieve better results .
It 's just like a competition when I practise sport .
At least once a month , usually on Sundays , my friends and I hold a competition .
Swimming gives me a huge amount of satisfaction and so much desire to keep on challenging myself .
I am writing to inform you that the package holidays to Madrid you are currently advertising in your newspaper are apparently not what they claimed to be .
I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish , as your readers could be negatively biased against your paper due to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough , as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , were very high .
Nevertheless , there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and , for some people , is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .
Another point of concern was transportation .
We had several problems , especially with the bus , which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour .
I believe there is plenty of room for improvement since , although the problems were not insuperable , they caused great inconvenience .
Firstly , a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented .
Secondly , advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them .
But the most important issue is the improvement of the general organization .
I assume that the tourist agency can think of better solutions than me , but I hope that my recommendations will be taken seriously .
There are six main characters : Ross , Monica , Rachel , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey .
She works in a restaurant as the head chef and she 's dating a man twenty years older than her .
It also shows you the power of the family and how they should stick together through all the difficulties they face .
Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher 's responsibility .
On one hand , parents should take responsibility for their children 's education as they are a child 's first contact .
However , they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people .
Ultimately , teachers may have different values from those of the parents .
On the other hand , parents may have a lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need , for example , pay for their children 's school .
It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home , making it the school 's responsibility to pass on good social values .
To sum up , parents should take full responsibility for their children 's education .
I am writing with regard to the advertisement published by you , to work in summer camps in the USA .
I would like to take part in this experience during the summer , as I will have my summer break during that period .
During my apprenticeship , I was in charge of organising several activities , so I think I could do well at organising sports and activities .
Cooking has always been one of my favourite hobbies , and for this reason , I also would like to help in the kitchen activities .
I am a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person , and I am also a very responsible person , able to deal with small and medium groups of children , and for this reason I consider myself as suitable for the position advertised .
I am looking forward to taking part in this project , and enriching my CV through participation in this project .
Looking forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
Everything in this movie , Henri , is so simple and startling , but at the same time hard to describe .
It tells the story of a widowed shop owner and a mentally handicapped girl .
As time passes by , the relationship has so many ups and downs , but with consistent love and care , it ends with a strong bond that is n't easily broken .
In France , where the film was made , they call the handicapped , " White Butterflies " , which is definitely a better nomenclature than " People With Special Needs " and so many disrespectful names .
My sole purpose is to help you enjoy the little things in your lives , appreciate life and its simplicity with all its hidden fun and sad parts as well .
Unlock the door to a new life and kick off your journey toward a whole new group of characters .
Check out how ordinary people , just like you and me , live each and every day , share their grief and problems , join them in their happy moments , get involved in their lives and be passionate and compassionate .
The aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course " Good design using DTP " , to give an overall view of it .
DESCRIPTION
All the participants , which were ten in total , were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course , in order to put into practice what was taught .
Furthermore , the organizers had carefully planned the whole course , including meals and beverages too .
ACHIEVEMENTS
The tutor , Will Reeves , a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way .
To begin with , he focused on design considerations with DPT , explaining what software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , layout and balance , as well as graphics and logs .
He concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing .
The highpoint , however , was the final practical exercises , which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension .
Not only was the venue inconvenient , but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too , who pointed it out to the organizers , who immediately started looking for an alternative venue .
In addition , in spite of having paid a lot , the participants were not allowed to take any materials away , and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result , as the participants did n't have any materials to use to revise .
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
To sum up , the course was generally successful , as the positive feedback received suggests .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject , for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor .
There are many problems created by doing large - scale building projects , and it is the government 's responsibility to deal with these problems .
There are some unfavorable influences on people 's lives .
For example , in some areas , people have to wear a mask while doing outdoor activities and they might need to purchase water from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively affected and thus they will feel less happy than other people living in unpolluted areas .
They have to migrate to another place since their homes are destroyed , and during the migration most of them will die because of lack of water , high temperatures or predators .
Besides , those animals who successfully arrive in a suitable place to live are likely to suffer from disease , because they haven't been exposed to such a new environment before .
Although there are many people and animals that are suffering from these problems , I do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be created to forbid some projects which cause massive problems for the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people about the serious problems caused by constructing large - scale buildings .
To summarise , large - scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to humans and animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these problems .
And the other questions : which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations help me with my writing process ?
From my point of view , my writing has definitely improved since the beginning of this school year .
I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well - structured sentences now , which I could n't do so well at the beginning of this school year .
This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well .
The way I see it is that I learned to use cohesion in a correct way , which makes the paragraphs that I write more clear .
Subsequently , I would like to answer the next two questions .
Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations help me with my writing process ?
Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year , I 'd like to improve my English vocabulary .
As I see it , the bigger the vocabulary , the better the writing process .
More words can be added to the article , so there can be a better explanation of the subject .
It 's my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process .
I learned a lot of new words during the presentations which I used in my free writing .
The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned on the English course , can always be used later on in life .
A better future means having good food to eat without worrying , good clothes to wear , a big property , a private means of transportation and many more .
Among them , a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport .
Having your own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual , including me .
One private car per individual is needed .
Whether to go to work or other places , travelling in a private vehicle is hassle free .
The trend of personal car ownership is increasing rapidly .
It is so clear that private transport will overshadow public vehicles .
Unfortunately , many people are damaged , not only physically but mentally , and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves the children in the hell it causes .
They are just the most sensitive and innocent victims of mistreatment .
It is very serious and hard to solve , because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and be able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes .
This is so difficult due to the fact that they usually feel stupid , miserable , hopeless and do not feel good about themselves .
Their aggressors make them become insecure and they think that they are alone .
In most cases , they even feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to telling the truth .
There is always someone who you can count on among your family , friends or associates , but you must ask for help .
We need to consider both sides of the argument for public transport use prior to reaching a conclusion .
Public transport is used for many reasons and can be convenient for different circumstances .
This form of transport can be used to avoid delays due to traffic conditions and parking restrictions .
It can provide an opportunity for people to complete work during the journey .
Public transport may be the only option for individuals who do not drive or have access to a car .
It is more environmentally friendly because it has the potential to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road .
However , public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues .
It may be expensive to use for some individuals and crowded during rush hours .
Using a car can be more flexible for some individuals .
A car can be useful for effective performance of many tasks .
It is easier to change routes when circumstances change unexpectedly .
The reasons for use are dependent on the individual and the circumstances .
First of all , in this film you do n't see a gangster Al Pacino . It 's about a retired army colonel who suffers from loneliness and depression .
So , overall , I strongly recommend it if you like redemption stories , and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life .
The text discusses the idea of how advanced communication technologies give us the advantage of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons to support this .
The professor , however , disagrees with points made in the article and explains that this system has its own disadvantages .
The first point the professor addresses involves the text 's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and , at the same time , will decrease the timeframe for getting the project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that , based on his own experience , this team work could be not so beneficial .
Therefore , the working group will make its own assumptions and may cause a waste of time .
Moreover , the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do the same work differently , so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done .
Another point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause for businesses .
The professor points out that holding virtual meetings between teams in different timeframes will be challenging .
For example , one of the team will have to stay late in order to talk to another group , causing inconvenience .
It is not easy to prove that there is a relationship between organizational culture and performance .
For a very long time there has not been scientific evidence that proved the relationship between organizational culture and performance , until studies found a correlation between these subjects .
These four studies are put together in a model named ' Organization Culture Performance Model ' ( OCPM ) .
This model tells us that the culture is determined by actual behavior of individual or groups of employees .
The culture is caused by organizational variables .
The external aspect is : external client orientation .
The internal aspects are : design of organization , communication , HRM - orientation and leadership .
The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : individual- , group- , and organizational performances .
There is n't a direct relationship between organizational culture and actual performances , but there is a direct relationship between organizational culture and expected performances .
The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employees experience .
A short summary of the OCPM- model : there are organizational variables that determine the visible and invisible behavior of employees .
These variables and behavior of employees determine the expected performance and then there is the actual outcome .
More and more people nowadays try to find some ways of relaxing , due to the fast pace of life and stress .
Smoking appeals to many people of different generations , because it gives fast relief for a short period of time . That is also quite reasonable .
It 's a fact that tobacco has been used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities .
It 's a real issue for the government to understand that if the process of banning smokers starts , the income rate will immediately decrease .
Moreover , tobacco contains a vitamin , called PP1 that is beneficial for your health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , even though it 's temporary , it 's still beneficial for your heart , rather than being constantly stressed .
It 's important to understand that you are responsible for your surroundings and people around you .
So if your habits can be harmful for them , you need to understand the cost of it .
For the same reason , the government needs to control the situation by using a banning strategy if people smoke in certain forbidden ares , like kindergartens , schools , hospitals , etc .
In my opinion , people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own , but as soon as it starts to be a threat to others , they should be stopped immediately .
The purpose of this report is to consider how my town takes care of the environment and to explain what kind of recommendations and improvements you can make if you live in Madrid .
Madrid is a huge city which offers a lot of recycling facilities that take care of the environment .
It 's very easy to recycle things and it 's possible to choose alternative energy sources .
Firstly , people can take the bus or the underground and leave his or her car at home .
Another option is the possibility of having solar panels on the roofs of some buildings in Madrid .
Old clothes , books and toys in good condition can be passed on to charity shops .
In conclusion , Madrid offers a lot of alternatives to take care of the environment .
Discuss the risks and impacts of climate(weather)-related natural disasters .
Over the past few decades , human activities have changed the global climate , hence we are facing higher risks of weather - related disasters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters have struck the whole society with many negative effects , drawing the attention of citizens to catastrophes .
This essay will examine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of drought , followed by two main negative impacts in terms of the economic and social problems in agriculture .
It is obvious that global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in the demand for cars , industries and farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gases .
Because of human activities , the temperature of the sea 's surface and the atmosphere have been gradually increasing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature of approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century , with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon that can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomena .
Undoubtedly , all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation .
Generally , the increase in temperature has resulted in a surge in hot days , and a decrease of cold days .
This will largely cause less soil water and precipitation .
Additionally , this event is different depending on the areas .
The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become drier and have insufficient precipitation , which may make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brief , there will be serious consequences as a result of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
In the economic aspect , drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .
As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor .
This can lead to a loss of profits upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken area is the social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the areas , such as Africa where there is an underdeveloped infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after an emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused a significant number of casualties for both mankind and animals .
Secondly , farming has also contributed to migration .
When the public suffers from natural disasters and there are no solutions , they are forced to leave their homes in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might face a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought has led to the severe social impacts of natural disasters .
In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have had immense economic and social impacts .
Not only human beings but also all organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
The fact is , natural disasters have changed people 's and animals ' living environment , bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
Additionally , climate change related to natural disasters also causes famine , which has caused deaths and forced people as well as animals to leave their homes . More seriously , the climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
Everything seems to strange when you are fifteen and you are talking about love .
This past few months have made my life unfathomable , making me unable to grasp the idea of when is the right age to fall in love .
I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older , and I know nothing will come out of it .
Yes , it hurts , but at the end of the day , almost everything in this world will make you bleed .
It will make you feel vulnerable , but that is life .
They will always love you based on your looks rather than your personality .
I am the chairman of the 2012 Metropolitan Medical Conference that is being held in Miami , Florida on July 5 , 2012 , and I would like to invite you to present your research on beta blockers . We would be delighted to listen to you discussing your work , and I hope you will also agree to run a short question - and - answer session after the presentation .
Additionally , Metropolitan Medical would be pleased to cover your travel and lodging expenses while you visit the conference , in addition to providing you with a per diem allowance .
If you are young , you could walk fast , if you are old or not especially fit , you could start walking at a slow pace and , with time , improve your performance .
I would like to give some advice to people who want to start walking : take your time , do not try to walk ten kilometers the first day . Try short walks first and every day increase the distance .
And if you do that , then , sooner or later , you will become a walking enthusiast .
He used to dream about him coming into his bedroom , laughing out loud , showing off his sharp teeth , threatening him with the most horrible punishments .
He remembered one of the awful dreams he used to have as a child .
Suddenly he felt brave and unstoppable .
It is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something , colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that .
Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes , especially for women .
No doubt manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and , consequently , it means that things of this colour will sell well .
In addition , companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes .
For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to the middle class prefer pink and green colours for some psychological reasons .
Furthermore , colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential .
For example , psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people 's appetite and makes them feel hungry .
That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red . Likewise , in some other cafes and restaurants .
To sum up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but , in the same way , manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
My friendship with Jessie started on the exciting first day of kindergarten .
I went downstairs to the playground for the break .
I was walking alone around the noisy and crowded playground , looking for my very first friend , when I saw a quiet girl under a tree .
We played every day together and , in the afternoons , we went to each other 's houses .
I love how Jessie helps me with everything I need , like with guys or family problems .
We love doing sleepovers , watching movies and going on holidays together .
It is generally accepted that television provides us with by far the best and easiest way to stay in touch with the whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , taking some time off from our housework .
This is the innovation that such a worldwide medium brings to our society .
Recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spending most of their afternoons in front of the television so as not to miss a new cartoon or a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today 's televisions are full of .
It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together current topics and problems , in order to learn something more about the world we are living in .
In view of the above arguments , I would suggest everyone cuts down on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
Secondly , public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus , thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the environment .
Lastly , if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops , many people will be unemployed . They could not earn more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
In conclusion , public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything would be a disaster .
Interrupting the momentum by taking a year off is maybe the worst thing you can do .
Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the deadlines , the exams , and other stuff that force you to get things done , and , as a consequence , teach you to be a responsible person , which you will need to be when you get a job , you will simply be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .
One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you should never take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need to , due to fatigue or for some other physical or psychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in a useful way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intellectually or doing whatever you think can enrich your life .
I 've wasted so much time in my life that even I find it embarrassing .
Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits in high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life .
Regardless of what 's waiting for me at the end , I will never give up walking along those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be .
I do n't need your friendship you bastard !
I hope I do n't get an F by saying this , but it is the truth , and I love being honest . I know , as soon you put your creepy , wicked eyes on my composition I must expect a bad grade .
I bet you love money , especially money obtained by illegal means , do n't you ?
I am writing in reply to your advertisement published in the local newspaper for the vacancy of Junior Chef .
I believe I have the necessary qualifications and experience that you are looking for .
Moreover , I am currently undertaking a Chef Training Course which provides me with not only practical but also theoretical knowledge .
Furthermore , I always try to maintain a positive attitude towards my responsibilities and sort out any problem that may occur .
I am available for an interview at any time which might be convenient for you .
Yours faithfully ,
Having gone through all those tough times ; trials and tribulations and I was alive !
Looking down at the watch on my wrist , I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall from the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament .
The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal !
Emphatically , I reminded myself that I would n't have survived had it not been for God 's help !
The very thought of winning an accolade in front of a jubilant crowd disappeared all together and all I ever wanted was to be home , be safe , and be with my family .
I have got a family of my own , so I am familiar with looking after children and taking care of them . I enjoy fitness and can easily help organise children 's sport activities .
I do enjoy communicating with children , I like to play games and learn something new from them !
In the evenings we would arrange different activities , like plays , singing , dancing .
I am also quite experienced in the kitchen . I am really into healthy nutrition and healthy cooking .
It is important for children to get healthy meals , especially in their early teenage years .
She is a great woman ; hardworking , responsible , kind , friendly , intelligent and an amazing person .
Some people say zoos are traditional family entertainment and good for animals .
Due to the interest in protecting animals , people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) , which is an international non - governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation , research and restoration of the environment .
Another positive aspect of zoos is that they help to protect endangered species by offering them a safe place to live .
In addition , zoos help to find mates for endangered species .
Consequently , they are mistreated , hit and live in an inadequate place where they can not behave freely .
Another drawback is that animals sometimes escape from their enclosures , which is dangerous for humans .
This may cause not only the animal 's death by being run over , but also the passengers ' death if the driver tries to stop and loses control of the car .
Personally , I think it is acceptable to keep animals in zoos , as long as they have enough space and are properly looked after .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to resist temptation .
They have computers , smartphones , cleaning robots , fast food ...
We have developed technology to make our lives easier .
Nevertheless , we can not allow that technology to put our children in danger .
On the one hand , I am going to sound like my grandfather telling his war tales .
Why do they need a smartphone ?
In summary , I know it is a hard choice . I am talking about multinational companies that try to change our way of life to suit their needs .
The art of writing letters along with painting colorful mandalas were taught her to by her grandmother .
Algebra and geometry were the most important subjects taught by her grandfather .
She loved watching the printer at work producing numerous results of psychology tests , which she had just passed .
She devoted all her free time to experiments on linking her math homework with programming of a music equalizer .
She graduated from Kiev International University in 2009 .
Kateryna was frustrated with the classic film genre and started looking for possibilities for realization of experimental theoretical ideas in practice .
Dancing requires a lot of things , like coordination , flexibility , and physical fitness , just to mention a few .
You do n't even notice how hard your body is working because you really are enjoying yourself , and I think that 's awesome because it just makes everything easier .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it seriously , because even though I said it was fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .
Dancing is not as easy as everybody thinks , but it is definitely worth a try .
Recently I listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
This got me thinking . How do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters ?
Adults can influence the behaviour of youngsters in different ways .
Secondly , adults can offer advice to youngsters .
They have more life experience so they probably know what they are talking about .
Think of celebrities , for example .
So , when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters , they can influence behaviour in a positive way .
Especially when they have to live under a great number of rules .
Also , advice is n't always taken positively .
And whether this is taken positively , is completely up to the adults and youngsters themselves .
Frozen shoulder or shoulder stiffness is an extremely limiting and debilitating disease .
The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder .
Although very important and critical , there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it .
1- Most patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth , because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma , as in elderly people , especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation .
Usually , after major operations , having a stroke or bone fracture .
So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness , movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited over time .
The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medication such as analgesics and paracetamol .
Cortisone injections are also helpful . These injections can improve everything ; decrease swelling , stiffness and pain .
- Physiotherapy is not only about exercises ; some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation about how our town takes care of the environment as well as about what people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive .
Nowadays , young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity of the pollution cycle .
However , it is estimated that at least 70% of young kids do not take care of their personal rubbish and are the main contributors to a polluted environment .
Despite the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school , they are the most civilized and responsible .
A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education , but because of their eagerness to show their kids that they are great and responsible parents .
Every year , we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman 's work every single day .
As far as I am concerned , there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you throw litter on the floor , you will have to pay a fine .
Conclusion
However , everything starts at the level of the education that every human being receives .
Unfortunately , there is still a long way to go in terms of environmental concerns , but some of these solutions suggested by the mayor help us stop the pollution .
Environmental problems are becoming more and more serious all over the world .
" Air " is one of the necessities to maintain a human being 's life .
However , air pollution affects not only people 's health but also the whole environmental system .
China is a big industrial country , so there are a great number of factories and trucks .
Environmental problems affect us all .
Not only should the government make laws to control the situation , but also we should do our best not to create more pollution .
For example , if you do n't smoke , you wo n't cause air pollution and you wo n't damage your health .If you use public transportation , walk more or take a bicycle as your transportation , you will not only help reduce the pollution , but also improve your health .
While there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live , many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention .
It 's also our responsibility to protect it and to do our best to prevent it from being polluted .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Finally , she saw the lights of an approaching car and ran toward the car .
Therefore , it would be incredibly expensive to reunite all of them again for another film .
They are credible , especially Kevin Spacey , Charles Palminteri and Gabriel Byrne .
The photography is also good .
The soundtrack is not spectacular .
There is a scene , at the very end , where you can see a transformation .
I think that the best way to recommend this movie to anyone one is to quote from The Usual Suspects : " the best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did n't exist . "
It would be a great pleasure for me to be part of Think Education , an innovative higher education institution that offers high - quality learning .
I have an MSc in Food Science and a PhD in Biochemistry .
Overall , I have nine years of experience in biomedical research and several years of teaching experience .
At the University of Queensland I tutored several subjects , including Biochemistry for Nutrition students .
During my career I have gained extensive experience in academic writing .
My scientific work has been published in seven scientific articles .
Moreover , in a position as a Medical Writer , I wrote scientific documents for clients in the pharmaceutical industry .
Furthermore , I was a writer and editor for the project Food Info , a platform to inform the general public about food - science - related topics .
The advertised position is very appealing to me because I have always been fascinated by nutrition and natural therapies .
I would be very motivated to contribute to the development of excellent educational materials for the Faculty of Health and Wellness of Think Education .
The strengths that I could bring to this position are excellent written communication skills and a keen eye for detail .
I would appreciate the chance to talk with you to discuss the requirements and expectations of the position .
Thank you for your time and consideration and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
There is no future for public transportation , is in my opinion a wrong assumption .
Modern times have raised concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
Public transportation can help fight greenhouse gas emissions and can help us protect the world from climate - change effects .
In recent years , there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Nowadays , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .
On the other hand , using a private car is totally ignoring the environmental damage and effects .
In developing countries , there is still a low level of awareness about the side effects of using polluting private cars .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of one 's behavior are becoming important and concerning .
In my opinion , it is just a matter of time until all the transportation options will be public and private cars will be left behind .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
If we do so , we can see the massive difference in our lives from the people living 50 years back .
Although now we have very advanced technology which has made our lives completely different and more comfortable than before , in the future it will be much better than this .
We will see things happening then which today seem to be impossible .
The other difference , hopefully , will be in medicine .
We will definitely have better drugs and also fewer incurable diseases .
However , it is possible that along with new inventions and research there might be more harmful viruses also .
All these differences will make people 's lives tranquil .
There are some downsides to an advanced world too . For example , people will be more unhealthy due to the environmental conditions and also less self - reliant because of technological progress .
It can not escape our minds that , at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper - sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single - sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
While the hyper - sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for many parents , sending their children to a mixed - sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they will grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it seems to me that choosing a single - sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and , in many cases , reinforce some of the many stereotypes that we , as a society , have regarding gender . Therefore , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but for the child as a key to the future of the country and , to an extent , to the world .
Therefore , and to sum up , It is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mixed - sex schools , which reflect the society we live in , as opposed to single - sex schools , which may reinforce those stereotypes that are undermining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving forces of the Western economy .
Thousands would lose their jobs , both directly in the car factories and indirectly in many other car - related businesses , like car part stores , petrol stations , garages , and so on .
If private transport was fully replaced by public transport , the world 's economic foundations would shake and a global financial crisis of unprecedented impact could occur .
It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are much dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
All things considered , we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear and , in no time , everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
I am writing to you to apply for a position advertised recently .
Currently , I am working as a teacher of English in my city of Dnipropetrovsk .
I am keen on communicating with different groups of children ( mostly aged 9 - 17 ) .
During my career I have organized a lot of fascinating activities to keep my students enthusiastic about learning more .
First of all , I have considerable experience of working with teenagers ( for more than 5 years ) , which I find really enjoyable .
And finally , I am the kind of person who is responsible , well - organised and optimistic .
It is a great opportunity for me to practise my skills and socialize with children from a foreign country .
Yours faithfully ,
Recently , genetic engineering has become a highly controversial issue around the world .
Many people think that genetic engineering has many drawbacks .
However , others claim that it is vital for society and future generations .
Genetic engineering is the process of manipulating the genes of an organism .
According to its supporters , there are many benefits of genetic engineering .
Besides , some genetically modified crops grow more quickly .
Supporters also claim that it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine .
With genetic engineering , human health has become better in many ways .
For instance , it may be used by scientists to cure some diseases .
In spite of the benefits , there are also certain drawbacks to human genetic engineering .
There are many ethical concerns about human genetic engineering .
It is still unacceptable in most cultures because of their religious beliefs .
Another problem is genetically modified food products .
Although they look bigger or more attractive , genetically modified food products are unhealthy for people .
In conclusion , it seems the benefits of human genetic engineering outweigh the drawbacks .
Therefore , genetic engineering is important for humanity and the future .
Not only did they share a clear interest in writing about social issues that affected contemporary life in Britain , but they also had similar ways of structuring their novels .
For example , in Dickens ' " David Copperfield " and Charlotte Brönte 's " Jane Eyre " , the story is told by their respective protagonists who remember their own past experiences .
In both novels , the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses ( " David Copperfield " ) and Boarding Schools ( " Jane Eyre " ) .
In the Brönte sisters ' works , we can find some Gothic elements - especially in Emily 's only novel " Wuthering Heights"- and a detachment from the figure of the Victorian dutiful woman .
Michael , my never - ending love story , was walking down the street one night with no particular thoughts in his mind .
The reason ? I told him I had found a job in another city and I was considering moving house .
No one could have anticipated what happened next .
I must have seemed cruel to him because , despite our daily disagreements , he adored me and was serious about settling down soon .
It was , of course , a once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , one I grabbed with both hands .
I was responsible for fulfilling all the needs of these famous guests .
The things some of them wanted : unbelievable ! Luckily , I had some other students helping me find all the curious things for the famous .
It was , after all , an amazing experience .
Not to mention that now I have some good connections in the world of the rich and famous !
Due to the ever - increasing population coupled with climate change , food shortages have become a significant problem facing many countries .
Some assert that genetically modified food technology could be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food could be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increased food yield .
It is well known that GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance genes .
This means that the food , being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases , we can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment .
This reduction in the application of chemical products can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safety .
Furthermore , GM food can also improve the production of crops .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure food production in a period of drought .
This could be important for food production , especially in developing countries .
However , some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bringing it onto the markets , have proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with a reduced use of chemicals .
In view of this , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortages .
However , because there are some disadvantages to the GM technology which is being developed , it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food .
An elderly university professor had to give his students the last lesson of his professional life , because he was going to retire .
As soon as the professor entered the classroom , he was surprised to see that it was completely full .
There was very little light in the classroom because it had been a rainy afternoon and a terrible thunderstorm had caused an electrical blackout .
The student did n't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion him : he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody .
The purpose of the survey was to discover the popular leisure time activities of male and female students .
The survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire given to the male and female students to complete .
The first part of the questionnaire dealt with leisure time activities on holidays .
The second section was concerned with time - out activities .
From the table of data , the most significant items are as follows .
It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays , while 90% of the female students like to go to the seaside .
The male students would gladly go to historical places , while 57% of the girls who filled in the questionnaire were n't inclined to spend their free time in that way .
In the second section , both the girls and the boys questioned claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera .
The majority of the male and female respondents enjoy going to nightclubs in their spare time .
For example , only 10% of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least once a week .
Unlike the boys , the female respondents usually do n't feel like going in for sport in their leisure time .
In contrast to the male respondents , the girls questioned go to evening classes in their free time .
Like the male respondents , the girls questioned go to the cinema regularly .
For instance , 47% of the female respondents watch films on the big screen every week .
In the third part of the questionnaire , it was found that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home for more than 2 hours a day .
In contrast to the girls questioned , who almost never play computer games , the majority of the male students play games for hours in their leisure time .
The female respondents are more fond of reading books than the male ones .
The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours surfing the Internet .
If any conclusions can be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
The leisure activities of the male and female students have a lot in common .
According to the findings , it is clear that , nowadays , going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places .
There is , therefore , a clear need for young people to prefer active and educational leisure time activities to passive ones .
First of all , we would like to thank you for letting us know about your concerns and giving us the opportunity to explain ourselves .
Please accept our sincere apologies ; it was the least of our intentions to offend you with our release letter , which is a standard format authorized by our legal department .
We already passed your comments about the format on to our chief lawyer and hope he can approve the necessary adjustments .
Of course , you can share your opinions and experiences about your stay wherever and with whoever you wish .
In addition , we are sorry that your holiday experience was affected by the fire that occurred on Saturday October 10th , 2015 .
It was not an easy task to find new accommodation and relocate over a thousand people .
We do know that the incident might have caused some inconveniences , but the most important thing is that none of our guests or staff were injured .
We hope that our explanations and apologies will make you change your mind and that you will give us another chance in the future to provide you with a much more delightful experience .
Given the circumstances , we would like to offer one of the following compensations if you decide to travel with us again in the future :
In my opinion , many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train . On your journey you can read or just look through the windows .
You can also enjoy the company of those travellers sharing the same transport .
However , I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedom , you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way .
Furthermore , you can choose what time you would like to travel and where to .
As long as people keep accepting this technology for communication , social media sites will also keep proceeding to the next step and affecting society .
In terms of the communication society , they will possibly change the way in which people develop relationships with each other , and consequently , they will create two types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , people have almost equal ability , and value interpersonal relationships .
In contrast , agentic culture stresses the differences between individuals , along with egotism and inequality ( Zarbatany , Conley , & Pepper as cited in Okazaki , & Taylor , 2013 ) .
These types of culture will exist in opposition in the future as an effect of social media sites .
There is nothing worse than not being able to communicate with people when you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustrating sensation that you might not want to go back again .
Besides , you 'll understand the native people when you go on holiday .
And furthermore , it 'll be reassuring to get by with your basic necessities in another country .
To wrap up the article , I 'd strongly recommend that young people learn at least one new foreign language , especially if you 're a student .
Nowadays , famous people , like movie stars , politicians , models and other celebrities suffer from a lack of privacy .
Paparazzi and journalists are following them everywhere they go .
They are also the reason for many problems which arise in the private lives of some celebrities .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour , and celebrities are aware of the fact that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in someone 's private life , when the person does n't want it is basically a synonym for trespassing .
On the other hand , it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives , but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of a private life .
Everything that goes on in a famous person 's life , including births , deaths , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If the individual stumbles , whether figuratively or literally , speculation about him will end up on TV , on the Internet or on the front page of the tabloids .
But in spite of this , sometimes journalists can be too insistent , trying to get at as much information as possible .
Generally , celebrities deserve to have a private life .
As it seems to me , private information about stars should be published if they approve of it by putting their signature to it .
It would be fair for celebrities .
I 'm glad to hear that you 've decided to take part in the organisation of this month 's concert .
I 'm writing to tell you about the experience I gained during preparations for the last concert .
You know , I have graduated culinary school and it was a great opportunity to use my skills . I 've made a lot of new friends .
I know it could be a problem for you since you ca n't cook , but organisers need volunteers in many fields : scenography , sound , VIP - escort .
So my recommendation to you would be to do something similar if you are looking for good experiences and plenty of laughs !
The Internet has many good points : it 's an infinite source of information and it 's a cheaper and faster way to communicate with other people .
However , Facebook , like many other social networking sites , has its dark side too .
On the one hand , it 's addictive . Internet addiction represents a serious problem in our age .
It may lead to inefficiency at school - or the in workplace - or even sleep disorders .
Stalkers , pedophiles , human traffickers , murderers and other criminals ; these are just a small part of the threats you can come across on Facebook .
In conclusion , I think that we ca n't be safe anywhere anymore - not even online .
It influenced the further development of post - Soviet countries as well the as geopolitical situation in the whole world .
It has also influenced international relations not just within the post - Soviet area , but also in the entire world , as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked by a crash of bipolar structure in international relations .
Since for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War , fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union , the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass - media but also in American society .
The American press had widely covered the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which had been spread across the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall , as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc .
The " New York Times " made a series of publications dedicated to the coup .
On August 20 , the " New York Times " published an article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .
The American press , summing up the era of Gorbachov , frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of Soviet society .
Those attempts were considered as one of Gorbachov 's main merits . "
The plotters immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin .
Decisive actions by Yeltsin were supported by most world governments and international communities .
Boris Yeltsin gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup 's leaders .
The coup , due to lack of organization and support from the military forces , failed three days later .
Leading articles in the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president .
American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status through his defiant stand , also mentioning that the people had known little about him .
The article in the New York Post " THE SOVIET CRISIS ; Yeltsin 's Remarks : A ' Reactionary Coup " refers to the night of 18 - 19 August 1991 , when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power .
The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which acquired a broad and irreversible character .
Also , it shows the attitude of the soviet people towards the changes in the country . "
The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited , and this includes party organs . "
This coup had great resonance among American society ; consequently , the US mass - media were eager to know the feelings of US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union .
The US citizen deemed the crisis a menace to the liberalisation of society ; they assumed it to be an actual barrier to the expression of the people 's will . "
The press underlined that many Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War and were harshly reminded that this was still the nuclear age .
The dissolution of the Communist party also became one of most popular issues in the American mass - media .
The Russian President , Boris Yeltsin , proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics . "
The Communist Party , which has had control for 74 years , is rapidly dissolving " , the Chicago Tribune wrote .
The US mass - media followed the reaction to the crisis inside the Communist party closely . One of the articles in the Washington post " Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe 's Communists " says that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe .
The dissolution of the Communist party was considered as one of the features of the collapse of the Soviet Union .
In the Washington Post , the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people .
As a result , the Soviet Union has been disintegrated along traditional ethnic lines .
The upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of new states and the following referendums on their independence .
The leaders of Russia , Ukraine and Belarus formally announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec 8 , 1991 and agreed to establish a " Commonwealth of Independent States " instead .
On the 25th of December 1991 , Gorbachov officially resigned .
The Washington Post wrote : " a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991 .
Soviet President Gorbachev agreed to the dissolution of all Soviet agencies " .
The Soviet époque , which had existed for 74 years , came to its end and this paved the way for the establishment of new independent republics .
" What are young people interested in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested , I interviewed a large number of young people , trying to understand their main interests , especially as regards music , TV programmes and clothes .
Many people aged between fourteen and eighteen said that the most listened to music among teenagers is definitely rock music .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical music and love opera .
TV PROGRAMMES
The people I interviewed are very keen on reality shows like " Big Brother " and similar , but I have to say that many of them are also interested in cooking shows and documentaries .
Only a few of them like to wear fashionable clothes .
CONCLUSION
Some of them are pretty similar to those we had in the past ; others are completely different and very interesting to explore .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or might it be a realistic idea ?
What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a worldwide spoken language be ?
Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a good example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and , therefore , the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover , English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiate in the business market .
Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would , without doubt , have many benefits .
Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone .
However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone , which might not be easy to accomplish , but it would be possible .
While teaching everyone English , it would also be profitable to teach basic knowledge of mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
Such a standardised educational system for every single person in the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and get out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others , so the world language will be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a need for teachers which would lead to many new job opportunities .
After all , a couple of professions might become extinct . For example , translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which could make up for the ones lost .
The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics , so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different types of political leadership .
However , this great improvement still has a few weaknesses .
On the one hand , there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance with the aboriginal people .
Anyway , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand , the suggestion of English as the worldwide spoken language might be up against a lot of criticism , since the United States does not have many supporters everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggestion and other languages , like Spanish or Chinese , could certainly be used as well .
Nowadays , more and more people are learning how to drive , as driving one 's own car is , as everyone knows , much more convenient than taking public transport .
Without doubt , having our own car provides us with great convenience .
But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred for maintenance and repair , and , of course , buying petrol .
Under these circumstances , some people may prefer to take public transport to save money for their " dream house " rather than buy a car .
Hong Kong is also famous for its heavy traffic , which implies the problem of traffic congestion .
Besides saving time , taking public transport can also help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
Greenhouse gases have already posed a grave threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , which raised people 's environmental awareness .
People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of environmental protection and want to contribute to saving our Earth .
Hence , contrary to many people 's perceptions , there should be an increasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , for public transport .
For the reasons mentioned above , it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that drops a bombshell on us , so suddenly that we can never predict how far it could go .
There 's not much work you have to do on a normal day , but maybe this will be a special one , because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be held half a kilometre away .
First , you need to know how to open the establishment .
They have similar skills and productivity , but , to be honest , I prefer working with the morning one . I do n't think you 'll have any problem with either group .
If there is any problem with the cash register ( very common , actually ) , you have a phone number under it of a good technician .
Change frequently creates a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in us .
However , it is one of the most motivating challenges in our lives .
We are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences .
For example , a close relationship or a serious illness makes us look at the world around us through different eyes , and they also let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings .
Even so , change can be perceived as a disturbing issue due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Often , dealing with new situations does not help us to feel comfortable .
Furthermore , we sometimes feel scared of facing new experiences and then we can miss a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality and to become better people in any aspect of our lives , because it represents a major challenge .
Nowadays , there 's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and solving mathematical equations .
Classes are being held much more interactively than in previous years , and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life .
First of all , it is essential for young people to learn how to take care of themselves , such as knowing how to cook .
In order to prevent the younger generation of our society consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes .
Not only is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to create healthy meals , but it also strengthens relationships among classmates , as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes .
Moreover , it is a welcome distraction from the theoretical school routine .
Passing this attitude on to their children , they wo n't be able to save money for emergencies and deal with it reasonably , which is a necessity in order to survive .
To conclude , there are a lot of things worth considering teaching in school .
Both of them are skills which help with managing your life later on , finances in particular .
Flying to different continents is easy nowadays but still expensive .
Therefore , Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind : travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible .
He was following an important European summit on environmental issues .
Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives .
He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices .
Access to different public transport services ( such as underground , buses , tram , etc . )
He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels suburb .
A few weeks later , Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle - East .
He was able to reach the South by a connecting flight from Rome .
Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he had expected .
He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy .
Its inhabitants get around exclusively in their own cars .
Towns are congested with traffic james , especially during rush hours .
Such an experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people 's lives and their surroundings .
In particular , an efficient public transport impacts on :
Communications - it eases movement from place to place
Environment - it reduces cars on the roads , therefore air is less polluted
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car ; though initially it might look like a huge investment of money from the community , in the long term it shows itself to be the most efficient way to travel !
Therefore , it all comes down in this essay to expressing feelings about Seville and its surroundings .
In fact , the more I know about its organization and its people , the more I feel at ease in Seville .
In my opinion , Seville was rather disorganized and not very charming and its citizens rather rude .
Consequently , what are the reasons for my change of heart ?
The more I understand it , the more I like it .
There are even some smiles and laughs , which is very reassuring for someone who is alone abroad .
For instance , I spent some time last night eating tapas on a small street in a laid - back atmosphere .
I was surrounded by joyful Spaniards who were speaking loudly .
To make matters even better , there was some music playing a few metres ahead , which contributed to livening up the spirits of everyone present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " draft beer " and going for a " tapas crawl " with friends , as in Switzerland each person gets their own dish when eating out and they only go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost in the winding narrow cobbled streets , as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures .
On account of all this , it is easy to understand why my perception of Seville has significantly changed over time .
As far as I 'm concerned , the city is no longer a museum displaying sumptuous and ostentatious monuments .
WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE !
This year , in Italy , for the first time in more than 200 years , a weird coincidence happened : the political leader , Silvio Berlusconi , and the singer Ligabue marked their careers on the same day .
On the one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when some journalists told the world about some wiretappings of his which would compromise his future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue won the award for the best song of the year , bringing his career ever forward .
Unbelievable as it may seem , this is really a bizarre coincidence .
If I also had a year free , I would only want to travel , not work .
Switzerland is really a great place for travelling . You should plan two different periods to visit sightseeing places , one in summer and the other one in winter .
Famous sightseeing places are really different during winter and summer .
If you decide to base yourself in Geneva , I suggest you first visit the north of Switzerland from the west to the east and then the south of Switzerland from the east to the west .
Switzerland is a small country , so take your time and spend enough time in each place .
Concerning your inquiry about working in my country , it 's really difficult to get authorisation to work , especially for periods longer than a week .
Therefore , I suggest you work during your travelling time .
For instance , if you plan to stay more than one week in Zermat in Wallis , think about trying to find a place where you could help in a restaurant or a shop .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
There was no anger in her voice , but amusement and something else that Peter could not distinguish .
The silence that followed her words was oppressive .
Travelling by car gives you independence .
Those are great advantages everyone can see .
It could seem to point towards public transport , nevertheless it will push car travel even further .
There will be no more greenhouse gasses , you can forget about escalating gas prices and , finally , you will not remember air pollution .
Computers and smartphones are becoming more prominent in our lives .
We need to embrace the advances of technology and we will be free of those terrible experiences .
I enjoy watching soap operas on TV and the best one for me is EastEnders .
This TV series is mainly based on working - class people and represents various ethnic minority communities , including African and Asian Muslims .
This show is particularly good , as it represents how people from different ethnic backgrounds can engage with each other .
It shows that ethnic minority people can integrate with the majority Caucasian people without losing their cultural and traditional values .
In addition , it provides an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to peep into the culture and traditions of British people .
Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters , it also shows the importance of family values . I would definitely recommend this drama series to other people .
It is important to gain awareness about different cultures due to the fact that Britain is becoming such a multicultural society .
However , what is the best means of transportation to see the world for yourself ?
First , to travel by boat is a very relaxing and carefree experience , compared to being confined to a very narrow and limited little space on the seat of a plane .
Second , people on boats are granted the opportunity to see beautiful ocean wildlife , while taking a plane does n't provide this luxury to take a look at the birds in the sky because planes travel at such a high speed .
Third , when it comes to travel , what really matters is not your destination .
From my perspective , it is the process that is more valuable .
Therefore , I would choose to lengthen the process of travelling , and a comfortable voyage on the sea would certainly become my first choice , since it guarantees a long and pleasant travelling experience .
I work in Café Noir , a well - known restaurant , popular with visitors in the centre of town .
Firstly , I do not understand why this is being implemented so quickly and why there has been no discussion - there is no time for anyone to feel comfortable with the idea .
Secondly , it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars and restaurants - such an idea is completely unworkable .
To support my argument against this proposal , I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town .
It was unsuccessful , and the politicians had to reverse their decision .
A non - smoking policy was introduced by some restaurants ; the consequences were terrible : a large number of their customers vanished .
In my opinion , introducing specific non - smoking areas in this type of establishment could be an excellent idea .
I can speak English and , of course , German - and because my grandparents are from Korea , a little Korean , too .
I am the only grandchild that ca n't speak Korean properly because I grew up in Bavaria and not in NRW , but they taught me to cook .
The good thing is : the rest of the time , living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets .
My other big hobby is travelling .
I am writing in response to your advertisement in a magazine .
I am a 23-year - old student doing a Sports Science degree , so I am interested in sports .
I have experience of children 's Summer camps and I recently attended a First Aid course , so I could deal with a difficult situation .
I am a native speaker of Spanish and I have passed the First Certificate exam of Cambridge , so my English level is quite good .
In addition , I speak a little French .
I have no problem with being hired for three months because I do not go to university in the summer .
You will find attached two references written by the two directors of the camps where I have worked .
You could ask them about me and they would answer you immediately .
Yours faithfully ,
It involves many moral virtues , which makes football one of the best activities for teenagers .
This kind of action , when performed collectively , requires coordination of efforts and an ability to work together , two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world .
In times of escalators and cars , it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement , velocity and strength .
Finally , football involves relationships in moments of tension , and this is the natural context for virtues like justice , courage and honesty .
In fact , it can be argued that the human virtues are a by - product of conflicts and fights ; that they are those character traits that we acknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition , be it for a trophy or for a country .
In a club , you will find professional advice and also as many people as are necessary for a match .
I have read your call for marketing professionals on your corporate website .
Having graduated from UCLMD in 2016 as an IT - based marketing communication professional with a focus on Business English , I could be a great asset to your company .
During my studies I doubled the conversion rate of a London - based hotel 's website , and improved the effectiveness of their e - mail campaign by 150% .
I did so by clearly outlining principles which proved to work with their target audience and they can keep using as a guide .
I have been volunteering for various similar projects .
You can find a list of these with my achievements in my CV .
I have been following your marketing activities , and I have a number of new , creative ways on my agenda . I could improve your brand image as part of your team .
I have a strong belief that being multilingual is essential for working in the financial industry and Mandarin is an important language for working in Asia - Pacific countries .
To further improve my Chinese , I enrolled for the Post - Intermediate Mandarin class during my undergraduate studies , in which I achieved a First - Class result .
Beyond my academic subjects , I have consistently taken up some active roles at university and outside school to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills .
I was trained as a PASS ( Peer Assisted Study Session ) leader for econometrics to provide some academic support to some younger students during my final year of study at Manchester .
I attended training sessions and workshops to learn about the skills to be a good facilitator before the start of the academic year .
The regular meetings with my group of students to discuss their questions on econometrics have developed my empathy , which is a crucial skill for being a leader .
In addition , I have undertaken an internship at HSBC Risk in order to gain an insight into the banking industry and learn how to work with my peers in a business environment .
I have gained a better understanding of the role credit risk plays in the full picture of banking operations .
To me , a vacation is a specific trip or journey for recreation or tourism .
At night , I expected to have a romantic French dinner at a posh restaurant .
But no , instead of sitting in a restaurant , my mum took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner .
In the following days , we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals .
As the day went on , I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea , go snorkeling or just lie on the beach .
And I would always have my meals at some luxurious restaurants .
There are always differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation .
When I finished high school , I started working as an accountant in my father 's carpentry business .
It took me 12 years to get the courage to quit because it was my family company and I felt really sorry , but I had to grow up and improve my professional skills , so I began to look for a new job .
My father was happy because it was a great opportunity and understood that it was what I 'd been dreaming of for a long time .
Five years have passed and I 'm still working for this company , which has given me a lot , and I 've been learning many things about accounting .
In fact , I am administrative manager and I feel really proud of myself .
I would love to be the person to organise and do all kinds of activities .
My name is Aly Meeuws . I am 16 years old . I live in The Netherlands at the moment and I am really planning on going to the USA in the future , so this would definitely be a great experience for me , especially for my English and being away from home .
Until next summer , I will still be in school but , hopefully , I will graduate so I can go to college afterwards .
Often , after school , I babysit my parents ' friends ' children and I usually really like it ! I am also a very athletic person , so I would not mind entertaining the children for a longer period of time and also doing some physical exercises .
Once , I cooked a Christmas dinner for me and my whole family and , surprisingly , everyone enjoyed it , which definitely came as a surprise to me !
There has never been a bigger force for change than technology . It changes absolutely everything about the way we live , even the way we talk with each other .
Despite the rise of social media , the idea of community has changed radically , because people are sharing interests everywhere on the planet .
Social Media such as Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and blogs illustrate clearly that the definition or influence of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are used and the social relations and associations that expand around them .
This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life , emphasizing the problems which have arisen from the use of Facebook and Twitter .
Finally , it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technology .
Social networking websites can be explained as a web utility that allows people to create a public or semi - public profile , arrange a list of other contacts with whom it is possible to share connections and look at and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include ( 1 ) creation of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes " .
One of the most popular social networking websites is Facebook .
Another rapidly expanding social networking tool is Twitter .
These kinds of websites allow people to interact with others directly via smartphones or computers .
Through Twitter , users post opinions or comments restricted to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebook , people can share pictures , videos and thoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not only for socialising but also for academic purposes , for example , to obtain benefits for their studies or to save time by discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some departments of police in the USA have used Facebook to share a video of a felony with the expectation of identifying the suspects , and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in response to the publication .
Additionally , a politician from Philadelphia , USA was elected after taking advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign .
My most memorable learning experience to date was my marriage .
My ex - husband taught me not to get involved with some kinds of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment .
We discussed some sexist ideas that I do n't agree with about what society demands of people and I noticed a little sexism in him , but I was fine with that because that can happen . But due to my profession , he could n't be like that for so long , because I was in a man 's shoes .
He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point , he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it .
I also learned that it is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man 's mind , and depending on her , he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to help and be an honorable man or not , he is going to be a good and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A mother is absolutely fundamental and the basis for the man 's principles and beliefs .
Women do not know their importance for the future in their own homes .
Once upon a time there was a majestuous kingdom in England , surrounded by beautiful rivers , waterfalls and mountains .
Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously until one day , at the welcoming ball in honour of the little princess , a horrendous witch showed up and cursed the little princess named Sophie , who would die at the age of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save her .
As only a gentleman would do , he apologised and introduced himself to the Princess :
Sophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that , with time , became more than just a friendship ; they fell in love with each other .
Princess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael , until one day , when she was just about to meet Michael to confess to him all the truth about who she really was , a guard discovered her and the King commanded him to lock her up in her room .
Michael was disappointed because he thought that Princes Sophie did n't love him anymore .
I believe that saying that there is no future for public transport given that travelling by car is so much more convenient , is premature . We need to consider a lot of factors before we can make a judgement of this kind .
Various announcements over radio and TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save the environment .
There are family problems , football madness , romantic obsessions and mental illnesses .
The plot is about a young man ( Bradley Cooper ) who has just been discharged from a psychiatric hospital and has moved to his parents home .
He was accused of mistreating his wife and that is the reason why they had been separated for the last eight months .
She has a turbulent and complicated past .
They meet by chance and start a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find the way to help each other and , not surprisingly , in the end they fall in love .
I personally think that the film shows an interesting view of psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problem .
Introduction
It gives information about their tastes in music , TV programmes and clothes .
So , naturally , about half of the teenagers and young adults prefer rock and roll , hard rock and progressive rock to other genres .
They enjoy both local bands ' output and some foreign songs .
About one third of the rest would claim they listen mainly to pop folk , whereas the rest would be interested in R&B , soul and jazz .
Television
Although not many young people like spending their free time watching TV , I believe that some patterns of preference can still be recognized .
Conclusion
This information could help the organizers of next year 's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes .
The house is already equipped with everything you might need and furniture so all you need to do is pack up your things and move !
I would like to express my total dissatisfaction with your latest measures .
Furthermore , you will increase the course fee by 15% from next month .
In the future , you do not provide the Japanese course at a convenient time .
I would appreciate it if you took these possibilities into consideration .
Yours faithfully
The movie is set in the United States around the 1990 's , so we could say the film is technically modern , though I 'm sure that in some years it will be considered a classic .
So she decides to take him to a child psychologist .
The boy soon becomes friends with the psychologist , and he starts noticing plenty of things about this exceptional boy .
I 'm not normally keen on thrillers , but this is definitely a must watch .
The boy 's acting is really something , such a thing that his acting earned him a nomination for the Academy Awards .
We regularly organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film .
Many students gain a great deal from our activities .
For example , with every film seen , our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions , particularly as we always have discussions around a subject related to the film .
Also , our monthly speakers are excellent . For example , last year we invited a well - known actress , Janet Hewitt , to share some of her experience on Broadway .
Unfortunately , organising these kinds of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough .
The fact that everyone from the community can participate in our events helps us to develop a positive relationship between the college and the community .
What 's more , shopping is almost always unenjoyable .
Especially when it comes to going shopping .
Afterwards , the crowd of people is ramming me when I 'm trying to walk .
My eyes instantaneously start to hurt .
I hate them wholeheartedly .
1 . The author compares Easter to a pagan spring festival , because they are associated with happiness .
The way Easter and , specifically , Good Friday are celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content .
People do n't want to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of the Easter celebration , so , to Easter Sunday .
According to the author , people " flinch from consideration of Good Friday " due to three taboos connected with this day : self - sacrifice , suffering and death .
The way self - sacrifice is seen has changed enormously - we no longer want to sacrifice ourselves , because it 's unpopular and it is in contradiction with the idea of consumerism .
What is more , we are becoming indifferent to other people 's suffering and that 's why we are n't willing to think about it , even on Good Friday .
Suffering , as well as death , is pushed away from our real life - we do n't want to experience them , but would rather watch them on different kinds of TV shows .
In a consumer lifestyle , we want more and more for ourselves , but not for other people , because it will require self - sacrifice .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
It was a hot summer 's day , everyone was walking to their usual destination ; work , school , to buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes from the cleaners . Everyone except Peter .
Peter smiled for a brief moment as he remembered his obsession with Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity . He thought , " finally I understand it " .
Nowadays , it is hard for many young people to do physical exercise frequently .
It is a well - known fact that sometimes they prefer watching TV on the sofa or playing computer games comfortably to doing physical activities .
There can be no doubt that technology should be a tool to motivate young people .
It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day , but while they are doing this , they are sitting on a comfortable sofa .
It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports , like football or basketball .
To sum up , it is important to motivate young people to do physical exercise .
School programmes and technology could be effective methods to achieve this goal .
It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because , in this way , they do their favourite sport in a routine way .
Back in the time , when I successfully passed third grade , my parents decided to let me pick the present that I wanted as a reward .
I realized that this is what I was looking for ; a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates , but this time it was aggressive skates .
When I started aggressive skating , I had to learn how to balance my weight using heavy two - wheel inline skates .
Once , on a weekend , it was my last year in middle school , I was at the park practicing as usual .
I introduced myself , and as I thought , they were visiting from a different city .
The more we got deep into conversation , the more I wanted to learn this type of skating .
They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm . I was surprised , I had mixed feelings , and it was indescribable .
In a short time , I became so good , and some of my friends changed from aggressive to slalom skating just by seeing me practicing .
After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks , to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing , and to try to reach perfection , I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport .
When I stopped looking for enthusiasm , fun , and excitement and started trying to fulfill my heart , brain , and body 's desires by skating , I knew for sure skating is not just a sport or a hobby .
About one year ago , I moved to Philadelphia , United States .
Unlike in my country , Philadelphia is always rainy , wet , and sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle . It was impossible to skate in these conditions .
A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot , and for me , everything is worth trying just to be able to skate again .
Singapore could be the place where you will find everything you are looking for .
If you are looking for any luxury brands and an extravagant shopping experience , this is the right place .
Vivo city in Harbourfront and shopping street on Orchard Road are good if you want to buy anything from mid - range to high - end goods .
Both places are extremely crowded with people on the weekend , so unless you enjoy people watching , early - bird shopping is highly recommended .
A variety of selections from different brands are available .
Icebreakers
Even if you meet him for the first time , his smile can make you feel comfortable . " My friend replied , " Yes , I may feel comfortable around him .
Advertising is a form of communication that is used to influence and persuade consumers to buy products , services , ideas .
Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation of consumers ' behavior in a commercial aspect .
But at the same time , advertising has many features in common with art .
Firstly , art is the expression of human creative skills and imagination , typically in a visual form .
And advertising is a combination of sounds , images and words .
To be successful , advertising often uses images from popular movies , catchy melodies , unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings .
Often , people who are watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before .
Therefore , advertising successfully combines other types of art to influence the subconscious and human behavior .
Secondly , art , like advertising , is such a large part of our everyday lives .
Art is something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing to people 's eyes .
Hoardings and billboards , which are a part of the urban landscape , are art .
Visual advertising like painting , uses color , value , space and line .
Also , it uses balance , contrast , emphasis and proportion .
These are principles of design .
Lastly , advertising , like art , originated a long time ago .
Commercial advertising can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece .
There were posters for entertainment , small ads for businesses , merchants used town criers , paying for events .
With the development of mass media , television and internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication .
Now , advertising is a big part of modern culture .
Advertising shares similarities with art and often combines other types of art to be more successful .
Advertising is creative combinations of sounds , images and words .
Modern technologies and the development of mass media , have allowed advertising to become the greatest art of the 20th century .
Michael got out of bed on the wrong side that day or , at least , that 's what he thought when , on his way to work , he was so concentrated on looking down at his mobile phone that he did n't see a woman approaching him and they both collided .
She was around fifty years old and rather unattractive although smartly dressed .
Michael then remembered how he had overslept that morning , how he did n't have time to have breakfast , how he did n't have any clean shirt ready and had to wear the new one that he was keeping for a special occasion and he blamed that woman for it all .
The new human resources manager had arrived and wanted to meet every worker in the company personally .
In this article a teacher reflects on his experiences of creating plays and using them to help motivate students to develop their English .
It consists of eight parts : Introduction ; How to start ; Writing the play ; I want to be Cinderella ; Practise ; The big night ; Reason for putting on a play and A few final thoughts .
The first thing you need to start with is a deadline to get everything done by .
Writing the play : first , you can ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters ; second , learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story .
Then you should take a decision about choosing roles : start by asking for volunteers , and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do .
It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate their different skills in the language classroom .
In a world of increasing environmental awareness , improved public transport represents the way of the future .
Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles , in my opinion , they might choose public transport if it fulfilled certain conditions .
These conditions fall into three broad categories : attitudinal , financial and logistical .
From an attitudinal perspective , people must first be convinced of the benefits of public transportation .
An educational or public relations campaign must be launched to sensitize those who might have disregarded this possibility before .
People should be familiarized with the environmental , social and personal benefits for present and future generations .
From a financial perspective , public transportation must be a clear and viable benefit to consumers .
In other words , it must be more affordable than driving to work every day .
For example , if people know that by using buses and subway , they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year , many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way .
From a logistical perspective , public transportation should be convenient for commuters .
City planners and transport officials must ensure that frequent and reliable public transportation is available for each citizen .
For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway , they must know that they will be able to get to various places on time .
Transport vehicles must be well maintained , subway and bus drivers should be customer - oriented and service must be punctual and efficient .
This is an additional important step .
In conclusion , through a multi - pronged approach , it is possible to increase the use of public transportation .
City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilizing these forms of transport themselves and bringing about change through personal example .
Then , more citizens will follow suit and we may all hope to live in a cleaner , less polluted environment .

Yours faithfully ,
You can ride at your own pace and go increasingly far .
It makes you see the road and your environment differently .
Furthermore , it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of driving a car because cycling does n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicycle , you first need to check if your bike complies with the safety regulations .
For instance , you need good brakes , lights , a bell and reflective stripes on your wheels or reflectors .
Indeed , some places still need to improve the structures for bikes : sometimes they do n't have a lot of cycle paths .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the traffic while remaining polite with others , there is no reason to be afraid .
Unfortunately , I did n't have time to answer .
You wrote that you are interested to know something about the concert I helped organize .
It was a great experience .
During the concert , I was responsible for checking tickets .
It was fantastic to take part in that enterprise .
I met those boys the next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the initiation test .
I felt extremely nervous , I was about to commit a crime and my heart was beating uncontrollably , really fast .
" Dear me ! How can you be so cheeky ? " he uttered dismissively , tapping his feet .
And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of event .
I think that horse races are a fun entertainment if you like one of these three things : animals , betting and fashion .
And if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot , you may run into the Queen and greet her , and at the same time enjoy the fabulous sight of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear .
But you can also have a " horrible " day at the races : if you 're not savvy enough to know the differences between the bets , you can end up skint , penniless .
Anyway , if you knew beforehand your odds of winning , it would n't be so thrilling .
thanks for the letter which has just arrived . I 've read that you 're writing a term paper on the chances of developing countries to profit from the electronic revolution , are n't you ?
I think I 've some useful information for you .
The article was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries .
I hope I have helped you with this information .
Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .
However , there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium .
First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay connected " all the time . Chatting with your friends , staying informed of the latest news , ordering online , etc - you can do all these things simultaneously , wherever and whenever you want .
This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they no longer need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore , mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance , as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way .
Last but not least , the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently .
Finally , the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life .
However , I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsibly , according to one 's personal needs .
I recently saw a film called Passengers .
It 's about 2000 people that want to go to a new planet to start a new life and their trip was going to take approximately 120 years .
Before the trip started , the company who decided to make this trip said that everything was perfectly calculated so that it was impossible to have any kind of problem with the spacecraft .
She discovered that she did n't have any problem with the cabin , it was Mark who hacked it .
It was such a hot summer that it was impossible to turn off the ventilator and I was a bored child with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network , Tuenti , and I liked passing all the time chatting .
I knew it was the beginning of a great friendship .
Louis was convinced that this new project would be an incredible opportunity for him to try new things and study different fields , which he enjoyed . He loved to read about science , inventions , and keep up - to - date with the news .
But he immediately thought - why not continue doing what I love while I do something new ?
He sent an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situation and sudden interest in this project .
The company immediately replied telling him that they were sorry that they did n't reply days earlier , but they could n't , since the system crashed and did n't allow them to send electronic mail , just to receive it .
They said that it was alright if he was interested in other projects , but he still needed to give the same working performance .
Louis told them that it was related to an instrument to explore new places .
He did trust the company , but not enough for them to know everything he thought .
The company told Louis that they did n't want to bother him , but that they were interested in investing in this kind of project , because it was related to the purpose of the company : exploring .
But Louis knew that the invention needed to have a great design that implemented portability , that is why he needed to refine his ideas for this project to be used in a large number of useful ways .
The company told Louis that they wanted to invest in this project and help Louis .
While he was exploring the bottom of the sea , he tried to grab a rock , but just when he touched it , it scattered into dust , which vanished in the bulk quantity of water around him . That was when he knew the next important thing that the invention needed to have : resistance .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to outline actions taken by the authorities of Mińsk Mazowiecki in the sphere of preserving the environment .
The local government of Mińsk Mazowiecki has recently implemented new laws which concern rubbish segregation .
It is obligatory for the inhabitants to put their different types of garbage into separate bins .
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some cases , they are completely neglected .
However , people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedience .
As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment , it is the local government 's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people 's actions .
Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed at short distances apart since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground .
One of the most challenging issues in modern cities is transportation .
Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes , underground , public transport , and cars .
Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option for transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing pollution .
A bus or an underground train can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time .
When referring to cars , we can considerably reduce the number of vehicles on the streets if we use public transport .
If a person constantly uses his / her car , he / she will need to pay for more petrol .
Equally importantly , a car requires maintenance and it will be another expense that the owner has to cover .
Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution will considerably increase , affecting air conditions .
It had four red wooden legs and it looked very comfortable indeed .
I immediately sat down and began to feel relaxed .
It swerved , beautifully avoiding a tree , and landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
As soon as I reached there the chair disappeared and I landed on the floor with a thump !
Today we had a class discussion about taking one year off between leaving school and starting university .
Taking a year off might help people who are uncertain about what to do next to make up their minds while trying new things and having new experiences that will be useful later in their lives .
It would certainly be counterproductive and a waste of time if the time is spent doing nothing and just passing the time as if it were a long vacation , but if it is used to have new experiences , a year off can change the future of a person .
It can be a great opportunity to travel , meet new cultures and people , or it can be a chance to work to save up money to be able to afford the cost of the university a person planned on attending .
Personally , I would love to take one year off , and I think I would spend it travelling around Europe .
Sales promotion , which is the set of marketing activities undertaken to boost sales of a product or service , has become a vital tool for marketing and its importance has been increasing significantly over the years .
In spite of some controversies , sales promotion has already demonstrated a massive positive impact on both sellers and buyers .
The aim of this presentation will be to analyse the aims and approaches of sales promotion as well as to evaluate both the benefits and the drawbacks sales promotions provide .
For this purpose , the presentation will be divided into four sections .
The first section will show the definition of sales promotion as an introduction .
The second part will provide the aim of sales promotion as well as the analysis of some key sales promotion techniques in detail .
Then the presentation will focus on a specific case study------the utilization of Flybuys loyalty reward program .
Finally , there will be an evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages as well as the present situation .
I am writing in order to apply for the position of volunteer in a summer camp in the USA as written in the advertisement .
I am currently taking exams for my English degree at the Ukraine National University .
What is more , I am quite good at sports , especially at football , basketball and tennis .
I consider myself to be a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person .
I would be grateful if you could tell me what sports and evening activities I would have to organise .
Please be informed that I am available for an interview at your convenience , so do not hesitate to contact me .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm studying a degree in Biotechnology at IQS , here in Barcelona .
I 'm a very extroverted guy , with experience taking care of children , as I 've been working as a skiing trainer for 2 years now . This winter will be the third .
I know how to treat children and how to make them have fun , something that would help me to organise activities and events for them .
I 'm also very self - confident and independent , as I live alone , which has made me a very good cook .
With any new course , there are certain expectations one will have .
At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious to create a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
Eight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
Before taking part in this course , my concept of mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to manufacture , durable and financially reliable .
My thoughts about mechanical design matched somewhat with the information that was provided in the first three weeks .
By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept of mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design are purely just creating new products .
I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products .
It can be seen in many aspects , ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system , to creating the whole new product .
This is because , despite having experience in industrial design , I never took part in the design process from the initial stage .
Therefore , my knowledge of mechanical design is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water on producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
The first thing I noticed was the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
This was demonstrated during the project Introductions session as well as the lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and attract the attention of other group members .
However , this is also an opportunity to meet up and work every week with people for whom English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
Because in order to deliver a successful industry project , I not only have to make a good product , but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers .
The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is a point that I have never considered before in a design process .
This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance , keep pace with the group and not to be left behind .
To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectations for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , and to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skills .
Last but not least , I hope I can learn to work effectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team leader by the end of this course .

In addition , the car is one of the means most used , not only for its speed , but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
In recent years , many regions of the world have faced an issue with water scarcity that may affect their development , especially for those countries suffering from poverty .
Due to the increasing population of the world , countries are likely to need more fresh water to irrigate crops to satisfy their population .
This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable solutions .
It will examine responses including the recycling of water , the development of technology for purifying ocean water and multinational sharing of water resources .
Recycling waste water is an effective method to solve the water scarcity problem .
This is because there is a huge level of water use in people 's daily lives , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
Thus , states should make it possible to purify waste water to a satisfactory safety level .
In addition , developing the latest technology in purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
As is well known , about 70 per cent of the earth 's surface is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean , like Australia , makes the most of the ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water needs .
Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money in upgrading technology instead of other fields such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect inhabitants ' physical health and promote their standard of living .
Sharing different water resources with neighbouring countries can be another strategy which can help to alleviate the problem of water scarcity .
Countries with abundant resources can give assistance to nations with water scarcity .
Although over - shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension , few countries have suffered these problems .
In conclusion , water shortage has presented a challenge to individual lives and the global environment .
This essay has discussed three alleviation strategies with the potential to resolve the problem of water scarcity , including the use of recycled water and ocean water and international aid .
While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially , they might have a positive impact on water shortage in the long term .
You may not have ever thought about it , but you ///would///could///might/// be able to jump from a plane if you wanted .
If you ask me why I enjoy my favourite sport so much , I would n't hesitate to answer .
First of all , the best thing about skydiving is the excitement and the rush of adrenalin .
Additionally , you imagine just the moment before the jump .
When you are sitting in the plane next to your instructor , with your legs hanging and your arms crossed … It makes an indescribable impression on you .
I 'm sure you will agree that it could be one of your best experiences if you pay attention to your instructor all the time .
Nowadays we watch the perfection of actors all over the world .
The range of techniques they use to strike the audience is colossal .
Facial expression is said to be more important for film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in stage acting .
It is evident that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use while acting .
The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing work and special effects .
But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors .
Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body language as much as film actors .
And controlling your voice is also important for film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors , that is keeping your vocal expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate the emotions and feelings of their character .
The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes these acting performances perfect .
I would say , it does n't matter whether you are performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timbre of voice as if you 're acting your main character , embody all their traits and features appropriately to the situation .
In other words , no matter what kind of performance it is , the only thing that matters is using all your abilities to model yourself on your hero , get the feel of their role .
I live in Moscow , the capital of the Russian Federation .
Furthermore , people actively use private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters and bicycles .
Tourists can encounter difficulties such as a traffic jam .
There are some disadvantages to banning cars .
In my view , the best solution to all problems would be the limiting of private transport in the centre , but not absolute banning .
Recently I read two articles , they were called ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ( Zimmerman , 2014 ) ' and ' Innovative ' Intervention helps babies at high risk of autism ( Geggel & Writer , 2015 ) ' .
However the first article was more motivating to read , because the author substantiated important suggestions .
All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention .
Firstly , the article ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' shows new research , in which it 's possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read .
In addition , using this identification may help parents , educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Most importantly , this early intervention can help many kids with dyslexia to overcome their educational failure .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on video - therapy which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
In my opinion , the findings need to be replicated in larger studies before other people turn to video - based therapy as a potential treatment .
What I can tell from this text is that the research is an innovative idea , but needs more attention to improve their success .
All in all , if you want to read about effective research with very strong proposals , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' .
Tom had joined a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital and this was his first day .
He was assigned to a task in the rehabilitation center .
He would deal with temporarily disabled people who came for a rehabilitation session every other day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people 's experience and perception of their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center .
The ultimate aim was to get feedback for service - improvement purposes .
He started with a group of six who signed a consent to participate in the focus group .
He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity would not be revealed .
He started with some jokes so that they would feel at ease and disclose their experiences .
In the afternoon , he analyzed the content and wrote a report with some recommendations for achieving patients ' satisfaction .
We all know the situation , when we are in the supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same , but one of them costs much more than the other .
Most people associate branded products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no - name products are just cheap and without any quality and poor taste .
As a result , we can say it is not always justified that branded products are more expensive than other comparable ones .
The effect of the media on people is clearly noticeable here .
A product which everybody is talking about and which is advertised a lot is automatically considered to be good .
In some cases , it may be true that branded products are better than no - names . For example technology products , but products like Red Bull or others like that , are definitely not always better .
Here it is said , try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust advertisements .
We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition , and we had been looking forward to our trip for months .
But , unfortunately , we had forgotten to get a passport for our son , so Pedro could n't fly .
First of all , I 'm really happy you accepted my invitation .
You 'll need to take the underground from the airport to the central train station .
The underground is in the airport and it 's very easy to get to because you just have to follow the signs .
Otherwise , the place would turn into a mess , especially crowded places .
Actually , it is time saving because everyone eventually does what he wants without wasting time pushing other people .
Also , that makes them do their jobs efficiently .
Being crowded in front of the employee makes people uncomfortable .
First , they would n't have privacy because there would be many people surrounding the one dealing with the employee .
In conclusion , people will do what they want smoothly and politely if they wait patiently in queues .
I 'm Sara and I 'm a half Italian , half Spanish , seventeen - year - old girl with a really cheerful , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a website and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English , but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them . Actually , I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never had any experience of this kind before , but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who 's seven years old with whom I usually play a lot when I do n't have to study .
I 'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings up , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children .
I speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points out of 100 at both KET and PET .
First , I started a new job . It did not turn out the way I hoped unfortunately .
My colleagues are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them .
Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfunctional .
But the whole experience brought a positive surprise : working at the same school as Nora does is actually pretty nice .
While we might talk about our jobs a bit too much , I do n't think it is uncomfortable to work side by side .
I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network . Of these , the live roleplay looks promising .
Moving is always upsetting and there is a period of adjustment that is very stressful .
A thing I would miss is the connections I started forging with other people .
So in conclusion I would like to say : the future is unknown .
May I not live in interesting times .
Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , quiet , always on time and always the top of his class .
The summer that year had been exceptionally warm , and Michael had found himself wondering if there were better ways to spend it than preparing for his University entrance test .
The truth was that he had n't rested since his graduation day and he was starting to feel tired , but he also knew that he could n't afford to fail .
Suddenly , the doorbell rang , distracting him from his inner struggles , and he heard his Mother opening the door .
He stood up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at his book once again and finally went out of his room and said " Please Mom , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
By a broad definition , teachers are the people who teach you .
I think the best teacher is a person who has professional knowledge and good teaching skills .
In addition , the best teachers , by their teachings , are the people who we most agree with and appreciate .
Many parents may not satisfy all of these conditions .
First of all , for many parents to have professional knowledge or good teaching skills is very difficult .
Compared with professional teachers , they have specific teaching abilities .
However , not all parents have that kind of personality and most of them are confused or use the wrong ways to teach their children .
Parents undoubtedly play an important role in our life .
However , we may not be greatly influenced by their teachings , but by others ' teachings .
Because everyone has their own talents , values , and judgments , we learn more from those with whom we agree and who we appreciate and get significant influence from .
Although parents teach a lot of things in our life , because they do n't have professional training and we may not agree with them and learn more from them , I think parents are not the best teachers in our life .
PREPARING THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
If I could travel back in time , undoubtedly I 'd choose to take part in the French revolution .
The reason for my choice is simple and clear : the French revolution was the turning point in modern European history and , thanks to its achievements , people in the twenty - first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech , assembly , worship and , the most important one , freedom of thought .
It is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years after the revolution ) , but I 'm sure it was a gorgeous city , as it is nowadays .
I imagine its streets crowded with workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution .
They trust in them , and are willing to fight for the freedom , fraternity and solidarity they proclaim .
I also imagine aristocrats fleeing Paris at their earliest convenience , leaving all their expensive dresses and impressive houses unattended .
They are frightened by the social movement , and prefer to look for a safer shelter in the countryside .
But , if I could be there , I would n't waste my time walking down the streets or laughing at the ridiculous aristocrats .
I 'd try to meet the poor king Louis the sixteenth and his wife , Marie Antoinette .
I would do my best to make their imprisonment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty .
Because no revolution is worth more than a human life .

Thank you very much again for helping me get the tickets for the concert in London , but unfortunately I have bad news for you today .
Otherwise , I will be taken off the university register .
You do n't know how embarrassed I feel now , not only because you helped me to get the tickets ( and I can imagine how difficult it must have been ) , but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible .
Sorry again for all those circumstances !
I have been proving my abilities by overcoming strong competition since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion for persuasion and problem solving .
In 2002 , I was ranked 11th amongst 930 candidates competing for 40 places at the University Federal of Paraiba .
Throughout my undergraduate studies , my professional skills were recognized in internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State .
During this period , I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire court .
At the law office , I supervised the ISO 8003 procedures .
On the other hand , in recognition of my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Law with Great Honors in 2007 .
My bachelor thesis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimously awarded by the jury with the maximum score of 10 .
This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulation of trade , that conduces me to this LLM and the international business transactions domain .
Since my law school graduation , many achievements encouraged my professional development .
First , upon graduation , I immediately joined a highly recognized firm , performing the double role of legal consultant and sub - manager when I was only 22 years old .
In the same year , I passed the strenuous Brazilian bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work on internal and cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence demanded , I specialized in Economic Law on a master 's degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five , I enrolled for a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I developed a multidisciplinary research project applying economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly grasp the theoretical ascertainment for this career , which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences .
Thereby , new regulatory sources are created in response to the globalized legal context .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross - border transactions , given the increasing requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions .
Furthermore , I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in the international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher .
Henceforth , I aim to consolidate my career by mastering the legal responses to the developments shaping international trade today .
The LLM in International Business Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome desired .
Man has evolved over the years , from the invention of the wheel , to space craft expeditions .
Our species has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to solve , a problem that has been haunting us since time immemorial : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had been eradicated from America , but soon another problem grew up and took its place .
The movie " The Color Purple " displays a variety of situations for Afro - American people who suffered because of their skin color . This is known as racism , which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination of one race against another .
They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all . It was absolutely forbidden , and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs .
Afro - Americans were completely segregated . Caucasians found it impossible to live among them , and that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses were separated too .
Afro - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their opposition to the oppression they were suffering , and fighting to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in the Afro - American society were threatened in the most denigrating ways ; men were the undisputed authority in the house .
He decided to go and have dinner at a restaurant which was very near his office .
He walked briskly to the restaurant , and tried to be as happy as he could .
The restaurant was almost full .
He suddenly recognized someone , Molly .
Tom and Molly were classmates at secondary school .
She was calling the waiter , and unexpectedly saw Tom sitting at a table alone .
Public transport is more useful and better than travelling by car .
First of all , our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it , we should definitely stop using cars .
Although there are many other polluters , such as big industries , people should start with the easiest solutions .
Although many countries do not offer a good public transport service , once people get rid of cars , there will be more money for improvements .
For instance , Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples of this .
As more money is being invested in the infrastructure , people tend to use more bikes and public transport .
Unfortunately , not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages a car provides .
For example , it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than by bus because you can take breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious .
In conclusion , I think that public transport should win this battle .
The aforementioned representative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen prove how easy it can be to remove cars from our lives , and I believe that more cities should follow their examples .
About the task that you asked me to do . Unfortunately , I do n't have enough knowledge of LIMS yet .
I am just beginning to understand the way things are done here .
I understand that the new programme has some specific requisites related to preservation of analysed samples .
Nevertheless , all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from the wet chemistry laboratory and from the microbiology laboratory gave to me .
Of course , if you have any suggestions please tell me .
Suppose we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand for a particular analysis .
Our international supplier wo n't be able to deliver the reagents or other goods on time .
I think it is important to have a local supplier that can help us in particular situations like a stock failure .
International suppliers take at least a week to deliver an order .
Thank you for this conversation .

I agree with the fact that as soon as their life is not private anymore , famous people have to face journalists with a smile they do not have .
I mean by this that , for sure , there are some days on which these famous people are in a bit of a mood , they have to visit the doctor , or they have to solve mishaps with lawyers , and they have to put up with those journalists following them to the door or waiting for them stationed in front of their houses .
In these cases , journalists themselves should realize that they are taking it too far and that they should respect them a bit more .
The map shows changes that have taken place in the town of Eastminster since 1999 .
During this period , the town has seen extensive growth in residential areas and local amenities , and the modernisation of leisure facilities .
Parks in the north - east and south - east have been reduced to make way for larger housing estates , the one in the north dramatically increasing accommodation in Eastminister .
As well as woodland in the north - west being remodelled into an adventure park , a hotel and golf course have replaced a historic house and gardens in the centre of the town .
South of the river , an industrial area has been constructed next to the existing railway , while residential streets have been converted into more modern apartment blocks .
With increasing housing has come a bigger hospital and more shopping facilities , the existing shops being built on the site of the old school , with a new school opening on the north bank of the river .
I live in the Netherlands and at our school it 's the same .
as I see it , it is my job to clarify things and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening for approximately 90 per cent of their classes .
I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities where they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films .
For example , my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things in school saying : this door , that window , this is my teacher , that is a chair .
However , I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time - consuming .
Although the main reason that prevents me from using them is my colleagues .
I do n't see them doing activities , it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it .
For instance , when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4 , I feel incompetent .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activating pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results .
In other words , how can we convince school board and colleagues that it is better for pupils to learn in an active way ?
Yes , she should accept this offer .
Everything was looking perfect and it was something she enjoyed doing before the accident took place .
She felt butterflies in her stomach .
Thinking about it relieved him , made him feel excited about the unknown , the unexpected , maybe all the questions ever asked , maybe , finally , they would be answered .
This is an easy word to understand , but it hides more than the definition says .
Behind this word I see my brother , parents and grandparents and feel very warm feelings .
All people need these things and the best givers are family members because they give unconditionally .
My family members all the time express their warm feelings with hugs , kisses and beautiful words .
Nowadays , our environment is really affected by the great deal of progress that technology has made in the last century .
Let 's begin by considering the arguments in favour .
Fossil fuels are our most common energy source , even though they have a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere .
In addition , they produce nuclear waste , which is a major problem for the environment and public health .
All things considered , I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it does n't cause global warming although it is expensive to generate .
If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , then it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , then the consumer must use more of X. If you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle , because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
The book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction with her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
In my view , Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic , because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly , which is how economists think people act .
If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self - interested , she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning .
She must be irrational .

Hans Feurer has been a mainstay of fashion photography since the late 1960s .
The peak of his career was in the early 80s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's advertising campaign .
Feurer 's campaign for Kenzo was one of the most popular and it defined him as a successful photographer .
Hans Feurer was born in Switzerland in 1939 .
After studying art in Switzerland , he worked as a graphic designer , illustrator and artistic director in London .
Traces of his previous career are evident throughout his work in his careful compositions and precise styling .
In 1966 , Hans Feurer travelled to Africa , during which trip he decided to become a photographer .
More than 30 years ago , in the remote deserts of North America , Hans Feurer was given free to photograph Kenzo Takedo 's 1983 advertising campaign .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model , Iman , also began after this pioneering shoot .
These images became the subject of Feurer 's eponymous book , lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs , illustrating his five - decade - long career .
The book includes Feurer 's photographs for the 1974 Pirelli calendar , for Kodak and for fashion magazines such as Vogue Italia , Elle France and Nova .
Obviously , the weight is the resistance , which will help the individual to gain strength and mass .
The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk .
Each weightlifter gets three attempts at each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category .
Bodyweight categories are different for women and men .
A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an " incomplete " entry for the competition .
The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form .
Dickens 's style is full of sentimental realism : he describes reality with a sentimental tone and he mixes comedy and pathos .
Conversely , the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and a dark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes are considered , it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of Victorian society , with a wide range of characters and stories which reveal the conditions of children and the poor ; whereas the Brontes ' novels contain the Byronic hero , a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge , in the case of Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgiveness in the case of Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
In contrast with Dickens , the Bronte sisters deal with love and psychologically complex women as protagonists .
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR ENGLISH COURSE
NEW FACILITIES
However , there are some shortcomings that could be fixed .
Firstly , there is a great demand among our students for a computer room with broadband Internet connection .
Secondly , we are in need of a conference room .
Finally , it is also recommended to update the books in the library : most of them are quite old and outdated .
ACCOMMODATION
One surprising outcome from the survey was that students do not feel comfortable enough in the residential building .
There are also numerous complaints with regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen .
CONCLUSION
In case you need further information regarding any of these issues , please contact us and I will be glad to respond to you as soon as possible .
I 've read your letter and let me tell you that I 'm really sorry that things are not going well lately , especially because I know how much you enjoy sports and your music classes .
Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend on each of your activities , it could work out and you would n't need to drop any of them .
Organization is the key .
However , if you are still very stressed , then you should drop one of them . I certainly do n't know which one you should drop . I think I would drop the music lessons , because sports are good for your physical and mental health , and also help you to keep fit and it 's more interesting for me ; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you .
Environmental problems today are more worrisome , if we do not do something for our planet , in a few years we will suffer the consequences .
Simple things like recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using cars , not throwing garbage on the streets or into the oceans , can mean a considerable change , because if we add the small efforts of each of us , the results will be translated into millions of people .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No more blah blah blah , it 's time to save the world " , we may not have superpowers and not be " Superman , Ironman , Captain America , Batman , etc . " and we ca n't save the planet from intergalactic threat , but unlike them , all together , we can save the planet from an even greater threat : its total destruction due to pollution and environmental problems that we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to cause problems , we have to have the courage to do something to fix them . Let us become that superhero that changed the world and made a change for future generations to have a healthy environment to live in .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to suggest ways which will contribute to increasing the number of foreign learners in the school and to make recommendations for future improvements .
Town 's entertainment
Although my town is not an enormous industrial center , people are fascinated by the leisure activities provided here .
The variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients .
They would also enjoy our museums and galleries , which can bring them closer to our history and traditions .
New teaching approaches
More students would be attracted if the school governors made some changes to the learning system .
I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one - to - one lessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will also be beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject .
Array of facilities
Dissatisfaction with the school equipment is occasionally expressed by the students .
Therefore , it is necessary to provide new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learning would be a great idea to attract more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities , so that more work will be implemented .
Improvements to socialising opportunities
The school governors should offer more extra - curricular activities , including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most .
Recommendations
I would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students , making their accommodation in the town more pleasant .
I 've seen a couple of advertisements for English courses in our town , but they do n't seem very useful .
However , if you want to have a look at them , they are put up in the supermarket .
However much Roman law , Mosaic law , and rabbinical law impacted the lives of Jews living in first - century Israel , many people who followed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the borders of the Roman Empire .
At the same time , however , anyone professing to be a follower of the God of Israel would have adhered to the Ten Commandments .
The Ten Commandments provide Israel with the moral framework for maintaining it .
The metaphor the Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphere of international law , it is wrong to understand the commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obligations towards God . . .
Isreal 's obedience to commandments was not a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love .
I always go to have a pizza at a restaurant near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolitan restaurant that makes pizza and all the Neapolitan specialties , and all the types of fried ? .
It uses only fresh ingredients from Naples that are brought there every day .
The place is reminiscent of the atmosphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with pictures of the most famous Neapolitan people on the wall .
The owner , Patrizio , is really nice and you can often find him in the restaurant talking to some guest .
I think it could be suitable for my class because it has two rooms and one of them is always used for big groups of people , like us . The service is really fast and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful square where we can have a drink while watching the typical Neapolitan evening .
Some experts say that public transportation is a crucial part of the solution to the developed nations ' economic , energy , and environmental challenges , helping to bring a better quality of life .
In increasing numbers , people are using public transportation and local communities are expanding public transport services .
Every segment of society - individuals , families , communities , and businesses - benefits from public transportation .
But , in fact , the car provides much better mobility , both in the big cities and in the countryside .
Our daily life is thoroughly planned , from morning to night .
We must keep doing our day - to - day tasks at work and at home , and , at the same time , maintain our social life and entertainment activities .
Modern life orders our days and weeks in a packed schedule of activities : job , children , housework , fun , free time ...
We have to go quickly from one place to another , just to be in time to fulfil our next task or activity .
It 's because of that we need to improve our mobility and private transport , such as a car , allows us to achieve our goals more efficiently .
Public transport has its advantages : we can say that a lower cost , less pollution and more free time and rest for doing anything else during the trip could be public transport 's main positive points .
But , on the other hand , travelling by car gives us more comfort and saves time , and it offers a wider range of choices of departure points and routes .
Every day , science and industry are developing new materials , technologies and clean energy sources .
As industrial and technological development progresses , public transport will lose passengers and the use of private cars will spread everywhere around the world .
Do you suddenly lose confidence when you have to speak to someone ?
In class , answer as many questions as possible , and try to participate in class discussions .
My problem has always been vocabulary .
I find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words , and help me recycle words I know in new contexts .
I hope that you will find my suggestions useful .
This is a very common argument : true genius stands out so much that it can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized , then he is not a genius .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accepts the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that , in history , geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true , or at least , is not demonstrable .
They take for granted that , historically , geniuses have always been recognized , but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history , and therefore , can not be used as an opposite example .
To sum up , because the geniuses that we have decided to recognize as such have been recognized , they argue that all the geniuses are always recognized : pure self - referential nonsense .
For Lombroso , exceptional people are independent , away from the banality of life , isolated , impatient , asocial , often considered crazy .
The time at university is the most important time in our lives , because we learn a lot of things and it prepares us for our future career .
Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion between professor and student . Others may disagree .
They prefer classes with lectures and almost no discussion .
In my opinion , classes with discussion are better .
First , classes with discussion between professor and student have an advantage for the students because they learn how to interact with their fellow students .
Doubtless , such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things .
This will enrich your personality .
For instance , a year back , I was at North Texas university in the USA . There was a health management and policy class with almost no lectures but with a lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I thought this was a disadvantage but this was not true .
Consequently , he was able to tell us how the cost of treatment is less , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody has access to primary health care .
As you can see , open discussion in class is really important since it broadens your horizon and helps you to understand different nation s ' policies .
Second , open discussion in class helps you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker .
It is evident that independent speaking and thinking skills are valuable for your career .
However , this health management and policy class with open discussion was helpful for me insofar as I learned how to speak in front of others .
In order to get good grades , we are forced to participate in discussion .
This experience taught me that it is better to participate in a class with open discussion because it provides you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career .
All in all , though some may oppose my opinion , it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lectures are preferable because interaction with other students will broaden your mind and you become a better speaker and thinker .
That is why every university should offer such classes .
with reference to your job announcement , I am submitting my application for the vacancy at Green Pepper Cafe .
Your job description sounds to be a good fit for my search , since I am very experienced at serving guests and have a good knowledge of various kinds of foods .
My tasks included back office administration and serving in the hotel 's restaurant .
Being ranked in the Michelin guide , this restaurant provides more than 50 different dishes .
I love serving customers and dealing with different and complex situations .
Should you require further information , I will be happy to provide it .
Thank you for your time and consideration .
Well , all your suggestions sound good to me . However , I would probably choose climbing because not only is it an extreme sport , but it is also an exciting activity I would like to try .
By the time he arrived at the riverbank , some of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
Everybody was there : the Smiths , with their three broad - shouldered sons ; the Newtons , who even brought some of their stallions to help us remove the earth and the stones ; and the slim guy who lived in the farm in the northern hills of the valley and whose name nobody knew .
They worked all day long , without rest , until they were breathless and their hands were bleeding .
He gazed at it , a bit worried about the possibility of more rain during the night , but proud of having put the farm in shelter .
We human beings are highly socialized creatures in the world .
Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of society .
However , considering the complexity of society , I believe it is better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental life skills on which their progeny count .
Nevertheless , the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society .
For example , one of my senior high school classmates encountered a communication problem in his family .
As a consequence , they have never talked to each other since then .
If we have not lived and learned the skills in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled before entering society .
Society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turns to continuously influence every member .
Learning in schools , however , provides a valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , paves the way for being independent in the future .
Have you ever tried unsuccessfully more than 5 sports in only one month ?
The only disadvantage I could find is that golf is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a lot of expense and also good mental and psychological health , which is the first thing I recommend you to work on if you want to enjoy golf from the beginning .
However , as long as you can afford it and you 're provided with patience and enthusiasm , you should n't miss the opportunity to play this amazing sport .
It slowly rustles and clatters and its pulsing waves attract so much that you ca n't stand sitting still much longer and you are ready to throw up everything and run towards it .
However , at the last moment , you understand that the ocean is there , in eternally beloved Spain .
I had been adoring the sea and dreaming about it when I had never seen it before , never heard it before , but definitely felt it not with my skin but with my heart .
Also , I remember the sweet perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of the old town and mixing with the smell of fried fish that is ready to be served in numerous bars , cafes and restaurants .
I remember children , running about the small squares in front of the cathedrals ; elderly people in wheelchairs ...
All these memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my eyes , everything in my mind and heart is too vivid to forget .
A language is the great thing to learn because it is the way people communicate and organize their thoughts .
Furthermore , it gives you the chance to enjoy works written in that language .
That 's an incredible opportunity .
Nevertheless , when you are learning a language , it brings confusion .
On the other hand , the new language needs an additional effort .
There is an incredible amount of things to learn .
In summary , learning a language is something beautiful , useful and entertaining .

But sometimes the pace of change , the direction of change or the consequences of change can make it no good at all .
No change ; no life . Nature is life and death , construction and destruction .
To stop the change is impossible . That would be against nature and against ourselves .
The smallest work changes the environment .
Everything that does n't grow is dead , and death is the opposite of life .
Think of the Olympic Champion Nadia Comaneci , artificially stopped in her physical development to preserve her graceful childish body .
It is equally cruel , in my opinion , to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave like femmes fatales in video - clips or on magazine covers .
Nature is also change , but in a cyclical direction , and with a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days and nights , the sequence of seasons … , in short , the wheel of life .
We live in a time of accelerated changes .
Technology allows us to do and learn in one lifetime more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations .
I think we should readjust the rhythm of change in order to be able to reinterpret , in a positive sense , Lampedusa words " everything must change so that everything can stay the same " .
It helps to cope with stressful situations .
But some people can get annoyed by this kind of activity . They may be irritated by loud music in the shopping areas , long queues at the cash desk , and crowds of customers everywhere .
Some people can be called shopaholics , as they ca n't live without new clothes and furniture .
I do n't belong to any of these groups , because I am not addicted to shopping , but I do love the process of choosing clothes , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping with my father as he is always advising me to buy stupid stuff .
My name is Alex Yegorov and I am writing to request information about qualification requirements for obtaining a skills assessment in order to submit my Expression of Interest to SkillSelect .
I would appreciate it if you could send me the necessary applications forms and associated information relating to the assessment .
It would be appreciated if you could provide assessment procedures , time frames and charges as well .
I graduated from University with a specialisation in Fiber - optic Transmission Systems .
Would Telecommunications Engineer ( 263311 ) be the right occupation for me ?
Also , may I have information on which version of the IELTS exam I should take ; the Academic or the General Version ?
Yours faithfully ,
The European Union was created and is meant to be an organization that helps all of its members to develop economically and socially while contributing to the common good of the whole union itself .
All current 27 nations must work both individually and together for the best conditions of immigrants .
There should be a working network for providing suitable jobs and standards of living for those , of course , who are looking to work and contribute to society , and do not simply expect to lay on the back of more economically developed countries .
Many non - EU citizens live and work in Europe , but for this to be successful they have to be able to integrate into their receiving society .
They should be able to enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as EU citizens .
Europe needs bright young people with an urge , with a wish to be productive , to create a better future for themselves and for their children .
Migration brings all the cultural wealth and diversity in Europe and integration is an expression of civic cohesion , contributing to political stability .
" The taste of my blood was completely different from the Sacred Blood " .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , the priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years old , realized that the wine drunk at the moment of communion is not the true blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whole life .
Inocencio , surprised by this discovery , asked his colleagues in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood . Incredibly , after a needlestick in their fingers , all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted into holy blood at the church .
At that time , the Order sent to the Vatican an urgent message and called the press to make an announcement of the discovery .
At this press conference , Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit .
I 'm pleased to hear from you again ! I have to say that you should write in your work that the traditional Portuguese food is delicious !
Usually my eating habits are similar to most Portuguese ; I have my breakfast between around 7.30 and 8.00 . I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals .
What is my favourite Portuguese meal ?
As a consequence , he had no money to pay for a sod , so he was thirsty all morning .
It is one of the most significant places in our capital , Moscow .
Then , this is the spot where all - nation celebrations take place , like civil and military parades or seeing the New Year in !
If you visit my country one day , I will certainly be pleased to show you Red Square and everything I 've told you about .
I was researching some definitions of cultural literacy .
It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what cultural literacy is .
Cultural literacy is the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture .
Cultural literacy is knowing about and respecting the cultures of others .
In order to be culturally literate , you need to be familiar with all manner of things , from Waterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Bath , the Magna Carta , Tutankhamen , the Pythagorean Theorem and 1066 .
To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely achievable .
A literate reader knows the object - language 's alphabet , grammar , and a sufficient set of vocabulary ; a culturally literate person knows a given culture 's signs and symbols , including its language , particular dialectic , stories , entertainment , idioms , idiosyncrasies , and so on .
The culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency , while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally - conditioned allusions , references to past events , idiomatic expressions , jokes , names , places , etc .
According to UNESCO , literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing population growth , achieving gender equality and achieving sustainable development , peace and democracy .
My personal opinion is that cultural literacy is the way to understand , learn and know about other cultures .
Also , you can be understood by other cultures .
The age between 13 and 19 is the revolutionary one .
I share this opinion with the revolutionary ones .
As a result , we often communicate and we do not exchange opinions as much as other families do . I do not consider them to be my best friends because I can not speak with them as freely as with my friends .
I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet , both in the number of viewers and the number of players .
There is probably an array of reasons to explain such a phenomenon , but for me , that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can keep possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and prevent it from becoming stalled .
A curious fact is that , out of the five most popular sports in the world , only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that 's exactly what sets it apart from the others .
The bottom line is ; a fast - paced game is a much more exciting experience for players and viewers than a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to become a good basketball player , the two most important things to understand ( as it is for most sports in general ) are the values of practice and awareness .
Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desirable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations , and the combination of the two is the only way to success . So if you want to be a good player , you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and survey the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you .
Although several causes of this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society , this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people .
One of the reasons for the worsening of the health of young people is the increasing use of cars .
Nowadays , parents take their children everywhere by car , whereas they would have to go everywhere by bike or by foot twenty years ago .
This is a result of the decreasing price of cars due to innovation in the car industry , which enabled more and more people to buy a car ( and use it ) .
However , possibilities to make young people healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation .
For example , commercials can be used to encourage youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects .
In conclusion , I feel that not only the reason for the low level of fitness of today 's youth , but also the clue to getting youngsters fitter , lies in modernity .
Good thrillers have become increasingly rare in the last few years , and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable plots , are full of cliches and , since it 's so easy to figure out how they will end , they are usually very boring .
The story is set in the future , about thirty years from now , when time travel has been invented but is used only by criminal organizations who send those they want killed into the past , where a professional killer , a looper , is waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body .
By letting his older self go , Joe changes his past , and therefore his future , leading to a series of unexpected events , and to an even more unexpected ending !
My expectations were not very high , but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good . In fact , it was not boring at all , and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise .
Time travelling is only a means to the development of the story , and the future society is quite similar to the present one , so even if you are not big science fiction fans , I suggest you give this movie a chance . I am sure you wo n't be disappointed .
In the competitive world that we inhabit , mastering a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success .
We 've reached a point where this training starts at an early age in the form of extracurricular activities , such as music classes , learning languages and playing sports .
The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring causes parents to invest in their children so as to prepare them for an unpredictable future .
The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless of the fact that it may compromise their children 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most widespread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply are n't .
This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in early infancy , as though this capability could be a celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow up as child prodigy .
The adherents of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own belief in their child 's potential to become a famous genius .
Little known is what the role played by music was in his life and what his relationship with it was prior to his first deed .
Admittedly , I do n't know this myself .
Anyone who challenges the aforementioned common - sense is n't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common , but still popular and not scientific , concurrent idea .
The " 10,000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific basis , in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that established it .
This amount of time does n't fit normal workers ' and students ' tight schedules and busy daily lives , therefore being labeled as impractical and unachievable .
The normal response to this conclusion is , like I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you do n't have this time available , is the loss of motivation .
The main problem of having these two perspectives on talent is that both of them are basically negative .
One asserts that talent is a matter of luck ; the second , of pure time - consuming and presumably expensive dedication .
Like any other unscientific " truth " that circulates and causes harm to our society , this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised publications on the topic , so that the effective ways of becoming talented at something can be adopted , before the popular beliefs take our motivation and self - belief away .
This research project will provide us with a better understanding and insights into this area through the EM trainees ' narratives and experiences of clinical reasoning development in ED and add to the scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
As discussed , clinical reasoning is still poorly understood and a variety of ways of articulating and conceptualizing clinical reasoning can provide richer means of understanding what is involved in clinical encounters ( Loftus , 2012 ) .
A narrative approach to exploring and investigating clinical reasoning development can provide a vocabulary that encourages us to integrate insights from different frameworks in ways that combine the strengths of each .
Many people have breakfast in a bar with an espresso or a cappuccino and a croissant .
Working people usually have lunch at about 13.00 and they have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffee because the break is short and they have to go back to work and need to be concentrate and do n't get asleep !
Young people do not drink coffee : they prefer to drink Coke while eating junk food , which is cheaper and tastier than pastasciutta .
In northern Italy people eat at about 19 , whereas in southern Italy they eat at about 21 . I get home late and I have no time to cook elaborate meals so I usually cook a steak with vegetables .
I really like the lasagna , made with a flat and long pasta with bechamel , tomatoes and meat and I love the pasta Amatriciana made with spaghetti , fresh tomatoes , bacon and a typical Roman cheese called pecorino .
Another typical dish from the northern Italy ( it comes from the mountains ) is pizzoccheri which is a wheat pasta topped with cabbages , butter and typical cheese .
I 'm talking about Gorgonzola cheese , which tastes really strong and is n't very nice because it has a blue mould inside .
However , eating is for us a tradition that puts the families together and recipes are handed down from generation to generation .
What happened to me is not the reason for my mood but I 'm sure it contributed .
My first night here , I was invited to a dinner mainly for scientists who are up here doing a radio show .
I would like to apply for the job you advertised last week because I am quite sure I would be perfectly suitable for the post .
I am an English teacher here in my country , Spain , and I have worked with children aged 5 - 14 for five years now , in different educational centres .

I guess that is why I am a bit a of workaholic .
I love playing sports , singing , swimming , doing handicrafts , and cooking as well . I enjoy teamwork , and I always share new ideas and good experiences with my colleagues .

I am quite good at organising sports events and games .
Students always love the activities I design for them .
Working there would be a great opportunity for me .
I know I would benefit a lot from the experience .
I am writing to apply for the post of instructor at USA Summer Camps .
I am 20 and currently doing a Barcelona University degree in PE .
I also have a high level of spoken English because for 8 years I have been attending a summer camp in Scotland , where recently I was asked to carry on as an instructor .

Yours faithfully ,
Although educated people in the past had the same desire to learn as educated people today , those who were considered educated in the past would be considered less educated today .
That 's because many scientific facts have been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts has become much more available .
Today , people know more about phenomena that were considered obscure in the past .
Furthermore , it 's easy to find out about these valuable discoveries .
In addition , information about anything can be found easily on the Internet .
In the past , graduating from high school was considered an achievement ; today it 's not .
To be considered well educated , people should graduate from a college .
Also , there are more people who continue their education after graduation from college .
In conclusion , the average level of education in the past is n't enough today to be considered educated .
Going to the UK has been a dream of mine , but going to Cornwall , however , might be a bit of an escapade during the winter , considering that I 'm only used to the relatively hot Egyptian weather .
I have read that Cornwall is usually flooded in winter , and that the weather might make transportation a pain .
However , I 'm interested in & excited about the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiences .
A historical place of importance in my country .
This is a forest , crossed by the border between France and Switzerland .
As it was full of spruces , it was easy to hide from the German patrols and people from both sides of the border helped Jewish people , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to flee through Switzerland .
A network developed from the South of France to Switzerland , especially to try to save thousands of Jewish children .
People who participated in that " way to freedom " never asked anything in exchange .
They never spoke about it till a few years ago , as they were considered criminals by their countries as they had broken the law during that time .
But now , they have told the whole world about it , some of them are now considered as heroes in Israel for what they did during those hard times .
Nowadays , public transport is a useful and convenient way of travelling , especially for students , people with a low socioeconomic status , or anyone who wants to go to work or school by bus , train or by subway .
Cars are a good way of saving time , especially when waiting for public transport , mainly buses .
But a disadvantage is that car maintenance and gas is more expensive than paying for public transport .
I also think that there will be fewer people using public transport in the future , but some will still be available , because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a car or travel by plane .
As in all educational processes , assessment of the programme planning must take place .
There are different ideas to be considered as far as assessment is concerned .
The function of evaluation and assessment must not only be the recognition of the results of the learning process itself , but also how this process took place . Therefore , we will need to use different instruments of assessment .
After the assessment and evaluation we will be able to adapt the necessary pedagogic help to individual students , know up to which point the proposed aims have been achieved , and we will be able to judge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessment and evaluation will provide information , for the teacher as well as for the students .
The teacher will understand the student 's difficulties better ; s / he will know the level of assimilation of the different kinds of contents and be able to modify future programme planning .
As far as the students are concerned , they will be able to correct inadequate strategies or behaviour , know the difficulties they encounter in the learning - teaching process and evaluate their own process .
As to the teacher , we will find out whether the programme planning was adequate or not and if s / he was sufficiently involved in the learning - teaching process .
Thirdly , we have to keep in mind the instruments for assessment and evaluation we are going to use .
For our programme planning , we propose the following instruments or techniques :
Society is continually changing , ever since we created the first civilizations .
However , it has a special importance nowadays , in a world that moves so quickly .
The first thing that comes to mind on this subject is technology .
It has such a quick growth that it 's impossible to predict how much transformation it will suffer .
It should make a lot of tasks easier and more efficient but , apart from that , I do n't expect it to have a deep impact on our lives , considering other aspects that will certainly overcome this one .
As the population grows exponentially , the resources fail to do the same .
As this may cause us to lose traditions and cultural identity , it will definitely bring more opportunities for everyone .
First of all , there are a lot of places to visit here and I would like to take you to Punta del Este , Piriapolis , Cabo Polonio , La paloma and other beautiful places .
Secondly , you can find a job here in Montevideo or , if you like , in the countryside .
For people who come from other countries like you , there are a lot of internships and I can assure you that you will find a great job . There are also companies that are hiring people to work for a short period of time in their call centers .
Finally , tell me if you want to go to a particular place or do some activity that you have in mind .
The pupils have been taught English since their very first meeting with the English language in school , so they are completely familiar with using English as a classroom language .
In this course design we have also chosen activities that we consider suitable to be taught about in English .
The evaluation starts by unfolding the brainstorm from day 1 , and then it continues with the pupils applying all their new words and knowledge about America .
Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils ' minds of their new knowledge .
The end of the evaluation is that every pupil writes a post - it note that answers the following questions : What have I learned from this course ?
Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect on their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time .
Taking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils ' motivation into consideration , we have decided that they can follow their interests on this course .
This also gives the pupils the possibility of introducing their classmates to new knowledge - and the communicative situation is authentic .
Kyiv is a good destination for shopaholics .
For those interested in top fashion brands , I would recommend visiting the shops in the main street .
The best manufacturers of clothes , linen , accessories have their shops there . Jewellery and watch shops can also be found nearby .
Mass - market clothes , bags , cosmetics , children 's toys are available there .
There are also supermarkets in each shopping mall , where you can buy food and beverages as well as housekeeping items .
If you are interested in local design , vintage clothes and remarkable souvenirs , go to the historical center of the city .
Different shops will offer a wide range of goods and impress with interesting design ideas and unique styles .
The main shopping mall of the city is under reconstruction at the moment , but in one year , it will be open to visitors and will surprise them with high - tech design and exclusive brands .
And if you are trying to find a good product for a reasonable price , visit the city 's outlet centre - collections from the previous years are sold there with significant discounts .

I believe we can reduce the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills .
For example , if they do not have enough money to have a home and to buy things necessary to live , they can get financial support from the government .
Homeless people tend to be unable to gather information because of lack of means to do it .
We need to let them get information .
The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to overcome hardships .
In the program , one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office .
He tried several jobs but he could communicate well in none of them .
He got to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He also learned how to build a good relationship with people through talking to his colleagues .
If more lessons like this are provided and more homeless people get the skills , the problem of homelessness will become less serious .
To conclude , giving information about support that they can receive from the government and skills is a very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
At the moment , all governments around the world argue about climate change .
Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem , whereas others believe deforestation has a greater impact on our world .
So , we can say , with less deforestation there would be less global warming .
The primary outcome is the increasing temperature , and this leads to melting glaciers .
This flooding leads to starvation because of lower harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand , deforestation is , as said , another part of global warming due to fewer carbon - dioxide - storing trees .
But incinerating a huge part of the rainforest means the destruction of wildlife habitats .
Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but so is deforestation .
But , in my opinion , you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first .
Even though their relationship was of the quarrelling type , everyone around them , friends and family agreed on the fact that the pair were as solid as a rock , and despite the ups and downs , love had always won in the end .
He was torturing Cecilia with reproaches .
It took him three days to calm down and put things into perspective .
Nowadays , experience is more important than academic knowledge to get a job .
Employers try to find employees that have practical skills rather than formal qualifications .
Although experience is extremely important , I disagree that academic qualifications are not important .
First of all , formal education is essential for employees , it is considered as a fundamental basis of any practical job .
Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person acquired in an academic institution .
In addition , every phenomenon is based on theory .
When employees face any problems or difficulties at work , they must refer to the theory that explains this phenomenon . Without knowing this theory , employees ca n't overcome these difficulties . For instance , engineering science seems practical , but each part of engineering science is based on theories .
Therefore , engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees , as they help people to think and solve all problems in a fair way .
A scientific approach is more important to deal with problems , beginning with identifying problems and then studying all factors and related information .
Moreover , studying at a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees .
To conclude , theoretical knowledge is more important than practical skills .
It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in their careers .
It is certainly true that markets can not abandon formal qualifications in future .
Some people are convinced that public transport has no future because the car is so much more convenient .
The use of public transport has a lot of advantages , but on the other hand , some disadvantages can be distinguished .
First , what are the advantages of using the bus or train ?
When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights , by car it is hard to get from one place to the other , because the traffic is heavy .
In that case , the choice of public transport will be preferable .
The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan to resolve legal cases and disputes .
The system , which has been in practice since British rule , was modified under the ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criminal Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases , the Jirga also covers all important aspects of the monetary , political , and communal life of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga , especially in Sindh province , has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan , law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions .
The strongest allegation about the Jirga system or ' informal justice system ' has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution of a variety of its rules and regulations .
This informal system of justice is being practiced in rural areas of Sindh and Baluchistan .
In fact , the informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally has its roots in Baloch culture and has been transferred to Sindhi society progressively .
" Historically , the Jirga System dates back to the days of Naseer Khan of Kalat , Baluchistan .
In recent years , many nations are developing their own economies rapidly , and it means that many areas of farmland and forests are being cut down to build better and bigger houses and a more convenient transportation system .
However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces .
In my opinion , we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance .
For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it puts a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor , while the environment is also getting worse and worse .
Secondly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the areas of farmland are also decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in pursuit of the perfect life and the people in undeveloped areas are starving .
So , I think that the government must do something in this respect .
The government should find a balance between economic development and agricultural development .
I think that it will have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the food can make people great and then vigorously develop the economy .
As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government , but also the task of each of us .
I am writing to apply for one of the jobs in the summer camp that you advertised on the Internet .
I am in my final year of high school , which I will leave with a university entrance qualification in July of this year .
I am looking for a job in the USA to improve my English and to gain more experience working with children as I want to become a primary school teacher .
I have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that very satisfying so far .
In addition , I have privately coached 5th and 6th grade pupils in Mathematics , English , German and French for the last 3 years .
The people I have worked for find me a reliable , communicative , well - organised and cheerful person .
My babysitting duties were to put the children to bed , provide lunch or dinner , play with them and read to them .
Since I have worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp , I think that I am well - equipped to deal with 8 - 12-year - old children from the experience I mentioned .
Yours faithfully ,
I will never forget this particular day .
We set off at 6 pm and reached our destination an hour later .

Recruitment
Hartoghstraat 844
Your advertisement in the Guardian of 31 August attracted my attention , because I believe that I have the skills you are looking for .
Attached to this letter of application , you will find my curriculum vitae .
I recently completed the four - year bachelor degree in European Studies at Zuyd University in Maastricht .
I learned about corporate communication , about management , organization and communication and some basics of marketing , etc .
Also , I have studied French and Spanish and have participated in many group projects .
During my studies , I went abroad to the University of Paris , where I studied political sciences and international management .
After my studies , I did a Master 's in cultural sciences at the University of Maastricht .
As a result of this training , I have excellent communication and analytical skills .
I worked in a clothing shop in the past , so I have some sales experience as well .
I have done an internship at the reception in one of the best VIP designer hotels in Sevilla , Spain .
My duties included checking guests in and out , planning and organizing group arrivals , assisting with cash advances , exchanging money , checking guest folios and giving commercial information to customers .
In this way , I have , to some extent , developed strategic thinking about individual client needs .
During my studies , I had to make portfolios several times and had negotiation classes , so that will be no problem for me .
I am very interested in this post , since it offers an excellent opportunity to develop my career in international management .
If you have any further questions , I can be contacted on 00316 12 34 56 78 . I would welcome the opportunity of an interview to give you additional information on what I can contribute to Meltwater News .
Yours faithfully ,
I am writing in reply to your job advertisement that I saw some days ago and I think this would be the right opportunity for me .
In those places , I had the opportunity to communicate with other people from all over the world .
I would like to improve my communication skills and I would really love to be an active part of your summer camps trying to do new things .
Cooking is one of the things I like most and I am not frightened of working hard , since I believe that if you want to improve , you have to apply yourself a lot .
I hope you will consider my application . This would actually be a wonderful experience for me .
It was a rainy afternoon , and I had discovered the letter that ruined my life . I would never be the same again . I was at home looking out of the window , when the phone rang .
Grandparents are the best .
She also has a pale complexion and black dark circles under eyes .
Grandma 's wrinkled face can be horrifying at night .
When I go to sleep she is constantly sitting beside me .
Understanding is the most important thing in this world .
We will never stop loving our grandparents !
The girls used to hang out together , they spent all their free time together and they were absolutely best friends .
When Aria comes home from Iceland , again , the girls get mysterious messages only signed with the letter " A " .
I love the show , because it is completely thrilling and scary .
Nevertheless , being famous has both its benefits and drawbacks .
First of all , celebrities are usually wealthy , so they have an easier life than other people .
On the other hand , lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person 's life , as their personal life 's boundaries are constantly crossed by paparazzi and journalists .
Owing to this state of constant stress , many of them are bound to have alcoholism problems , drug - addiction and depression .
In conclusion , fame may be nice , but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
In this way , I 'd have the chance to get to know different people from all over the world and , at the same time , I 'd earn some money to visit the city and the castles of England , where many historic battles were fought .
After leaving London , I 'd love to do two months of volunteering at a children 's hospital in York .
Will you help me to write a striking CV ?
I 'm meeting two friends of mine in Bristol where we 're renting a little car and we 're going to travel without a destination !
Almost immediately , the house was empty , and the music turned off , letting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase , valued at £ 2000 was broken .
Michael decided to blame the dog for the unfortunate incident and when he told his father what had happened , he automatically put the dog up for adoption as it was n't the first time , despite Michael 's attempts to avoid him doing it .
I would like to apply for the 12-month Internship Programme ( Marketing and Client Relations team ) at ICG as advertised on the Cambridge Careers website .
This position will allow me to gain an insight into the asset management industry .
The reputation for stability and consistency and the global leadership in mezzanine finance are my main reasons for applying to ICG .
I am very interested in working in the financial markets .
Having lived in four different cities ( Brighton , London , Manchester and Cambridge ) in the UK , I have become more adaptable to new environments and keen to accept new challenges .
In addition , I believe my international exposure and fluency in English , Mandarin and Cantonese will be an invaluable asset to the company .
Given my strong academic background and my leadership experiences at university , including the completion of the Manchester Leadership Programme , I believe I am a strong candidate for this position . I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview .
At this point , no one knew that she had had the interview and the interviewer told her that the job was hers .
I am writing to you regarding your job advertisement .
I am a very energetic , hardworking , caring , tolerant , fun - to - be - with 30-year - old woman who loves spending time with children .

In addition , as a mother of 8-and-12-year - old boys , I have a vast knowledge of children 's psychology and am an excellent cook .
Besides , while being an exchange student in the USA during my school years , I improved my English speaking and communication skills .
Regarding the living arrangements , as I understand it , food and accommodation are provided by the summer camp .
It would be my pleasure to visit the States again and take part in activities I enjoyed doing as a teenager .
And I am confident that I would be a useful member of your summer camp team .
But then , every once in a while , one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance , or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision .
This results in common opinions , support when there 's a problem and mutual understanding without many words .
On the other hand , we tend to have higher expectations and less patience when it comes to our loved ones .
One should also bear in mind that sometimes it 's necessary to compromise , especially when it comes to material or financial issues .
Once you accept that your sibling , although similar , is n't the same as you , or that your child has a different view on their future , it 's easier to embrace the differences and be a supportive family member .
These are my findings and my recommendations .
This innovative center has a lot of first - class facilities for young people .
It has a professional rehearsal studio that local music groups can just rent for pocket money , they can also rent instruments by paying a small refundable deposit .
- The second best place is a private disco for youngsters .
- There is another place where local youths spend a lot of hours ; the new and magnificent mall .
They especially like the music store and the magnificent t - shirt store owned by two local designers . There you can design your own item and collect it the following week .
My name is Susanne White and I would like to apply for the position as a camp assistant advertised in the Crash Magazine .
Two years ago , I developed a project called : Our talent for Poetry and Painting , within an association for orientation of children and teenagers .
Apart from my experience in the Arts , I also have been doing gymnastics for ten years ; therefore , I am a sporty girl .
In addition , I believe I am suitable for this position because I have the ability to speak with people of different nationalities in English and French , and I am enthusiastic about camping .
Enclosed I also send the reference letters written by the director and supervisor of the Talent Proof Association , where I worked with children , in order to support my social skills and crisis management competence .
Yours faithfully ,
The importance of cleanliness around us is not understood till it takes a toll on our health .
An individual must be aware of the result of his actions on the environment , be it due to personal or professional actions , in order to maintain it in a healthy state .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging people who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against those who tend to cause harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to inform people about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town .
Representatives elected by respective communities attend the meeting .
It is then their responsibility to communicate the message to all members of their community .
These meetings are organized according to their planned schedule and the results were surprising .
Earlier , regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not , it was disposed of in the same bin .
Later , people were educated regarding recyclable , non - recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed of in different bins .
Development was also happening at the same time which was good for our town , but , lots of trees were also cut down as a result .
People started protesting against them to avoid any further damage to the environment .
Hence , the municipal board decided to invite the developers to the meeting that was scheduled for a weeks ' time .
Taking care of the environment is everyone 's duty and it must be done responsibly .
The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job of educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state .
Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that .
When he was ready , he took his keys and everything he needed , he locked the door and went to his job .
Further to our phone conversation of last week , I would first like to thank you for giving me this chance to talk to you , and following up on our discussion , please note that we have been approached by the purchasing department at the hospital to give them our maximum discount to secure the deal as a lot of brokers were quoting with a very competitive price which was very close to our cost .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter took out his mobile , dialed 112 and told the dispatcher about that whole situation .
The dispatcher told Peter to calm down and check if he had scissors , towels and water in his car .
The dispatcher told him every little thing he had to do .
To begin with , they help us solve really complex mathematical equations .
We have made programs that make computers do very interesting things , like graphics .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers made easier for us is communication .
Humans are social animals , we communicate because communication is in our genes . If we do n't communicate we go insane .
On the other hand , computers have very bad effects on both us , and the environment .
For example , research has shown that not computers themselves , but the things we use or play on them are addictive , like social networks or games .
Despite the fact that computers decreased the use of paper , they 're still harmful to the environment since they consume tonnes of electricity .
So it is normal that computers have bad effects on us and the environment .
We have also worked together at a kindergarten for some time and this year we started our studies at an institute in order to become primary teachers .
As a result of having shared many experiences together , I have come to know her and her abilities very well .
As a student , she is persistent and hardworking as well as respected by teachers and students because of her warmth and kindness .
Lucila is the eldest of six siblings , so she is used to babysitting children .
In the past , she had some difficulty keeping her room neat , but , as she has grown up , she has become a far more disciplined and tidy person .
When we worked at the kindergarten , she was very patient and caring with the children and she was also willing to help them whenever they had a problem , even if that implied hard work for her .
I can confirm that she had a special connection with the kids : she was admired by those who had a great time with her .
Moreover , she has been to a camp in Australia in which she was a coordinator of a group of twenty kids .
As a result of her experience , Lucila has developed an incredible ability to solve any problem that may arise .
Lucila has always wanted to work with children and she is interested in a job that would also help her develop her English skills .
She would undoubtedly do an excellent job and , for the reasons I have given , I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
Yours faithfully ,
To the Italian education authorities
In this report , I will describe the school system in my country , point out its flaws and conclude giving suggestions about how they could be addressed .
In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes are put in a corner .
That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students for working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real - world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools focus extremely on theory .
In fact , students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life .
Suggestions
What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences in grammar schools also , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .
Furthermore , schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years , which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would , but it would also attract more people to the school itself .
Conclusion
People should get used to the fact that most companies will also care about your previous work experience , and the idea of gaining that through school would be really appealing .
I am a friendly , happy , hardworking person with a lot of energy .
I have had 5 years ' experience working with children as a language teacher .
I am used to organising sporting events and fun activities for children and teenagers aged 6 - 19 .
In addition , I have experience working in restaurants during the summer , so I am used to all types of kitchen duties including cooking and washing up .
I believe I would be the perfect candidate for this position and I would be happy to attend a Skype interview whenever is convenient for you .
I am sure that it would be a very interesting and challenging position and I would really enjoy the opportunity to work at your camp this summer .
Yours faithfully ,
Nobody can argue with the fact that education is a crucial period in the development of a child .
Learning new languages is very important , but also studying subjects related to computers and technology , like computer programming , is becoming more and more useful than ancient languages like Greek or Latin .
This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study , in particular , and an important tool in life in general .
On the one hand , it allows students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past .
On the other hand , this does not bring very many employment opportunities .
Learning computer programming , guarantees a good living .
It is a known fact that there are very few computer programmers .
Furthermore , as technology changes more and more , there will be a greater demand for these skills in the future .
It is evident that technology is important in every aspect of our lives .
In conclusion , there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school , but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any serious school 's programme .
I have considered them my favorite band since 2010 , because I had the chance to get to meet them watching The X Factor episode where they auditioned .
' All that echoes ' , by Josh Groban , is the sixth studio album of this American singer and songwriter .
It includes twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song .
That fascinating album surprises not only with the variety of subjects , but also with the strength of the instrumental sounds .
The arrangements are simple and effective and the powerful voice plays harmoniously with the rich sound .
False alarm ' , which is the second track , is totally different and mysterious because of the wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings the well - known from the film ' Once " song called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fantastic way , but listeners used to the first version might be disappointed .
Musically satisfying , ' Happy in my heartache ' , tells the story of tragic love .
Once again , Groban fascinates audiences from all over the world with his mature voice and catchy tunes .
I definitely recommend that album for your collection .
His main task was to collect letters from abroad and to hand them to THE postmen WHO WERE in charge of DELIVERING them to THE addressees .
One day , he took part in a competition intended for the selection of the head of the post office where he was still working .
The LARGE NUMBER OF participants DID VARIOUS EXERCISES , INCLUDING a TRANSLATION into German .
When the exam was finished , he went out of the room where the competition had been held .
I noticed that the first malfunction was the safety lock , which demanded applying great force .
We discovered another problem when we tried to use the blender .
Finally , four weeks later , I was contacted by your representative .
I am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service I have received .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mr Cunningham ,
I am writing to apply for the post of camp monitor which I saw advertised on the university website .
I am very interested in it because I would like to broaden my experience in activities with children .
Regarding my experience , on the one hand , I belong to a soccer club at university . Consequently , I have some experience working in a team .
It is true that water sports are not the most usual there , but , I enjoy doing them every summer at the beach .
Moreover , from my point of view , children need to focus their attention on constant activity . My sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to keep their attention .
If you offer me the chance to join your team , you will not be disappointed .
I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
These days , travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people .
Governments build more roads and more families are able to afford cars .
There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to describe .
On the one hand , it is environmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars .
Nowadays , buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in cities .
On the other hand , buses and subways can accommodate more passengers , while a car can only hold 4 to 5 people in total .
Compared with cars , public transport has a larger capacity , which saves space and costs less .
Last but not least , fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport , so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
Thus , it will be more smooth and pleasant for passengers to travel on the road .
In conclusion , public transport is a cost - effective way for people to travel which also contributes to the sustainable development of society .
" Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed . "
The statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort into fields or subjects that they are not good at , which I can not agree with .
This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted with instead of running away .
The responsibility of educational institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions , not making decisions for students .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive about the unknown instead of negative and retreating . All these are the main reasons why humankind can keep improving .
Transferring this knowledge and experience to young people is the meaning of education .
If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance of being successful , we 'll never have people like Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein , who were considered as stupid kids in school but did n't give up trying .
Convincing students to take a more comfortable road by giving up the possible risk is definitely not the proper attitude the educational institution should have .
One may suggest that everyone needs to learn to assess the risk before investing , however , teaching students how to assess , not assessing for students , is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Nevertheless , the ability to identify one 's limits can be best learned from experience .
The responsibility of educational institutions is to make sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him / her from getting close to the water .
Educational institutions should guide students to have better self - understanding and self - assessment , not persuade them to follow a pre - decided path .
Last but not least , what is the definition of " success " ?
How do the educational institutions judge a student being likely to succeed or not ?
For some people , living a life which enables them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the best , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such a situation can they provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue fields of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Contribution
The most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme " Tagesschau " , which airs about three times a day on the channel " Das Erste / ARD " .
It is a news programme based on well - researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need .
The main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research , which make it more reliable than other news programmes .
Moreover , they try to be interesting to all ages , so they post on Facebook and Twitter as well , which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme .
Nevertheless , they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and , in addition , they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need .
I strongly believe that this TV programme deserves its popularity .
The way they present themselves in the media and the well - founded research are truly unique in German news programmes .
Although I rarely watch the show on TV , I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring news so vivid and interesting through short video clips , pictures and their choice of words .
If you ever get to watch TV in Germany , you should definitely check out this interesting news programme .
Have you got friendly colleagues ?
We 'd get there at about half past eight every day and start cleaning the main room proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema .
We got to see the new Bond movie and also the blockbuster Spiderman 3 there .
My job was cleaning the cinema , but Fred 's main responsibility was to play the movies for the clients , so I 'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier , so I could enjoy watching the movies with him .
For the last ten years , Michael had been working for a well - known company in London as an accountant .
He sat on the sofa in front of the television and , suddenly , he realised that every morning was exactly the same , nothing had changed for so many years ! "
Since Michael was a child he had always dreamt of moving to Australia , where he could go kitesurfing all day long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sandy beach and drink good Australian alcohol .
After 10 minutes , a resignation letter was ready to take to Michael 's boss .
Without waiting for her answer , he just went into the office , gave Mike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with the resignation letter and left .
Michael had cheated on her and he did it consciously .
The words coming out of his mouth like a litany , almost mechanically , as he realized that there was no turning back .
The relief of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness .
Glitz , glamour and popularity ; three words which are often linked to the world of football , and this sport is no doubt one of the finest that man has created .
The stars playing this game add to the already amassed recognition of the sport .
Weekends would be a drag if match days were not on television .
The 90 minutes is the most enjoyed time of the week though , because of the adrenalin rush that is associated with everything that is done on the pitch .
As a fan , supporting a team is just one part of the sport .
Rivalries , arguments about which team is the best team and watching matches in a group just add to the excitement .
With regard to this sport , any advice , in my opinion , is good advice and I have just a single piece of advice for someone starting this sport , and that advice would be to enjoy everything related to the sport .
Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until they go to university , even some of them still need to study them at university .
A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled at mathematics .
This essay will discuss the differences and similarities between learning a language and learning mathematics .
The ways of learning a language and mathematics are different .
For studying a language , people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read a variety of foreign - language books to increase their reading and writing skills .
Furthermore , people need to have a good memory to remember a large number of words .
In general , studying a language focuses more on a large amount of individual effort and little talent .
However , for learning mathematics , students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions . Instead of rote learning , they should remember different types of formulas by practicing a mass of examples .
To sum up , teachers , skills and talent are more important for learning mathematics .
However , there are some similarities between those two subjects .
Secondly , associability is important for both languages and mathematics .
In conclusion , people need to find the right way which can save a lot of time and energy to study these two subjects .
Shenzhen - China 's largest migrant city and a neighbor of Hong Kong - is a remarkable place that I call home .
Most Shenzhen residents come from different cultural backgrounds and speak various regional dialects .
Meanwhile , we embrace a superordinate Shenzhen identity , which is characterized by a culture of openness , tolerance , and creativity .
Our differences , it seems , do not make a difference .
However , when I was young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance .
As a child who did not play with " boys ' toys " and identified as gay later , I was often subjected to disdain and hostility from peers and adults .
Ironically , the marginalization comes not only from society at large , but also from within the gay community .
A feminine gay man is considered as less than his masculine counterpart , because femininity is regarded as weak , unattractive , and second - class .
This experience of amplified minority stress prompted me to think about intergroup and intragroup interaction early in life .
It has led me to believe that masculinity should not be an indicator of individual worth .
She chose a cosy little restaurant near her house .
As soon as Anna and her friends went into the restaurant , everything started to go perfectly .
She started to dance with an Elvis look - alike , laugh and enjoy every single minute .
She was embarrassed that she did not recognise him .
But immediately she realized that it was one of her friends ' tricky plans and she started to laugh with them .
Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kingdom in my country .
The Alhambra Palace was the residence of Boabdil , the last Muslim king , who was defeated in 1492 after delivering Granada to the Catholic Monarchs .
Nowadays , this palace is one of the most visited places here in Spain because of its beauty and its impressive courtyards .
You can see the history of the Reconquets in its walls and towers .
Its surroundings are also wonderful , and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra , one of the last Muslim palaces in the world .
I haven't seen you for almost two months but , as you know , in November I had a unique opportunity to help at a concert that took place on an airport runway and it was a simply amazing experience !
The event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events , so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal !
The whole process of selling the tickets was fascinating because of the demand for them .
People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to killing their every single ' rival ' .
Security guards had a lot of work to do but , thanks to them , we stood a chance of dealing with other problems , such as , for example , regulating the quality of the sound .
I was incredibly overjoyed when the culmination came .
The band was playing , we were enjoying the music and it seemed that there would be no more complications .
What you actually think at such an extraordinary moment is that life could n't be more beautiful .
After a few drinks , I told him that I 'm currently looking for a job , nothing big , just a couple of hours during weekends to make some money for my journey to the Netherlands .
It 's literally 10 - 15 hours on Friday nights and Saturdays , stuff like carrying instruments ( which means hanging out with musicians ) , tidying after ( finding things , like wallets and cellphones ) and , generally speaking , - helping .
In fact , I had to be everywhere with the guy , just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city .
Last time , it was , for example , delivering my drunk boss home ;)
Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I 'll tell you so much more . I have loads of unbelievable stories !
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
A modern interpretation of Austen 's Classic Love Story
Joe Wright directs this uplifting adaptation , which depicts the five Bennet sisters , who have been brought up to get married .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them , striving to put everything in a broader perspective .
Surprisingly enough , sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet ( Keira Knightley ) meets single , rich , and proud Mr. Darcy ( Matthew Macfadyen ) .
Keira Knightley , in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet , delivers an outstanding performance .
In fact , the film , well cast from top to bottom , is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a set of beautiful English locations , as in many British productions .
In this adaptation , the screenwriter makes some substantial alterations to the novel .
Therefore , dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure , several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings , and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story .
To conclude , Pride & Prejudice is an amazing adaptation which completely bewitches you with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit .
I am a 45-year - old man and I have plenty of experience of working with people .
Above all , I am interested in films .
Science fiction are my favourite type of films because I like to leave behind normal life . Nevertheless , I enjoy all kinds of films such as comedies , thrillers , westerns , horror films and even silent films .
I think I am right for the position because I think I can boost the motivation of people about movies and push them to share their particular point of view .
As far as the job is concerned , working on Monday and Wednesday evening would be perfect for me because I am currently unemployed .
Please feel free to ask for further information if you need it .
Yours faithfully ,
Thank you for accepting our invitation to give a talk at our club .
Our club members are thrilled to know that an international sports star like you is coming to see them .
Many times , reading my own poems and articles is a surprising experience . "
So , I have yet to submit myself to some serious criticism ( well , calling my writings literature is a huge joke in itself ... anyway ) ; but yes , I would like to place my written works ( however small and few they may be)for qualitative discussion in front of people who really can identify the good and the ' not - so - good ' writing .
It 's very common to hear people talking about friendship , but are we sure about the real meaning of it ?
Firstly , we ought to consider that friendship is not uniquely a human emotion .
Friendship is overall an act of will .
Friendship is a type of love which is characterized by being unconditional , reciprocal , and ready to forgive each other .
Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes , your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them , your plans for the future , and moreover , pays special attention in times of crisis .
They feel happy when I am happy , they are sad when I am sad , they enjoy my success .
They are , definitely , my best friends .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself , while many also see a lot mystical connections in this painting .
The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes in the painting are made visible through it .
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the painting is the woman 's smile .
Many scientific studies have been undertaken to determine the exact nature of the smile and the real reason remains a mystery .
It is believed that every person sees the smile differently because of the changes in the lighting that Leonardo presented .
Some winding paths and a faraway bridge is also perceptible in the background .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
We use it to communicate with friends , to play games , to watch series , the list is endless .
Unfortunately , it is not perfect .
Luckily , the government intervenes to preserve the safety of the Internet .
What it comes down to is , should the Internet be more tightly controlled by governments ?
Without the intervention of the government , criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users .
They could get into our computers and steal our information .
They could use that information to get into our bank accounts and steal our money .
However , if the government were to monitor the citizens ' actions more closely , it would be considered an invasion of our privacy .
Nobody wants to have their private data exposed to the eyes of the government .
The reason why the government even take action is to ensure people are able to enjoy the internet , but a more tightly controlled internet would destroy that purpose .
So they would not appreciate it if there were suddenly restrictions put on them .
To sum things up , the government should not control the internet more tightly .
Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as are some diseases and mental disorders .
Therefore , what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made .
Those who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes .
Nevertheless , identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities .
This provides evidence that life experiences and the surroundings where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
For instance , parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and , consequently , they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field .
According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives by encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
As I see it , personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which is the strongest in each case .
I was so surprised to hear you signed up for a new interior design course because it 's such a coincidence that I 'm planning to do something with my bedroom in the near future .
As I 've got some extra money at last , I think It 's high time for me to think about how to make it cozy and comfortable .
First , I am thinking about painting the walls in warm colors ( apricot , salmon pink or warm beige ) . I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list .
I completely rely on your taste , as we 've always been on the same wavelength .
The idea of painting it white seems too boring to me and I 'm completely out of my depth with all this new stuff for ceilings in shops , but I 'm sure you 're an expert !
I hope I 'm not bothering you too much with my redecoration , knowing how busy you are .
CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
Since technology has improved in recent years , we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel .
There are so many advantages .
It is the fastest and the most comfortable one .
Of course , for these facilities you have to pay a lot of money and that could be a problem for some people .
It could also be really comfortable but we do n't use it often .
Travelling on a boat is a great adventure for sure .
But there is also an inconvenience - it is also expensive .
In my country , trains are n't really fast and there could be problems during the trip , but that , for me , makes it more interesting .
Even though any mode of transportation is not bad , for me the train is the best option .
Back in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a journey that took 18 hours driving non - stop . Surely very few people would consider it convenient ?
Cars are handy and driving can be pleasant , but only when the driver is in a good mood , with no traffic jams or craters on the road ( really common situations in Brazil ) .
Since ancient times , public transport has existed , and it suffered numerous assassination attempts . In China , for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that time , chariots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against the Mongol 's dictatorship on it ; the situation was reversed in an early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars an instrument of oppression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
Convenience has little to do with the fate of public transport . Countries with high HDI ( convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport systems , and they are even boosting them .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and changes us into labor - lovers , personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity .
USA SUMMER CAMPS APPLICATION .
I play hockey and basketball , two sports that are simply perfect .
I have been learning English for a while , I am a sensitive and positive person , full of energy and willing to have new adventures .
I have experience of taking care of children and it is a task that I really enjoy .
I think I might be a suitable person for the job because I have already worked with kids , especially teaching and having fun .
As I have already said , I play sports , and that is why I could be helpful at organizing sports and evening activities .
I learned how to cook when I was eight , so I am pretty confident and well prepared .
Yours Faithfully , Alexia .
Above all , it 's a significant step to make a good design , in which background colour , artwork and security are the main considerations .
Then comes the preparation of metal plates and that needs skilled machinists .
The most important step is manual inspection .
After that , good quality sheets and bank notes are separated from partially damaged sheets and will be packaged and distributed .
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to give some information about the range of exciting activities that people can do in our area .
There are lots of places where you can do water sports like scuba diving , windsurfing , surfing , go on a banana bus , kayaking … The Costa Brava is the perfect place to do water sports because there is a lot of wind and good weather .
In winter you can go skiing or snowboarding in the Pirineus .
Conclusion :
To sum up , I think that if you want to do exciting sports , Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do , but if you do n't want to do sports you can do other activities or go to interesting places .
After all , what I had was so infinitesimal that I could barely taste it . '
It was time to escape , even though his mother would find out who ate it eventually .
Chapter 9 : The KM-3J : The second confrontation
That night , the time flew by , but things started to get weird . Marcus was talking with an Australian guy about the proofs that he had found related to dinosaurs . He was interested in them , but Marcus did n't like his point of view about those species . The guy told him they were bad creatures with no feelings , and Marcus thought they were awesome and the most lovely creatures he had ever heard about . The guy thought Marcus was crazy , so he fled the Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies . They were beautiful and flawless . The scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing , and suddenly the ladies vanished . The men started shouting .
Jack was arguing with an officer about the Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't understand anything because Jack was drunk ) , and suddenly , the officer took off his costume and a strange mask , and at that moment … Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer , he was Brad !
Jack tried to confront him , but as soon as he tried to do that , he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him . He had a new team . He decided to name them " The KM-3J " , a villains team , their names were Karolina ( she decided to change her name to that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one ) , Melanie , Miley ( they were both twins , the most beautiful ladies in the world ) , Max , who was an expert in the military field , and Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known his last name until that moment : Junior . He was embarrassed about it , he was the offspring of a weird woman , but she was his mother .
The bulk of the population of New York was homeless because there had just been a horrible war between New York City and California , but , increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war .
Jack was frightened , but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him . They had used some weapons from The King of the Sky . They got into the room and started shooting while Michael was untying Jack from the chair . Accidentally , Mark killed Miley while he was shooting . All her body parts were scattered on the floor . He did n't care about that and fled with the others .
Work and education disturb one another .
I will elaborate on points to support my opinion in the following paragraphs .
It all depends on the preference of the individuals .
If they want to bear some hassle and become more productive in their life , they can manage both things side by side .
This not only makes them knowledgeable but increases their potential as well .
As a result , they put their children into some job so that they can earn money for the family .
With firm determination , they can continue their education and work to feed their family as well .
Moreover , some employers select the potential employee from colleges while they are studying and pay for their Masters or Advanced Diplomas because they see their profit in that investment .
Hence , studying and working side by side helps candidates to grow professionally .
In conclusion , working and studying is very much possible .
It just depends on the dedication and determination of the person .
People should do both study and work side by side to make themselves more skilled and capable .
I believe I am a good fit for this job since I have previous experience working in similar jobs .
I demonstrated a courteous and professional attitude and achieved a high rating in the customer satisfaction survey .
I am also interested in different kinds of food and different cuisines .
I accept feedback from peers and management and improve my performance .
I am also a quick learner and adapt well to different working environments .
Thank you for your time and consideration of my resume and I look forward to speaking with you .
Was it the invitation to a wedding three weeks ago ?
So many twists and turns . She played her cards well . I never suspected , while sitting in the pews next to my wife , that , when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face , the evening would end at D'el Arte .
No , none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel , after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room , that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the tests for something more serious were all negative .
I 'm writing as in response to an advertisement for a job in the USA .
I am fourteen years old and interested in this job and believe I have the qualifications .
I think I would be suitable for this job , because I am young , energetic , enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children .
I would be helpful in the kitchen as I used to work part - time in my uncle 's restaurant .
I can also help organise any activity , as I have previously worked in a summer camp in my town with children between the ages of six and ten years old .
In my opinion , this job would be a great , useful experience .
I hope you consider my application and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
I have just seen your advertisement for a job in your summer camps .
So , I do n't find it difficult to organize competitions or activities for children .
This is the experience which I 've been waiting for for ages !
In my teens , I was fascinated by planes .
But at 360 metres , I was still surrounded by heavy fog .
My mom has a kindergarten and I love helping her out .
Every summer I help on my mom 's summer camp , but it 's a summer camp for babies and I would like to work with older children , because I think it 's more challenging . I would love to work at any place across the US .
I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs , restaurants etc . ,
so I was handing out leaflets everywhere .
Eventually the concert came off just perfectly !
Lots of people showed up , everybody had fun and the best thing in the musical experience is that you can make friends with famous people and those who you admire and only see on TV .
If you ever have an opportunity to help at this kind of event , I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart !
It 's a pity that you have to choose between the activities that you love the most , but I guess that life is full of choices .
You have always wanted to be a policewoman ( unless you have recently changed your mind ) so you must be very fit , since you need to pass the physical tests , which are very demanding , according to my mother .
So I think you should n't be upset because now is a difficult period , I know , but it passes and we can get back our lives when we go to university .
My cousin , who is studying English Literature , told me that you have much more freedom when you start university , so do n't worry !
James Dashner 's The Maze Runner , joins The Hunger Games and Divergent as the latest futuristic Young Adult thriller to get its own film franchise .
The Maze Runner manages to feel remarkably fresh .
He can remember his name , Thomas , but that 's all he can remember : everything important has been wiped clean .
A group of teenagers , all males , have made a makeshift life for themselves there .
Like Thomas , none of them have any real memories of their previous lives , although there 's a barely spoken , horrific suggestion that the lives they 've come from might have been even worse than the ones they 're living now .
The book ends with a devastating final twist .
The oldest memory of our relationship is a short skirt and some crocodiles .
The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy . I should be able to describe my view of an American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult , a woman , a wife , a mother and , simply , a human being with various roles in life who has been happy a million times and unhappy a million times .
No . I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time , but it is impossible to write the truth , since I have never seen him face - to - face . I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life , experience and the surroundings I live in .
His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words , and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences .
I adore his imagination because he is able to take you away on a cloud to a never - never land .
He is a man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo , love is just a quote and lying is the new truth .
I do n't believe in friendship between a man and a woman .
If I want to sleep , he stops his own imagination to let me relax and rest .
So , he is thoughtful .
However , I am scared a bit of the consequences of this secret adventure .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily newspaper .
He forgets everything when he plunges into his Neverland .
On the other hand , he is disciplined , because he is able to stop with his imagery at once .
I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue . For example : you are totally uninterested in reading between the lines ! You never listen to me ! I even called him a lummox and a stumblebum .
I was impressed and I find this a good feature of his personality .
He went with the trip from California to Texas and then to Phoenix .
If you like adventurers , well , he is the right man for you .
Kyle is a strong and charismatic individual and he values his privacy a lot .
But I identify with his view of male and female relationships .
Red is matter , brutal and heavy and always the colour which must be fought and vanquished by the other two . "
To : The Chairperson
Subject : Local Environmental Protection
As requested , this is a report concerning the environmental conditions in my town .
The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population 's interest and involvement in the optimum preservation of the area .
Through a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations , both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling .
Therefore , in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned .
This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal .
Since exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays , the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to encourage citizens to travel more by means of public transport , to the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Consequently , there are buses which run at short intervals on various routes , so that people can arrive at their destinations rapidly and conveniently .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community , thus making pollution caused by heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society .
Our local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal , storage , collection and transportation of waste material , but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , making it an appealing and pleasurable place to live .
Conclusion
Taking everything into consideration , it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which we reside .
However , as with all issues present within society , a dual commitment from the citizens and the authorities should be regarded as a key factor .
Red fire ants originated in Brazil .
Fire ants are very aggressive .
They often swarm on their prey swiftly and sting repeatedly to paralyze it .
If we disturb a fire ant nest , they will relentlessly sting us , injecting poison into our body .
In infested areas , they injure livestock , pets and wildlife , and damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , and irrigation systems .
We should use pesticide treatments to reduce their numbers .
There will be several inventions in the next years .
Nowadays we ca n't predict the aim of future devices though I guess that they will be mainly related to eradicating current illnesses .
Cancer , for instance , is surely one of the preferences for the companies that invest large amounts of money in R&D.
Moreover , it is a profitable task if they invent new medications to help people suffering from that illness .
Personally , I consider curing cancer the most challenging goal for the next generation of researchers and inventors .
That is the reason why I have been thinking for a long time about a new device to eradicate starvation .
It is not completely developed but I can advance some ideas about its design .
Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding one person in one day .
Manufacturing costs are not expensive and these pills do not expire .
I consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely put an end to the most unfair problem of this world .
To achieve this , Guido creates an imaginary game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .
The strength of the movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccentric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his ability as a director to deal with such a delicate topic as Nazism while managing to drive through a thick line between comedy and drama .
The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni is also a beautiful , delicate addition to this masterpiece .
What strikes me more is that , despite the fact that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , the film is n't really about the holocaust but is a bittersweet fable about human courage , love and hope .
Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful .
Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular game or how to block . I have learned to think about others first , and realized how important working hard is .
It is a learning ground for many to strengthen their personality and character for their lives .
Honestly , I could not agree more , as the website as it is available today is an inconvenient tool providing insufficient information .
Besides , adding a schedule to the left section would be an advantage , as our customers would be able to find the option they need in a more convenient way .
Second , the theme is outdated , and developing a new design can be a good move to attract more clients .
Minimalistic design is both stylish and user - friendly , as it does not imply any elements requiring website visitors to load heavy modules , and there are no unnecessary banners that distract the user .
Third , implementing several advanced solutions , such as a calculator , a gallery and live chat , could make our page more useful .
As to other aspects of our website , it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements ( which decrease the website 's value while bringing little profit ) .
All these tasks can be completed within a month , and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website , as it is an important aspect of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key where attracting clients is concerned .
Before focusing on the topic of technology itself , I would like to mention some aspects related to education .
First of all , Spanish educational laws are in Europe , and probably in the world , the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private - , which leads to a big difference in the educational knowledge .
While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly , private schools have some privileges .
Knowing this about the Spanish education system , we can now talk about technology .
I obviously agree that technology is necessary nowadays .
So , schools and educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
Technology does not imply a new instrument being taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the content would be a total failure .
Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated .
Moreover , they should include the past information and the new information .
In other words , technology should be used as a tool for students to be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .
These new technologies also help in the development of teaching .
Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to having qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great teacher said , we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there should n't be a technological revolution but an educational one .
I fear that such a huge move would damage businesses and many workers would lose their jobs .
At present , I am working for Cafe Noir , a well - known restaurant popular with visitors , many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced , they would not go into restaurants and , instead , they would meet friends at home .
On top of that , I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable .
To support my argument , I would like to tell you what happened in my country when such a ban was introduced .
First , it was almost impossible to enforce it .
In the end , the government changed the law , encouraging people to provide non - smoking areas .
This approach strikes me as much more realistic and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late .
We will talk about a technology that might soon disrupt the world .
But first let me explain the process followed to manufacture anything .
The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing , then producing , then consuming .
For a quick glimpse , this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object .
This directly affects the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .
More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them more cheaply the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money .
So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now . You would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
You could then pay off your debts , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently had $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
Looking at it through a broader lens , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would be accommodated .
This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; lower production costs allow the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
With competition giving him no choice at all , the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium .
Surprisingly , the producer gets to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produces at better quality too .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has the potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that , benefit the whole world .
I can still recall the day Cathy and I took Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
I am interested in applying for the job vacancy at the Cafe you run .
The reason for applying is that I believe I would be a perfect candidate as I have plenty of experience in the food industry as well as being extremely interested in working for this well - known company .
I strongly believe I would be the right person for the post as I consider myself polite , well - mannered , enthusiastic and good at dealing with customers .
Besides , working in popular restaurants has enabled me to gain the ability to work as part of a team and under pressure , as well as to learn about a wide variety of international foods and dishes .
Finally , I would like to express my willingness to work for you as this would be such a great experience for me .
I would be able to attend an interview at any time which is convenient to you .
I am writing this letter because I would really appreciate the opportunity to work as a camp counselor .
Regarding my level of English , I speak fluent English and got an A in the Cambridge First Certificate Exam .
As for my experience with children , I have been a counselor for the last two years in a summer camp .
Furthermore , I have worked as a babysitter for the past year .
I believe I am suitable for the job as I am very enthusiastic and energetic .
I am hardworking as well .
I always try so hard not to go to new restaurants because I do n't like most of them at first .
It was my brother 's birthday , so he asked if we could go to a new restaurant called Muerde La Pasta .
The restaurant is in Alcorcon . I have to say that it is a beautiful place , with a lot of beautiful lamps and a lot of space .
It 's a free buffet , so you can take everything you want … there are chips , pizzas , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and there 's no food limit haha .
Honestly , I thought I would n't like the restaurant , but I was completely wrong .. I loved it !
You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been in it .
And you can never really say a teacher in the mountains is miserable unless you have experienced being one .
When I found out I would be teaching at the most remote high school in Ozamiz , I said I was very unfortunate , and when I found out I would be spending my days in the mountains , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes filled my thoughts after finding out that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most .
My first paragraph aptly expresses my exact realization .
To have been assigned to the mountains is never the worst situation ; I have never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
It has taught me lessons I could n't have learned had I not been here - lessons that not only help me improve my teaching career , but also help me become the right person for my vocation .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who , most of the time , share the same line of interest with me .
With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm , we always make it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never settle for any mediocrity .
My personal relationship with my co - teachers is the same as that of a typical Filipino family .
I may have hurt some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance , and they may have hurt me too , but at the end of the day , it 's always camaraderie among us that dominates .
Their needs speak beyond intellectual hunger .
Every day , I have got to deal with students wearing different faces of life 's resentment .
As a teacher , it took me everything I have to come to terms with every pitiful fate of my students .
Hence , the value of UNDERSTANDING the students , even beyond what the meaning of such a word can express , has been dramatically instilled in me .
These stories , once heard , can open somebody 's heart to learn to love learners despite everything .
Consequently , I have seen the need to attend to their needs .
I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities , but I know somehow in my one - year stay in Gala , I have made a difference to my students ' lives .
My everyday interaction with my students has been my everyday fulfillment .
Eventually , the huge challenge I have had has turned into my inspiration to do better in my job .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life , but seeing them enduring motivated me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on .
The place , my colleagues , and my dear students are enough testimony to the fact that , in Gala , I have found a home … and a family to love , really for real .
I am writing to you regarding a job advertisement I saw in yesterday 's newspaper looking for an English - speaking person to work at weekends in your cafe .
I am the right person to do the job as I have always been interested in different kinds of food .
I like trying dishes from all over the world and I am keen on cooking and experimenting with new exotic cuisines .
I am really interested in applying for this job because I am an outgoing person and I am good at dealing with people .
In addition to this , I have broad experience in this field since I worked as a waitress during my last summer holiday .
As a consequence , I am prepared to work long hours .
I hope you will take my application into consideration because I have a great sense of responsibility and work very seriously .
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours sincerely ,
It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certificate .
Similarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms for learning English .
As I have said , I have been learning English for the sheer pleasure of it ; but , having come this far , I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition of my level .
Lots of people think that teenagers are stupid , have little knowledge about life , do not have enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understand .
I agree that some young people behave really badly ; they smoke , shout at their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
But most teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or elderly people .
I strongly disagree that they are not experienced .
The young person has to be strong , try to understand the situation .
Teenagers also have to make serious decisions like choosing secondary school , future job , which way they will go in their life , if they want to be in a relationship with someone .
Ways to collect and record information for future generations
Finding the best way to collect and store information for the future is not just a problem in our working life but also in our private life .
That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic .
Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion .
One way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio - file .
Additionally , it happens that while speaking of a particular event , suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator 's mind .
Another interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs .
This is an impressive way to document a change over many years , but on the other hand , it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition .
For me personally , the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way for three reasons : Firstly , I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person , but maybe two or three more .
Secondly , I can catch the narrator 's emotions .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concerned about the loss of quality of photographs and pictures .
After dinner , we saw an interesting show of Balinese dance and music .
Then the turtle started swimming and disappeared from our sight .
Visiting your own country certainly has its advantages .
Also , you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home .
Actually , they like the idea of visiting an unknown land , where everything is different , from the weather to the habits .
Furthermore , they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world , like Paris , Madrid , New York .
In conclusion , I think it 's important to know both our own countries and foreign lands .
At that moment , I thought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family , but fortunately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other end of the phone and she told me that my sister and her boyfriend were n't with the other passengers .
Unfortunately , Walter can not find the shot , so he has to look for the traveller , which is not easy .
He has to travel to remote parts of the world and have some really amazing adventures .
I wo n't tell you any more as it could spoil the story , but the film is definitely worth watching .
In addition , I can say that I was charmed by the main character who is developing throughout the whole film .
If you like complicated stories about dreams and how to make them come true , this story is definitely for you .
Easy on the pocket & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Gorica .
There you will find a parking area and some basketball courts , and on further exploration , just after the basketball courts & walking towards that famous bridge that you can now see much better , a restaurant .
Day , date and season dictate the always interesting & changing menu at this restaurant .
One of Slovenia 's qualified sommeliers will help you choose from the good wine cellar , so this is the place where I recommend our class can relax , eat , drink well & enjoy the happy atmosphere .
It is called " Les Miserables " and has much to recommend it , including the plot , the cast and , of course , the soundtrack .
The film is set in France in the nineteenth century .
Just after the French Revolution .
It is an adaptation from the original book " Les Miserables " by Victor Hugo .
Regarding the soundtrack , I can only say that since I saw the film I can not help singing every song all the time .
Travelling by car is becoming more convenient .
Cars are improving , becoming safer and more environmentally friendly .
Moreover , people have become more aware of environmental protection .
Thus , more and more people , when buying a new car , also consider its environment friendliness and the possible impact on the community .
Also , cars are becoming more affordable in many countries .
For example , in India and China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars , which are also imported .
Once you know for yourself how comfortable it is to have a car , there 's very little chance you will go back to public transport .
However , there might still be room for public transport in the future , especially in big cities .
I mean the underground in the first place .
It is very economical in terms of time , distance and people capacity .
Although I do n't really like watching soap operas , I started watching this particular show with my family .
The show was based on the journey of a married couple , living in India , who get separated due to some misunderstandings .
The couple have 4 kids and , after separation , 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad .
The dad , who is a cardiologist , moves to the US and starts a new life there .
The father , who had vowed to never look back , at first ignores her requests . However , upon insistence from his other children and his sister , agrees to go back to India .
The rest of the show is based on the interactions between all 4 children and how they work together to unite their family .
It 's a typical Indian soap opera in which love conquers over everything .
Although not very realistic , the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and , at the same time , teaches the importance of women being independent and able to live life on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship can be perceived as a special process of creating , testing and implementing new products and materials , new methods of resource utilization and the new kind of management in business processes to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first test has shown that I am very motivated and my skills almost fit with the possibility of being an entrepreneur .
However , the attitude that I have is not very appropriate for entrepreneurship .
It is important to underline that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine the behaviour of an entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting .
In the motivation part , I also received a high score in needing challenges , as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really important for me to be my own boss , even though it involves many more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in the test , I received fewer points in " need for achievement / success " than were required for being an entrepreneur .
The first one was based on the profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test .
The above - mentioned situation means that during the assessment other goals that an entrepreneur might have were not taking into account .
For instance , it this be social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifestyle .
However , the test evaluated parents ' and friends ' opinions as important feedback and I do not agree that it is essential , unless they are specialists in that field .
Nevertheless , I might take a reasonable risk if it can positively influence business .
It is certain that each of us loves to travel , but everyone likes the most comfortable means of transport .
For me , the best way to travel is train , because I think this mode of transportation has the most pros .
If we check the prices of air travel , we can be disappointed , the same is true of travel by boat .
Fortunately , train tickets are cheaper .
Travelling by train is quite fast , and pleasant , I can travel safely to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport .
After the summary is to certify that travelling by train is the most advantageous , but the most important reason why I chose travelling by train is the fact that I have motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At the end of a decade in which technology has made enormous leaps , I am thinking about how much our current idea of the house will change in the future .
Despite many differences in human nature , the current houses do not differ so much between themselves .
Furthermore , they have flat or sloping roofs , one or more floors .
Some are situated in the neighbourhood of parks , forests or lakes .
On the other hand , recently , many new and more advanced projects are realised more often by daring architects .
But can you imagine that in the near , unspecified future , all homes will be like that ?
Built using the most modern technology , full of the latest inventions which man can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , but it would be useful for modern houses to be constructed so as not to damage the environment .
I think quite a few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the future will go beyond the limits of our imagination .
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN
There have been major changes regarding teaching methods in the last few years , but there is still room for improvement .
However , speaking , listening activities and the massive use of I.T . mark the schedule nowadays .
The new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language , rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have .
This new outlook on teaching methods consists of the use of so - called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to effectively use the language in the context of a real situation .
There are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take responsibility , motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for real - life purposes .
It is important to note that the difficulty implementing the changes to the new teaching approach referred to above lies not with the students themselves but with the older generation of teachers , since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods .
In conclusion : the way of teaching has been changing in the last few years all over Spain .
The main reason for that can be found by surveying the related to new teaching methods developed recently .
However , a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education - related challenges Spain will have to face in the coming years .
The Japanese government made a competition to see which of their citizens was the best trend - setter .
Once the day was over , the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damage done , but it was impossible .
Everyone was happy for some time and true peace between the countries of the world had been achieved , but then the United States enslaved Canada and tried to enslave Japan as well , but they were able to defend themselves .
This movie can be considered a classical thriller , but with several aspects that makes it unique in this genre .
First of all , the historical period is the Victorian age in France .
The landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildings , dress , and habits of the population are displayed in full detail .
Secondly , we have an amazing script that can be considered unique .
The story tells us the importance of perfume in all aspects of our lives .
We will discover the importance of a unique fragrance and how to mix the ingredients in the right proportions .
This idea will create the atmosphere to tell us a story about crime and passion .
Nevertheless , this is not an all audiences movies , because it contains hard scenes not suitable for children .
Few other modern movies are so great in comparison .
The main reason is the convenience of travelling by car in comparison with using public transport .
Apart from that , there are many other benefits to buying a car instead of using buses or the underground every day .
First of all , a car gives such a valuable thing as privacy .
Additionally , if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life , it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars .
Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find a quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
Thus , it is clear that private transport such as cars has plenty of advantages .
On the other hand , we can encounter different problems while travelling by car .
Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon .
It means that travelling by car can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than car drivers . Therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
This makes travelling by public transport much safer .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires a lot of attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can do serious harm to other people .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own .
She went downstairs to the cosy bathroom and had a shower .
Anna was a bit stressed , but she was sure , that everything would be alright .
Anna looked incredibly beautiful .
Her mum went to her and hugged her really affectionately . "
My all - time favourite sport is basketball .
I started playing at the age of seven , when my mother encouraged me to join a basketball club .
It was very enjoyable from the onset , and has been a fantastic experience to learn the sport together with other children .
Another key factor was the coach , who knew how to convey the skills and techniques to children .
Moreover , I was fascinated by the feeling of belonging to a team in which each member shares the same goals and values .
One also learns to work hard and be disciplined in order to achieve success .
All these points have led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I 'm still hooked on it .
If someone asked me for advice on how to start playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a trial practice and if the person enjoys it , he / she could join the club .
When choosing a club , I believe it 's important that an experienced coach is present who knows how to teach the basics .
Yours faithfully ,
One of my favorite restaurants in Málaga is called Sun and Shine .
It is a different kind of restaurant , because you can find not only the typical Spanish food , but also dishes from different parts of the world .
What I like most about this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food , the flavor is fantastic , the food very tasty and carefully cooked .
On the other hand , the surroundings are modern , the place is airy and cosy .
The waiters are very welcoming and informative , so you feel very comfortable .
All the ingredients are very fresh and of the highest quality .
Finally , I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled .
I 'd like to thank you for the lovely experience you offered me .
Unfortunately , we did n't get the chance to see each other that night .
I suppose you 'd like to hear about my experience .
I started the evening by welcoming everyone and appointing them their seats .
They were such nice people and really appreciated my help .
All in all , a great experience ! You can rely on my help next year !
Thanks again for the lovely experience !
welcome to the historic town of Lancaster ! You are now in the vibrant heart of Lancashire .
However , the city centre also offers just as many opportunities for you to go shopping .
Whether you want a fancy bottle of wine , a secondhand wedding dress or an antique clock , you will find it in Lancaster .
You are offered the standard big brands like M&S , Next , Waterstones and others , but you can also find little independent shops selling all types of goods .
From soldiers who served in the trenches of France to the ceremonial functions in the nation 's Capital .
Nathan Cirillo is remembered as one of those soldiers .
A member of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada , he was killed at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in October 2014 .
One year later a commemoration of his passing was celebrated .
Unarmed , at attention , and protecting the memory of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice , his last moments and those who came to his assistance , exemplify the true meaning of being Canadian .
I am writing in reply to your advertisement in the European Observer of April 7th for a post at USA Summer Camp .
I am 44 , of Austrian nationality , married and hold the Cambridge English Advanced certificate since last summer .
I would welcome an opportunity to work in the USA this summer in order to practise my English .
Cheerfulness is in my nature and I am used to working hard . I would be happy to support the USA Summer Camps team in every aspect .
I am also experienced with children , having looked after my sister 's daughters , aged 9 , 11 and 14 for years now .
In the evenings , singing , dancing and torchlight walks are a good alternative to watching TV .
Also , I worked as an au - pair in France and Canada , where I looked after 3 , and 2 children , respectively .
I look forward to receiving your reply at your earliest convenience .
In the growing " sharing " economy , online communities are offering peer to peer for almost anything .
One of my favourite is eatwith.com .
Second , you choose a menu and make a reservation .
On the other hand , if you are a professional or an amateur chef , you 'll earn extra money .
There 's nothing like sharing a meal with local people . It offers you the possibility to glean information from someone who lives in the place .
My niece 's wedding was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
When we arrived in Barcelona , we went by taxi to the hotel which my brother had previously booked , and there we met with other relatives : my brother , his wife , my nephews and , of course , my niece ( the bride ) .
We all went together to have lunch at a nearby restaurant .
The marriage ceremony took place in a wonderful church . There were flowers everywhere , live music , three hundred guests and , of course , the bride and the bridegroom , the most beautiful and happy couple I have ever seen as far as I can remember .
The party was held in a large garden near the bridegroom 's parents ' house .
Taking a break between leaving school and starting college seems unnecessary .
Terrorism is everywhere .
Not many of us are going to risk our lives , especially when we all know we are going to have a fresh start in college .
However , for those who really need to fork out money to pay college loans , it is best for them to take a year off and work part - time in a cafe , or somewhere remotely interesting .
What if they forget themselves ?
What if drugs , alcohol , cigarettes took over their lives ?
Look , they are still very young and they are all prone to bad influences through parties without parental control .
There is absolutely no time to waste your youth on drugs and alcohol .
One day in the post office , I had an argument with a man who studied at the same university as me , and I challenged him to fight with me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .
After that , he told the teacher who was responsible for that class , and she called me into her room and asked me questions .
This story tells us that sometimes we can not control ourselves , but we should be alone and think positively or take a deep breath , and that will make us calm down .
I am Brazilian and I started to learn how to write in Portuguese when I was 7 years old .
I think this period when we start to write is magical , because we can access an entire new communication world .
This experience was very important and made me more confident about my English skills .
Back to Brazil , during college I started researching and writing about economics .
I had to write a dissertation and a thesis and , I will not lie , these writing processes were very hard , but I learned a lot about academic writing .
Today , I work as an economics professor at the Federal University of Goias , in Brazil .
Because of my work , I have to write all the time , to my students , to my colleagues and to the academic community in general .
I want to discuss the results of my research with everyone that is interested in it , from Brazil or from any other place in the world .
I expect that this course will help me develop my English skills , so that I can write my papers , communicate and discuss my research in a more effective way .
In the modern world , public transport has become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient . Travelling by car also reduces people 's journey time and they do n't need to wait for a particular bus .
It may also be because , as people are getting richer , they do n't need to use public transport as a more comfortable option is always there waiting for them .
Though public transport is more advantageous to the environment , people just want to get their personal needs satisfied .
While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with modernized vehicles , public transport may not seem to be a better choice .
More usage of vehicles may cause serious problems such as depletion of natural resources and environmental issues such as pollution .
Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive , it does not stop people from using cars , since convenience matters to them the most and not money .
If it continues , no resources will be spared for the future generation .
On the other hand , the most important advantage of studying abroad would be precisely , the exposure , which would help you understand the language from native speakers ' point of view and be aware of how some expressions or words are actually used .
However , as a disadvantage , we must consider the cost of studying abroad , because it can be rather expensive .
To sum up , the best way of learning English , or rather the best place to do it , depends on each person 's means and learning style , but it is definitely possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad .
Moreover , it is the most sombre day of the year , which recalls the Crucifixion caused by people 's sins .
Accordingly , the author compares Easter to a pagan spring festival , where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christian is joyful about the Resurrection .
2 . We flinch from consideration of Good Friday because we do not like thinking of a sad situation .
People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about death , suffering and self - sacrifice .
Today people are not willing to sacrifice themselves for other people .
Everyone is individual and worries about themselves , because it is an easier way to live .
4 . The author mentions the origin of the word ' compassion ' , in order to remind people of the meaning of that word .
Nevertheless , people keep this compassion tidied away , because it is too painful for them to stand .
Not only do they run away from uncomfortable situations , but they also prefer to see them on screens .
Actually , they choose the Good Life , because they can not cope with their own suffering without cultural understanding .
Maybe it was because I was with my friends and I could find many ways to spend my time with them or it could also be the great environment .
When we got to the resort , we all checked in and went to our designated rooms . I was sharing a room with my friend Emily .
Television is one of the most important inventions of the last century since it has had a great impact on societies around the world .
Since television was first invented , it has influenced different aspects of people 's lives .
Since television was launched onto the market , it has acquired other purposes besides entertaining , such as communicating and advertising . That is why the possibility of it having educational purposes has been widely discussed .
Television can certainly educate , it has great potential for doing so , because of the way it presents information and the range of people it can reach .
Television can educate in several ways . To mention some : by providing and extending information given on certain courses at school , and by providing information that is not even taught at school .
It is very exciting that entertainment and education can be merged to accomplish the spread of knowledge among the masses in an enjoyable way .
Television can educate through content whose main purpose at first was entertaining .
Television series , contests , movies , and news do it all the time without us being aware of it .
I am writing regarding the advertisement for USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I found this advertisement in the newspaper and I would like to state the reasons why I think I am suitable for the job advertised .
First of all , I would like to point out that I have some experience in the area , since I have worked as a group leader before .
Everywhere I have worked before , I have been praised for being very organised and having the ability to deal with unexpected situations successfully .
I have been a member of a basketball team since the age of 5 and I have recently become a young ladies ' group 's coach .
As for my cooking abilities , I used to work as a kitchen assistant during the summertime .
I did that for three summers and I still help out at my parents ' restaurant when a they are in need of a hand .
I would really appreciate it if you could take my application into consideration .
If you do , I would also like to be sent the accommodation details , if possible , to the following address : 62Dssy7@gmail.com .
Yours faithfully .
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which I saw in the International Newspaper to apply for the job in the USA Summer Camps .
This year , I finished my degree in Mathematics at the University of Zaragoza and in September , I will start to study to become a teacher .
Moreover , this job would be an excellent experience to improve my English and make me more self - confident .
As for my experience , I love working with children and I sometimes take care of my nieces who are 10 years old .
My degree took up all my free time this year . However , I tried to go on doing sport , especially running and playing football . I also try to keep up with the latest trends in sports events .
I would describe myself as a sociable , responsible , trustworthy and hardworking person who likes working with children .
I enclose my CV and I would be glad to attend an interview at any time convenient for you .
Yours faithfully ,
My favorite sport is football , but it is not a sport that I like to play , it 's a sport to watch because it 's beautiful , very cool and very exciting to support a team in a championship .
I love it when this event happens , so many incredible games going on , the best players in the world , three games per day at the start , and with very good - looking players .
I do n't know what exactly happens , but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes , everybody becomes happier , Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers , people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody 's house .
I love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems , or just shown us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects , a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delays in their construction , etc .
You just need a pair of running shoes and clothes appropriate for the weather .
In winter I go running for half an hour in the afternoons , but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather .
It started a few years ago when I was a little overweight .
After three months , I was running faster and the pain in my heels disappeared .
I am writing to express my interest in applying for the Sample Analyst position in your Laboratory .
I hold a Master 's degree in Environmental Biology and , previously , I have had the opportunity to work on international research projects that would provide me with the skills sets I need to be an effective fit in your laboratory .
Based on my understanding of this position , you offer full on - the - job training to your employees and encourage their involvement with all laboratory activities .
This opportunity appeals enormously to me and I feel confident that I can meet the challenges presented by such a role .
While engaged in diverse experiences ( including my research internship , environmental volunteer service , and other types of employment ) , I have maintained standards of excellence at university and demonstrated my ability to take on a number of responsibilities as well as to effectively manage multiple concurrent projects while meeting deadlines .
As an intern in a biological laboratory , I have been trained to quickly learn new fields , think through problems in an analytical manner and maintain flexibility within a demanding schedule .
As a meticulous , organized and result - oriented biologist , I pay great attention to detail , am skilled at gathering data and used to keeping detailed records .
In addition , working closely with a team of dedicated researchers has helped me understand the importance of efficient lab practice and develop my group - oriented skills .
As a result , I am well prepared to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams as well as to be effective at independent work when I am required to use my own initiative to complete a task or solve a problem .
Moreover , through my internship experience , I have acquired good analytical , quantitative and computer skills .
Beyond my coursework , I have taken an active role in international volunteer activities for three years , in the last of which I coordinated projects from beginning to end .
This leadership role required proficient communication skills , as I was providing support to people of different ages , backgrounds ( with varying levels of English ) or levels of technical ability .
With my relevant coursework , lab experience , committed and adaptable attitude , I am confident of excelling in this position . I would welcome the opportunity to join your team and put my skills to work for your laboratory .
Please find attached my Curriculum Vitae for your review .
Thank you for your time and consideration .

Referring to the job advertisement published on your homepage in September 2014 , I would like to apply for the position as a Analytical Development Team Member .
I am a student in the last semester of a Molecular Life Sciences program and I am looking for an analytical job .
Therefore , I was very interested to read on your website that you have a new position as an Analytical Team Member .
An apprenticeship as a chemical lab technician in a high standard company and a Bachelor of Life Sciences with specialization in analytical chemistry make me a highly suitable candidate for the position .
Furthermore , I have worked successfully for a year after my apprenticeship with different kinds of analytical methods and I was able to improve my knowledge in this area .
Besides , I have always worked productively in a team and GMP was common .
This job in Development would enable me to transfer my learned proficiency into practice in your company .
I am confident that my experience and interpersonal skills will strengthen the team .
I am looking forward to discussing this and other eligibility in an interview with you .
Thank you in advance for considering my application .
I am eagerly looking forward to hearing from you .
Her intelligence at a young age was a problem for her teacher , Miss Caroline , because she had never had such a well - educated pupil before .
Instead of celebrating it , she somehow inhibits Scout 's learning .
Furthermore , Scout often reacts very impulsively , mostly at a young age .
She goes after Walter Cunningham after she gets in trouble on his behalf .
Later on , Scout begins to understand , not least because of her father and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
On the one hand , Scout acts very impulsively and is an obstreperous tomboy , but on the other hand , she is very clever and more adult than others at her age .
I 'm very glad I can finally do something for you after everything you 've done for me .
So , you need information about my country 's eating customs ?
On weekdays , Dutch people take their breakfast , which usually consists of a few sandwiches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. At the weekend , we tend to sleep in and , therefore , take our breakfast a bit later .
Around 12.00 a.m. , most people have lunch , which also consists of sandwiches and is just as light as breakfast .
Let me also tell you something about traditional Dutch meals .
The most important ones are probably hotpots : mashed potatoes and vegetables , often combined with smoked sausage .
In my opinion , some of them are absolutely revolting .
A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty , consists of thick little pancakes , served warm with melted butter and icing sugar .
Those pancakes are called " poffertjes " .
Whole generations are brought up with this dish , yummy as it is .
Is this enough information for your project ?
If you want to know more about Dutch eating habits , just write to me , and I 'll write back , giving you any other information you might need .
My favourite way to travel is most definitely by plane .
First , on a plane , I can get to my destination much faster .
In a few hours , I can get to some far - away destination .
I definitely do n't recommend it .
Therefore , when it comes to speed and being able to go places , planes are definitely the best type of transportation available .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best assets people and nations can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from their own .
No wonder most training includes intercultural communication and cultural awareness courses .
However , it is probably a truism that reading about or watching films about a country are only pale substitutes for actually going to visit a place and experiencing the differences yourself .
And the longer you stay in a place different from what you are accustomed to , the more opportunities you have to really understand what makes people behave a certain way , what they really like and dislike and how their community works .
No one in the neighborhood had a clue of what was about to happen in the next few hours .
All of a sudden there was a loud voice that echoed through the neighborhood , and one can almost imagine the silence shattering like a glass .
Not knowing where the sound had come from , they were pulling out smartphones from their robes and jamming their fingers on the screen .
Almost all of them were heard shouting in panic " There has been a terrorist attack in our neighborhood " .
He was in disbelief , flabbergasted , never expecting that the person living next door would do something so heinous .
So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula ? That does not imply that he is a terrorist .
Not knowing what the intelligent thing to do would be , the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police .
After briefing the call respondent about every detail that he had known about Rasheed .
Sprinted towards what seemed like flames , only to find Rasheed standing across it , blood pouring from his right hand .
Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed , he quietly returned to his house .
Whenever there is a possibility to buy a new item , one should do it .
Suffice it to say , buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time .
Shopping without purchasing anything tends to be exhausting .
There is also a possibility of buying unnecessary items .
Nonetheless , the value of time is as important as money .
The main reason for this is the fact that free time could be spent in a more sophisticated way .
Obviously , shopping for food is not equivalent to purchasing clothes .
The article " Stairways to Heaven : Gothic Architecture , Heavy Metal , and the Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparalleled one in terms of the discussion it provokes .
The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for Gothic architecture , and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article .
In order to explain the nature of Gothic architecture and its major aspects , the author efficiently employs musical analogies .
One of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal rock music .
Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one , as it employs parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal rock music .
For example , the purpose of both is to induce awe and they both employ the concepts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these styles usually tend to abandon classical tendencies , and both rose in response to a new demand in the culture .
The public transport system is overburdened today .
The trains and buses are crowded , and newer routes do not reflect the changing demand .
Mass production has made cars more affordable for the middle class in recent years .
Also , the increase in disposable income has given more buying power to consumers .
Then , after you get off the train , you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Her cherry - red face glistened vigorously in the golden brown sunset like a perfectly baked pastry , as the last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horizon .
Finally , after a few minutes of walking , Alison approached a tree .
It jumped around ferociously as if everything was just a game and that is when Alison realised things were now so much better than before ...
Winter is one of my favorites because it is so beautiful to see everything covered with a white sheet of snow .
Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer , temperatures are not too cold and not too hot .
You are comfortable wearing a light jacket outside instead of a heavy warm coat .
Relaxing in the pool on a floating lounge chair enjoying cold lemonade is the ultimate experience .
Autumn is also a great season because of all the colorful leaves falling even though they are a hassle to pick up , especially in the pools .
When you drive through the neighborhoods you notice that families are all gathered in some kind of celebration .
My name is Natalia Maciejewska Quiñónez and I am a citizen of Castellón .
Recently , things have been disappearing from our homes .
I would also like you to talk to the police department , because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe , not ignore us and say that everything is fine when everything is wrong .
I competed in singing competitions when I was younger and I took acting classes .
When I was taking a walk through the neighbourhood , I saw this poster about the musical Wicked and they were looking for someone to play the lead .
Of course , I took this opportunity and two weeks later I had to do an audition .
Many people still consider television only as a way to relax , be entertained and stop thinking about all the problems that might worry them .
It is also important , though , not to underestimate all the educational possibilities that it gives you , as sometimes you can learn more from a documentary than from a school book .
What emerged from the discussion we had in class , is that plenty of students spend their free time watching useless reality or TV shows , procrastinating instead of studying for school .
As it is a very common phenomenon among teenagers , schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new .
A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabulary or improve your comprehension skills , and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable .
Getting distracted is extremely likely , therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel , as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing .
If I had to choose whether to consider television educational or not , I would definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what are the sources of the information told during a TV show , as it might be misleading .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disappointed with the town I live in because there is a lot to see !
I 'm really keen to show you all the interesting places around .
To my mind , you 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those first few days when you had to get to know your new surroundings .
So , as you asked me , I 'll propose an interesting place to visit where you could take a rest and relax .
There is also quite a big concert hall where , if you are lucky , you can enjoy some interesting concerts ( in general for free ) .
when I saw your advertisement , I instantly thought that I would like to work in one of your summer camps .
My name is Seraina Fennstermacher , I live in Switzerland at the moment , although I grew up in the U.S. I have two children myself , and I always liked working with children .
Since I used to work as a secretary , I feel capable of organizing sports and evening activities , if you choose to let me do so .
After this short description of myself , I would just like to say that I have only heard good things about your summer camps from my relatives in the U.S. , so it would be my pleasure to work for you .
Yours faithfully ,
Seraina Fennstermacher
People were counting on this party to increase public expenditure , but pensions have stayed the same .
People really need these improvements and you only gave them fake hopes .
One of the most disappointing things is that you played down the situation we are living in and the needs people have .
We were told this party would speak out against corruption , but now it is your own policy , and promises seem like they were a bad joke .
Fortunately , we discovered the real policy this party has and is really coming under fire .
People are noticing your promises are not going to be kept and I am sure there will be plenty of people complaining about the lack of truth in your promises .
Yours faithfully ,
Line of Duty is a British police drama , created by Jed Mercurio , about the investigations of AC-12 , a controversial Police Anti - Corruption Unit .
A large list of characters appears through the episodes , being the common thread that connects the two seasons the regular ones : Martin Compston ( as DS Steve Arnott ) , Vicky McClure ( as DC Kate Fleming ) and Adrian Dunbar ( as PSupt Ted Hastings ) .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistakenly shot by another cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sway his professional judgement .
Fleming plays his partner 's role , an AC-12 undercover specialist , who prides herself on being the consummate professional , unmoved by emotional considerations .
Both of them share a superior , Hastings , who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer ; zealous and suspicious , not being everyone 's cup of tea .
Even though widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards , he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances .
Their scenes are repeatedly stolen , though , by the real stars of the show , the officers who are under suspicion of corruption : Lennie James ( DCI Tony Gates ) in the first season , and Keeley Hawes ( DI Lindsay Denton ) in the second one .
With calculated precision , the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies , and throws in a few twists and turns that make your jaw drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethical principles and , nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal team , has got a nice family and has recently been awarded " Officer of the Year " .
To conclude , those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry ; Line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write the third and fourth series , and if you haven't tried it before , you 've just about got time to catch up .
If you were a UK tourist coming to Switzerland for a short weekend break fifteen years ago , you would have found yourself in a situation where no shops had Sunday opening hours .
But the situation is completely different now !
Now you can shop on Sundays although your shopping spree will still be limited to Zurich railway station and the airport , not to mention some limited choice of simple foods at occasional motorway services .
But it is an improvement , to say the least !
Although the size of the average supermarket in Switzerland will still remind you of a medium - sized village shop , there has been improvement there as well !
We can now see international brands we are used to in the UK .
Not a good experience for ill - hearted !
If you have strong nerves , do your window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich .
She immediately noticed that the glass was broken , probably shattered in pieces by those boys who invited her to play with them at the mansion .
She was just about to open the door to check the inside when , suddenly , a scream echoed from the house , the door slammed open and the group started running at full speed , chased by four big spiders who had just discovered that their home had just been occupied .
Sarah peeked through the door and immediately realized the evil intentions of the group . "
Usually he was energetic , full of confidence , ready to party .
She had fought too hard for this life and she would not let their long - standing relationship be ruined just like that .
He had never worked , but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remember their names .
" Have you got a mistress?",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast .
" That is impossible ! What would our friends say ?
And where would I put my wine collection ? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house " .
They definitely had different ideas of poverty .
However , all the people in his neighbourhood feared him because of his past .
In this way , he moved to his new neighbourhood where everybody respected him .
Their relationship had been excellent since the first time that they had met each other and two months later they decided to become lovers .
Although his life was perfect , he began to feel sick and sad and he remembered his past life when he was a child .
Finally , their relationship broke up and Michael fell deeper into his illness than ever .
At that moment , everything changed , he remembered his childhood , his recovery and his sane life . Then Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion , public transport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convenient and at the same time the easiest way to reach any destination you wish to get to .
On the one hand , public transport is slow and uncomfortable .
People have to sit next to other people they do n't know for a long time . In other words , you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers .
Pickpockets are frequent and you might end up being robbed , losing your money , credit cards and personal ID card as well .
On the other hand , travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not know so well .
Furthermore , you can choose an alternative road , rather than taking a main road .
This way you will have the chance to have a more relaxing journey through the countryside , traffic will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally , you can plan the time you want to arrive , using a GPS or other technology to help you plan your journey .
To sum up , travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town , but when you have to travel outside your specific territory , nothing is better than a car .
Well , on this particular morning , Michael seemed to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be energetic and very vibrant that particular morning .
His attention to detail appeared to be trustworthy and correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged , because of how reliable he is .
Well , the day 's responsibilities , in Michael 's mind , had been successfully accomplished and he felt really confident about all he had accomplished .
Needless to say , Michael could n't have been any more deceived than he had realized , because the unfortunate thing is that when he was doing his walk - through in all of his department the inventory that was supposed to be submitted was in fact inaccurate .
I know you are under a lot of pressure because of your final exams and I can really understand how you are feeling right now , buried in a mountain of books and notes , with no free time for other things or just to relax .
You should forget fast food like McDonald 's hamburgers !
To answer this question , the first thing to consider is if young people really have sincere values , or on the contrary , if they are only simple copies of a current model of a fake society which imposes unattainable stereotypes on them .
Nevertheless , far from arrogance and vanity , we can still find some young people who have interesting personal values that are used by them to define their lifestyle .
Some values such as solidarity and empathy , that were believed lost , can appear surprisingly in the personality traits of many young people today .
In addition , these personal values joined others such as courage , curiosity , imagination and the sense of adventure , are important aspects to consider and they can become very effective weapons to change the world if they are used suitably .
Considering all this , nowadays it is socially important to develop positive values among young people , such as respect and tolerance , to create honest adult people .
The 21st century has given a new meaning to the word friendship .
From what evolved as a comradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship , it has moved forth to relationships where people have not even met one another physically .
Today , with technology , friends are made at the click of a key , be it on social media or mobile devices .
Friendship was nurtured and we took time to do activities with friends and best friends were limited to one or two of the closest associates .
Friendship stood the test of time and grew stronger with disagreements , fights and misunderstanding , all being resolved and forgotten in the name of friendship .
Today a minute incident can just tear apart a friendship .
Today , friendships are take take take and very few stand the test of time .
Friendship today is a friend or friends for each season and reason , while the friendship of the past was whatever the situation or time a friend stands through .
I 'm 24 years old , so I belong to the previous generation , when family , school and life in general worked in a different way , from my point of view .
However , this does n't mean that my parents , especially when I was a child , always told me " yes " and let me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grew up with many " no " s , and I do not always agree with them in different situations .
Because nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in every way by their parents : they buy them whatever they want , and behave like " friends " .
This does n't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their children ; on the contrary , a child should talk to their family , asking for advice or just to confront each other , because communication is at the basis of relationships of every kind .
The Miracle is an extraordinarily large resort .
The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club makes to the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kids Club 's members everywhere in the hotel , except for your room .
The hotel handles privacy very well and I guess most of the guests will appreciate it .
In conclusion , the Miracle Resort is a very beautiful and appealing place to go .
A more compact building would be more appreciated by most people .
So a lot of them go abroad in order to find a good job in better conditions .
Unfortunately , my girlfriend and I need to do it too .
I have finished my degree and my girlfriend is just about to do it .
Our plan is to go to Birmingham with my cousin Daniel who has been living there for 3 years and to stay with him just the time we need until we can find a job and a place to spend three months because we must return in October .
As I said before , the main objective is finding a job there , gaining some experience and improving our English level .
I think that it would be quite easy for Montse to find a job , but I am quite worried about my opportunities .
If I am lucky , I would apply for an interesting job , but I think that I will apply for a normal job such as barman , working in a factory , etc .
If everything goes as expected and we both find a job , we will visit the city of London .
Most of the students at Laura 's new school do not talk to her . They are a little bit too cautious about interacting with her .
Frustrated , Laura accepted her new life of solitude outside of the secret society of others .
He thought that this was very brave , but he did n't have enough confidence to tell her that .
" Sense8 " is a new kind of television series that has grasped the attention of millions of viewers from the first episode .
This TV series is presented by Netflix , an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show , anywhere , and on any device .
The first difference when compared to ordinary TV Shows is that all episodes from Season One were released at the same time .
This seems like a small thing but it represents a major change in the way people view TV shows .
The series provides an unorthodox insight into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit .
This connection allows them to see through each others ' eyes , and even control each others ' movements .
In order to make the series more interesting , the directors decided that each of the eight chosen ones would be in a different country .
This decision made the series extraordinary , with scenes filmed in Seoul , Nairobi , San Francisco , Mumbai , London , Berlin , Mexico and Chicago .
The series provides an amazing window into eight different , and extraordinary worlds , with beautiful landscapes .
To sum up , I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science - fiction , but also to anyone curious about different cultures as " Sense8 " provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters , their surroundings , religions , and traditions .
To be honest , in the questionnaire you sent , I could give a positive response to most of the questions but I do n't consider myself a code expert .
I could n't answer , in particular , the questions about PHP and MySQL .
In JavaScript I have some experience but not of the necessary quality that is required for such a position , I think .
If I have to , I search the web for information and implement it but it requires time .
Perhaps there is some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity .
I am very interested in multilingual jobs , with German , Spanish , English and Italian , related to marketing , IT web - analytics , Customer service ...
Do n't hesitate to contact me if you have some offer that you think could fit with my background .
I 'm always open to new interesting suggestions .
Why is it that whenever Ina Garten , Ana Olson or Nigella Dawson is on , I tend to stop everything that I 'm doing and just get fixated on the TV ?
It 's so relaxing and very informative . I never get bored .
Cheesecake , for me , is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to outline some aspects of my experience , such as , with whom I stayed , where I spent the week and what places I visited .
I will also make reference to some suggestions that might help to improve the exchange programme .
Particularities of the exchange
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students ' exchange programme .
His name is John , and like me he is doing a degree in Physics Engineering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center , such as CERNE , conveniently located a few miles away from his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest - free loans available to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
This would allow considerable numbers of talented students to benefit from an opportunity which they would otherwise be unable to take .
Before addressing the question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind you that both activities ( spending time on a computer and watching television ) are harmful for children's / teens ' health .
On the other hand , it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television .
With the help of computers , young people can meet new friends , find out a lot of information , take part in forums and discussions .
Surfing the Internet needs imagination , logical thinking and knowledge .
Young people are able to choose what they want to watch / read / listen to , and the choice is practically unlimited .
Television ca n't give such an opportunity .
And the idea that , by spending time on Internet chats , young people develop their social skills , is problematic .
But getting used to the Internet 's rules of communication , they might find it difficult to face up to reality , and make friends in the real world .
This restaurant was recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner from this restaurant a few years ago .
This restaurant specializes in southeast Asian cuisine and it is called The Chai .
Personally , what I love about this restaurant is the ambiance .
Besides that , this restaurant is located in the heart of one of the most popular cities in southeast Asia , Kuala Lumpur .
I was blown away by the breathtaking view of the city from my window .
From my experience , I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality , not to mention how delicious the food is .
Not only that , I was spoilt for choice as I flipped through the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranged from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the list goes on .
The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the food on the menu .
I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
But if you know how to deal with your anxiety during the exam period , you can take the success of passing exams for granted .
Place it in the most visible and strategic place in your room and stick to it .
Speaking of mental and physical health , you should definitely get enough sleep .
Without mind and body regeneration , you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest .
The more oxygen you get for your organism , the easier you will be able to concentrate on anything you do .
Communication is one of the biggest problems among today 's teenagers .
The telephone was a convenience , something used to help people communicate , to make their lives easier .
Today , the Internet is one of the most effective and efficient ways to communicate .
Telephones changed , technology became smarter and allows people to stay connected everywhere they go .
Despite the large number of advantages that the Internet and phones give us , the use of technology affects people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We communicate through our accounts , emails or chats .
The worst thing is that people do n't know how to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or even with old friends .
Nowadays , communication face to face is something rare and , most of the time , accidental .
I will give you some information that should help you during your stay here .
There are n't many guidebooks about my city so I will recommend you a place worth seeing .
The most interesting place is the Park of Tradition , opened last year .
In the centre of the park there is a shaft which is . The shaft is beautifully illuminated at night .
There is also a building which can be considered an interactive museum .
In a very interesting way you can find out something about the history of Siemianowice and about mines .
What impresses me the most is the combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks .
There is also a cafe which serves traditional Silesian cuisine .
During summer , the park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events .
Basketball - the best sport ever !
I 'm sure you 'll agree with the fact that basketball is a good sport for the body and soul too .
As well as being a great way to stay fit , basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player .
That 's why basketball is my favourite sport and it should be yours too !
If you are thinking that you should do some sports , you would really enjoy playing basketball .
Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as few as two people , even if the official games of basketball require 10 people .
I think that you should start practicing this sport because it helps you physically and mentally and it is a good way to socialize .
After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents ' life - not him , Marianne - for life , or leaving and starting afresh , he had finally chosen the latter , thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment .
But now , every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself , having second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he shared with Marianne .
He had taken her out to a five - star restaurant , which she insisted was too much , which got Michael to insist that it was okay .
But all awkwardness aside , it ended with a first kiss .
A few weeks later saw the occasion of their first fight .
Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throwing things at the wall , crashing plates from the counter to the ground , the whole nine yards .
A week later , he found that Marianne was cheating on him with a European businessman he did n't have the mind to remember the name of .
It was the unofficial end of the relationship , the decision before the actual talk .
Secondly , many people argue that society has experienced great changes in family life .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Just to make everything worse , on his way to the office , he slipped on the snow and fell on his back .
Peter got there and had to take practically all of his clothes off because the office was like an oven .

The first episode aired in 1963 and , since then , Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci - fi TV shows on television .
Actually , last year was its 50th anniversary and to celebrate it a special episode in 3D was broadcast .
It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor . It appeared on the news , in newspapers and on the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .
However , I really liked experiencing that because I had never seen the media in Spain pay so much attention to a TV show .
If we had stayed more time , we would have been able to spend more time at the shop , but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with , because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role .
Anyway , before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor 's role , the fans had started making speculations about who could act as him .
Thanks to it , I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourite TV shows .
I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention . Also , I like it because the plot is incredible . Something that happened in season one can be connected with some of the later episodes .
I am writing to apply for the job in summer camps which was advertised in the USA newspaper last week .
As I am studying physical education , I have a lot of experience of looking after children .
Last year , a group of little kids came to university and we had to teach them several games and outdoor activities - thanks to this project , I am able to organise entertaining sports and activities .
I would be able to start immediately .
I hope you will consider my application - I can be contacted by email at any time .
Yours faithfully , Julieta .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She 's been talking to him plaintively to put him to sleep , reading him the same old tatty paperback book with one fairy tale only .
Most , if not all , of the inhabitants of this planet would answer ' yes ' .
Last century provided us with countless opportunities to be more mobile .
We , humans , can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical for the first time in all our history .
There are still borders , both on maps and in minds for us to overcome , but the situation has changed drastically in a century or less .
Of course , most westerners were already able to imagine the globe with relative accuracy , but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours .
By ' shades ' I mean not real colors , but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes into contact with .
China and India were almost of the same accessibility for the ordinary carpenter from Edinburgh as they were for his predecessor five centuries ago .
- Nelson Mandela . I believe that education is important and it is able to bring about enormous changes to an individual .
That 's why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences to be a teacher in my future career .
From these experiences , I discovered that teaching people will never be an effortless job .
As a teacher , I have to be considerate , unbiased , trustworthy and decisive .
I have to try my best to take care of all students and to ensure that the contents are accessible for them .
I have gained a lot from these experiences .
Moreover , I also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest in 2015 .
Although I was not able to attain any awards in the competition , I gained a lot of public speaking skills from the competition .
These experiences were tremendously memorable for me and it was an honor to take part in these events .
Apart from that , as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communication between people , I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself .
Starting from F3 , I learnt Korean and I attained level 5 in TOPIK ( Test of Proficiency in Korean ) .
Learning languages is indeed difficult and painstaking .
Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me , they can also bring me satisfaction and gratification .
It is my aspiration to devote my time to the study of English and education .
I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages at university .
It has been my life goal to become an English teacher in order for me to make contributions to our society .
Therefore , I have always wanted to be offered the chance to take an English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal .
I hope that I can be one of the candidates you find suitable for your university .
In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives , taking into account the changing schedules .
However , it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone , and proper times to learn .
Of course , we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but , mostly , whenever we need .
Using the phone during breaks lets the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students ' , schools ' and parents ' lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts permitting students to use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it into our habits .
Of course , when we are talking about children and education , it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages .
For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking on the phones as a means of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
As I said , it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents , so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need .
Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated into the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers , in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
Technology and , mostly , mobile phones , are part of children 's and parents ' lives , so schools should n't ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't have a negative effect in education .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them , in order to be informed about this important issue .
Yours faithfully ,
This report aims to present different advertising strategies for our products according to the type of customers we have .
In addition , I will recommend the best kind of advertising for our needs .
First , to have a successful campaign , it is important to know the target market .
After studying our advertising options , it was found that two of them could be suitable for our purpose .
One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks .
As I mentioned above , the advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market .
I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls would be more effective for us .
In conclusion , we have different options for this campaign .
If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product , I can assure you that we will succeed .
Now things have changed : parents work full time and do not take up a lot of their children who are more and more alone and unsupervised .
When the home is empty , teenagers feel free to spend all the time lying on the couch , playing video games or watching awful programmes on TV .
At the same time , they gorge themselves with every kind of food they find in the refrigerator .
A sedentary lifestyle and a poor diet lead , of course , to obesity .
This is a common issue . In fact , juvenile obesity is increasing with bad consequences such as premature diabetes or a permanent disease .
For those people who want to combine fun and health , a good solution could be running , which is a free , competitive and complete sport .
In Milan , the association Runners from Mars welcomes thousands of runners who compete for charity .
One day I dreamt that I was a millionaire . I bought a huge detached house surrounded by tall trees in a beautiful city , maybe in a city like Seville .
Downstairs , there would be 5 bedrooms with big beds , 2 bathrooms , one of them with a Jacuzzi , a beautiful kitchen with an American fridge ( one of those that have 2 big doors ) and a table in the center , where I could eat with my family , and a pleasant living room with two or three large sofas .
Upstairs , there would be a games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally , a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could watch our favourite films .
I think I would be a suitable person for the job as I love organising activities for the little ones and spending time with them as well as preparing different types of meals .
Three years ago , I worked as a Spanish teacher in an Australian boarding school .
At the weekends , I carried out a workshop on leisure activities for children in need .
In that place , we worked as part of an incredible team that organised different activities each weekend .
The experience was great and since then I 've always wanted to have the experience of working again in an English speaking country .
Yours faithfully , Andrea .
The human race began from the jungle , where they lived with the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees , and now the journey of the human race has come to the same scenario , where once again , he is living with the fears of wild beasts called ' other humans ' and under the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwart buildings that may collapse either due to an earthquake or to a terrorist attack .
This is the world of globalisation where the entire world is one market .
Every person is marketing himself ; is selling himself ; is presenting himself as a decorated gift - item .
This is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge at out fingertips because of the Internet , we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
With knowledge and information , things become comprehensible but more complex .
The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions in the world .
It , today , has millions of followers who believe in its philosophy that reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied - up because of the constant pull of the strings of his past lives .
Interestingly , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements , for they have constructed machines that exhibit the workings of brains through waves and software that questions a practitioner and provides him with a solution to his worries .
They were simple yet profound , relying on the comprehensible philosophies of forgiveness and karma .
Scientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions . However , ironically , it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology .
Likewise , there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who , time and again , circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation ( the Illuminati , for instance ) that runs the world secretly and plots all the pre - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorists assert that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules over the international media , thereby being omnipotent .
Furthermore , they concoct stories and concepts , publicise them while making animated versions all over the internet .
The brilliance of their presentations is so acute that an ordinary man is almost forced to feel enlightened in his ignorance , finally becoming brainwashed .
The same technique is used by politicians , iconoclasts and leaders who pollute the minds of the people through the medium of technology .
They present complex information so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thus , by all means , today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to locate and obtain endless information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes the common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being - exploited life .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses , because , by Grade 5 , children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations .
Second , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus .
In daily life , many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation .
In other words , if parents spoil their offspring , then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
In conclusion , it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure , but also help them become independent young adults .
I am writing in response to your advertisement on the noticeboard in our language school inviting applications for the post of Club organiser .
I am a forty - year - old secondary school teacher of Art and I believe I have qualifications that you may be looking for . I have been teaching students for approximately 15 years .
I enjoy participating in debates .
I would describe myself as a good listener and a fluent speaker with a strong ability to control discussion .
If you would like to take my application further , then I would be pleased to hear from you .
Yours faithfully ,

Entertainment and food
Not only does River Boat Disco have its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more than suitable for this occasion .
Although Milford Comedy Club offers a fun night with four established comedians , the only food available is snacks .
However , the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early , at 10:30 pm , whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
The price for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Even though the price is $ 5 less for the comedy club , it is without food and , by the end of the night , I do not think there would be much difference .
It would be possible to organize a bus , which would be preferable to going separately by car .
However , the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi .
Recommendation
" Manjiare Di Roma " - An Italian Restaurant
This Italian restaurant is in Monção and near the school .
It was opened about four years ago by two friends who had previously worked at pizza places .
As you enter the restaurant you are met with the traditional Italian restaurant red towels and a bit of a rustic feel , behind the counter you can see the cooks making the pizzas .
There is a great variety of dishes , from starters to main dishes and desserts . My recommendation is garlic bread as a starter .
This restaurant is very affordable . The prices are extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because there 's a special menu called " student 's menu " where you choose two ingredients for your pizza , with or without French fries , and a drink for about three euros .
All in all , I think this would be the best restaurant for our class to go to , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
As a result of finding this solution , they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment .
Not to mention the huge advantage that people are protected from earthquakes because these houses do not have direct contact with the earth .
These cars can go down to their destination and then , go up again until the driver pushes a button .
Lots of the buildings are skyscrapers and the architecture has completely changed .
People are still human beings and act completely normal .
They seem happy with the way they live and embrace the change in everything .
Now let 's return to the present , because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future , eventually .
I read your advertisement in the Cloud magazine and I consider it an interesting experience .
I 'm an Italian native speaker aged 27 and I 've been studying Sport Science at Milan University .
In 2012 , I got the Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've been improving my French to pass the exam .
It 's six months since I started teaching gymnastics in a primary school near Milan and I discovered that children are more competitive and honest than adults and I appreciate this .
I am also aware that they are reckless , so I recently attended a First Aid course , which has given me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
I always try to motivate them with some educational play and I make them understand how important the group is .
For references , you can contact the principal of the school , who will be happy to supply you with any information .
Taking a gap - year before starting university is a lifetime opportunity for lots of people .
You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on the university campus .
After you finish studying , you will have to immediately start working unless you want to live with your parents for the rest of your life .
It could also be potentially your last chance to spend so much time with your high school friends .
You will definitely part ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime .
You only live once and wasting such a great possibility is unthinkable .
Over the last decades , the spread of technology in our daily life has marked the beginning of a new era .
Computers , mobile phones , the Internet have undoubtedly changed our way of thinking and behaving .
But can we safely regard this technological advance as a proper achievement of modern times ?
Certainly , computers and similar devices give us the priceless opportunity to make our lives simpler .
However , the main drawback of such progress is that we now rely more on computers than on our own capacities .
We are slowly but inexorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that even a single day without technology would turn out to be a nightmare .
We consult Tripadvisor , we die for positive ratings and we increasingly forget to care about simple things .
In my view , we should all reconsider the role that computers have gained in our lives .
Technology is not reality and should never replace it .
It was the last year I was attending high school and final exams were approaching faster than I had thought .
The only thing I knew was the date of the exams was becoming more threatening as time went by .
Then , when it was finally my turn , I sat in front of the teachers and , slowly , I introduced my speech .
After this event I can cope with anything !
As was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow us to obtain that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context . Even so , the data collected and the following conversation with the teacher , contributed to obtaining an interesting picture of how Arts and Crafts is considered and carried out under the CLIL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects like Arts and Crafts , which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language , the artistic .
How to provide students with more real and relevant input , in the daily routine of an art class , seems to be a challenge for Arts and Crafts teachers , who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language .
Despite the difficulties that CLIL teachers have to overcome , the truth is that the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way special .
What surprised me more positively was the level of peer support , the cooperation and the comradeship .
It is interesting to see how the students resort to each other when looking for help in a natural way , without the intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about the CLIL atmosphere .
I am writing to express my interest in the bar staff opening you have posted on our school 's noticeboard .
First of all , I strongly believe that I would be the most suitable applicant because of my long experience in bar service .
I know what is involved in late night customer service and how to deal with a loud environment .
In addition , my knowledge acquired by managing a bar and a certificate in hygienic food handling will guarantee a clean environment in your bar .
Finally , I would like to emphasise my professionalism towards alcohol service .
I am a bartender who has been awarded three times in international bar - show contests .
Certainly , I can offer professional bar shows and tricks to make your bar more attractive to the customers .
The time allocations you have suggested in the job advertisement also suit my schedule perfectly .
Yours faithfully ,
Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which makes them aware of the mistakes they are making .
While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .
I fully believe that this combined method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
Now we are going to evaluate the main characteristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower ( i.e .
In the first conical part , it is possible to feed in the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove . The difference is that , instead of a fan , here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it needs a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the purpose of a fan and a pump is the same : move fluid from a point A to a point B , but in one case , you have to move air and in the second case , water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Like in the stove , there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
My home town , an international city , attracts millions of tourists from all over the world every year .
Knowing a clean and tidy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shopping , both the authority and the citizens understand the need to keep our city clean in order to keep the tourists coming . Therefore , they are serious about protecting the environment .
To keep the city clean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally - friendly attitude in daily life : they refuse to litter . If they can not find a rubbish bin around , they keep their rubbish in a small plastic bag . At home , they separate the recyclable items from the rubbish before they get rid of the rubbish .
They follow the government 's advice to set the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees Celsius .
The government plays a crucial role in taking care of the environment .
It educates the citizens to cultivate their sense of protecting the city 's environment .
We are lucky to live in a city where both the authorities and the people have a strong sense of environmental protection .
Firstly , it is a way to get out of the routine , occasionally .
It helps to release the endorphins and anxiety levels in my body .
For example , it improves my cardiovascular system .
If any one you would like to start practicing this dynamic and amazing sport , I would tell you to try it as soon as possible .
So , give it a shot and you will realize it is one of the most amazing activities you can ever do .
We 'd had a lovely meal in one of the most charming restaurants in Rome .
We did n't understand a thing because the car keys were just in front of us .
So we rushed out the restaurant on suspicion of theft .
As soon as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mixed up car keys in the restaurant because both of them were exactly alike .
People seem to be living quiet , comfortable lives nowadays .
We have reached an age of high technology .
Humans will most likely continue to improve this technology and make their lives better for the future .
The men would only do the paperwork themselves .
However , not everything about life in the next 50 years will be positive .
Eventually , it might become so much of a precious resource that it will be used as the international currency instead of dollars .
We will have to find an alternative drinking source ...
There might be a few situations , when shopping can bring a headache instead of joy .
Personally , I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing a heavy trolley . Crowds in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the shop to another , because these shops are organised in a way which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .
That and the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encouraging .
Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male gender , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .
I believe they are genetically programmed to take away all your ' joie de vivre ' .
The constant grumbling , regular checking of the time , this anxious and adrift facial expression - how on earth could it create favourable conditions for shopping ? !
And believe me , there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them , it always turns out this way .
In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand the contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and have a great time .
You just have to avoid supermarkets and buy clothes in advance - so there will not arise the situation , where you need something really badly and it is not in your closet - and , of course , avoid male company . Better choose a female companion .
I saw your advertisement and would like to apply to work in the USA in one of your summer camps .
Since then , I have attended a course for the preparation for the CAE exam , and spent two weeks in Ireland during the summer working as a babysitter , so I have had experience working with children .
I love facing new challenges and am available to work long hours if required .
I also consider myself to have great organisational skills .
This can be noted in the fact that I was head of entertainment at my High School for two years .
During those two years , I was responsible for the organisation and booking of bands .
But before I could leave school I remembered that I had left my trainers in the changing room , just after football session .
-"Michie ! Wait for me ! "
Oh no , not again ... That stupid girl was completely in love with me , since last year she thinks that I like her , but she 's wrong .
She 's an impossible woman .
-"Thank you for the information . Bye " , I said , knowing what I was n't going to do tomorrow .
for the position you recently advertised regarding Summer Camps in the USA . I also have
plenty of experience with teaching younger children .
This experience involved tutoring children from the ages of 5 to 16 in various aspects of English and Maths
as a Surf Instructor during the summer holidays in my home town of Zarautz .
skills in sports and also a fun - loving attitude towards organising activities .
I have many references from employers and the parents of the children I teach .
I love dancing and I do ballet , which requires a lot of discipline .
I think that this is not a normal sport , but it has the same advantages : it burns calories , improves circulation , is good for the bones and muscles ... Therefore , it is a really beautiful way to exercise and helps you to improve flexibility .
I would really like to participate as a co - worker in this summer camp .
My mother told me that I can gain great experiences .
By looking after children between the ages of 8 and 12 , I can learn new skills that will be useful in my future with my future kids .
I am very energetic , cheerful and hardworking , which are the traits you are looking for !
On the other hand , I think serving within this area is the best opportunity for trying new abilities .
I am also a great organizer ; therefore , I can be such a great help with the evening and sports activities .
I hope you understand my point of view .
Over the course of history , life has constantly changed .
From the early nomad tribes , to the first human settlements , then to villages and cities to the formation of civilization , man has never stood still for too long .
Key discoveries have changed the course of history .
First , fire , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadays with technology .
The more knowledge we accumulate , the faster progress will come .
Mankind went from a rural based society to a modern skyscraper - filled civilization in just a century .
The discovery of electricity increased our productivity greatly .
With the advance of electronic products , information has become even easier to spread .
Then with TVs , information started to spread faster and faster until our contemporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands .
In the next 50 years , who knows what we will be able to accomplish ?
Education and technology are closely related , to a certain extent , in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years .
Although there are many differences between these two , similarities can be found as well .
The main similarity between face - to - face learning and online learning is that they both provide valuable learning skills to students .
Currently , all types of courses exist via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
Added to this , both learning options require time and dedication from students ; otherwise , knowledge will not be properly delivered .
On the other hand , the differences between face - to - face learning and virtual learning are numerous .
Firstly , online learning conveys flexibility in its schedule .
Students can attend courses when they decide , but always respecting due dates .
Another difference between face - to - face learning and online learning may be that face - to - face learning allows students to develop human relationships , whereas with online learning it is quite impossible for this to happen .
During face - to - face learning , students have a teacher - student relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop interpersonal skills and coexistence .
When doing a fece - to - face course , besides having an attendance schedule , people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given .
Consequently , both learning options have their positive and negative aspects .
Assessing these similarities and differences , each student has the option to choose the option which better suits his lifestyle .
Peschiera Borromeo , a small town near Milan , has an agricultural reality and there are many possibilities for walking around and training yourself for doing parcour .
Unfortunately , there is a lot of traffic , so the best place to avoid it is a little artificial lake called Idroscalo where people can run around the 7 kilometre perimeter or cycling in the open air while looking at the swans .
In this area , you can find many facilities , such as two swimming pools , a tennis court and a volleyball court .
People can also try canoeing at the local school or water skiing with a mechanical device that drags you across the water .
The speaker discusses the article , saying that taxes stand against free trade and in favor of protectionism .
In his opinion , the concept of protectionism in the world of global economy is not effective .
There is a good example involving developing countries , whose economies have been successful due to being the most open to free trade , and countries with low economic growth , which closed themselves off to international trade .
Although in the lecture it is admitted that international competition can cause problems for local businesses , mentioned in the article , he claims that it is worth competing with global corporations , because this way surviving local companies may get stronger than ever .
They can hire local people , give them well - paid jobs , and those people may learn how global corporations work , which is a good thing for local economies .
And finally , the article states that free trade does not always lead to a peaceful relationship between nations , but the lecturer draws attention to the European common market set up after World War II .
He emphasizes that free trade between powerful European nations makes a war between them almost impossible .
To test the research 's hypothesis , self - administered questionnaires were used on a total of 400 customers .
The target population included telecommunication service users who subscribed to a loyalty program .
The choice of the telecommunications industry in this framework is related to the vital role of loyalty and retention in this service setting .
Many experts have emphasized the market maturity and the number and variety of competitive choices among service providers .
A total of 309 complete and exploitable questionnaires were collected , with a response rate of 77% .
This sample size allows us to perform multiple data analyses ( multivariate and SEM ) .
An appropriate sample size should be ten times the number of items used in the questionnaire ( Sorbom et Joreskog , 1982 ) .
In this research , the sample size seems to be appropriate for SEM ( 309 > 27 items multiplied by 10 ) .
Games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment , but may also serve as exercise .
I like this game because it is exciting and challenging .
It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field with a goal at each end .
The objective of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal .
Football is played at a professional level all over the world , and millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to follow their favorite team , whilst millions more avidly watch the game on television .
In many parts of the world , football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations ; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world .
I learnt team - building , discipline , as well as teamwork through playing football .
There are many worldwide international football competitions .
One of the major international competitions in football is the World Cup , organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
Over 190 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals .
The finals tournament , which is held every four years , now involves 32 national teams competing .
The star I admire most in football is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , nicknamed Pelé , who is a former Brazilian football player and thought by many to be the finest player of all time .
Often considered the complete attacking player , he was completely two - footed , a prolific finisher , exceptional at dribbling and passing , and was a remarkably good tackler for a forward .
Since his full retirement , he has served as an ambassador for the sport .
I wish to become a professional football player .
In my opinion , holidays are essentially about being comfortable , staying in your element and simply enjoying your time off and not about creating uncomfortable situations if that might be the outcome of trying new things .
As stress and challenging work triggers exhaustion in many such as myself , I prefer curling up with a good book and enjoying a nice cup of coffee on holidays rather than generating any level of discomfort .
On the contrary , I disagree with having to try new and challenging things on holidays due to the fact that I take much more pleasure in reading novels , which make me feel all the rush of an outside activity but all the while keeping myself safe and comfortable .
Their acting is spot on and the costumes are magnificent .
She 's such a beautiful woman and plays the role beautifully .
The other actors are also really talented and bring to life many of the historical figures that Turkey had in that time .
I strongly recommend this amazing series to people who want to take a glimpse into the history of a fascinating country and experience different feelings together with the main characters .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to comment on the way people , and especially children , learn languages in my country , what foreign languages they learn and where they learn them and to recommend changes in the language - learning system .
With Germany and Austria being our neighbours and thus business partners to many Czech companies , German is the second most popular foreign language spoken , followed by Russian , French , Italian and Spanish .
Students at some schools also have the possibility of exchange programmes , but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event .
Recommended changes
I would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach in schools instead of giving private lessons .
I saw your advertisement for language courses in London and I am writing to find out more about the courses you offer .
Could you please send me more information and details of prices ?
I would particularly like to know how many students attend the school , and how many students there are in a class .
I would be interested in having more details of the social and sports
Are the activities included in the price of the course ?
Could you tell me about the cost of accommodation too ?
As a consequence , they become slim and they do n't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life .
On the other hand , teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones , video games and television , which make them be more sedentary .
Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside and running or riding a bicycle would be a better option .
Snacks , fast food , fried food and sweets are part of young people 's lives as they can find them everywhere : in the shops on the street , at parties and in shopping malls .
In conclusion , young people should behave differently towards their health and fitness .
The statement is rather too categorical , because to say that there is no future is going too far .
Sometimes the reasons for doing so are not to do with convenience but , rather more to do with economic issues or matters of conscience .
It is easy , fast and we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance - shorter rather than longer .
Raising people 's awareness of pollution and how we must have a more sustainable existence is what makes us look for other less selfish and handy options .
Public transport is always going to be slower , less flexible and much less convenient , but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet .
In conclusion , public transport will always have a future if local governments have policies to promote it .
It is never the attractive option , but it is the one which shows more solidarity .
Government jobs carry with them serious responsibilities .
It is therefore no surprise that a person 's age and experience come under scrutiny when positions in government need to be filled .
Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience , while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability , namely whomever is most able to carry out the job .
This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion .
On the one hand , many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions , and the implications of this opinion are clear .
Those operating at senior levels within a country 's military , for example , require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life .
Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country 's military , they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience , and this could have catastrophic results .
Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before being given promotion to important positions .
For one , younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government .
For example , young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s , a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully a rigorous screening process .
If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person , it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment .
It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people .
Although the above overview reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates undergo rigorous training programs .
Thus , a person 's age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs .
Promotional Objective :
One of the promotional objectives is to increase the awareness of Trivago in Hong Kong .
In order to achieve its objectives , Trivago invested more money in promotion in 2014 .
For example , they promoted their search engine through a television commercial and a Youtube advertisement .
Youtube advertising means the viewers have to be forced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video on Youtube .
Since most people watch television not for just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s ) on Youtube , they will be forced to watch its advertisements more than once .
Trivago has a very simple and memorable tagline , which is ' Hotels ?
Therefore , Trivago uses advising to increase its market share in Hong Kong .
Trivago is trying to demonstrate that it is the most convenient hotel search engine on the market .
Last but not the least , Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost all the advertisements are encouraging users to download its mobile application .
If more people download its mobile application , it means more people know its brand and use its service .
Current advertising strategy
We found one of the television advertisements which is currently being broadcast in Hong Kong .
The advertisement is about 16 seconds long .
There is a narrator who introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates " how to use its mobile application to search for the best value hotel . "
We will analyze its strategies from different perspectives below .
Television Commercials
In general , television is the most popular medium in Hong Kong .
Advertising on television is an effective way to communicate a service to the general public .
Since television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time , more potential customers will be exposed to its service .
If the advertisement is designed well , people will remember it .
Moreover , television has the advantage of being able to utilize sight , sound and motion .
Combining a catchy theme tune and a well - designed visual advertisement can increase the chances of viewers remembering the brand .
As designers are not limited to using only sound or still images , they can create advertisements that are appealing visually and audibly .
Background Music
Music helps stimulate the senses and focuses attention on the advertisement .
The background music in the advertisement is relaxed and excite .
It helps the audience to better recall the advertisement and store it in long - term memory .
It can also increase the retention of visual information .
Demonstration
The television advertisement shows the service being used .
It demonstrates all the steps from searching for a hotel , choosing selection criteria and comparing the price of different hotels .
Through the demonstration , Trivago can show to the audience how easy it is to use its mobile application to find the best value hotel .
It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly know what its service is .
On the other hand , as a mobile application , some people probably feel confused about how it works .
Therefore , with the visual effects , a demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application .
Informative
The television commercial presents information to the audience in a straightforward way .
The narrator directly indicates the functions of the mobile application .
For example , he says the application can instantly compare the rates of over 150 websites .
For those who are very interested in hotel searching services , they may notice such an informative advertisement .
In the television commercial , Trivago uses cognitive message strategy .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it as its unique selling proposition .
This strategy shows its profession and reliability for its target customers .
At the same time , it increases the confidence of customers about choosing its services .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to increase its popularity there .
It needs to utilise some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services for its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives .
On the other hand , Trivago also applies conative strategy in the advertisement .
In the television commercial , the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application to their mobile phone .
It encourages customers to purchase its services and truly make use of it .
Moreover , the " Means - End Chain " is adapted in the television advertisement .
Trivago can achieve personal value for customers through the advertisement .
Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasant journey with lower prices and the freedom of choose their favorite accommodation .
The advertisement can show that they are wise by using Trivogo 's service to plan an economical trip .
Trivago uses this method to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage , since the value of its services is increased .
Nevertheless , Trivago designs a tagline in the television commercial .
Trivago '' , can introduce the key idea of the television commercial .
Besides , it can also improve the consistency of advertising platforms .
As the tagline is catchy , if the tagline is continuously applied on the other advertisements , it will not be easy to stray from the main idea .
Other communication tools
Trivago does not choose radio to be their medium , as it is antiquated .
Attention to radio commercials is low .
Also , radio advertisements only contain verbal effects .
Without the visual effect , it becomes less attractive .
Even though people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago , they probably do not know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal word .
Therefore , the product awareness driven by a radio advertisement is not enough .
Likewise , Trivago is an online service , so a newspaper advertisement may not be appropriate for it .
Lastly , hiring a spokesperson entails high costs in promotion .
And there is a risk in hiring a spokesperson , as he may not bring an expected return for the company .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the audience 's focus may shift from the product to the spokesperson .
Therefore , a television commercial is likely to be the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong .
Jacob was absolutely furious when he saw what was going on outside his window .
Not even a month before , he had paid a fortune to get his place refurbished and painted .
How many times would he have to face this irreverence ?
While he was standing on the pavement , tears of resentment covered his face .
I think I have watched almost all the football matches in history , especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season .
90% of our conversation involves football and we can talk all day about it for sure .
First , whether played individually or in teams , it 's great fun and demands a lot of effort .
It has helped me to stay focused and improve my concentration , too .
As well as that , tennis gives me the opportunity to keep fit and meet new people .
Since it 's not very easy at the beginning , if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and practise at least twice a week .
Do you know " The Flying Dutchman " ? I consider him as the Dutch Superman of 2013 , since he has won some important sports competitions .
" The Flying Dutchman " , also known as Epke Zonderland , is a gymnast from Groningen who was the first man worldwide to do an incredibly difficult exercise on the parallel bars .
By performing this exercise perfectly , he became the World Champion this year ( and he also won the gold medal at the Olympics of 2012 ) .
For this achievement , I admire him quite a lot .
To summarise , my hero of 2013 is Epke Zonderland , because of his achievements in the gym .
My villain of this year is Clown Bassie , since I think his behaviour is unacceptable !
Clearly , travelling in your own car is much more comfortable than on public transport .
In my opinion , this is disappointing for a number of reasons .
Also , it is an excellent way of saving the environment .
Furthermore , we also save time : as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park , which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park , or wasting money on expensive car parks .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody 's life . We should use it every day to save the Earth , money , and time .
If you 're looking for a great film to watch on a rainy day , I totally recommend Alice in Wonderland .
Directed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of the fantasy novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young Alice troubled by a strange recurring dream , the loss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives .
Unsure of what to do , she chases a rabbit in a blue waistcoat , and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole from which she emerges in a forest , where she is greeted by many strange creatures .
The film features Mia Wasikowska as Alice .
The cinematography is fantastic , with wonder digital landscapes .
But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design . They really managed to create something amazing with the appearance of the characters .
If you enjoy a classic book , but with more action and a little bit twisted ; watch Alice in Wonderland .
I totally recommend it , you will not be disappointed .
Firstly , I should say that life nowadays would be unthinkable without science .
In the century of advancing communications and technology , it is hard to imagine the world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
People today are interested in learning about the surrounding world , about new civilizations and distant planets .
Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of .
By using computers nowadays , it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for .
They climb the highest mountains , dive in the depths of the oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science .
The present belief is that scientific research will solve all problems and do away with all difficulties .
That is why science is so important nowadays .
On the other hand , the greatness of science goes together with its disadvantages .
The obsession with knowing everything has led some of us to conduct dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives .
With its help , we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person must provide themselves with the necessary skills . " What can I do with my life ? " .
After all , a successful career is best measured by how satisfying you find it , and it 's easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting .
they nearly always reply with their occupation .
Through our work , we find an identity , we can find status , intellectual stimulation as well as wealth , which enables us to buy comfort .
Our working identities can change over time , our identity and behaviour as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader .
Our ability to develop our identity is crucial to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles , we need to shed our old identity and add new elements .
So when people say ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it true . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a self - fulfilling prophecy .
We can change our beliefs , actions and thus our identity through experimentation , practice and conscious self - discipline .
In an age when career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors , it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world , in order to develop and expand your career options .
While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds .
Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are considered to be .
Old buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money . They only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
However , even with these arguments , demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well .
With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated .
And on top of that , without public funds , there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
After all , the factor with the most influence on the demolition of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience , especially in a large city such as London .
Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt on your stilettos while you are making your way to a bus stop .
Definitely not a good way to start your day .
Indeed , the method by which a person goes from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
Transportation is very important in our daily life and , in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is convenience .
That is why most of us prefer to travel in our own car rather than by public transport ; not only because it keeps us within our own private sphere , it also keeps us dry when travelling on a rainy day .
Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced on public transport .
Next year I will be starting the Psychology bachelor programme at the University of Groningen , and I would like to earn some money beforehand .
So , when I came across this advertisement yesterday , I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job .
Those children are too old for babysitters now , but I love children and would really like to work with them again .
I believe myself to be a proficient cook , as I 've always cooked for my family at the weekends .
When I was almost three years old , my parents moved to Indonesia because of their work circumstances .
There I went to Surabaya International School , where I learnt English .
I like photography too , although I haven't been doing that for a long time .
I 'm interested in philosophy as well ; I enjoy writing essays about psychological or philosophical subjects , so every now and then I write an essay in my free time .
Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue because it is very difficult to give a clear - cut answer and so , it makes the process of discussion very exciting .
There may be a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing .
My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent .
On the one hand , I personally think that the desire to become famous is a great driving force that stimulates people and brings a lot of benefits to others in its wake .
It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be demonstrated by such sportsmen .
Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation of their clubs and countries as well .
What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that somebody 's desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on others .
It means that other people feel challenged and do n't want to fall behind and look like underdogs .
On the other hand , an almost equal number of people may have a contrasting point of view .
They give examples of when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless .
Such people tried to achieve their goal irrespective of the means .
I can illustrate my words with the example of military campaigns .
The desire of some countries ' leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame - seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question with " yes " or " no " because there is an almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view .
She could n't believe that he was capable of doing such a horrendous thing .
It was a strange atmosphere in the house and a chill went down her spine .
She went down to the kitchen and proceeded with preparations , but she could n't get rid of that weird feeling . ' Something is up . I can feel it ' , so she picked up the phone and decided to call Michael again .
" Hi . Where are you ? she asked , apprehension rising slowly . "
What are we going to do about Susan ? " said the unfamiliar woman .
" I do n't know . " said the familiar male voice . "
You need to understand this . I 'll pay child support and help you with the kid , but I can not lose Susan " .
Full of rage and disappointment , she opened the door and saw the woman sitting in Michael 's lap .
When she got home , she packed some of her belongings and drove to her best friend 's house .
After two hours , she could hear Michael 's voice coming from downstairs .
She heard heavy footsteps on the stairs and buried her head deeper in the pillow .
Don't!"she said and threw the pillow at his face .
Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated , aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual , physically , mentally or emotionally .
Bullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person .
It can be classified into four types :
Relational ( destroying peer acceptance and friendships )
Cyber - bullying ( using electronic means to harm others )
Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long - term emotional and behavioral problems .
Bullying can cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , and lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .
In conclusion , I would like to say that self harm , low self - esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools . We need to stop this .
Now to banish bullying from our school I ask all of you to take this oath : I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying . I will treat others with respect and kindness .
I will have compassion to not be a bully and the courage to not to be a bystander .
It is my responsibility to help others being bullied and to report bullying .
She was a machinist , and was currently working on some secret work he could n't understand .
I would like to apply for the job as a music and dance teaching assistant at your summer school as advertised in your advertisement .
I am a twenty - year - old student in my second year at National University of Culture of Ukraine .
Here I am studying dance and choreography .
Also , I can play several musical instruments , such as : violin , guitar , drums and tambourine .
Furthermore , I love children very much . The reason could be that I have three younger brothers and one younger sister , so I am the eldest one .
However , I have no experience of working with children , apart from helping my parents with my brothers and sister .
But in the dance field I have a lot of achievements , such as victories in different competitions and festivals .
And , of course , as required , I can speak English quite well and have a certificate that shows it .
My first memories of food are from my early years , as I looked at my grandmother cooking typical Spanish dishes such as paella or tortilla .
When I was in school I used to go to my grandparents ' home to have lunch because my parents were at work . I fondly remember my grandma 's great cooking skills that she still has to this day .
A few years afterwards , right when I started high school and hit my teenager years , I began eating bigger amounts of unhealthy food from American fast food restaurants that I used to go to with my friends some days right after class and during the weekends .
By the time my high school years were done , and when I attended university , I developed a certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish food , unavoidably combined with less fast food due to the usual dinners with friends .
Wonderful inventions such as the train , bus and airplane have allowed us the freedom to travel and explore this great planet for a lower price .
Industrialization gave us the ability to mass produce public transit vehicles so that everyone could be free to move .
Travelling by car may be more convenient on an individual basis but pollution is a danger we have to face .
If all of us used cars , the levels of pollution would be incredibly high .
Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport , especially trains as they use electricity and are less polluting than other means of transport .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadays and only the use of public transport can make a significant difference to the quality of life in our cities .
If those who run public transportation systems hope to make them greener in the future , they 'll have to come up with solutions that are both energy efficient and effective .
In conclusion , I think that public transport has an important role to play if we want to preserve the quality of life in our cities .
I believe that my background is suitable for this position .
My first degree gave me a good track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student and as a research fellow , allowed me to build a scientific way of thinking .
Furthermore , I have improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformatics and microscopic techniques , and I also would like to point out my high motivation to develop expertise in stem cells and pharmaceutical research .
In addition , I am committed to science and I am a dedicated , team - oriented person , who is able to work independently .
I am interested in an English Course on which I can learn at my own pace .
In addition to that , I graduated in Computer Science and there is a lot of information available in this language .
So , I need to have a good vocabulary to understand the materials I find on the Internet .
Finally , I have an interest in technology , the environment and science .
Yours faithfully ,
The city authorities have a very strict policy regarding waste disposal .
All citizens are involved in the process by organizing their waste in the corresponding bins and by making good use of the waste calendar .
Every house in the village has three containers :
The cost of the waste disposal service depends only on the volume of non - recyclable waste produced .
Eventually , the citizen becomes part of a very meticulous recycling process by looking to the cost .
On the other hand , the city provides a punctual public transport system , which is very convenient .
Trams are available 24 hours and tram stops are evenly distributed ; it takes no more than 8 minutes to walk from one stop to the next one .
Jack lived with his mother , he had no job , and when she had told him to be independent , he only lasted one month before ending up in poverty .
He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law banning new types of food . This had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes .
One day , before this new law was established , a crazy scientist created a new waffle , " the great , furry waffle .
There was a bit of a problem in his plan : the new waffle was in Texas , and he lived in Washington .
He saw on his mum 's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle , he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips .
Once he got to the laboratory where the pancake was made , he told the mad scientist that he wanted to eat his waffle .
It was a combination of bacon , meat , and cheese with a little bit of butter .
Have you ever stopped to think that some standards exist in society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards are called unwritten rules , which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create civilizations , while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
For example , I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about African American Communication , but he is also describing Brazilian communication at the same time .
First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly for a long time , without having clear reasons .
It means that you want to transform the dialog into a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment as you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
Surprisingly , on the other hand , a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule , and can be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian culture , if , during a conversation , a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are saying .
In both the extremes of speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of good communication .
Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to comply with the unwritten rules of vocal patterns successfully .
As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal space is another unwritten rule that it is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
When you are in a space where you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal space .
And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimacy with the other person .
In Brazil , there is also this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same as in the U.S.
Although Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are not tolerant of strangers invading it .
So , even though the distance between people is shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable with , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend a lot of time looking at others .
As a result , some people can make misinterpretations .
For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep constant eye contact , and for these women , this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
Differently , foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact .
In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture , since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
According to the article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazil , eye contact is prime , and you will be considered to be without interest in the speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to them .
The source of this rule is easy to identify , especially when parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get the kid 's attention exclusively , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that eye contact can have a strong influence on the cultural values of attentiveness and respect for the others ' opinion .
In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns are reflected in the communication values , which can be decisive to maintain good communication .
Also , personal space is governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians , meaning respect and interest in others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of unwritten rules in the cultural values .
Because of these varieties of values and rules , usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations .
Respecting these rules is the first step to understanding them and avoiding some conflicts .
He remembered that he still had n't studied for his chemistry test .
According to Ferguson et al ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Bond , Morton and Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after exercise .
Nevertheless , a study by The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , since they did not find in their study a significant change to systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Surprisingly , the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise .
Thus , the investment in research into the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improve quality of life .
In conclusion , the results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer performance .
It is unquestionable that some research found significant improvements .
In this present study , however , the rowing time of the participants was not shorter than times without supplementation .
Importantly , serious changes in blood lactate levels were not found either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase oxidation and would reduce lactate production .
Nevertheless , nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly .
Finally , it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing blood pressure .
By this action , beetroot juice may effectively protect the cardiovascular system during exercising .
Despite the present findings , more research is necessary to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By this action , athletes may improve their performance as well as their quality of life .
I read your article about technology and education in the newspaper yesterday and I am writing this letter because I strongly disagree with your personal opinion about teachers and education .
To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in that students have no idea that they are broadening their knowledge .
Of course , I make use of a computer and projector during my daily teaching , because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children .
However , my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated .
The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children , but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide .
Without teachers ' guidance , self - study may cause some problems for children , such as possible misunderstandings .
Networked educational content is not safe at all .
So , the teacher is a necessary part of the educational process .
Nowadays , young people graduate from universities , and come up with new and innovative ideas about the educational process , and so , the tradition will be updated in the following years .
To be more precise , new educational methods promote the students ' teamwork .
In other words , students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematical problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary , good students can help their classmates to improve themselves .
In this kind of education , the teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
Furthermore , it makes children more sociable .
In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages , but it can also make children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in school with other people .
This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communication problems .
To sum up , I am not against interactive learning and the use of technology .
My personal opinion is this it is not sufficient to cover the education process .
I think that it is efficient when there is a combination of traditional education and interactive learning .
This is a good option , especially during the summertime .
While doing these activities , teenagers will easily make new friends and develop new skills .
This sports centre provides a huge variety of physical activities .
One of these is athletics . "
Campo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athletics professionally .
Besides , you have the chance to take part in international competitions if you stand out .
This experience would teach you how to work with different kinds of people .
Thank you so much for this opportunity . I am very grateful for everything .
Most of the content produced on the internet ( 50% ) is in English and , last but not least , although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time , we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities .
About the accommodation . We talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English - speaking families because of the great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills .
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am certain that we will cherish every second of every minute there .
I was actually about to email you about the activities that are being planned .
Regarding the students ' preferences , they all love the outdoors , like parks and rivers , and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge .
Concerning this amazing trip , I only have two questions left starting with the weather , considering your experience with the changes happening at this time of the year , and the second and last , about what type of clothes you recommend , which is of great importance primarily to our female students .
On the positive side , travelling by car is more relaxinjg because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you .
Going by train , for example , you need to get to the next train station and , afterwards , from the destination train station to your final destination .
Often enough , you have to rely on other services , such as buses or taxis , to reach your destination .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas , electricity and other materials used is a lot lower per head .
Furthermore , you have the chance to take a nap , do some work or watch TV while you are being transported .
Moreover , you can be lucky enough to avoid big traffic jams , especially if you are taking the train .
Avoiding traffic jams , construction sites , accidents and other obstacles you may be affected by may result in a shorter amount of time spent travelling .
As a conclusion , you could say public transport will have its uses even in the future . While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time , the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary .
It is popularly believed that the golden era of public transportation will end soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and vans .
Public transportation modes like trains and buses have been immensely helpful to the general public throughout the past couple of decades .
On the other hand , travelling by car is getting far more popular than it ever was with the development of science and technology .
People who are based in rural and remote areas always prefer to use public transportation , according to researchers from Columbia University .
However , in some countries , public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly . This is one of the main reasons which have led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation .
Not only people in countries where there is poor public transportation , but also in the most developed countries , there is a great tendency to use cars instead of depending on public transportation .
Public transportation , on the other hand , takes a lot of time to travel from one location to another .
Use of high power efficiency and linear high power amplifier ( HPAs ) are growing .
Power efficiency and linearity are important factors in many applications such as cellular communication , wireless communication .
Higher power efficiency and linearity cause decreased power consumption , increased lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
The Class - E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain , theoretically , 100% power efficiency . The Class - E power amplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency , in theory .
However , in practice there are some limitations , such as switch on resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .
Secret agents have often been chosen as the main characters in stories and films , such as the James Bond ones , which managed to be really successful .
But what exactly makes spy stories so fascinating ?
There could be a lot of reasons , like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret . But in real life , what kind of person does a secret agent have to be ?
For instance , the ability to bear both physical and psychological stress is not something you can easily learn .
A secret agent works undercover , so his most important quality is possessing great skill at lying .
So , although the life of secret agents may seem fascinating and exciting , it is also difficult and risky and not so simple as the one shown in films .
