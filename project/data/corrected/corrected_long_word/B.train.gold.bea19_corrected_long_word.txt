I would like to make a reservation for next month , from 24th may to 28th ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I have questions about your booking policy .
I mean , after reading the terms and deposit policy , I understand I must pay for the first night at the time of booking and the rest of the stay should be paid upon arrival at the front desk .
Plus , if I cancel the reservation 48 hrs before arrival I will be charged 5% of the full stay .
I understand this part , but if I have to cancel the reservation , how should I do it ?
My favourite sport is swimming because it is the one I have been practising for a long time , since I was a kid .
I like other sports such as football and volleyball , too .
To conclude , I think this is a really good sport to start with when you are a small child to gain experience and , year after year , become better .
The first one is individual sports and in this kind you practise your game alone and you are the only player on your team .
Although some people prefer individual games , I prefer team games .
Because they teach us the meaning of cooperation and leadership .
I find football interesting because it teaches us a lot of values such as cooperation and onest .
I think it is the most interesting sport .
Famous people definitely deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
In our world there are many personalities , more or less known , such a film stars , musicians and so on , but why ca n't they have normal lives ?
Actually I have to admit , that film stars , politicians and other famous people have to count on fame .
With reference to your advertisement for the summer camp job in the current , I am writing to you to apply for it .
In the advertisement you state that you need a person who has skills relevant to working with children .
I would like to tell you that I have done a course on which I learnt to organise all kinds of activities for children , from canoeing to swimming competitions . Also , I worked in a summer camp last year , where I could put all the things that I had learnt into practise and it was a very pleasant experience which I would like to have again .
Because of that , if you want , I will send you a letter of recommendation from my boss at that camp .
I would be very grateful if you would consider my application .
Yours faithfully .
Everything 's OK .
The concert was just flubbergasted .
It really was amazing . I think , it was a breakthrough in my perception of music .
First of all , Balkan music turned out to be one of the most irresistible kinds I have ever heard .
The mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music , probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music .
With reference to your advertisement posted on the web ( CareerCast IT ) a few days ago , I am sending you attached my curriculum vitae in support of my application for the following position : Graduate Project Engineer , which is being offered at your company .
I have never worked as an engineer , but I am experienced in electronics as a hobbyist since I was a child . I have my own lab equipment and I have designed and assembled several circuits .
Please , feel free to get in touch with my teacher in order to obtain references for me : ( 5wYU8kZ1pS6@uniovi.es Phone : 34 123 45 67 89 . He speaks English fluently ) .
If you consider my application , it would certainly be a great job opportunity for me to gain experience in the engineering field and develop my professional career .
My ability to learn and work , together with my enthusiasm , are core strengths that could be of great help to your company .
I should like to thank you in advance for granting me an appointment for an interview and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
When we arrived there in July last summer , the owners welcomed us with a magnificent basket of fresh fruits in the room and a variety of drinks in the fridge , all included in the room 's fee .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone because there you will completely relax and it will really seem to you as if you were in heaven !
It still gives me great fun in the incredible company of my friends and it keeps me fit as well .
I definitely recommend this sport to anyone who wants to keep fit , have fun with their friends , and live a happy life .
At any time of day or night , we can see people eating in all kinds of eating establishments ; from restaurants to food stalls in the streets .
I would show you the restaurant which is my favorite choice .
If you are interested in my idea , I would help you to find one immediately .
We knew we had a competition and that it was a really hard one .
The other team was professional , they had won many competitions , they were really good , but Tom and I knew that we could win .
Our competition was on Monday . We had one day left .
I told Tom I wanted to talk about our achievements before we went home .
He also thanked me and told me that if it was n't for me he would n't even have thought about playing tennis professionally .
I am a university student .
I 'm 18 years old and I 'm interested in working in your Summer Camp .
Two months ago I worked in a kindergarten .
I have experience with kids .
I can also do different activities with kids , for example , singing , running around the garden , planting trees , drawing , playing instruments , etc .
I 'm the right person for the job because I 'm reliable and experienced .
Sport is an important thing for all of us because it helps us avoid disease and become healthier . My favourite sport is swimming , so practising this kind of sport is the best because it helps me feel fresh and relaxed .
Moreover , daily exercise is a very good idea which helps us to avoid becoming overweight and to keep our body healthier . So I always want to advise people to practise this sport or other knids of sports to avoid diseases .
During the last months , we have seen a huge number of new movies issued by many famous European and American filmmakers .
The first one is basically based on the true story of the main character , a financial broker , who is played by the famous Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio and on how he became rich by breaking the rules and speculating on the stock market .
Walter Mitty , in contrast , deals with the fictional story of the main character , an archivist , whose life is changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors .
Far from the moise and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street , Walter Mitty offers the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character 's life and adventures , through which he will discover his true self and will start a new life .
Although presenting a more lively plot , The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does .
I must say that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a well - constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie .
My name is Rebeca Costa and I am writing this letter about the advertisement for a job in the USA Summer Camps .
I think that I can help you with several camps activities , because of my background in volunteer work . I have experience not only in the kitchen but also organising and managing some youth sports games in my neighborhood .
I would like to know more information about how to proceed with applying and when this job will commence .
Yours faithfully
It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly in their private vehicles .
It seems more convenient to them to get around on their own rather than be tied to public transport .
It can be argued that public transport systems have been losing their popularity in many ways .
People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car .
This may cause people to get to their particular destination late .
Secondly , public transport seems to be getting more expensive day by day , which has reduced its popularity .
People therefore find cars more affordable for them .
Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase a car .
In conclusion , I would say that , due to recent progress in society , there has been a considerable increase in car ownership .
It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties , which I find awful .
That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who does n't , but fame is not the same as being remembered .
We can see that people become famous when they die , so , journalists are instrumental in creating a negative or positive opinion of that person .
" Nowadays , older people are disadvantaged because they lack the ability to use technology confidently . " Do you agree or disagree ?
The difficulty of learning something .
In our world , it 's impossible to live without using technology .
But this is an anachronism .
It 's impossible to stop science .
The question is whether older people are disadvantaged by not using technology in a confident way .
There is no doubt : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example , explains well and calmly the use of new technology to an old man or woman , in the end , these people are also in a position to use it .
New technology consists , for instance , in smartphones , tablets , PCs .
There are some old people who are interested in knowing how technology works , but others who are not interested at all .
For the latter , it 's not necessary to use technology , because they can continue to live without using it .
To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , anyone who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results might be lower than their expectations .
Dear Sir/ Madam ( director of the film department )
As requested by a local tourist office , this is a report regarding shopping facilities in my town and shops that will appeal to tourists with different interests .
Regarding the actual shopping mall , it has more than 30 shops with a variety of things , from fashionable clothes to delicious food and even squaint books .
Moreover , it is a source of entertainment for all ages .
Called in a malicious way , there are 6 floors for jewellery , clothes , accessories , gadgets , books etc .
To sum up , it would seem that downtown is a preferable place , with better value for money .
Although using your own car is better for moving around the city , public transport has been shown to be a good option for travelling long distances at a low cost and , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There probably is n't a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living in today . That is , if businesses continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure , they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .
In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to improve if the companies in charge want citizens to use their buses , trains and other public vehicles in the future .
Those improvements should include lowering the price , reducing the times or offering new destinations and more resources .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to share the experience of different students who worked abroad during the summer .
In order to do so , I conducted interviews with 30 university students .
Conclusion
Even if there are some disadvantages , most students agreed that this is an amazing experience not to be missed .
All in all , I suggest encouraging students to find a job abroad during the summer .
There are a few things which I am very keen and passionate about in the whole world .
This is not just a sport , but an extraordinary thing I do in my ordinary life , in everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrated , sick of passing fancies or fake friends , there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it : this is , of course , swimming .
So , I let myself drop into the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged , all the problems , sadness and heaviness of life suddenly disappear , and that 's the most amazing emotion I could ever try .
If I had to suggest a sport for children to do , I would recommend it , because whether it makes everyone be in shape , it is healthy and guarantees an high level of wealth .
I advise parents to let children begin swimming as soon as they can , provided they are interested in it .
First of all , the environment is contaminated and these substances get to us by water , air , food ... also clothes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves around us , even if we are living in the country or far from the factories .
If you want to live healthily , you must understand it and try to choose between the few real options you have .
The main advice would be to have a balanced diet : a lot of fruits and vegetables , few fats , to drink more water , etc .
Your health needs calm , friendship , happiness ... You must keep in contact with your friends and spend time with yourself ( do not forget your hobbies and learn new things ) and your family .
It is known that the Internet makes things easier than ever and can be used for everything .
One of the advantages of the Internet is that we can meet new people around the world and make friends without talking face to face .
In my opinion . I must express the facilities given by the Internet .
Did you know that your brain is exercised when you read books ? You should read the topic that you prefer like news , sports , novels , economics , health , fitness , food , cooking and you can choose material that is easy and enjoyable to read like novels , magazines , newspapers , technical books and things like that .
When you have finished your studies and you have gotten a job where where you do the same activities every day , the brain does n't work hard and you might have some problems like forgetting words , dates , information that you learnt a few years ago , because your memory wo n't work in the same way .
I wish to apply for the post of worker in an USA summer camp that was advertised in the newspaper last Monday .
This job is of great interest to me as it reflects my ambitions in life and requires my education , skills and experience .
With majors in linguistics ( to be more precise , the English and Chinese languages ) , I have recently got a second degree in psychology .
Two years ago , I worked as an interpreter and an organizer at the Waterski World Championships in Moscow .
In addition , as I have been determined to build my career as a teacher since my childhood and , moreover , I definitely have a way with children of any age , after graduation I gained experience at university and in a local school .
In terms of my personality , I am very hardworking , enthusiastic about a wide range of activities , open and friendly .
My opinion is rooted in my experience , so I really enjoy interacting with people , especially children , and to tell you the truth , I like cooking and experiencing new things in general .
I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this position .
My enclosed resume outlines my experience in greater detail .
I would welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
A wise man in the past said once , " If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climber , the strength of a shot putter , the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer . "
It 's exhausting and you have to move fast to get every shuttlecock .
You have to be competitive !
If you do n't know what racket you should buy , you will get all the information at the club .
Mostly , the badminton clubs sell all kinds of badminton equipment for beginners and professionals . Do n't be lazy !
I usually play three times a week and I had a tournament last weekend .
Every lost game gives me more motivation to practice harder and every won game makes me proud and happy about all the hard work that I have done in the last few months .
Those films are really good . You have a drama , a romance , and a thriller ; those films are very entertaining .
Another thriller that is really good is The Cabin in the Woods . That movie is really entertaining , and scary .
If you like scary thrillers , this movie is the one for you to watch , I do n't remember it very well , but it is also mysterious , so you will like that one .
This place does n't appear in history books , but it symbolises better than others a change in our country .
This building is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a short walk from Gaudi 's magnificent artwork , it is n't as famous as that .
When the Civil War ended , the country was completely destroyed and people had nothing to eat .
Particularly in Barcelona , the trouble was that they could fish in the sea but there was n't an appropriate place to keep the fish , so they could n't eat it one or two days later .
That situation must have been terrible for the population , but fortunately , there is always a possible solution .
Neighbours helped them to build the building and , after a few months , they began to use it .
This is a great example of how the Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without the government 's help .
However , the structure has been kept so that visitors can enjoy this popular architectural jewel .
He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle was n't really a battle , it was a revolution , where the fish were the citizens .
This meant some fish were damaged thanks to the revolution , which also meant that , while they were reproducing , the genes of the baby were changed .
And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish , they will taste different or simply change shape .
If there were a revolution in the city , obviously the fish would try to escape .
The homeless man had another dream where there was a pest around the forest that was contaminating all types of food .
When he woke up from his dream , he kind of having a skeptic attitude , but he was diminishing it .
Nowadays , it is more and more popular to take a year off between school and university .
It has many advantages and disadvantages as well .
They do n't know which university and field of study to choose .
The year off gives them opportunities to get a job .
In the beginning , it would be a simple job and without high wages , but you would get some experience .
You can get to know other countries and new individuals .
It is also a point that if you do n't achieve what you wanted to during the gap year , you are in the same place as when you were graduating school .
Last year , I attended an art course , which taught me how to make interesting things only using my hands and my imagination .
I have a certificate for high achievement in the areas of painting and designing things in clay .
Among my colleagues and friends , I have a reputation for being a mature , responsible and easy - going person .
I believe that this will give me the chance to consider my application and get the job .
Yours faithfully ,
Nowadays , television is very important in our lives because there are a lot of benefits and advantages to watching TV .
There are lots of interesting programs suitable for people of every age .
In my opinion , TV is useful because we can learn many interesting things and also reduce stress by watching TV .
We can choose entertainment programs which are full of fun .
The driving instructor picked me up at the gas station and from there we went to a parking lot near AMC and practised parallel parking and the k - turn .
The instructor dropped me back at the gas station and from there I took a bus to Princeton and from there I transferred to another bus to my home .
Micheal is a clever , shy guy who decided to look for new opportunities outside of his small town . After the tragedy of losing his father , he felt the need to move forward with his life and discover his real needs . No one in Micheal 's school was able to understand this weird , isolated guy , so he never accepted having new friendships out of his class , that ends when the class ends . Then there was that girl . A beautiful popular blonde who was in the cheer leaders and every boy 's dreams . One day , after a physics exam , she just stumbled into his bag and knocked his books out of it . " Sorry " , she said , with a sad sexy look ! ,
that look occupied Micheal 's mind from then on and led to him dropping his dream of being a creative engineer and abbreviated it all on his muscles and girls hoping that he might be noticed by her . Arika , the girl who was using anyone who could make her make a step towards her success and popularity . Michael felt that he was pathetic and deceived when he saw her with the class 's new clever guy . He could n't understand that giving up one 's dream is the worst decision and will lead to failure . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
To study 1 unit per week was difficult for us , because of translation .
We were faced with the real problem of lack of time for translating , especially closer to the end when our translators worked with very large texts .
It makes studying more effective and comfortable for us .
We 're also waiting for information about your fee , order of payments and other employment terms .
So , definitely , if you want to try this beautiful experience , I sincerely recommend it to you .
- I 'm absolutely sure that you need n't drink coffee every morning .
Try not to eat a very substantial meal in the evening and in the morning .
Yes , I believe that television entertains and also educates .
Watching the history channel gives us great information about the history of the earth .
Watching the National Geographic or Discovery channels takes us into a world of animals where we get to see numerous wild animals and their characteristics , which are really interesting .
Watching the daily news on television enlightens us about what 's happening around the world .
There are also many disadvantages to television .
There are plenty of entertainment programs which just waste our time with no other benefits .
It 's really depressing to see kids being engrossed in soap operas or some useless reality shows or cartoons .
Entertainments are a must . Everyone should take time off from their busy or hectic schedule .
If everyone uses television wisely , it can do more good than bad .
To USA SUMMER CAMPS department of human resources ,
I am writing this letter in response to the job advertisement for working in a summer camp in which I am quite interested .
I am currently studying for a marketing and market research degree at Malaga University . In September I will start my last year of the course , which I hope to finish next year .
The idea of working in the kitchens really excites me , because I would like to provide my cooking experience . I started it as an obligation because my parents where always working , but eventually , I liked it , and now I make all sorts of desserts and meals .
I know this is going to be your first visit to Russia and it 's really great ! I 'll give you information about two ways of getting to my place without significant expenses .
The second way is more convenient and comfortable .
As for the weather , it 's quite nice at the moment , but I suggest bringing something warm just in case as the weather is very changeable here .
I have just received your letter and I 'm glad that you have found my film the most interesting .
I 'm really pleased as there were about 200 competitors and , so , I would never have thought I would be the winner .
I 'm really sorry , but on May 15th I have an important exam at school , so it would be impossible for me to meet her .
Mr. Green , I 'm really keen to know who the professional film director is .
Particularly , in the south of the country .
Since many European tourists like to have their holidays on the beach enjoying the sunshine and also discovering the historical remains from the past , Antalya ( Turkey ) is the best city to work in .
In the case of workers , I would like to have accommodation given by the company .
Cyberschool have been attempting to present their new project called cyberschool .
Cyberschool is when students receive
Electronic gadgets are bad for our eye .
Some individuals might even become computer addicts due to the time they spend on their PC .
Travelling to school at least includes 1 kilometer of walking , whereas staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and healthy .
Finally , I personally disagree with cyberschool .
Cyberschool are n't interested in health and safety issues !
Now that they were back home , Paulina found out that her mom was in town , so by instinct she decided to go and visit her , as well her brother , who had been avoiding her because she taunted him by being in love with his best friend . They were n't together anymore , but that was such a devastating thing .
Genuinely , she knew , that begging him was n't enough , so going to their old house as a surprise would at least give her the chance to confront him instead of making a fuss about it . Despite this insignificant trick , she knew her mom would be really happy to see her daughter .
There are only a limited number of government buses on the road and their frequency is not good , so they get overcrowded .
People board these buses out of compulsion , as they have to reach their office on time .
On the other hand , the metro service is a good means of transportation ; it goes under the road , so you do n't get traffic .
The only flaw of the metro service is its unavailability in remote areas .
After a few kilometers , you will find a bus stop , but metro stations are built only in major areas .
So , even if you travel by metro , you have to take a bus or car to reach your destination , unless it is located near a metro station .
People who are rich prefer to travel in their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience .
On public transport , many people do n't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey . It is very exhausting , especially on a long journey .
While in a private vehicle , you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey .
Many crimes such as pickpocketing , eve teasing , violence , etc take place on public transport .
It has been an easy target for terrorists to plant bombs , so if you are traveling on a bus , you accept the risk .
Recent graduate vs. experienced worker
One of our seniors workers will retire in a month and therefore , as I 'm in charge of the Human Resources department , I have to start the search for a new employee .
It is a commonly held view that an experienced worker will facilitate the search of .
However , I would like to review another option , such hiring a recent graduate from a renowned university .
Any experienced worker would bring a sense of calm , steadiness , wisdom , commitment and experience , of course .
He would contribute his life experience , and he would ask for better working conditions such as salary , family time , and health insurance .
However , a recent graduate will be keen to accumulate knowledge and fearless of trying a different approach .
In my opinion , recent graduates are ambitious , without prejudices , and most of them are not family people as yet .
In conclusion , I would say that a recent graduate would be a great asset for our company as they will accomplish our targets .
What disadvantages does it have ?
Firstly , it is true that they have similar relationships to those we had many years ago .
The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch , such as emails and messages , instead of writing letters , which took a long time to arrive .
While it is true that social networks help shy people to make new friends , it is also true that young people write their messages with abbreviations .
After doing this regularly , they tend to have problems at school because they start to write incorrectly .
They also publish their conversations on the internet .
But when they do this , they expose a lot of details about themselves , details that everyone can see , especially strangers .
In conclusion , I think that social networks can constitute a big problem , especially for people who are not aware of what dangers there are on the internet .
I am glad to hear that you are interested in visiting Brazil next summer .
It is a little village where you can experience a different culture , find local handicrafts , eat good food and enjoy beautiful beaches .
Near " Taipus " , you could visit " Barra Grande " , where you can see the sunset at " Ponta do Mutá " and eat seafood overlooking the bay .
Television currently occupies a very important role in entertainment . However , one of the problems that society has faced since television became popular is that it is a distractor in education .
There are educational programs and channels which transmit good documentaries , but most people prefer other types of programs , such as cartoons , soap operas and soccer matches .
In addition , many of the educational programs are not transmitted by broadcast television and people without cable systems have no access to these .
So TV could become a useful tool in the educational process if more effort was put into this , from the television programming to the preference of society .
It is argued that whether the government or teachers have the right to determine what subjects should be taught in schools .
In my opinion , although there are some advantages if teachers are responsible for this task , I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission .
There are two main advantages of teachers deciding what subjects are taught in schools .
Moreover , not all teachers have the ability to design a high - quality course curriculum .
If the decision is made by central authorities , the most obvious advantage is that the assessment of students ' grades could be standardized throughout the whole country .
For example , a fair grade judging system is essential in a Joint College Entrance Examination .
Although some drawbacks may exist when this task is determined by the central authorities , a committee comprising experts in different disciplines could minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusion , while there are advantages and disadvantages of both central authorities and teachers leading this task , I prefer the government to do so .
On the one hand , friends are like a family because you live together a lot of experiences and adventures .
In conclusion , so family and friends are very necessary in your life .
Both texts contribute different approaches to the music industry .
Accordingly , the first one considers whether the industry has been affected by file sharing , whereas the second analyses the success of live performance in the present technological era .
The first text asserts that file sharing benefits new artists and offers listeners a wide choice of styles , despite the fact that it is believed that file sharing is detrimental to the music industry .
Additionally , the writer suggests that it has some potential which can be used by the CD industry .
The second text assesses the attraction of concerts despite the present high quality of recorded music , and suggests that the reasons for the success may be the communal experience and its offer of different songs and performances that make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , the music industry should adapt to new technologies and new habits of users .
On the other hand , personally speaking , I 've always been amazed by the attraction of concerts for large audiences . Therefore , in my opinion , the second text offers good reasons to explain this phenomenon .
The first place you could visit is FEXPOCRUZ . You will be astounded by the gorgeous girls and the fascinating business you can get there .
I remember that you are fascinated by nature , so you could go to Guembe to eat delicious typical food . You will see an amazing view and a lot of kinds of tiny butterfly , there are amount of variety .
If you want to go sightseeing downtown and enjoy the nightlife , I know a fun place where we can dance and drink a lot .
If you need more information about this city , let me know .
That 's one of the possibilities which and I can do in winter when I want to be outside , instead of walking or snowboarding .
And more , I have an opportunity to meet new people .
On the other hand , I might get a cold and a temperature or something like that .
Casar de Cáceres is located in the north of Cáceres . You can see a lot of amazing things in this spectacular village .
Walking around the mysterious streets can be a great experience . We can find some really nice people , including pilgrims crossing the village every day following the historic path of the Via de la Plata , which is located in Casar .
You can smell and taste the gastronomic delights that are on offer , such as the stunning Torta del Casar with denomination of origin .
Many drivers regard travelling by car as a future means to travel which helps people save a lot of time .
However , others believe that public transport is better , due to the fact that public transport is environmentally friendly .
It is a known fact that travelling by car is less green than by travelling public transport .
In present - day society , sustainable development is of paramount importance as our environment is being destroyed at a fast rate .
Using public transport helps save resources such as fuel and electricity .
If people insist on travelling by car , they are , in fact , producing greenhouse gases which are given out by their cars .
It is definitely not environmentally friendly .
To preserve our environment , taking public transport is a must and a global trend in the future .
All in all , public transport should be an indispensable part of our future plan , because we have to protect our beautiful environment . Travelling by car , although much more convenient , is never a clever choice for the betterment of our future society because of serious environmental issues .
If everyone started using a car for traveling , there would n't be enough road for everyone as there are seven billion people in the world , and even for the environment it is better to use cars as little as possible .
On top of that , fuel consumption would be too high as we have limited availability of fuel resources .
The government and public bodies should start thinking about it , and to save society public transport is best .
Certain age groups wo n't be able to drive a car , so they definitely need public transport .
I can understand the use of public transport is decreasing nowadays , but there is still a future for it .
Everyone should think about it because it is really vital for society ; and especially the international bodies should do something about it to motivate people to use public transport as much as possible .
So , in summary , to save the environment , to make the roads accessible to everyone , public transport should be used and we should all try to educate people about the importance of public transport .
They lived in a small town in Massachusetts .
He asked Jessica to let him go with her , but she did n't agree , because before marrying him , she wanted to try to see if their love could hold out against everything , including distance .
She was disappointed and tried to explain her thinking to him , but he did n't want to understand her reasons .
Then , I would make the next recommendation .
Nevertheless , the sports store is a little expensive .
However , these three are the most visited by tourists , so they will not disappoint you .
They argue that a large number of people prefer travelling in private transport , because it is more comfortable and convenient .
Travelling by car can give you a certain status and make you feel more independent , besides the comfort and convenience .
Firstly , travelling by bus or on other public transport , such as the underground , helps us to decrease the emission of exhaust which causes pollution and global warming .
And last but not the least , public transport is much safer than private transport , because it transports many more people , and so , there is more caution .
Detoxification , a method people often use to lose weight , has not been proved by science .
People think that it is a common and effective way , but I believe , since there is no scientific evidence , it should not be brought to the weight - loss process .
In fact , some people just understand one aspect of this method , that is to say , they have applied the wrong method .
However , the method has brought some unexpected results due to their wrong understanding .
In fact , some deaths have been caused by bringing detoxification to the weight - loss process , because they follow the majority without carefully considering .
Generally speaking , the method has not been demonstrated to work by scientists , so it is better to avoid it in order not to have some unexpected consequences .
Film stars and politicians are interesting to people because of their talents and special abilities .
Of course , people want to know some facts about the personal lives of famous people , but often , stars do n't like it when journalists try to get into their lives .
On the one hand , famous people try to hide their lives from journalists .
In everyday life , the internet has become one of the most important things and it is becoming more and more influential .
On the other hand , with the internet , we can follow the news and current affairs very quickly and we do not have to wait for the news on the television , and we do not have to buy newspapers .
In conclusion , the internet has pros and cons , but it can be very useful and fun to use .
Gnadenthal is a very small village consisting of almost only one single drivable road , which is not famous for its size , though .
What is really special about this little village is the Christian brotherhood who have been living there more than 1000 years .
That is probably the reason why the local conditions are still similar to the ones of the Middle Ages , apart from some infrastructural improvements that made diseases like plaque obsolete .
The few houses themselves are set around a very old Romanesque church , which is bordered by a traditional farmyard for raising sheep and cows .
Nearby , fields growing vegetables can be visited which have never been altered by any modern machine but only by the power of hand and cattle .
Gnadenthal is exceptionally suitable for people who want to take some time off from their hard and stressful daily life in order to find calmness and to think about themselves in a way of their character .
Since there is no chance for any distractions because of the missing digital infrastructure , any guest will experience a four - day visit the same as a four - week journey in the usual western world .
This enables him to get used to the traditional way of life of a monk .
By conserving this place , the opportunity to gather a great amount of psychological enrichment is conserved , too .
Hi bro , What s up there ? .I'm going to recommend you to give up sport . As I told you too many times , sport is bad for your health . It makes you to be all day with legs or arms broken or something like that , and music improves and stimulates your brain and intelligence .
But also , I told you that if you are very good at sports , you might get a grant for your studies , which will be worth it , so I do n't know . In my opinion , I would continue with the music if you are good at it because it is better for your brain , but also , sports can relax you and make you disconnect , so if I were you , I would think about it and compare which of them you like more or which makes you feel better or relax more or just makes you laugh or have a good time .
So , I enjoy running alone or with friends , because this sport has a lot of possibilities , more than I thought when I started to run after finishing High School .
Therefore , we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths to pavement .
Later , I had more roommates , colleagues and partners even who did this sport , which is among the most fashionable ones at the moment .
But , for beginners , I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence , and practising with company because running can be boring , tiring , dangerous even , but if you have a strong spirit and willpower , you 'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses .
I enjoy it and got achievability from it .
Through the practice of Karate , I really understand myself .
Since most of these public transport amenities have been remedial rather than something planned when foreseeing future problems , they have only been of limited help and , therefore , they have only worked for some time .
This has resulted in only very needy people using public transport , and the vast majority of people still use their personal automobile , with inconveniences and safety being the excuse .
Indeed , using public transport is not only unsafe and uncomfortable , but also unhealthy .
So , little by little , and as the economic conditions of people improve , public transport will eventually disappear .
In the past , I tried to play basketball , tennis , ping pong and so on , but the outcome made me depressed and less confident .
Especially in New Zealand , there are some beautiful islands and you can get to them by ferry easily .
If you are interested in hiking , you should buy waterproof clothes , just in case .
In some places , you will have difficulty finding it .
Let 's start hiking as soon as possible , otherwise you will miss the opportunity to see fabulous scenery .
During the last decades , the number of cars used in big cities has increased steadily . Proportionally , air pollution and deaths associated with traffic accidents have also increased .
One way to reduce those negative consequences is to foster the use of public transport .
It moves more people per liter of oil used and pollutes a small fraction of the amount it would have if every passenger had traveled using individual cars .
However , public transport lacks some advantages only found when using our own car .
Cars are n't cheap and if you think that it is easier to move from one place to another when you have a car , you have got a point , but there are a lot of considerations which you should occur like gas , insurance or parking costs .
That could be frustrating , especially when you have a long journey and you need to spend long hours driving .
Finally , the word convenient means something different for everyone .
Being there has some advantages and disadvantages .
I can start by saying something about the advantages : we are not just classmates but we are friends .
But there are some disadvantages , like stairs because we are on the second floor . We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many stairs to reach our classroom and that 's so annoying sometimes .
Furthermore , travelling by car is a very comfortable way of travelling .
As you may be concerned , cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages .
In addition , cars have been increasing the world 's carbon emissions and that causes the ' Ozone Layer ' to thin down .
To sum up , cars have advantages but , on the other hand , they can also create problems .
In my opinion , cars are one of the best and most useful inventions .
Unfortunately , we should be careful with the way we use them .
You 've chosen the best country for attending university .
Travelling could be a good way to improve your language and to get to know Italy better .
You should definitely visit Rome and Florence !
Maybe you 'll choose to attend university in one of these cities !
Italy offers lots of work opportunity during summertime .
Adam was twelve years old , a clever boy in his school , always got the top marks and participated in most activities , and known to all the teachers and students .
Despite all these things , Adam was lonely and had no friends in school or in Abbeywood Street in Queensland , where he lived in Australia , and Adam was very annoyed about that , and what made it worse , was that a boy called Johnny had insulted him and Adam did n't want to have a fight with him .
Two weeks later , Adam began to make some friends , but unfortunately , they were n't very good friends . They used to cause trouble and did n't do their homework on time . The boys were Fernando and Louis . They were in their seventh year in school , like Adam .
He realized Adam 's marks were getting lower and he was involved in some trouble in school and began to investigate him .
As a matter of fact , Mr Michael should have provided some advice for Adam when his marks got lower , but he did n't , and the consequences were very bad , so Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I know this is not easy , but there is an ecological and cheap mode of transport : the bicycle .
But let me tell you that I was confused in the best way , not because it was rather wacky but because happenend unexpected .
The plot revolves around an FBI squad who face , in a game of cat and mouse , a team composed of the four best illusionists .
They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances , sharing out the stolen money with their audiences .
If I have to stand out any weakness I would say that is a bit predictable .
As it is a movie related to magic tricks , when a sequence is played and it seems simple and easily understandable , you know that , in fact , it is not .
On the other hand , if you are looking for a film that is extremely gripping and can keep you guessing , it 's definitely the right choice for you .
Exam stress leads to many bad consequences for high school students .
These consequences vary . One example would be that students may get lower grades in their exams , or even fail them .
They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness , since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam .
As a result , many high school students may not concentrate during classes , or whilst studying , since they have many things going through their heads ( since they 've been studying a lot ) .
The study guide does n't necessarily need to be a long and complex one ( since those may cause them stress too ) ; they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises .
Then I decided to study engineering and become one of the best engineers ever .
Long after that , because I had such a natural talent at engineering , I began to write books and essays about everything related to my job .
People are looking for a comfortable , easy life .
We are all looking for that without great difficulty or effort and one way to achieve this goal is to study abroad .
Many students today like to study abroad to get a high standard of living , to get their life job and experience a new way of life .
Studying abroad can enhance employment opportunities .
Companies are looking for well - educated people with good experience to hire and students are more likely to suit their choices .
With your certificate , you can easily find a job .
Universities are also a rich place for big opportunities to get there if you have studied abroad .
You can work at a university as a lecturer and get a high salary .
Students who go to study in another country experience variety of life .
They try new food in completely different places .
They learn how to do everything by themselves and become independent .
To sum up , studying abroad is a great chance to get a great job as you have higher education with much more experience .
Moreover , you can learn many things and expand your knowledge , and have friends from different backgrounds .
Do you remember our arrangement ?
Besides , I 've a big surprise . Apart from remembering our agreement , my father is taking up hiking with his friends and he has invited us to join them .
I 'm writing in response to the announcement in International Sports Monthly .
I would like to say that my favourite sport is birdwatching .
To begin with , I have been interested in birdwatching from when I was young and I want to be a biologist when I grow up .
Birdwatching really relaxes me and brings me closer to nature .
If someone wants to start birdwatching , I think he should be interested in birdwatching first .
This means that if he does n't like it , he will definitely give up immediately .
Then he should buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope .
To sum up , I believe birdwatching is a really exciting sport but you must like it to start it .
Sports or hobbies could be great options as new activities to plan at my college . However , I believe there are others which could be provided for us and it would be interesting to take part in .
The new activity which I have thought could be organised and could have success is called " The Club of discussion " .
In addition , it could be interesting , although you do n't have to do physical activity , because your ability to edit a speech , support an idea , have connected speech will be improved by this kind of activity .
I think that the allure of this activity is that you can meet a lot of people and share with them that experience .
In conclusion , making a speech contributes to our social relationships and it allows us to define our personality .
I am glad to hear that everything is OK with you .
I am very grateful that you will help me with searching for some information about colleges in England .
Actually , I am interested in science , especially the area between chemistry and physics .
Also , I 'm interested in tuition which refers to biology and the influence of different kinds of chemical compounds on the human body .
You know that I learnt biotechnology at school in Bulgaria .
Customer satisfaction is much greater when the customer gets service which has value or quality much greater than expected .
If service only meets expectations and does not provide anything more than them , that means customer satisfaction is there , but the customer will not feel great .
If service is not meeting the expectations of the customer or its quality is just below what is expected , it causes customer dissatisfaction .
This will result in consequences such as negative feedback .
In this context , it can be concluded that 78% of the respondents are satisfied with both the customer service of builders and the results of Vasthu .
The rest of the respondents gave positive feedback .
The factors which hinder other respondents from giving very positive feedback may be either dissatisfaction caused by customer service or failure of Vashtu 's results ' failure to meet their expectations .
It is one of my favourite free time activities .
Personally , I watch a comedy movie almost every evening .
I respond to the article " White House calls for ' genuine choice ' in Hong Kong elections after petition attracts 200,000 signatures " on SCMP .
In fact , China will not be moved by this , and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong , China and the US .
It is better not to interfere in internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China 's political conditions .
The US is supporting this illegal activity indirectly .
The US always keep " rule by law " as their catchphrase , but Occupying Central is disobeying Hong Kong law .
According to Wiki encyclopedia , the FBI called the occupiers " terrorists " and decided to suppress the dispute as if dealing with a terrorist attack .
So the US has no qualification to criticize China .
Apart from this , the presidential election in the US is full of unfairness .
I do not know if there is a filter for presidential candidates . I just know that the ballots are counted by states .
After Hong Kong gets " real democracy " , the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent .
The US always targets dividing China into many small , weak countries , then it can break up one of its competitors .
Let us look at countries that the US introduced " democracy " to .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria . There was chaos instead of " democracy " everywhere , and the next might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central will lead to chaos similar to the Tunisian Revolution .
The signature collection by the White House has now ended .
Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts are both considered crucial for students ' education .
Nevertheless , others consider learning ideas and concepts to be the best way to deal with many academic and real - life problems .
l completely agree with the idea that it is important for students to learn ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
However , ideas and concepts give people a competitive edge when dealing with other similar issues .
From this experience , I learn that I should not just remember facts , but should try my best to understand ideas and concept .
Second , learning ideas and concepts supports self - education significantly .
Consequently , you can reach high academic levels .
However , learning ideas and concepts needs more investigation and understanding from many of the academic textbooks .
When students grasp the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issues related to it deeply .
There were masses of materials on a specific issue , but I tried my best to grasp its notion and that made me recognize any unmentioned points .
Not only do students learn more in their studies , but also it helps students understand many facts in our lives better than any other way .
He is so brilliant ; he speaks three languages , plays several instruments , and most important of all , he is a man of remarkable principles .
When he was younger , he worked for the government , but he had to quit because of the corruption .
He always wanted to have his own business . He used to say , if you work for somebody you are part of the problem , but if you hire people to work for you , you are part of the solution , so if you want to be successful , be your own boss .
When I try to create in dreams the home of the future , the first thing which I have in mind is new technology . In my opinion , homes in the future have to be different . This is connected with our society and development .
In general , houses could have open space , a lot of windows and light everywhere .
In my opinion , inside they will still look the same , maybe with more technology connected with new inventions .
One of the most impressive solutions will be swimming pools in the sky , near area .
They will be more comfortable and useful for our community .
We found very cosy and traditional houses , the market was very popular , with a lot of people walking around , and the people were very nice to us .
The next place was a restaurant near the beach .
Near the restaurant , we saw a very strange thing .
When he saw me in front of him , he immediately invited me to dinner with him .
Because I had never heard beautiful words like that about me , I accepted the invitation without thinking .
When the night came , I went to the restaurant that he invited me to go to .
Since then , we have been in touch and now we are dating . I think this is extraordinary .
But one day , my sports teacher gave me the opportunity to become a basketball player at nine years old .
Since that day , basketball has been my favourite sport .
Would you like to become a basketball player too ?
A player can win a game , but only a team can win championships " .
If you remember that , and understand it , you will become a great basketball player .
All of us are surrounded by plastic . Plastic is needed for a lot of things in our everyday life .
However , I also think that it 's important to be conscious of environmental concerns , so some ideas like this could be good to reduce rubbish .
So , we can use plastic in a responsible way , but we have to know that we should n't take this idea to the extreme because we need plastic .
I watched till they dragged him away , and then everything went quiet again , as if there was nobody , so I 'm sure the cops will ENFORCE the guy who did this .
A couple 's coming slowly down Frankstown , walking with a girl by the hand . She has to be the boy 's baby sister .
Could they hear my old mind working to guide them , lead them and TREND them and get up out of this damn wheelchair and take them by the hand .
But , unfortunately , we 're not in the future .
The other benefit of living abroad is incredible personal experiences .
Therefore , this experience opens you up to different ways of viewing the world which may alter the rest of your life . In addition , it gives your children a much better understanding of other cultures when they attend international schools .
Congratulations !
Near the mountains ( about 20 kilometres ) you can find beaches , but I recommend the beaches in the South , Andalusia .
There are many kilometres of coast and there are a lot of sites and parties to enjoy all the time .
Travelling in Spain is easy .
Not just a really competitive game , football is a full mix of art , creativity , dedication , hard work and team work .
When a very skilled player finds himself in a hostile work environment ( with talented but selfish players who are n't committed to their " team play " ) he tends to lose performance and lack good results in matches .
Sometimes , the real spectacle does n't take place on the pitch , but in its surroundings !
Supporters of traditional clubs can be very passionate .
Usually , when facing tough opponents or decisive matches , they turn the stadium into a really big party in order to intimidate their adversaries ; coloring the benches with flags and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaics to express their delight .
If someone asks me what is the most important thing to start playing ( or even following ) this terrific sport , I 'd say it 's passion for wearing your club 's jersey and respect for your adversaries .
For years of wars and difficult situations , history was creating people 's beliefs and convictions .
I think religion means a lot to people- especially Polish people .
I want to describe the story of the Monastery of Częstochowa .
The icon , depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child , known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was imported from Russia in 1384 . And since then a lot of pilgrims have been visiting that picture .
Polish people had to defend Częstochowa and rescue their country . But the Polish resistance was smaller and smaller .
Immediately the fighters of Sweden began to stop attacking a hill .
He promised that the Madonna of Częstochowa would always be a Polish queen .
I think it is a perfect example of an important historical place in my country .
I think everybody who lives in Poland must go to Częstochowa .
On the one hand , we have people who live for their sport . On the other hand , there are people who do any sport , indifferently , because it is just a way to lose weight or a way to spend their free time .
Unfortunately , I do n't have a favourite sport , although I 'd like to have one .
It is likely you would have more self - confidence if you worked harder during a lesson .
So , for the unlucky ones like me , my suggestion is , if you have not fallen in love with any sport , you should try a course ! You will surely feel better and more relaxed after that .
Tarragona is an interesting and beautiful place for spending your time .
It is an big city and there are a lot of attractions .
Restaurants and clubs
You should go to the restaurants located in the harbour of Tarragona .
All of them are based on the typical Mediterranean cuisine .
Mirabel , Aquamar and Siroco are the trendy restaurants .
They are very comfortable and cosy and a good price .
At night it has a special atmosphere .
Watching the Mediterranean sea .
Conclusions and recommendations
Tarragona and surroundings are a good place to visit and to explore their culture .
First , parents are a great source of experience , which can be helpful in teaching .
Secondly , they have a close relationship with their children , which results in feelings and emotions .
As mentioned earlier , experience is a prerequisite for every teacher .
It does n't matter whether they have failed or gained success through those events , the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events .
From this point of view , children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences .
I , myself , have faced so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents .
Once , when I was 18 years old , I had to make an important decision about my university major .
So , I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities .
I was hoping that my decision was the right one , but it was n't actually . I had chosen electronics but my parents told me to do some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronics .
I followed their recommendations and I totally changed my thinking .
So , by considering different ideas and opinions , finally I chose computer engineering as my university major .
So , parents ' experiences can make them good teachers for their children .
They have a strong familiarity with preferences , skills , talents and all other valuable information related to their children .
Regarding this information , they can teach their children and help them to make reasonable decisions .
So , I went to my parents and asked for their help . They presented the best recommendations for making the decision , then I could make the best friends that I could easily get along with .
I am really satisfied with my parents as my indisputable teachers .
All in all , parents are a great source of experience , which can help them to be good teachers .
Also , they have so many close relationships with their children , which makes them trustworthy characters as teachers .
When the weather is good , I often go out with my friend for a walk in the countryside or go shopping .
Finally , I enjoy taking care of my garden , where there are many flowerbeds with a lot of different kinds of flowers .
Actually , I do n't like computer games very much , because , in my opinion , they are so boring ! I also think these games create a sort of dependency , like alcohol or drugs , so they can be very dangerous !
For example , I use my computer to prepare exercises for my students or to look for funny and useful laboratory experiments in chemistry .
This is a documentary about science .
I like watching it because I can get a lot of information from this programme .
For example , I can learn about the Big Bang , or the origin of the universe . It 's fascinating !
From this programme I can get information about the latest scientific discoveries and
technological developments .
In my opinion , it is one of the most interesting programmes about science on TV .
What did you understand about the job advertisement ?
This is a job dealing with all the information on a cruise , and the media manager works with other managers on a cruise .
Every day you have new news about the cruise , excursions , the weather and a lot of other information about the cruise .
If you want information early the in morning , you can get newspapers in your cabin .
The media manager follows information on panel , changes information depending on the weather , trips and a lot of other information .
You can change all the information on a cruise and inform passengers about the change of plan for the cruise .
We also have to keep in mind taking care of our environment , in order to have a healthy life .
In my town we protect the environment around us :
At school , children are taught about how to make appropriate use of electricity .
There are many people that offer themselves as volunteers to clean the city , and have been very helpful in making the city cleaner and more attractive .
" Seven " is a story about a psychopathic serial killer , who kills on behalf of morality and ethics .
In particular , the killer kills seven people , each one corresponding to those actions that , according to the Christian religion , are the seven deadly sins .
All the murders show characteristics reflecting a specific deadly sin .
That provides , especially to one of the two detectives who are investigating the crimes , a trail to follow in their investigation .
In the movie there , are some references to Dante 's " Divina Commedia " , an Italian poem , as well as to the Bible .
The film is excellent because of both a very exciting and engaging plot , and great performances by the main characters - the serial killer and the two detectives .
To my mind , shopping has both supporters and opponents .
Many times when I have been shopping , I was unhappy or disappointed for different reasons .
Unfortunately , we realize at home , that our wallet is empty .
When it comes to bargain sales , in such periods , people start to behave like animals and rarely think rationally .
Nevertheless , some people treat shopping too seriously and , as a result , become addicted to it .
I 'd like to present my application because I think I 'm the person that you are looking for for the job described in your advertisement .
There , over the last two years , I was the leader of a group which was involved in the organisation of lessons for young students with learning difficulties .
I was in the school swimming team and I 've got a first - aid certificate .
Each year , in the summer holiday , I 've worked in the " Summer camp " organised in our neighbourhood , both helping in the kitchens and organising sports and various activities for children between 6 and 13 years old .
Yours faithfully , Daniela
In the wonderful world of cooking that we live , in where we have a lot of products and chefs are so good , I would like to visit an Italian restaurant , because I love cheese and I think that Italy is the best place in the world where you can eat different types of cheese .
The perfect atmosphere for me is a modern building that has different rooms with different styles : modern , classical , gothic , etc .
When I eat in a restaurant , I hate two things : people smoking and the loud voices of the people .
Whereas I love two things too : a friendly waitress with her traditional black clothes and a light on my table that makes the night more romantic if you dine with your partner or more relaxed if you dine with your friend .
I think that an Italian restaurant is a great place for my class , because there they can choose between different fantastic dishes . For example , pasta , pizza , seafood or pork .
However , not all is OK . A trip to Italy is so expensive and many classmates ca n't afford it .
I enjoyed the time off from university .
My time off from university is important to my personal development .
Learning can also take place outside the university campus .
As such , we develop through interacting with our environment .
While on holidays from university ,
I was able to inspire some members of my family to send their children to university .
I told my friends and family members the importance of university education to our community .
I visited many interesting places , e.g. a nature reserve , historical places , the zoo , rivers etc .
Also during this period , I was involved in a local community project building a community hospital . While on this project , I interacted and shared ideas with other professionals on the project .
While on time off from university ,
This part - time job gives me a learning opportunity to develop my skills and understand the practical aspects of my career .
This practical experience gave me the opportunity to understand the importance of supervision .
I earnt some money to pay my university fees and rent for three months . I also received a very good reference from the firm which was passed on to the university .
They would like to offer me another opportunity to do a work placement in my final year at university .
My parents are both English native speakers , but to learn more about the culture , I studied languages at university and now I have a degree in English and French , so this job is also an opportunity for me to improve my English in another situation and not only with my parents and family .
In Italy , I worked as a babysitter for a couple of months . I took care of 3 kids : 1 child is 7 years old and the other 2 children are both 11 years old . And back then , I had to cook lunch and dinner for them .
At university , I was part of the football team and we won a championship against one of the most athletic football teams in our country .
I think I 'm an energetic person that likes all the types of sports and activities , but the most important thing is that I love kids and playing with them makes me really happy .
The convenience of travelling by car benefits the majority of us in modern society .
Car manufacturers are desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of cars .
By making them more modern , powerful and economical , they have successfully attracted more customers than ever .
There was once an interesting saying that North America is a nation on wheels .
As a result , the rapid increase of cars on the road has brought negative consequences .
Firstly , vehicles ' emissions can have detrimental effects on the environment in many ways .
Secondly , vehicles contain many different fluids , including motor oil , antifreeze , gasoline , air - conditioning refrigerants , and brake , transmission , hydraulic and windshield - wiper fluids .
In most cases , these fluids are toxic to humans and animals , and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed of incorrectly .
In addition , traffic congestion has become another worsening problem .
The traffic jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days .
It is considered to be one of the longest traffic jams by some media .
On the other hand , modern public transport has been improved progressively in the past decade .
Its comfortable , efficient and economical features have been attracting more young professionals .
In 2013 , the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides , averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2 ] Shanghai Metro system is 14 metro lines and 329 stations , with an operating route length of 334 miles , with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013 .
In addition to the convenience of public transport , the fares are much cheaper compared with driving a car .
Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport passes as a benefit .
The public transport in my city is very convenient .
Even though our subway system is still developing , the main line that passes through downtown , several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourists ' , students ' and professionals ' first choice for commuting .
There are some park - and - ride stations allowing car drivers to connect with the subway . It is very convenient and encourages more people to drive less .
Environmental awareness has positively affected the younger generations .
I think it would be a good idea to try the restaurant " The old clock " .
The restaurant is charming and fascinating , located in the old town 's center .
It 's an ancient brewery which keeps a special atmosphere .
The menu is not really wide - this is good in my opinion , because I 'm quite suspicious of restaurants offering too many dishes ... The restaurant serves fresh food only , depending on the season 's produce .
There is also a good choice of food for vegetarians , so Mike and Ann will not have a problem eating .
Last but not least , the price is good , especially considering the quality of food and service .
All over the world , the number of overweight people is growing .
Obesity is one of the most significant challenges of present - day society due to the fact that the number of people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly .
Firstly , food habits such as fast food and sedentary lifestyles are some of the main causes of the surge in weight among people .
Having looked at both causes and effects of obesity among people , it is recommended that people pay attention to eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a healthy lifestyle for their own benefit .
I liked this shopping centre because it has a lot of women 's shops inside , the facilities are quite attractive and very up - to - date , the green zones are broad and it is supplied with a lot of wooden benches .
Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
The sky was cloudy , the temperature was below zero , the wind made him not able to walk and it was then that he realized why is sister was celebrating her wedding on this date .
For me , these are the most incredible sports that anyone can do .
This sport combines the movement of arms and legs with breathing , as coordination between these parts is crucial .
Among the advantages of swimming we can highlight the following :
Improving the respiratory system .
5 . Relax not only the body but also the mind , so that stress decreases considerably .
If you want to know more and learn to practise this sport , we recommend attending a specialized school . There are many good and not so expensive ones , where you can count on the support of a qualified instructor who will give you the confidence to start .
As per our discussion earlier on the Service Guide Sales communication , I would like to ask you if you have already started to prepare the background and sales communication materials for this service guide and how to use it .
We are aiming to deliver the Service Guide materials in Week 25 to the marketing colleagues for translation and localisation .
Following our communication to the marketing community , ideally we should also inform the sales community about the sales communication materials and guidelines .
I propose having a meeting to discuss the process / timeline and align our communications to the marketing and sales community .

About the weather forecast for next month , I 'm sorry to tell you that the temperature might fall .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
As you do not have to wait for set timetables and follow fixed routes .
Driving your own car gives you more freedom when travelling and increases your sense of independence .
However , a car is not always more economical to run because , for example , you have to pay for road taxes , insurance , and motor tests .
The main reason for this is that cars use diesel or petrol , whereas trains use electricity .
From 17th to 20th March me and my schoolmates , and the 2 M , went on a trip to Sicily .
Then we had lunch and went to ' Giardini Naxos ' and we saw the necropolis .
It was an incredible trip !
It looks like regular cars but has some advantages .
In addition , my car is considerably more powerful than other means of transport .
I want to see tropical animals , birds and meet the local population .
Travelling by car is much more convenient , as many people say , but public transport is much better for the environment .
Many people use public transport every day and I think this is good for our communication , because we can talk to other people .
It is also good for our environment because there is just one bus for 80 people .
The hero finds all his friends are disappearing one by one .
Only by looking in the eyes of stone - cold danger can he evade disappearance himself .
My favourite sport is swimming . I like it because it makes me feel free , independent and happy .
It is an individual sport but also a team activity .
In my opinion , it is one of the healthiest sports there are because you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breathing .
I do not swim in competitions , but almost since I was 3 years old ,
I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates .
If he is afraid of the water , it is not recommended to do this sport , or being able to overcome his fear would be a great goal .
It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you .
If we talk about my favourite sport , it will be basketball .
I love basketball , though I rarely play basketball because it is hard to find a stadium to play basketball in Thailand .
I like basketball because it is one of the easiest sports .
Let 's talk about the advantages of playing basketball .
I think playing basketball helps me to be healthy .
If someone wants to play some sport , basketball is my first suggestion .
So , newbies can understand and know the rules easily .
This is a story about basketball , my favourite sport .
All in all , as we can see , there are many advantages and disadvantages to considering the members of your family your best friends .
From my point of view , friendship is based on honesty .
Introduction :
The purpose of this report is to evaluate the range of options available for many twenty - somethings in order to choose their housing in my country , as well as the main obstacles they face with each one .
It will also describe the possible housing prospects in the coming years and the consequences for young people .
Due to the enormous economic crisis that has shaken Europe and that has intoxicated the real - estate market , most of the prices are eye - wateringly expensive for college students that want to study abroad or simply emancipate .
In addition , the unwillingness of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something important to take into account .
But then I proved to myself that everything is possible .
In addition , I made new friends there . They are very clever and physically strong .
They teach me the techniques of how to run faster .
I keep practicing with them , running around West Lake every Saturday .
After the race , we got together in the cafe , drink beer and had a nice conversation .
My next goal is to participate in a full - marathon .
I think everything is possible when you are organized . You start to build your own timetable , which makes your life more easy and effective .
We can learn that a lot of successful people are very organized .
This company has the intention of setting up some training courses for staff , so I came up with the idea of having a course that concentrates on company morale .
I strongly believe in the idea of having a comfortable office environment , because when you like what you are doing and also where you are doing it , you will do it the best you can .
I recommend that everyone in this department takes the course , that way we could have the views of all the employees and focus on what we need to improve and channel it into profits .
These courses will last about a week and I suggest we only take from two to three hours per day so it does n't become tedious and we can keep everyone interested .
In conclusion , this will make everyone feel part of the company and we will have everyone 's opinions .
The story of Blade Runner is about a police officer named Dickard who is working as a killer for the most dangerous robots on earth , which they call the replicants , and they are dangerous to humans .
Dickard , the police officer , kills three robots in the film , but at the end of the movie and before he tries to kill the last robot , he discovers that batty has emotions and feelings instead of his mechanical body , because he saves Dickard 's life at the end of the film .
Travelling has an important role in our everyday life ; we need to get to work , school , want to meet our friends .
On the one hand , it is more convenient to have a car .
Owning a vechicle is very convenient and gives you independence .
You can also stop worrying about how much you take to work and on trips , being able to hide all those things inside your trunk , while this is impossible with any other means of transport ,
Moreover , travelling by train , tram or bus produces less exhaust fumes and , as a result , saves the ozone layer .
To sum up , travelling using public transport is more beneficial for both the environment and travellers .
I am convinced , that in spite of cars being comfortable , public transport will constantly develop .
Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and divide to produce more stem cells .
They can also treat or prevent a disease or condition , and are used by scientists in research , and by doctors .
There are a lot of people in this world that are ill and need stem cells in their healing process , so parents that had an aborted foetus should let the scientists and the doctors use the stem cells in their research and help other people .
Science nowadays has developed a lot and has given the population a lot of possibilities , like storing stem cells and using them to treat future health problems anyone can have .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to inform visitors to Leonberg about our shopping facilities .
There you can find almost anything you want , from clothes to electronics and groceries , to beauty products and flowers .
Furthermore , the picturesque old town of Leonberg has a number of lovely small corner shops where you can buy local food and handmade products .
Even if you are interested in more than ordinary shopping , you will be satisfied in Leonberg .
We have a big furniture store , an extraordinary market garden , a well - known home improvement store , and also a large bike retailer with professionally trained shop assistants .
Recommendations
In my opinion , shopping is not always enjoyable , especially for men .
Sometimes , your shopping trip turns out to be unsuccessful and you are desperate because you wasted money .
If we look around us , we can see a lot of facilities .
For this reason , we are always involved in the project of improving the facilities for life , and one of the most important aspects of the project is the home .
Nowadays , we have a lot of electronic devices , such as microwaves , remote contols for TV , electronic devices for cooking , personal computers , and so on and so forth .
Each one makes everyday life a bit easier , but real progress in the home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind .
An inner electronic system would compose the whole house ; it would include small devices of wave reception connected , on every side of the house , to a gum headband whose function would be to identify neural stimuli and to convert them into radio waves .
This system would also be connected to the Internet in a ' dual output remote port of information ' .
Having explained it , I am completely sure that this outline of my ' house of future ' will astonish and amaze everyone who reads my sublime project .
How are you doing ? I remember you wanted me to tell you about my experience with helping at a concert I went to last month .
I did n't think that I had any chance of getting there , because of the large number of applicants .
But , I fortunately made it .
I was attached to a group of people who were responsible for informing the public about the programme and all the organisational stuff .
I had a great time throughout the entire concert .
We took some photos and got autographs .
Michael the big man , who can do everything in the whole damn world , except take care of his keys , I guess ... "
Angry like a tiger , or something else that 's bad , naughty and terrifying .

Their behavior may make you feel uncomfortable and disgusting .
You should know it is called sexual harassment .

The perpetrators harm the victims by words or assault .
Now you know what sexual harassment is .
If you are the victim of sexual harassment or you are a witness , you should try to call for help first .
Many people hesitate to tell others about an incident because they think it is embarrassing to tell others about this .

This restaurant is near the riverside of Zarate .
in other restaurants , and they let you eat the amount of main courses that you wish for the same price .
In addition , the atmosphere of the place is excellent .
with an amazing riverside view that makes you relax and feel comfortable .
Travelling by car is much more convenient than using public transport for various obvious reasons .
But , considering the increase in private vehicles in our crowded overpopulated world , it is recommended by geologists and ecologists that we use public transportation .
In this way , we not only contribute to saving our eco - system , we also contribute to increasing the national revenue .
Our interaction with human beings has been pathetically reduced .
Exchanging greetings , expressing emotions , updating work status , gaming , studying and more have become activities we do using mobile phones .
Cars are mostly used by people travelling long distances in a shorter time .
Inside cities and for shorter distances , nothing can be more comfortable and safe than public transport .
Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely , but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with other people .
For centuries the population of the world has been dreaming of commuting anywhere comfortably by car .
It was after thinking about this major problem that governments around the world launched the greatest and most ambitious plan .
To start with , cars are going to be made using high technology at a lower cost , and therefore affordable to all .
City development is already under construction .
New motorways , streets , car parks are no longer sitting in the council 's offices , waiting to be signed , they are a reality transforming the world landscape .
Could we ever think of such a dream coming true ? All this is beyond my imagination and understanding , whereas new technologies could be used to give the world a much better healthy environment and less egocentric .
I am very interested in starting a pet - care franchise because I like pets and I think all these services would be very helpful for a lot of people in my country too .
Can you tell me more about the possibility of taking out a Petpals franchise in my country ?
I would like to know what initial investment I have to calculate ?
In your article you write about an education center with assistance for new franchisees .
In the future our lives will be much more difficult because we 'll struggle for everything alone .
Everyone will get help from the machines or technological .
Technology will be our best friend .
Despite this , our appearance will change . Our fashion will be more technique .
What about relationships ?
Well , I do n't think that we will build a close relationship with anyone and building a family will be even worse .
The family might exist on paper , but not in reality , because each member of the family will be busy and they will just send some messages from the high - technology phones they 'll have at that time .
I know , it sounds boring and pessimistic , but if we do n't change our minds immediately , the future is going to be like that , for sure .
From an overall perspective , it is notable a higher amount of illiterate women in all the regions compared with men , who are in some cases the half part of the total of women in each region .
Developed countries , Latin America and East Asia are the three regions that show a low percentage of illiterate people , expressed as below 20% , whereas Sub - Saharan Africa , Arab States and South Asia have over 30% of people who do not know to how read and write .
As we can see , an unequal percentage is shown depending on the area where the people come from .
Buenos Aires is a city made for tourists . Visitors can do so many activities in a small radio of the city . Dancing Tango , eating traditional meat or visiting a beautiful library are some of them .
Furthermore , there are many places where tourists can buy many things , such as a typical mate or a picture of the Obelisco Porteño .
But if visitors want something more than a typical souvenir , they can visit canteens or a bar where tango shows are put on and take their own pictures or even buy a CD with the traditional music of Buenos Aires .
Even if you just want to go shopping for clothes , there are so many places you can go . Palermo is known as a little New York for the designers and well - known brands , and technology is located in Recoleta .
So , Buenos Aires , also known as the Paris of America , gives all visitors the opportunity to meet Argentinian tradition in just one city that includes the history and the culture of the country .
Pontevedra on its way to becoming a green town .
Pontevedra has been one of the most polluted towns in Galicia for many years .
We started to appreciate the advantages of walking .
At the beginning , this was a very controversial decision .
Finally , he has championed moving Celulosa 's factory to a safer place .
Pontevedra is going greener .
Nevertheless , our passion is still strong .
In many countries , it 's considered that relatives are the close family and the only people with whom an individual can be just the way he is .
This point of view is based on , for example , the fact that you share an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
Thus , it fits perfectly for those people who have a bad relationship with their families .
In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that it is less probable to find negative feelings inside the family , like envy , refuse or hate .
It is a lovely place not far from our school , and I think it 's interesting in his natural habitat .
During this year she had explained the harbor world , in particular the world of Miramare , and I described the same things from the geographical aspects .
I was just a bit worried because there are 28 students in this class , but they are very respectful and clever .
All the students were interested in the information and they asked for a lot of explanations .
During this day , the students had the opportunity to hear very interesting things , but not in the same way as if they were in a class during a traditional frontal lesson .
They had improved their knowledge by having experience of the field .
In recent years , whether using the internet is beneficial or not has never failed to attract people 's attention .
While many people believe that the internet brings a vast amount of problems , such as a reduction in interaction between people and some bad information sources , in contrast , I have a strong opinion that the internet brings many more benefits than drawbacks .
People should first recognize that searching for information these days is much more convenient than in the past .
We had to go to a library to spend a lot of time finding information we needed on the shelves before .
On the other hand , we can access the information with just a click nowadays .
Clearly , the assessment has become much more efficient with computers and the internet .
Yet , perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using the internet , is the vast amount of information contained on it .
All the information in the world can emerge immediately after a click .
Admittedly , some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough , but it still offers us many other useful sources .
At the same time , some sources contain pornography and violent information , which makes many people afraid of using the internet to search for information .
Nevertheless , it remains a good way to store and supply information which hoped to have more flows in the future .
I think one of the important historical places in Japan is the Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto .
It is well - known as a vast beautiful Buddhist temple in Japan , and it 's also famous among foreigners .
It has five storeys and is one of the tallest historical buildings in Kyoto .
It is a great and famous sightseeing place and it is also an important place for Japanese culture .
Kiyomizu temple was used many times as a background for a lot of Japanese novels , paintings and historical dramas .
I am sending you useful information about places of interest in Katowice , which you can show to your group .

In the last ten years , Brazil has created a wide range of governmental programmes .
Educational and medical assistance , as well as iinfrastructure improvements are some of the recent advancements .
One of the best examples in education has been a scholarship programme called Science Without Borders .
It offers students a unique opportunity to study abroad and acquiring an international standard qualification .
In addition to this , it provides them with access to the newest research developments .
As a consequence of this investment , the state is contributing to the improvement of the careers of Brazilian professionals .
On the other hand , a problem could stem from the lack of incentives for the nationwide educational institutions .
Therefore , in order to avoid giving rise to any further complications , the Brazilian authorities should bear in mind the development of both national and international programmes .
As a result , quality would be guaranteed .
I am writing because I recently saw your advertisement and I am interested in it .

Do n't forget to recognise the most activities and tasks for you .
For instance , when you stay at university class or something like that , you should remember how much time you have to do it .
Finally , it depends on what works for you , because you have to constantly remember the time that you do your tasks .
It was late at night and Michael went surrounded with deep darkness to the edge of the forest .
The visibility was very poor because the moon was hiding behind dark grey shadows , but Michael went on memory .
Suddenly , a tumbledown cottage emerged from the darkness .
The Nazis could be everywhere , " he thought , and unlocked the door with a little key .
If I had the opportunity of giving some advice to a person that is starting in this sport , I would tell him to not give up , because this is n't an easy sport , and it is more mental than physical .
The cathedral has a height of 55 m. The cathedral was raised to the rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756 . What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk .

PEOPLE 's LIVES WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS .
This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages that we will find in the next 50 years .
It will consider some relevant things which will be completely changed in the future , as well as arguing and explaining the pros and cons of everything .
Furthermore , the environment will suffer the terrible effects of our current lifestyle .
Consequently , protective clothes , which will be made with materials and NASA technology , will be worn by the future population .
On the other hand , the benefits in health will be significant .
In fact , the development of different vaccines will mean that it will be possible to get over a great number of diseases .
It started when I was 12 or 13 years old , his music meant everything to me .
I really hope in this " hiatus " , this is what they called their break , they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends , managers or the media around them .
Famous people live in a completely different way than ordinary people .
It is believed they are extraordinary , perfectly beautiful and incredibly happy like we see in their photos in magazines and on TV .
Unfortunately , in reality it is n't so amazing as it seems to be .
There are a lot of disadvantages to being a star , which normal people do n't realise . For example , not having a private life .
There are a lot of different viewpoints and I would like to consider them .
Almost their every secret comes out and they are still judged , criticised or mocked .
Journalists and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance the the value of them .
Being all the time at the centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming .
That is why a lot of big names suffer from depression or even try to take their life .
On the other hand , this is the price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this .
People can not have everything and live as they want .
They ought to appreciate what they have and stop complaining about their life , because there are plenty of people , who dream of being them .
They have not got expensive cars , detached houses , they ca n't afford to travel and their only entertainment is watching TV .
However , nobody has everything they dreamed of ; it is normal that always in our lives something will annoy us .
Famous people have to notice how much they have , appreciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life , because it is not such a disaster as they often think .
Day by day , the power of consumption increases more and more and one of the areas you can see this is in the traffic .
People who have the resources to buy or hire something and are looking for convenience have a great desire to buy a car .
The poor quality of public transportation and the lack of options like underground and train , helps people choose to use a car .
These things make us think about whether public transport has a future . After all , to do all the things you need in your routine , like to go to work , to go shopping or just to go out with the family , it is more convenient by car than by bus .
Cars nowadays have technology that allows both drivers and passengers to have a better journey while listening to music or using the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey .
The government needs to invest in better conditions on public transport , with more options for the transportation of citizens , in order to make it easier to go from one place to another , and harder to choose between a car or a bus .
Everything has two sides and the choice of transportation is not an exception .
Firstly , travelling by train , metro or bus can lead to the reduction of gasoline consumption .
As a result , they offer low fares and play an important role in environmental protection .
It was reported that for one hundred kilometers , each car consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline , and released a certain proportion of air pollution .
Meanwhile , with the same amount of fuel , a bus carries fifty people , and even up to as high as hundreds of people with mass transportation .
Secondly , it can not be denied that travelling by car is convenient , but people who agree with the idea point out that high - quality and modern public transport such as the Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable .
can also satisfy passengers who can not travel by plane and need to take long - distance journeys .
There are some places in developing countries , for example , in remote or highland areas , where people have not seen a car for many years . They have no choice apart from old buses to travel .
In conclusion , public transportation will still be the first choice of people in the future .
There are some similarities . However , differences in the educational system cause differences in the attitudes to education .
University education is valuable in Australia , just like in Russia .
In general , most employers prefer applicants who have achieved an academic degree .
The most important argument was that travelling by car is much more convenient .
The fact that you can travel anywhere at any time is undeniable .
If you want to buy some vegetables for your dinner , you will have to wait until the next train arrives at your station .
He started his career when he was sixteen years old through kart competitions .
After only three years , he joined the Benetton formula one team and two years later he won his first driver championship .
In 2000 , he won his third driver championship with Ferrari and also won it consecutively for three years .
Then Ferrari and Michael decided on a new collaboration , so the greatest became a test driver and tried to improve the car outside of the races .
Like every German , since he was a young driver , he had dreamed of being a championship driver with the national car .
To summarize , he arranged a meeting with the head of Ferrari and the press because he would like to announce his definitive
retirement .
This , unfortunately , was only an excuse . He was only pretending to retire as he had already signed a contract to drive Mercedes .
These people usually give arguments such as that the public transport is never on time , or that it is difficult to get to your destination using it and without having to take 3 different routes , or even that public transport is not as suitable for a made - up short - notice trip as a private car can be .
In my opinion , these arguments depend on how efficiently designed the public transport system is , taking into account number of routes , timetables , cost of the tickets and facilities for users who use it frequently .
The benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community are quite well known : a significant reduction in pollutant gases , a high decrease in noise pollution , as well as , as a consequence of having fewer cars circulating on our streets , an increase in pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking , running or cycling .
All these benefits will surely contribute to a better future for all the habitants , so let 's give public transport a chance .
The city only began to take care of the environment in the last ten years when the studies created technologies aimed at not causing pollution .
In this area there are many fields where wind turbines have been built to use the wind and generate electricity .
On the roofs of the supermarkets there are solar panels and they exploit the sun to produce energy .
These means of generating renewable energy are better than the old methods because they do n't pollute .
There are many green parks where you can do sports and other activities without polluting .
And if we consider the speech where the woman said that , at present , this phenomenon is a problem , because this bamboo is the main source of food for the Giant Panda that still lives in the jungle .
The Giant Panda is an endangered species . The pandas have to survive the hunters and the destruction of their habitat by humans .
Therefore , the risks of the extinction of the Giant Panda are real .
I am on the point of finishing my Engineering degree in Mining Engineering , specializing in energy , at Vigo University .
I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing for the First Certificate Exam , planned for July and June , respectively .
I would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level , and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these goals .
Thus , the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of getting an internship at your company .
In this programme , the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor .
The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence costs , so the company is not required to pay him a salary .
Furthermore , as the programme is endorsed by the European Union , the trainee has accident and liability insurance .
As for the duration , the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months , 3 months being the period covered by the subsistence grant .
I will be completely available to do the internship from next September onwards .
I hope you will consider my application and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
These days Italy has quite a big problem with unemployment . It 's very difficult to find a job and most people find jobs in supermarkets .
I live in Valpolicella , a famous region for wine , and I have already worked in a four - star hotel for high school .
It was a good experience . The hotel had every comfort you can imagine : a restaurant , a spa , a gym , indoor and outdoor swimming pools , a beauty center and a church .
The personnel were n't so helpful , but luckily someone gave me some advice , especially the porter , Artan .
Valpolicella has many sights that are worth seeing : first of all is Lake Garda , a lake with a famous phallic shape which divides three different regions ( Veneto , Trentino and Lombardy ) .
Orlando Duque , the Colombian diver , who is the high - jump champion of the FINA World Cup 2014 , stated that since 2007 he has been thinking about retirement even though he feels the strength and desire to go to the World Cup in 2017 in Guadalajara , México .
" I have been thinking about retirement since 2007 . I have been lucky because I was injured and I got better " , said Duque during the press conference of the World Series that , this year , will end up in Mexico on 17th and 18th October , after the competition in Bilbao ( Spain ) .
" I turned 40 three weeks ago . I feel motivated to train , and while I have the motivation I can continue ; now I do n't have an exact date ( … ) I just have set 2017 in Guadalajara " , said Duque , who was the first sportsman who won a world championship in falls from height .
" Jumps have been my life , I have spent all my life on jumps and it motivates me to do it , I want to continue " , explained Duque when he pointed out that he still has several screws in his right ankle and he is still lacking completely recovery .
The Natural Well Ik Kil , which is located three kilometers away from the archeological zone of Chichén Itza , will be the final one of the Jumps season , 2014 , and in that season Duque and the Mexican Jonathan Paredes will face each other in order to be among the top five spots of the season .
" The plan is to win this competition because I always compete to win .
In the men 's test , the high - jumpers are thrown into the water from a height of 27 meters , whereas in the women 's competition the launch pad is placed at 20 meters .
You may ask why , of all the possible activities , this one was chosen .
After the first trials , however , improvements are soon noticed and the results come quickly : better breathing , uninterrupted and quiet sleep , and an unmistakable sense of well - being .
Despite being a common and easy to do activity , running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well .
Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce discomfort and keep one 's feet at a nice temperature .
Notwithstanding , a formidable pair of running shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period .
Anybody can do it , it is practical and simple , and goals can be set in accordance with the person 's needs and limitations .
I always considered football as art .
Players must be considered as a painter working on a piece of art .
Only the results will be recognized at the end .
Their expectations will be considered useless .
Everything after a successful result will be a plus .
I would recommend them to always remember that , so if things do n't turn out as they expected , they wo n't feel disappointed .
We are people and all of us must have a private life , including celebrities .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazzi who are trying to find out more about their private life .
I agree that film stars and famous politicians must have their free time because they are working for people everyday .
It is quite hard to have a rest when journalists are trying to find out some exciting things about your private life .
On the other hand , famous politicians and film stars have chosen such a life .
It is a part of their everyday life , they are used to being in public and they are used to saying something about themselves on camera , so everyone will know about their life .
There are some moments when celebrities need some time to be with their families and friends and journalists must not disturb such moments .
Everybody must have free time to themselves .
In the modern world , a company which has excellent staff is more competitive , and these employees are usually motivated .
It is clear that staff would spend more time on their tasks if they were motivated by their boss , while unmotivated employees are more likely to put less effort into their jobs .
Generally speaking , there are two basic employee motivation methods : rewards involving money and non - financial rewards .
Many leaders believe that money is the best . However , from my own perspective , the non - financial rewards are the best approach to motivating employees and I will prove my opinion in this essay .
I had never been very frightened until one day when something strange happened .
My sister claimed that on her trip , she had seen completely astounding buildings , but while she was talking , we heard a very loud scream .
Outside , it was getting very cold and the sky was dark , so we could n't see anything but , nevertheless , we continued walking through the trees , when suddenly we saw a very big shadow in front of us .
Ana and I decided to go outside to look for Michael . When we went out , he was in front of the house , making strange sounds . When he saw us , he smiled at us in a malevolent way , then made us go back inside .
My favorite sport is basketball .
One reason why I love this particular sport is because it 's based on cooperation .
For example , if you play basketball and the ball is passed regularly , then your team is more likely to win because passes cause confusion and exhaustion for the opposing team .
On the other hand , if he chooses to play professionally , then he must try hard .
Regular exercise is potentionall so that he / she can build up strength and endurance .
One of my favourite restaurants is one located in a delightful town called Ubeda .
The restaurant has a very characterful decoration indeed , because you seem to be inside a train .
However , the most impressive thing is the range of flavours that explode inside your mouth .
The connection between quality and price is plenty balanced .
I know from personal experience that it is worth tasting the gourmet sampling menu .
I really think it is suitable for the class , because each one of us could know in advance how much we would pay to eat there and , besides , we could taste the main courses of this restaurant .
Without a shadow of a doubt , I am absolutely sure this would be the best option for our class .
I 'm not a great fan of films based on fictional , unrealistic facts and events .
And that 's obvious because it 's the first serious production by this young , promising director , whose ' Flushed " became a worldwide hit .
An enormous number of additional attractions for viewers provided me with unforgettable feelings .
Everything came us a surprise and you did n't expect that this or that action would take place .
The movie requires us to be highly concentrated on what is going on and I find that to be one of the most conceiving factors for those who still have some objections .
The director gives a chance to broaden our minds and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe an imaginable ending to the gripping story .
RECOMMENDATONS
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no circumstances should we miss it !
The profile of millions of recent graduates and professional people in Spain is one of a young person , well prepared and without work who is thinking of going abroad as a good chance to get a job .
Working abroad can offer you a good opportunity . Maybe it would never happen in your own country instead .
Furthermore , as is well known , salaries are higher in other European countries than in Spain , so your living standard may improve the same as your career path .
On the other hand , going abroad without your family might be a really bad experience , because you may really miss them , maybe because you are not able to visit them as much as you can due to living far away from home .
The weather may be a disadvantage , as well .
For example , if you go to work in England , you can say goodbye to the bright and sunny Spanish days and say a big welcome to the frightful English weather and depression .
To sum up , the disadvantages of going abroad are greater than the advantages , but every cloud has a silver lining .
Maybe , many people who have studied did it to get a job opportunity in their own country , but that 's life .
I have got one sister . She is 15 years old and her name is Tina . She also goes to Fribergaskolan .
called " Djursholms ridskola " and on Sundays I often go
When we were in Thailand , we saw many different animals ; everything from big leguans to rainbow fishes and deadly sea - snakes .
Every year at the sport - vaccination me , my mom and my sister go to Switzerland to go skiing in the Alps . It 's wonderful and really fun .
Three words that describe me best are , perhaps , animal lover , happy and a perfectionist .
I like food , especially Italian food . It is my favorite food to eat .
My favorite restaurant is " La Piazza " in Djurholm and it is , of course , Italian . I have actually been to Italy twice , to Rome and Florence and to a small town named Lucignano in the countryside .
When we were there last summer , I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called a Hoopoe .
Some of the books I like are " Only Way is Up " and " Steal the Show " and were written by Emmy Abrahamson . I think she is a very good author . Another author I like is John Boyne who wrote " The Terrible Thing that Happened to Barnaby Brocket " .
I love to design presentations and edit things on the computer , but also in real life , like my room , clip - art and more .
Parkour is a discipline in which the main purpose is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and fastest way , without causing any harm to your body .
One of the foundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method , created by Georges Hébert .
Basically , the method is based on developing the main foundations of movement of the human body . These are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped movement , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
He had a great background in gymnastics and , from a teenager , he used to do a lot of exercises .
The roots of Parkour were developed by him and he taught some Parkour techniques to the firemen who he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the foundations of Parkour too .
David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment , and then the current Parkour was born .
Some people say that David created Parkour but , in fact , his father developed all the ideas of the discipline .
David adapted it to the urban environment and created new moves .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosophical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a phrase from the Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that , in a dangerous situation , you will be able to save yourself and other people , and so on .
Therefore , it is due to its philosophy and the joy that I feel before , during and after a training session , that Parkour is my favorite sport .
There are fewer people who use public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than on public transport .
For a lot of people , travelling in your own car is more comfortable than travelling by public transport like buses or the metro , because you do not depend on a schedule , which is very common when you take public transport .
However , public transport also has advantages .
On the other hand , travelling by metro or bus pollutes less than going by car .
The consequence of this is that , in the near future , public transport will disappear .
The company ensures the quality of water from production to distribution .
The product will be registered with the Ministry of Health and Sri Lanka Standards Association and adhere to their rules and regulations for production , storage and distribution .
We will not compromise the quality of the production process or the product in any way .
The company will ensure low negative environmental impact due to the production process .
The direct supplies to offices , households and hotels will also be given a good price for the delivery service .
We will rent water dispensers with a maintenance service to required customers in future to attract more customers .
During the last century , our way of life has changed completely , even in villages .
To resolve this problem , my village has created a plan to teach its population how important it is to take care of the environment and how to do it .
For this reason , we have new containers to separate all rubbish : we have to throw away bottles , cans and cartons into the yellow bin ; paper and cardboard go in the blue bin and there is another one for glass .
At school , children are learning how to use less water or electricity at home .
I hope these simple actions can be used by other people because the environment needs us to work together for a better world .
How interesting !
Anyway , he built a skyscraper , which is called 21 .
But that 's not the most interesting thing !
It 's an unforgettable experience .
It may not be your cup of tea , but I think it 's the most interesting and beautiful place in our town . I 'm looking forward to seeing you !
When visiting Copenhagen during summer time , there is a huge variety of shops and restaurants that will give you a sense of the Copenhagen lifestyle .
Afterwards , take the bridge over the lakes and enjoy a full day of shopping .
When you are tired of shopping , take the bus to the West Side of Copenhagen where there is a vast choice of restaurants ; everything from Italian to Chinese to Danish cuisine .
If you like an evening stroll or a night out , walk through Istedgade for a glimpse of the old Copenhagen and the nightlife it offers .
In the following paragraphs I 'll tell you what they told me .
The first question we discussed was : ' Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufacturers ? '
An argument some used was : ' In case we removed this whole industry , then there would be a humongous group of people unemployed , and that would be a problem . '
In their opinion , young people , including themselves , are very busy with fashion and clothes .
Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kind of clothing , just because they thought they would have more friends then .
The next question was : ' Does it make society materialistic and competitive ? '
I totally do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transportation because of the existence of cars .
The general public are using public transportation more than before .
Students who are not allowed to drive are still using public transportation and they always will do .
Moreover , the traffic in areas such as downtown forces people to use public transportation like trains , since the trains are faster .
Insurance is so expensive in North America , most householders do not use a car because of insurance , and also because of added costs like fixing the cars , changing car oil etc .
Furthermore , the government are enhancing public transportation services . They are providing them at a lower cost . The fairs for rides on public transportation are less than the cost of driving a car the same distance .
Finally , none will argue about the benefit of using cars over public transportation , but that does not exclude public transportation .
how are you ? I hope that everything is all right .
Although I was watching it from backstage , the atmosphere was the same as if I 'd been watching it in front of the stage together with other fans .
There was a lot of work during the concert preparation .
We had to check if everything was correct : sound , light , special effects .
Besides , we had to see if the band had everything that they needed : something to eat and to drink . I was responsible for that .
It was an unforgettable experience . I will never forget it .
The opportunity to meet my idols in real life was the most exciting .
I will tell you everything when we meet !
Attached we return to you text of the doctoral thesis of , directed by Dr. , requesting you to fill out the detailed report of evaluation , also enclosed .
We explicitly point out that this report is compulsory to proceed with the necessary arrangements for the deposit of the thesis .
I did not do everything I wanted because I was forced by my parents to go to Boquete .
But once , one of her friends told me that before the kiss , everything was going to be OK .
Belarus is not a popular tourist destination nowadays , but a lot of people would be surprised to find the real medieval atmosphere in Grodno , a western city of the country .
Two ancient castles remind us of the times of kings and nobility , quiet pedestrian streets show us life as if it could be the 1800s .
Grodno is situated at the crossroads of great trading routes , that 's why one can hear Polish , Jewish , German , and Lithuanian there .
Its multi - ethnic population was the reason for organising and holding the Festival of National Cultures every two years .
It 's worth visiting because the traditions of the ancient Belarusian , Tatar , Russian , Jewish being shown make us feel history itself .
A city of different religions , different nationalities and " talking stones " is waiting for you .
REPORT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY TOWN
The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve , or zoo , make it very attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourist destination is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities .
ATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES
There are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics .
These include facilities like ample parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge , elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls if you are carrying very heavy loads of purchases , and relaxation spots like cinemas and gaming centers for kids .
In addition , most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people , as this is a statutory requirement when building a shopping mall .
SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS
Its products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors .
Another shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market .
This is where you will find several shops that sell most African traditional artifacts .
CONCLUSION
I hope from the explanations , I have been able to convince you of my opinion of the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities , which abound as you take your time in considering visiting them .
In developed countries , four wheels have gained a lot of appreciation in everyday transportation .
In the capital cities of Europe one can easily notice how many people prefer their own means instead of the pushing crowd on public transportation .
It is , however , well known after a plethora of scientific publications that cars harm the environment dramatically .
On the other hand , modern citizens like to be part of the green revolution and our carbon footprint has an effect on everyday decision making .
Many organizations and public authorities encourage workers to use public means of transport to and from the workplace in order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and save natural resources .
As a result , before private transportation reaches its peak for the 21st century , it is most probable that green mobility will overtake it and dominate in people 's choices .
There is a great future for public transport , the same as for cycling and travelling on foot , instead of cars and other polluting machines .
Do n't worry about not recognising me because I haven't changed a lot in two years , but , to reassure you , I will be carrying a bright orange suitcase .
I would like to visit Big Ben and many other places that you suggest , but I do n't really want to see ordinary tourist sights , so if you could show me something that not everyone can find , I would appreciate that .
I am sure it is an easy task : here you can visit many entertaining facilities where you can find technology or culture , for example , and there are also many places to eat , dance , etc .
The great view it provides is incredible .
Times Square is a good site for shopping too , although the excessive amount of advertising is a little bit annoying .
Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , anthropology and seeing a lot of types of art .
Talking about places to eat or dance , near the Grand Station you can find the ' Num Pang ' , a good place to eat sandwiches .
Remarkably , teenagers like eating these and this is where you can find some of the best .
If you need more information , please tell me .
I entirely agree with the statement : travelling by car is much more convenient , because you can go wherever you want without waiting for a bus or train at a bus stop or station .
I think that travelling by car is also more inner and comfortable because you only travel with people you know .
Talking about money , the car is probably more convenient , even if you have to pay for fuel , highway and everything that is necessary for the maintenance of the car .
So , people prefer travelling by their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way .
Finally , we should use public transport to reduce pollution , but it should be better supervised and maintained .
I agree with the statement , that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
Usually , journalists also follow them all the time .
Sometimes it happens that journalists write some silly gossip about famous people which is not true .
It may be a danger for the family of a celebrity , politician , famous person , and because of it some could break up .
They want to be rich and famous and they know that journalist will follow them .
In my opinion , the television has an important role in society because it can influence people 's lives .
I mean some people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language through the different programs that television offers or just use subtitles to make it simple .
It 's important to know what is happening in the world , because it can enrich your knowledge culturally , politically , etc .
Besides , you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if a lot of serious situations are occurring in your country .
Children learn a lot of things through cartoons , it can help them to improve their speaking and to learn new vocabulary .
The television is one of the most important media .
So , for that reason , I think television can entertain and also educate .
I 'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if they 're sad or a break for someone 's in their free time .
I have always believed I can become an engineer and computer technician to invent more things since I was small .
After I received more and more information about some successful engineers and inventors such as Steve Jobs , I realizes that , no matter who you are and how smart you are , you can not live without a healthy body .
Consequently , I believe physical development is a necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful to for providing me with opportunities to do extra - curricular activities .
Therefore , to keep my body healthy and my interest , I have kept taking part in the School Aquathon since I was in the second one . I participate in the same events each year .
Besides , it gives me a motivation to train harder and never think of giving up , and that I need to keep up my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body .
I learnt how to set a proper goal as it is a significant factor in success .
I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after taking part in the School Aquathon and saw others improve and not just me .
School work and examinations give me huge pressure , so I found a way to strike a balance when I learnt to do windsurfing .
In my opinion , windsurfing is special and indispensable to me .
When I step on the surf board , all my vexation and misgivings are gone .
On the recommendation of my instructor , I participated in the joint school windsurfing competition .
On that day , I found something wrong with my position on the results board . I was shocked and decided to protest about the wrongdoings of the race committee .
To find out more information about having a green lifestyle , I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013 .
Also , I learnt communication skills with friends .
One of the purposes of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle , so I got a better physical development .
To have more different experiences , I have joined the " Dialogue in the dark " experiential exhibition .
In the totally dark environment , I experience the feelings of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their lives .
After undergoing this experience , I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future .
I have got a greater passion for engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life .
Also , I have learnt communication skills through others and am considerate .
Through this colorful school life , I have had different types of experience and I have finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician .
I think it is not a good engineer who only has skills in engineering .
Therefore , I think my experience can train me to be admitted as a suitable candidate in engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal .
People differ from each other and everyone has different professions .
Being a politician or a film star have something in common : those people are famous .
And , as a drawback of being a celebrity , they are followed by paparazzi almost everywhere .
I think that journalists should remember about the private life of famous people , which should remain a secret for other people .
There are a lot of cases where journalists make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists .
Besides , being followed by unknown people must be quite a scary experience .
Some people would say that it 's necessary for ordinary people to know how a politician lives so they can know if he should be trusted .
My listening is good and I can understand .
I make lots of grammatical mistakes when I am speaking and writing .
I like reading books and travelling to different countries and getting to know there culture .
It is a fact that the public transport is getting worse year by year , especially here in Peru . However , we have to think about the benefits that public transport has . For instance , it can be a cost - effective way to get to work . So , will there be no place for public transport in the future ?
The bus started after half an hour and Michael started talking with his parents over the phone and discussing his business .
After some time , the bus stopped for 5 minutes and Michael bought two chocolates , chips and a soft drink and offered her a chocolate .
This is how they started their conversation and , while exchanging conversation , they felt as if they had known each other for a long time ... they became attracted to each other and in the midst of that they kissed each other and even exchanged phone numbers .
Their bus was about to reach their destination next morning , so Michael offered to drop her at home and the girl accepted with a smile .
I am writing with regard to an advertisement that appeared in the local newspaper recently .
This advertisement sought a group of young people to work in summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , my name is Lorena and I am twenty - three years old and I am from Spain and I would like to job in your summer camp because I could improve my English and earn money ; my English is good because all this year I have been at an English academy to learn the language and now I am going to take another certificate . And as a result I will be able to communicate with children .
Secondly , last year I stayed in a beach summer camp and there were children aged 6 - 13 . My partner and I organised water activities when the weather was good , . On the other hand , when the weather was bad we organised puzzle games , adventure games , etc .
The advertisement mentions work in the kitchens . Our summer camp was small because it was in a small town , so we had to cook children food and I was able to do it without problems .
Yours faithfully ,
Honestly , as an eight - year - old boy who knew close to nothing about Christianity , his knowledge of Christianity was lower than that of a three - year - old child .
Anxiousness got the better of him as he prepared himself to enter the sanctuary .
WHATTTT I MISSPELLED MICHAEL ! ! Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transport means travelling around the world and cities using trains , buses , taxis , airplanes etc .
First of all , travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars have to pay for gas , insurance , repairs , environment fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .
In conclusion , public transport will not be affected by using private cars .
I strongly believe that , in the near future , public transport will be the main vehicles for travelling around the world , safely and cheaply .
Suddenly two people dressed as astronauts were leaving the park and warned the young boys to go to their house and wait until this unfortunate event was over .
While they were walking back home , they heard a journalist commenting on what incident had happened in the park .
The only thing they could clearly hear was : - But this can only be caused by contamination , although this windy day hasn't helped .
Jackson stopped walking and was distracted by a beautiful dog Michael continued on his way , unaware that Jackson was n't following him .
Almost arriving at home and mulling over the thoughts , he drew his own conclusions as to what might have happened .
What I think is stupid is that most people usually hide their faces behind the screen and no one wants to appreciate a sunny day anymore !
What I disagree with in this video is that he generalizes too much .
I think it is cool to have a social network , and there is nothing wrong with letting kids enjoy the technology that has become part of our generation .
However , they must be supervised , especially by their parents .
The thing nowadays is , if you disconnect from all of the things we have , people make fun of you and say that you are old or just do n't know how to deal with the modern world .
I 've experienced this , so that 's why I am saying it .
The internet has caused me depression once . I felt really alone and I used to be someone who I was n't in real life , but I learned how to deal with it .
Sportswear , elegant clothes and , of course , accessories .
In the summer time , Milan offers a variety of facilities and services , especially for young people .
Visiting the centre of the city is really fascinating : Piazza del Duomo is one of the most evocative squares in Italy with the particularity of the white marble facade of the Dome and its multitude of spires .
The surroundings are dedicated to fashion : you can find the most important shops for which Milan is known throughout the world .
The Sforzesco Castle is another suggestive historic monument and the green Sempione park is one of the best places where people can do sports or can attend a yoga class in the open air .
Finally , people can experience the Milanese nightlife in the area of the Navigli , which is really crowded from 19:00 till late .
Here you can experience the typical Milanese aperitif , during which you can have a cocktail while eating whatever you want and you can get to know a lot of young people .
The police announced checkout is the murder motivation .
Suddenly , he hears a weak voice whispering ; do not try to stop the shadow , let it kill the criminals or you 'll die .
He checks everywhere but ca n't find anyone .
He goes inside it and discovers a half - decayed body that fits Mendez 's description .
He understands that the shadow was the ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez 's murderer .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in Pamplona , and to outline some recommended shops that might appeal to tourists with different interests .
Shopping Facilities
In addition , several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located in the centre with easy access and cheap rates .
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionate about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " are dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
Recommendations for tourists
I would strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter their interests , should visit the aforementioned special shops .
In my opinion , celebrities should remember that if they want to be famous they , probably , will be chased by paparazzi .
On the other hand , they are still normal people , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
Probably , they want to go on holidays without being recognised by other people , without giving autographs and having their photo taken .
And celebrities know well that they have to be controversial , because that is the best way to achieve their lovely fame .
So , big names try to go somewhere without guards , without make - up to show themselves , to cause some juicy gossip about them , to gain fame in the easiest way .
To sum up , fame is ambivalent and people who want to be famous should realize it before becoming a star .
I found the advertisement on your website and I 'm sure that I 'm the person you are looking for .
Although I 'm an Italian native speaker , I 've been studying English for seven years ; furthermore , last summer I spent two months in Philadelphia , so I can communicate quite well in your language .
I 'm really cheerful and hardworking , and I have good marks for sport .
Thank you for considering my application .
Yours faithfully ,
I absolutely agree with the statement .
I understand , they are rich , their lives might seem interesting , even more interesting than ours , but they are not so different , they are not better than us , ordinary people .
Many journalists or photographers think when they write some gossip about politicians or when they take some " curious " photos , it 's OK .
It must be really stressful when you ca n't go anywhere without journalists following you .
And also , it must be really uncomfortable for friends or family who go with you .
Of course , some famous people might like this feeling that they are so liked and favourite and those who do n't like it have the possibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalists following them do n't exist .
My town is a very good town for taking care of the environment .
Our town is full of green plants everywhere : in the school playground , between the roads and many other places .
Plastic substances should be reused .
People with dogs will be sentenced and will suffer heavy consequences .
City X helps reforestation in many countries and places such as Brazil , Java , Sumatra , Peru , Guyana , French Guyana , Surinam , Bolivia , Uruguay , Paraguay , Colombia , Venezuela , Equador , Chile , Indonesia , Bali , Malaysia , Singapore , India , and many more .
New technologies are changing the way of thinking about private cars in a new , much safer and more ecological way .
On the one hand , public transport is well known for its large number of benefits , like less pollution and more economical aspects .
Moreover , in large crowded cities , using the underground or buses is usually a good way to avoid traffic jams , saving time and stress for sad drivers during their commutes .
For that reason , encouraging the use of public transport has been the main concern of most modern governments .
On the other hand , huge technological improvements in car features like self - driving , electrical engines , solar power and others , have created a new way of conceiving the way we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving . This is a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time as we are driving .
However , that is really close to being changed by Google 's Self - Drive Car , which is a new technology able to drive a car to any destination without human intervention .
Furthermore , the car could be empty and go anywhere we command .
That exciting news opens up a new world of possibilities for the use of cars .
In addition , many other improvements like electric engines from Tesla are adding new benefits to this new concept of Intelligent - Cars .
To summarise , cars are going to be so independent , ecological , cheap and intelligent that we will never take public transport again .
I have a brother named Markus who wants to be a professional tennis player when he gets older . He is 17 years old .
Last month I was working at a concert by decorating the stage and it seriously came out better than I expected it to .
Seems simple , but looks beautiful . Sometimes simplicity is the most perfect accessory .
Nowadays , people care more about themselves and doing good things is wrong for some of them !
I 'm sad when I see a nursing home but , you know , there , people will never say whether they do bad or good and , at the end of the day , they will not care only about themselves and their insecurity .
It is very beautiful because it is structured like a mountain ( and so you can start from the top floor and then you go down , visiting other floors ) .
If you want to visit the south part of Italy , you must start your trip from Florence , the birthplace of the culture . Then you must go down to Rome , the capital city of my country .
In that wonderful city , you must visit the statue of Jesus Christ called " il Cristo velato " made of marble , and then you must visit the centre of the city , full of fantastic features that make this city really special , like Spaccanapoli , Hidden Napoli , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio Church and so on .
I think you could work as an entertainer in some tourist villages around the country .
In that way , you could improve your way to make a relationship with people and it could also be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your ability , so I think that you could take some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .
Nowadays , people have different viewpoints about whether the principal concern when choosing an occupation is salary .
Personally , I disagree with the view that money is the most important consideration for choosing a job , because there are several equally important factors .
I believe that other considerations are as important as money .
Firstly , the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned .
Working in a company which is built on good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily bring fulfillment and sustain passion for your job for a long time .
We would believe that this work is worth contributing to for life .
Secondly , the co - worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job .
Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring workers a sense of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence the quality of work may increase greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessary for people 's daily lives , satisfying their basic needs .
For example , the cost of food , drinks and commodities needs the support of a steady income .
Furthermore , we may need much more money to do some activities , such as worldwide travel or camping for days .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , health - care will be increasingly important with people getting older . Hence having enough money as a stable income can not be disregarded .
In conclusion , while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people 's choice of profession , I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors .
There are various reasons why I am absolutely fascinated by this martial art .
Behind every single movement you will find gracefulness and power .
On entering a class , you are able to fully concentrate on the sport .
There are certain procedures at the beginning of a class which encourage you to empty your mind and be ready for class .
Especially in our hectic world , it is very important to find yourself and just listen to your body .
As a martial artist , you start to achieve great fitness and your balance will improve a lot , as well as your flexibility .
Many characteristics will increase immensely , such as confidence , self - defense or responsibility .
However , to see any improvements you should attend regularly and at least twice a week .
I 'm writing to reply to one of your advertisements published in the local newspaper last week .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the privilege of working as a teacher all my life , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care of children .
Due to my experience as a teacher , I am sure that I wo n't have any difficulty with organising sports and inventing a wide range of activities in order to entertain children .
As well as taking part in activities relating to cooking .
I would be grateful if you would send me more information about this job and you can get in touch with me on 671234567 .
Yours faithfully
Personally , I think the best month to come to Italy is April as the weather is temperate .
Thanks a lot for your invitation and if I was n't so busy , I would travel around with you .
I wish I could express my dissatisfaction with the facilities .
Also , the phone did not work properly , it was impossible to use it to call the receptionist .
There were six of us from a school , and we all agree the stay was unpleasant .
In the end , to my surprise , the price was more expensive than I expected as advertised on your website .
I regret to inform you that if you do not offer your apologies and compensation for all the disturbance caused to me , I will go to the authorities .
Yours faithfully ,
I live here with my wonderful family consisting of my mum , Aylin , my dad , Tom , my two really annoying brothers , Hans and Oliwer , and my two cats , Tiger and Smilla .
I go by cycle to " Fribergaskolan " every day , together with my friends Tekla , Julia and Bianca .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " . It 's an Asian buffet and they make the best food .
I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost every one of them in my old school ( called Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other big hobbies is photography .
They had to sew my finger , but in the end , everything went fine .
In Camden , every block has three or four containers to recycle paper , plastic , glass and old clothes .
What is more , people are encouraged to collect rain water to use for these activities .
Public transport has been made accessible by reducing the fares and making it free for students .
Nowadays there is a lot of information about health , having good eating habits , sleeping the number of hours recommended by specialist doctors , etc .
For these reasons , I consider that doing any sport that you like or you may be interested in could be a good option .
I think that , in particular , spinning is a hard sports activity because when you have spent approximately 1 hour on your bike you 'll probably feel tired .
If you want to lose weight , this type of sport is perfect because it belongs to the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food , whereas it is suitable for people that only do exercise for entertainment .
Furthermore , from the first time that I was in the gym , I have got to know nice and friendly sportsmen who try to give me advice not only on how to improve my techniques but on how to avoid injury too .
Although it is kind of hard for young people who have finished school finally , to understand that it 's definitely not finished yet , education does n't stop from then on and it is one of the most important things to continue going to school .
On the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't really have the opportunity to choose whether they want to go or not .
Trying to motivate people for education , studying and school is a very hard thing if they all know all those dreams are not going to happen anyway , whereas people in Switzerland have to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possibilities look like .
Therefore , education should be accessible for everyone , in my opinion , for as long as possible , but only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
Only if all of that is guaranteed will the motivation increase .
For most men , shopping is so boring and exhausting , but for women it can be the best way to make their mood better , because they are so happy when they buy lots of clothes in a sale , cheaper than at the regular price .
In the big shopping centres your purse can be stolen by pickpockets and you can lose a lot of money .
Personally , I really like shopping , because I am interested in fashion and I like looking good .
Nowadays , technology and society have changed in different ways and most people have more free time than before .
In contrast , technology has been becoming more useful and it could do work that we had to do some years ago and having more free time could be better for us .
You ca n't imagine how excited I am about travelling to the UK !
I 've been searching for a lot of stuff we could visit once I get there , for example , Piccadilly Circus .
I think it would be fascinating to go sightseeing around there and I could find some souvenirs for my family .
If you manage to organize it beforehand , I 'll have the time to prepare all the soccer stuff ( boots etc . ) .
I 'll give you some other information shortly .
Now I am working as a journalist at National Radio .
My colleagues are brain - damaged .
But instead I am writing about stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .
Sometimes it 's hard to believe that everything will be OK .
Friendship is one of the most valuable sentiments for people , especially for people who in their school days .
When it comes to the best way for students to make friends , some argue that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable . However , from where I stand , joining a sports team is undoubtedly the best choice .
Training in the same sports team , the students can not only release the whole day 's pressure , but can also build up good relationships with others through communication and exercise .
For example , the champions of the Olympic Games , China 's famous synchronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia . The two girls enjoy a really good friendship .
They got to know each other because they both joined the same sports team , and then after exercising and playing together , they finally become two enviable friends .
Additionally , cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team .
Here , students learn how to work together , how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork , how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self , and even how to negotiate or discuss with others , as well as how to be patient and rational .
Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students , I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent .
However , if students participate in community activities , for example , doing volunteer job in the town 's library , they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is spent working .
Is everything OK with your family ?
She has a wonderful body , but in her face you can see perfection .
This year , my country 's media celebrated a doctor who works in Afghanistan .
He left his job in a safe and comfortable Italian hospital to move to a country that is living through a civil war .
We have so many interesting places to visit , but if I must limit myself to only one , I choose the centre of the city .
It is renovating , but you can see many beautiful buildings .
Besides brilliant actors , they have incredible decor and it 's perfectly situated as it is very near to the bus stop .
I hope you 'll enjoy our city centre . There you can enjoy yourselves and learn something about our city .
It is a really interesting place and I think you 'll appreciate this .
Some people go shopping to feel better in themselves .
I personally love to go shopping and spend my money on new clothes .
I heard about it in my English class at my university .
I am in the 5th semester of Industrial Design , and I have 500 points in my TOEFL .
Taking part in the camp was wonderful because I helped with planning the activities .
Finally , I am a master in the kitchen . I really enjoy making desserts and I was on a cooking course last summer . In fact , I have experience in the kitchen .
As I mentioned above I have experience in camps . I speak English , so I just want an opportunity to show you .
Please give me the opportunity to work with you .
If you would like to know more about me , please contact me at your earliest convenience .

I am writing this letter to apply for the post advertised in the Tuoitre newspaper of 13 March .
Since graduating from University of Education majoring in business English , I have been working for a food joint stock company on a contract basis .
I am particularly interested in dealing with various types of foods and meeting new people .
I would welcome the chance to work as a part of your cafe where I will make a small contribution while developing my English skills further .
Meeting new people and setting up new social relationships are also the tempting point attracting me .
In addition , your cafe is conveniently located near my home , which takes about 10 minutes to go to on foot and I have 2 days off a week . That gives me the opportunity to take on a new job .
Yours faithfully ,
Last week , my friends and I were selected from the class to go on a fascinating trip to a contemporary and magnificent museum .
At this mind - blowing place , we looked and gazed at the phenomenally awe - inspiring and unbelievable fossils of ancient dinosaur bones up to 100 meters high !
I luxuriate the making of the spellbinding models and the gift we got to pick in the dinosaur shop .
I enjoyed this unforgettable trip to the museum , and hope you can take time out to go one day !
In the same place where Manuel Belgrano first raised the Argentinian flag on February 27 , 1812 .
Inside the " Monumento a La Bandera " you can see historical objects about the history of Argentina , and in the underground there is the hall of honor of American Flags .
Since I was a child , my favourite characters have always been the cruellest ones .
Obviously , because in every story , book or movie , although heroes are weaker than bad characters , they always win !
For example , in Terminator 's movies , the villain was always stronger and more equipped than the hero , but at the end of the movie , the righteous one wins the battle .
Finally , the latest movies are based on cruel , bad , dirty and strong characters ! Enjoy them !
In recent years , social media sites have developed and penetrated our society as the essentials rapidly .
There are enormous numbers of users all over the world , and social media sites such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are utilized for acquiring information , contributing ideas , sharing photographs and communicating between individuals , between individuals and organizations or between organizations .
While social media sites make our society more convenient and more comfortable compared with the past , they simultaneously bring with them some issues .
There are two advantages and one disadvantage of the current consequences , and I mention conceivable effects of social media sites in the future .
Usually children go to kindergarten up to 5 years old , and after that , they start preschool .
However , the Bulgarian government was thinking about changing the law so all children have to start at 6 years old .
I think I ca n't compare the education of children in school or tertiary education between Bulgarian and Australia , because I still do n't have children and I am not studying at university in Australia .
The town has 100,000 inhabitants .
After a day of shopping , you can go to one of the many restaurants Kortrijk has .
Unfortunately , our holiday did not live up to the claims made by you .
So , two of us had to share a bed , which is hardly acceptable .
The other problem related to the offered excursions . You promised a number of attractions , but two ( the walk up to the mountain , as well as the visit to a historic castle ) were not available .
Unfortunately , we also had problems with food . In your brochure it said that we would have a number of restaurants around , but in fact there was only one , which was , in addition to that , really expensive .
In our honest opinion , this is not acceptable , because in the brochure you talked about more than one restaurant .
Yours faithfully ,
It requires a vivid imagination to try to put a view of the future . First of all , the means of transport will change . Vehicles will depend mainly on solar energy or nuclear energy . A flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work . You will need to supply your car with spinach after they invent a spinach - fuelled car .
Also , food will change in the future . Capsules of your favourite foods will be available in the future in mobile supermarkets . These capsules will turn into your lunch as soon as you put a small amount of water on them .
I think today 's television is still good value , because there is more choice than ever before .
Of course , I think that we should n't watch too much television .
I think that 's the only negative point about today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
They just ca n't stop watching television , because there 's just so much that they like to watch .
In that way , we can enjoy all the new technology of today , and all the enjoyable TV programmes !
It was taken on the embankment of Khabarovsk .
In the background , you can see the River Amur .
On the left , you can see people on an observation area .
I was very excited because it was my first visit to Khabarovsk in the summer .
By the way , on that day everybody was celebrating the Day of the City .
Afterwards , we went for a walk .
When we were schoolgirls , we used to spend all our free time together .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for SUMMER CAMPS USA to work in different positions .
I have qualifications in teaching children . I am a graduate teacher from University Carlos III of Madrid . I have experience of adventure sports . I like the country and mountains .
I also have a lifeguard certificate .
I have experience with children aged between 10 and 12 . I have worked in the South School Centre for two years .
I do not have experience of working in kitchens , but I like cooking . I live alone and I do the housework myself and the meals .
Yours faithfully .
This year is the last one before going to university .
On one hand , it is true that leaving school means passing from the basis to your future profession .
After sixteen years of continuous work , it is the perfect moment to take a rest and enjoy your life by travelling .
To find out about other cultures and get new knowledge completely different from school .
However , it could be a great time to work and earn some money to pay for university or simply for saving it .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break before university , the routine of working and studying every day could break .
So when university starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and , as a consequence , the marks will be lower .
To conclude , I think after school we need to apply for university in order to continue working on what we like .
The year off should be taken after university studies .
As the number of traffic accidents has increased dramatically over the years , finding the best solutions has put the government under pressure as to whether to implement stricter penalties or use alternative regulations .
Personally , road safety can not be ensured by either the former or the latter methods .
Instead , it should be a combination of various actions .
As a matter of fact , severe punishments can partly decrease the rate of offences .
Nobody wants to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison , so fear of punishment might be effective and prevent people committing the offence a second time .
Moreover , one 's penalty also can be considered as a mirror that people can look at and avoid doing the same things .
Its penalties , depending on the severity , could include fines , licence suspension , community service or imprisonment .
Consequently , those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only , and therefore , minimize the number of accidents .
Authorities should enact more safety policies on roads and ensure by improving the quality of traffic facilities .
In many developing countries , the government rarely attach special importance to both the quality and quantity of the traffic system , especially in rural areas .
Furthermore , vehicle collisions are rising greatly due to the number of unclear road signs .
Traffic education is also a compulsory measure , especially for younger generations as they commit the majority of offences .
People should be educated carefully about all the safety regulations and laws when they get their driving licence . The more they know the rules , the less risks are taken on the road .
Therefore , it should be considered carefully how to combine both severe penalties and many other regulations .
Public transportation once used to be a convenient and inexpensive way to transport oneself in the city .
However , the increasing rate of car ownership has been taking the place of public transportation , providing more convenience for getting around places and to places .
Travelling by car gives flexibility in our schedule .
This convenience of cars enables us to use our time efficiently .
However , cars can not take the place of public transportation just because of that convenience .
Maintaining cars has associated costs .
In addition , cars require regular maintenance , such as oil change and checking tire pressures .
Mechanical problems can often be costly problems .
Unlike public transportation , one has to be responsible for his or her mode of transportation , and it could be expensive sometimes .
On the other hand , public transportation is inexpensive .
In other perspective , cars require driving .
For example , people who have disabilities and certain diseases are not able to drive .
For those people , public transportation can be the optimal choice of transportation .
In conclusion , cars are convenient . However , they are not for everyone .
Therefore , public transportation has its own reasons for existence , and there is a future for public transportation .
Our congregation has run educational family camps with the support of NNNs Integration programme for 8 years .
We have huge experience of organising seminars and camps for families with disabled children .
For many children , participating in this camp is the only opportunity to spend time with children their own age and to feel like fully - fledged members of society .
Words fail to express the emotions that all participants experience .
The health improvements of some children could be considered a miracle .
A reduction in financial support from foreign charity foundations has led to our camp not being possible this year .
Our budget is fixed for only 75 people , which is almost twice the number of participants last year .
We do n't know and we do n't want to know how to refuse children participation in the camp in this situation !
The greater amount of money has already been collected thanks to the trustee board of " NNN " community , but we still need an additional $ 13000 .
We are asking you not to be indifferent to disabled children and to provide feasible help .
The idea that newspapers will disappear with time due to people 's attitude towards surfing the internet for the worldwide news does not necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted .
One of the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of society deals with newspapers as a daily routine .
To the best of my knowledge , it is a way of behaving more than a way of coping with the latest technologies .
To begin , the reason for the decreasing popularity of newspapers is that most people , these days , rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world .
On the other hand , newspapers are presented in a definite place , with limited time , and in addition , they are a daily expense .
While some may claim that credibility is the main reliable aspect of publishing .
It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectable reputation are the ones which will be accepted by thousands of people .
In this respect , newspapers seem to be more credible than numerous websites that make up fake stories much more than publishing real news .
Furthermore , reading habits have their own taste , specifically for elderly people .
They enjoy turning the pages and reading the headlines using their eyeglasses .
This marvelous , tasteful generation ca n't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences on modern society .
In light of the foregoing discussion , it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect towards globalisation even in daily news worldwide .
However , the newspapers still have their lead in that respect .
It can be suggested that a combination of both media will positively influence the ways of delivering news .
However , I accepted her plan and I met her at " Wonderland Café " .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe : comfortable chairs and sofas , beautiful features and really good - tasting coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think of .
Although the most important thing is that there were not only friendly staff but they looked like they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
I strongly recommend this café if you want to enjoy an excellent coffee with a careful decor and brilliant performances in which you can participate while having a drink .
This sport is not so hard , and it gives me the opportunity to do an activity that is not too expensive and can be done outdoors and not in a closed sports hall .
When I come back from my job in the afternoon , I put on something comfortable , take my bike and go away along the streets alone with my thoughts and no one can disturb me .
The Visit is a movie in which two grandparents get to know their grandchildren for the first time .
They have never met their grandparents because their mom had a fight a long time ago with them , even before they both where born , that caused them not to know any more about each other .
The girl is making a film for a school project about the journey and about getting to know her grandparents .
because sometimes they start acting really weird and after 9:30 pm weird things happen to them . Then both kids understand that their grandparents are hiding a really big secret .
First , small stores provide products with more unique features and different selections .
Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff , this is the fun part about shopping in small stores : you can always find something unique .
Second , it is true that shopping in a shopping center is fast and convenient , because one can buy all types of things together .
However , most shopping centers provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive .
In conclusion , I prefer to shop in small stores because I am more likely to find the one and the only product , while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting .
The changes to television are evident . This could be because society is changing too .
On television we can see what people consume .
If TV programmes are a lot of rubish , it is because some people prefer them .
Maybe , there are a lot of repeats of old programmes , but some of them are still watched by a large number of people .
And sometimes , programmes are too aggressive and give people bad messages .
On the other hand , there are some channels which show documentaries and programmes about specific subjects like science , math or history .
I think there are good TV programmes , but people do n't give them the value that they should have .
There are a lot of old programmes , but it is n't a problem .
Television still has something important to show .
I am writing to congratulate you on the excellent Dumplings Festival which I attended in Cracovie last November .
I had a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concerning the organisation .
I was far from impressed by all the dumplings which housewives prepared .
However , there are a couple of small suggestions .
First of all , the venue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
I saw parents with children but kids did not have many attractions .
Once again , please accept my compliments on a job well done . I hope you find my suggestions helpful and I look forward to an even more successful event next year .
Yours faithfully
These days , the use of technology is increasing , especially the use of robots .
According to Russell and Norwing , robots are special machines that have intelligence to carry out activities on their own or by command ( as cited in Chijindu & Inyiama , 2012 ) .
They represent an innovation that has changed the world in distinct ways and has been embedded in different areas of society ; for example in security , health , the armed forces , education , industry and agriculture .
Consequently , positive and negative social impacts can be observed by the population .
More accurate surgery , emotional bonding and an increase in communication are examples of positive consequences .
Negative impacts , such as the human dependence on robots for doing basic activities and pollution of the environment , can be cited .
This essay will describe the positive and negative social consequences of robots , and possible implications in the future .
Each day , the environment suffers different problems caused by global warming and humans are the sole agents responsible for this problem .
We need to analyze and investigate the main problems to find solutions which might heal our world .
First of all , transport is the most significant carbon dioxide emitter .
As we know , in all cities , a lot of cars are used every day unnecessarily .
Probably , if we used public transport like buses instead of private vehicles , we would reduce the greenhouse effect caused by the CO2 produced .
I think we must be down to earth and creative to cut down on our daily trash production .
To sum up , it 's necessary to solve the environmental problems to keep our planet safe , so we had better start resolving closer issues .
In Pantanal , the weather is hot and wet , and we can drive to the river deeper in the wood and see wild animals , like alligators .
There , you will see beautiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice vineyards .
Here , you 'll find most kinds of temporary job , like in restaurants , bars , etc .
Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese . None of those languages are as popular as English is .
Over 1 billion people around the world speak English as a second language . Because of that , it is considered the universal language .
Nowadays , it is obligatory if you want to get a better job .
I will discuss the importance of English as a second language in Brazil .
Brazilians need to learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
Learning English as a foreign language will have a huge impact on Brazilians ' professional lives , helping them to get a better position .
The Brazilian educational system should be aware to develop students ' language skills more .
Learning English as a second language will help Brazilians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
It is a rich , graceful and delightful language to learn .
She was going to the national championships in swimming and she had been preparing since last summer .
Especially since the previous national competitions when she suffered a shoulder injury and could not start .
Anna won first prize and regained confidence .
These people sometimes think of their sons or daughters as innocent angels who spend a lot of their time with inexperienced teachers with no qualifications .
Teaching could be a stimulating working environment for students and teachers if it combined a rewarding career and the improvement of teaching skills .
In this case , teaching would n't be monotonous and with no opportunities or prospects .
I am writing to ask you if your school could organize an individual course in English for me .
My pronunciation is not always correct , and as a result , I have some problems with listening . I know English economic terminology very well but my everyday English is rather poor .
I enjoy visiting museums and travelling in my free time .
I prefer learning on a one - to - one basis , because it is more comfortable for me .
I love outdoor activities . I have been doing rock climbing for nine years now , and started motocross in 2010 . Also , I consider myself very friendly with children and teenagers . When I was a child , my father and I used to go camping almost every other weekend . That was until four years ago , because he is no longer able to stay out of the city . But he taught me all that I need to know to survive out there , so , I really know how to do things in the woods .
Also , I am chef , so I can assure you that I will be helpful in the kitchen . I have been cooking for large numbers of people for 7 years in a really big restaurant .
Yours faithfully
It is said that there is no future for public transportation . I used to think that when I was young , but it has changed as I am getting older .
There are a lot of benefits of developing public transportation .
First , it is more convenient .
Most developed countries developed a public transportation system to lower the impact of a growing population .
Shared costs make the huge expense of developing and building the public transport system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally - friendly .
Public transportation is proved to require less energy consumption .
I still think the public transportation system will keep on growing in such a crowded era .
How long have you not used public transportation for ? Do you agree that there is no future for public transport ?
I personally think so , the reasons are as follows :
Also , travelling , of course , is a big part of the function of the car !
The very well developed highways , roads , and city streets provide a good foundation for cars . Look at North America , highways have been built everywhere . It 's really your loss if you do n't drive a car .
Second , people start to learn to drive at the age of 16 , and they can master driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) . Soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still driving to their destinations as they are used to it .
So who can be bothered to take public transportation anymore ?
Third , public transportation sucks , when you think about it . You can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hassles of the public transportation transfers in your mind .
The wasted time also should weigh in , whether it is waiting for the trains , or waiting for the delayed buses , not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car .
And driving your own car can be very convenient too ; it can go right to your own garage .
All in all , public transport is not as fast as a car can be , it 's not as convenient as a car can be , so its future is in doubt .
Look around you , crimes and death are surrounding us . All these people are dreaming of living a peaceful life without all the problems of killing and sadness .
Thirdly , I lived for two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
For that reason , I believe that being safe is absolutely better than being sorry . I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that life will go on and one day all of us will be satisfied with this life .
In conclusion , I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy , because you live a calm life without anything making you sorry .
If I could change places for 24 hours with a famous person , I would like to be Paula Echevarria .
I will start by telling you something about Paula Echevarria . She is a very pretty and famous actress . She also writes a fashion blog . She is 34 years old and she is married to David Bustamente , who is a popular and handsome singer in Spain . They have a daughter - her name is Daniela - and they are like a perfect family .
I have chosen Paula because she is popular , famous , rich and has the perfect husband . But , above all , I choose her because she is friendly , intelligent and always smiling .
Therefore , she has everything good about being a celebrity , but the most important is that she is a great person .
Let me conclude by saying that I would like to be Paula for one day , because not only is she a good professional , but she is also a wonderful role model to be followed by everyone .
I would like to talk about my hobby of breeding birds . This hobby is very pleasant for me and also for many people , especially when you have different kinds of singing birds like canaries or finches .
This hobby gives me pleasure and a good sense of nature , especially when I wake up with the sound of the singing birds in my house .
At present , I have three kinds of birds . One of them is a yellow canary , the second one is a finch , and the third one is a combination of two kinds of birds . Each bird has its own special voice .
By increasing the variety of cars with new technology , people 's demand hasn't ' stopped .
As technology enhances the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it because of many different attractions that these cars have .
Furthermore , there are advantages to travelling by car , like seeing the scenery and also the costs are less in comparison with a plane .
On the other hand , by increasing the population , we should revise the regulations with the fast pace of technology .
To sum up , as thought cars are too convenient to some extent , but the cost will reduce the benefits .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for the job in the USA summer camps .
I am interested in applying for this position .
I am 25 years old and have just finished university studies to be a sports teacher .
I think I am suitable for this position because I am hardworking and energetic .
I also have the proficiency ( CPE ) degree and I have been to the USA several times so my English knowledge is good .
Furthermore , during my studies at university I worked on 2 projects based on sports activities for children aged 7 - 13 , organising them .
This job would give me the opportunity to practise my skills and get more experience with children as well .
Studying English abroad is the better alternative , but it has advantages and disadvantages .
On the other hand , living abroad , you 'll need to speak English all the time and you 'll have the opportunity to learn English in a short time , and in a not boring way .
So , probably , if you have the opportunity to stay abroad for several months , you should do it , to learn English and live a different experience .
In order to improve the time you spend on it , we will recommend you to star in one of our malls , where you can find at your disposal lots of facilities , from the most fashionable shop to the most traditional .
First of all , coming to a mall will help you to deal with them . Also , we have to rate positively the wide range of services you can find here : restaurants , coffee shops and some free areas to spare .
For all of you who have kids , you will also be interested in the different areas which take care of them for free for as much time as you need .
In conclusion , you will save time , money and a foot ache . So accept my advice and try to enjoy the rest of your time in the city .
There are two main characters .
Arthur went to London for an appointment for a job interview .
The company requested him to go back three days later , so he was looking for a hotel that someone had recommended him .
He was delighted with her and fell in love immediately .
He forgot his engagement and went to live with Blanche .
I chose this story because even though this story was written in the early twentieth century , the underlying theme is still current today .
And I would also like to highlight that it reflects the importance of every decision we make and how it can change our future .
" Atacama 33 " is a recent American movie that tells the true story of a group of miners that were trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months .
The film is well - developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that the miners had to go through .
The characters were perfect because they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involved in the real accident .
It is universally accepted that shopping is not always enjoyable .
However , other people think differently .
However , shopping can have a bad effect on our health , especially as we can feel tired or exhausted at the end of a hard day .
People claim that shopping can make our mood better , which in consequence will be fun .
In conclusion , I would like to say that there are different views about shopping and that 's not a surprise because we are all different .
TheInternet has been developed a lot over the last few years , and we can use it easily for doing any tasks .
On the positive side , the use of the internet helps us to quickly and easily find a lot of information about all the topics .
On the negative side , the use of the Internet can be a waste of time in our lives ; this happens because although searching is faster , we can get distracted looking at other things on account of the attractions of the Internet .
To sum up , the Internet is a good and efficient instrument if we know the correct use of it .
But to learn new cultures , we must know their languages , especially if we want to travel .
Due to globalization , there are more and more multinational companies that require employees who can speak at least fluent English , but if a candidate knows more languages he can have more career opportunities and achieve top level positions .
In my opinion , it is very important to speak several languages , not only for the above reasons , but also to train your brain , to have the opportunity to find a job abroad and , why not
Unfortunately , it is very difficult to learn foreign languages when we are adults , so it is extremely important to teach and to study them from kindergarten age .
The doorbell rang insistently . It was Saturday in the early morning and I was still in bed .
The last low sound of the doorbell managed to wake me up . " I am not dreaming " , I thought , " Who is ringing at this time?"Then I jumped out of bed and quickly went downstairs .
First I asked " Who is ringing so early ? What 's happening?Suddenly , a familiar voice shouted to me through the door .
You do n't think opening the door to your little brother"Oh brother ! , I shouted , and I ran to open the door . "
In answer to your question about the use of the internet by young people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information more easily and quickly .
Also , it plays a great role in removing the borders between nations . In a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just to talk to a friend .
Nowadays , the Internet is very useful , it has many ways of helping people , such us helping with their homework , using Google , or entertainment websites like Youtube , email services such as Hotmail , and the number one social network site , Facebook .
I think it is a bohemian way to travel too , because the train used to be one of the most appreciated means of transport in literature .
The boat is a very beautiful way to travel , but I 'm sure when I travel by boat in the future , I 'll feel anxiety because I 'll be surrounded by water .
In conclusion , my main problem is concern about how safe the means of transport that I take is , so , the train lets me be more relaxed than other ways to travel .
Volleyball is a complete sport where you can exercise all your muscles .
A feature of volleyball is that the players have to rotate their positions while they are scoring points .
In fact , I enjoy playing volleyball because it is a fun sport which you can play with a lot of people , eleven people to be precise .
I suggest to new players of volleyball that they should start step by step .
Wear comfortable clothes and suitable shoes .
Nowadays , they have to work through a lot of issues while they are in their adolescence . They begin to have a lack of self - esteem , depression , social pressure , and all this can cause a lot of problems .
I went to a workshop about a light - controlled synthesizer .
On the way there , everyone who participated in the workshop stopped to buy some snacks .
When we reached the workshop , the kids and I were told to put on protective glasses and given booklets with the instructions .
We were instructed to make a badge that flashed different coloured light by using solder to attach the LED and battery hatch to the badge .
Then we had to follow the instructions in the booklet to make the synthesizer .
At first I was quite confused , but then one of the instructors came and helped me out .
Each synthesizer emitted a loud noise .
When the light sensor is in the shade , the synthesizer emits a lower pitch , and when the sensor is exposed to light , the synthesizer 's pitch rises .
I worked as an Advocate ( Solicitor ) for a period of more than four years and from those jobs I gained lots of experience in minute taking , dealing with clients , arranging meetings and handling cases .
I am a proficient user of Microsoft Office packages .
I worked voluntarily for some cases relating to juvenile justice , like ( speedy disposal of cases , abuse of their rights while they were in custody , custodial death etc . )
I worked on a project about how education as a fundamental right for children under 14 years of age is denied in some communities .
In my second placement , I had to do lots of administrative work , including typing .
I had to work as a liaison with clients as well as the company officials ( since Shriram Law Consultants is a part of the Shriram Group of Companies ) .
The article and the lecture are about the attitude towards conducting medical experiments on animals .
The author claims that the main aim of the scientists is to reduce human suffering even if it demands research conducted on animals .
The lecturer opposes this idea , as , in her view , medical experiments on animals should not be conducted .
Firstly , the author informs us about the impossibility of discovering new types of drugs .
Secondly , the author suggests that it is impossible to replace experiments on animals with anything else .
The lecturer disagrees with that point of view , because it is possible to introduce computer substitution or do research on tissues .
The lecturer argues that , as a biologist , she used to see animals suffering without the appropriate amount of anesthesia .
The article states that the most efficient replacement for internal - combustion engines will be fuel - cell engines , because of their various advantages , while the reader refutes this point by stating that hydrogen does not have so many advantages .
First of all , the reading passage says that the internal - combustion engine relies on petroleum , which will soon be depleted , but hydrogen will not deplete easily .
The professor counters this point by explaining that hydrogen is , in fact , not easily found .
She adds that it is not directly usable , because hydrogen should be obtained in a pure liquid state , which technologically is very hard to keep under -200 degrees Celsius .
The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem , because it needs to be purified in order to be used .
She explains that in the process of purification , a large amount of coal and oil is burned , which pollutes factories rather than the environment .
Finally , the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economical , because it requires only half of the energy of internal - combustion - powered cars .
She explains that platinum is very hard to find and , without this metal , it is impossible to produce hydrogen .
An Unexpected Success
I am a fairly calm person and I am interested in reading every kind of book , therefore , I have a quiet life .
Last Spring , however , something happened which surprised everybody , especially me .
My little sister wanted to learn to play the piano so she joined a music school which organised a concert performance at the end of the course .
Unfortunately , she could no longer play .
I was absolutely terrified as I had to show .
I am definitely going to play the piano for a long time .
He was the pastor of a Baptist Church and he fought against the discrimination against black people in the United States in the 60s .
He founded the civil rights movement to free black people from racial segregation and inequality .
He participated a lot of times in meetings , as a leader , and he went against the law several times .
Report on shopping facilities in my town :
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to assess the most interesting shops for tourists and make some suggestions .
Shopping facilities :
In general , shops are concentrated in a specific zone so that tourists can find what they are interested in very easily .
Suggestions :
In general , tourists think shops should be opened at midday as they are foreigners and like to buy things after seeing the sights around the city .
Conclusion and recommendations :
I 'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience .
As you know , Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation . It 's a very fast , energetic city with lots of things to do and to see .
You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school .
In addition , a few years ago , the Big Theater was restored and has regained its original appearance .
There is no need to describe all the sightseeing in Moscow . You can easily find it on the Internet . I just want to say that I 'm sure you 'll like it a lot .
It 's a group of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history .
There you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia .
You will understand that people here and there are very different and their lifestyles are dissimilar .
I could n't wait to listen to my favorite song until they played it . It was the best experience ever . I wish you could have been there to see that .
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NAPLES AND I HOPE IT'LL BE USEFUL .
I THINK THAT THE EASIEST MODE OF TRANSPORT FOR YOU IS THE UNDERGROUND ; NEAR THE TRAIN IN GARIBALDI SQUARE THERE IS THE UNDERGROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO CATCH AND YOU HAVE TO GET OFF AT CHIAIANO STATION . I'LL BE AT CHAIANO STATION , SO WE WILL WALK TO MY HOME .
Some people claim that universities and colleges should not spend a great deal of money on sports and social activities , as their budgets should prioritize classes and libraries .
However , as educational institutions , universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge for their students to help them develop academically and socially .
Let us look at an example of a university student .
The student had a great number of assignments and projects , so he spent more time on accessing the library , becoming more ambitious to study books , and using a computer to search the for latest information .
Sometimes he felt tired of doing papers , and went to the gym to play basketball .
I had a similar experience
when I studied at university . I sat in classes for hours every day .
At university , I also have a lot of assignments , so I like to go to the library to study , where it is more quiet , spacious and internet accessible .
That 's why I like to go to a school with good facilities and widespread information to help me to be a successful person .
Sports and social activities can greatly improve my efficiency .
For these reasons , I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social activities to prepare students for their future development .
Academic education will always be at the heart of a university .
In universities , sports and social activities should by no means take the place of a focus on academic study .
I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academic facilities as well as sports and social activities .
It is a great life stage , but at the same time , it is difficult . Sometimes teenagers have problems with their families , with themselves . As a result , they do n't know what to choose .
Many times , when people leave high school and they go to University , they realise after several months that the course they had chosen is not for them .
You can work , travel , go on an exchange study program , rest and do something that you are interested in .
When students go to university after they have taken a year off , fewer people leave the course after several months because they know themselves better .
I 'm interested in doing a course at your school .
I have an intermediate level and I 'd like to speak English better because my pronunciation is n't very good .
My grammar and writing are good , but as I 've said already , my pronunciation is awful .
I 'm available to start the course immediately and I want both an eight - week intensive course and a one - month summer course in August , when I 'll be on holiday , and in addition , I 'd like to learn in small groups because the teacher can focus on his pupils better .
Twenty years ago , no one would have thought of the invention of the iPad or smartphones and how they could change our lives , but today , these items have become necessities of our daily lives . Nowadays , many people have got into the habit of carrying their smartphones no matter where they go .
The progress of science , whether it is in scientific research or in the design of consumer products , has changed our lives and will definitely keep changing our lives in the future .
The iPad , smartphones , genetic food engineering , all of them have one thing in common - they have changed our lives dramatically .
Take genetic engineering as an example . On the one hand , it helps farmers to produce more crops and meats ; on the other , it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways of producing more crops and poultry in the future , resulting in an unprecedented increase in the human population , which brings pollution to the environment .
To cope with the problems of overpopulation and pollution , people need to dramatically change their lives in the next 50 years : they may , among other things , face tight birth control and environmental protection measures imposed by the government .
It is sad to say that the future generations have no choice but to adapt to the changes in order to survive .
As a result , I could be very helpful with organising sports and activities , but I could also provide assistance in other places , including the kitchen .
Furthermore , I am cheerful , energetic , and I get on well with kids .
Yours faithfully ,
I watched the film one month ago and it has really impressive and engrossing effects .
The film is about a movie shooting and the adventures of a film crew which is in Bolivia .
They try to make a film which explains how Christoph Colomb discovered America and talks about what Colomb 's aims were .
They come across some problems while they are shooting the film and this supplies quite a few strong highlights .
These problems are imperialism and poverty .
Actually , they want to describe the history of discovery and conquest from a critical perspective , but while shooting the film , there are some protests against the privatization of water and the team fall into chaos and then the film starts to give some social and political messages .
The crucial point is the transformations and experienced contradictions of the characters .
In our imperialist and capitalist world , we need more films or artistic influences which mention the problems of our life and realities .
I do n't think that there is no future for public transport and I agree that travelling by car is much more convenient .
If the government provided good transport infrastructure like modern and comfort buses , traffic free Metro lines , then people would rather use public transport than travel by car .
Governments should promote the best mode of transport in order to reduce carbon emissions and people would be encouraged to go green .
Many times , because of huge traffic congestion on the road , we waste our time , while using public transport like the Metro saves us time .
Department stores are found in all big cities .
There you can find almost everything you want .
CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE
There are such interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would never have expected or , unsurprisingly , misinformation .
We know that making social contact can sometimes be a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and daunting experience .
In my experience , being in front of the screen of a personal computer , you will be able to express and exchange ideas or opinions as easily as if you have to in front of someone else .
However , both readers and writers do not only do it in an altruistic and philanthropic way , but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to become famous if they really appeal to a large number of people and they will also be able to earn money thanks to advertising .
Consequently , we should never blindly trust everything we see or read on the Internet .
To give an example , I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series , characters , new seasons , and when they will be ready to watch again .
Whether they give us reliable information or not usually depends on the source .
You must n't take everything into account .
To clarify what the situation is , it is true that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites , but the fact is writing or reading a blog can give people a practical way to communicate and share preferences , beliefs or thoughts . however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He was hunting on a hot day in summer in the countryside near Monfrague with Jon , a friend from Madrid .
Jon did n't usually go to the countryside , so he did not know how to walk over the stones and he was afraid .
There was a lot of blood and it was then that Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I 'm writing to you in connection with your volunteer project , whose
description I found at http://http://europa.eu / youth/. I would like to know whether you are
accepting applications at the moment .
Your project is very compelling for me .
take part in it . I could help you with teaching math , together with computer programming ,
in an engaging and interesting way . I 'm passionate about math and programming .
Currently , I am working as a python programmer .
Programming language is a great choice for teaching kids to program .
Programming is fun and math concepts are absorbed much more easily through it .
I have a bachelor 's degree in mathematics ( I 'm a math teacher ) and a master 's degree in computer science .
Please let me know if you are looking for volunteers and if you are considering
applicants from Russia .
Would you be so kind as to tell me the aapplication deadlines , and program start and end date .
I have a sending organisation " Centre for Youth Studies - Higher School of Economics "
( accreditation number 2014-XT-16 )
I often try to play interesting games with the children . I think the games are a fun way to teach interesting things both to children and to older people . That is why I invent new methods to introduce science in the children 's lives .
The favorite game for my brothers is called " coca boom " . With this game I showed them what chemistry is . We cough a " Coke " and some " Mentos " sweets , then I put the " Mentos " into the " Coke " and I taught them what happens when you mix two substances .
Also , I think I would be a good person for the job because I like nature . I could teach them a lot of things about Geology , a camp is perfect for introducing the boys and girls to stones and minerals .
I would be happy if you considered me if there are vacancies .
I play basketball in my free time and hang out with my friends from my old school .
Everything is made of blocks and you can build and play with friends .
But I played basketball and tennis at the same time , so I chose basketball , because I think it 's fun .
Besides seeing touristic or historical places and attending open - air activities , people also want to see the museums of the city they visit .
Because museums offer so many interesting and different things , they differ from other places in the city being visited .
First of all , people visit museums to learn the history of the city being visited . We know that museums are generally established to exhibit special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to exhibit modern belongings .
These old things in the museum give us unique information about the history of the city and its social life .
For example , when you go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City , you can see lots of historical monuments and items belonging to American history and also other countries ' history .
Many items in museums have cultural value as well as historical value .
For instance , art museums include art collections such as paintings by many different artists .
Besides historic and cultural characters , some museums also can be a source of fun , including attractive activities .
There you can see dinosaurs from prehistoric times .
In sum , museums are attractive places for tourists to find out about the city they are visiting .
By visiting museums we can learn interesting details about the history and culture of that society .
In addition to having lots of information , we also can have fun seeing interesting things in the museums , such as huge dinosaurs . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you visit .
Today plenty of ecology organisations are trying to raise people 's awareness of the environmental damage .
It is often necessary to have a car when living in a small city or village without public transport , and it is understandable .
But while living in a big city , where there are lots of bus stops , tram stops or metro stations , it is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck in a jam during rush hours .
As the ecology organisations says , it is better for the environment , and as we decided , it is better for us to save our precious time .
Increasingly , people prefer to use public transport rather than drive a car for these reasons .
The importance of the internet in our lives
The last decades there has been a massive change in our lives . This is caused by the development of the internet .
There have been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on social life .
The internet allows you to search for information in massive online libraries for research and writing essays .
There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find the publications of researchers around the world .
The internet is becoming important for our studies because of the availability of information sources .
The internet has a lot of consequences in our lives .
Also , it gives us the possibility to get in contact with family and friends .
In my life there are so many sports I like but there is one in particular that I love so much .
When I was young I saw my father watching football programmes every day but I did n't understand what football was .
However , over time I began to understand how to play and I liked it much more than in the past .
In Italy , football is the most followed sport , especially in my town where the most important player in the world played : Diego Armando Maradona .
He won two national championships and also an important European competition .
On the other hand , my advice that I would give to someone who is starting this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsibility and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
Is it best for the pollution and the environment ?
But , I think that in other cases we take the car without any reason . It 's only a bad habit and maybe we could change it to improve our health ( going on foot or taking a bike for example ) and also we will help to the environment and the pollution .
For example , I 'm a commuter and I also need my car to pick up my daughter from school in the afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't like the traffic . Then when I get away from the hustle and bustle of the city I usually go to my village .
In my opinion , tennis is the best sport because I 'm an individualist , so I prefer individual sports , because in these kinds of games everything depends on you .
I hope this sport will have more importance in Italy in the future .
I am writing to you to raise an important issue concerning the school library .
I look forward to understanding and I hope we will reach a consensus .
Together with an unofficial Student Council , we created a petition which is to raise the issue with the teaching council .
Our priority is good preparation for the secondary school certificate .
Moreover , pupils demand the possibility to borrow books .
It is the most important matter , because most of us are not able to buy highly educational books .
Our request boils down to the fundamental role of education .
It is broadening the horizons of our knowledge .
Besides the issues that have already been mentioned , there is also the undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library , it would be more representative .
Given the rationality of the above arguments , we pupils expect the positive consideration of our request .
Respectfully yours ,
Our lives have changed a lot since the last century due to technological improvements and changes in society .
First of all , as we said before , people 's lives have changed due to two important elements , which are technological improvements and changes in society .
The first one is very obvious because , every day , researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new inventions and improve the old ones .
For instance , one hundred years ago , it was impossible to see a woman working and supporting the whole family alone financially , or studying for a degree at university , things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society .
In addition , there are other conditions and facts that have helped to change people 's lives , such as political decisions , global wars and global economic problems , etc .
I am writing to You in connection with your request for information about an interesting building or place to visit in Katowice .
The most interesting is the art gallery , Oko Miasta , which is located in the city centre .
It is a very distinctive place because of its size , its appearance and its atmosphere .
It is a good place for everyone who wants to get some Polish literature .
Furthermore , in the building of the art gallery there is a club Oko .
Not only is it the popular place among young Polish citizens , but it is also really extraordinary : people can walk the red carpet and drink the most famous drinks .
While he was lost in the action , a strange and unexpected sound came from his sister 's bedroom .
My sister should definitely close her windows . I am going out of this house . I should leave this cat here and let it ruin her things " .
Destination : Disney .
Do you imagine travelling to the United States ?
Have you ever gone to a place designated only for having fun ?
Disney is the dream of a lot of people in the world , many of them have said that it is a magic and awesome experience .
Firstly , Disney is not an ordinary destination like beaches or mountains , it is a place that requires a different means of transport since it is a long way away .
The vacation starts when the plane takes off and nerves and happiness blend , creating an experience you will never forget .
When the plane arrives at the airport in Miami , you can appreciate the beautiful view that this place offers .
Secondly , the entrance to Disney is incredible and colorful . It also has the main characters in it .
Each one has a different topic and amazing rides perfect for adolescents .
To conclude , Disney has so many facilities that it is impossible to get bored , you can relax in your hotel and have an unforgettable time on the roller - coasters .
Indeed , it is true that travelling by car is much more convenient .
We therefore have to choose other alternatives .
This technology will be improved further in the future .
I 'm not addicted to films whatsoever , but I prefer to watch the ones that are said to be good and stand out from the others .
Besides that , if I had to choose a type of film , I would say , comedy and action ones are the most appealing to me , if they have a real dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one .
Honestly , they lasted for 3 hours , but the most impressive of all this is that they were able to create a single world between me and the screen for all that time .
They really held my attention , they had all the characteristics that I consider the basic ones in a film , not to mention the astonishing actors that gave an impressive performance .
All I expect in a film is the way they establish connections between the actors and the audience in a way that allows them to play with the characters as if they were puppets and to create a coherent and attractive film .
I am writing this letter regarding the advertisement about the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I understand that you require people who have good English , are energetic , cheerful and hardworking , who are able to look after children between 8 and 12 , help organise sports and evening activities and work in the kitchen .
I have previous experience working with " ADRENALINE SUMMER CAMPS " coaching children in how to play football for a football championship . Within the summer camps , I also organized other activities such as climbing , running , competitions , expeditions and other movement .
During the time I spent coaching , organizing and helping in the kitchen , I learnt that the most important thing is to keep a positive attitude and always motivate them every step of the way .
I truly enjoy working with children to help them learn and improve their already acquired skills , especially in sports .
Hence the reason I am very interested in this opportunity to coach sports for children during this summer .
Yours faithfully
I think everybody knows the importance of having a person who is always there .
For me , a good person to speak with about everything , especially about my problems .
Although we have many different views on life , we understand each other and are best friends .
Many people around the world follow international sports events passionately .
That could be a great way to stop international tensions , although crises and wars still exist .
Sports in general are followed by a huge percentage of the population .
I do n't usually watch sports competitions . I used to do that sometimes , but nowadays I 've been thinking that it 's just a waste of money and time .
I 'm keen on individual disciplines .
People seem to be distracted from their real life .
I 'd prefer that people demonstrate good behavior independently of international sports events .
I 've been interested in playing an instrument since I was a child .
Latent fingerprints are commonly found at the scene of a crime .
They are key clues in forensic investigation .
Persistence and uniqueness are the characteristics of the fingerprint .
The latent form of fingerprint is invisible to the human eye , hence the need for some methods for visualization and development of latent fingerprints .
Divergent approaches are used on a routine basis for the development of latent fingerprints .
Powders , by adhering physically to the fingerprint residue develop the latent fingerprint . Chemical reagents undergo reactions with the organic and inorganic parts of the fingerprints . Developing the latent , small particle reagent developed latent fingerprints by adhesion to sebaceous content of the fingerprints , ninhydrin reacting with amino acid of the fingerprint and developing the latent marks . Single and multi - metal deposition methods work on the principle of deposition and result in the negative development of latent marks .
New methods are continually added in the literature and show the importance of fingerprints in the criminal investigation system .
One can easily deduce information about culprits from the partial form of a latent fingerprint .
What is more , if you want to get rid of depression or stress , go to the gym .
According to scientific research , mental health is closely connected to physical health .
As for me , I am keen on basketball as it is my personal way to unwind and work out .
I am into it because it is quite addictive and spectaculous .
Moreover , it is considered to be one of the most active and popular kinds of sport all around the world .
To sum up , I believe that if you want to be mentally and physically fit , you should try to do some sport and exercise . Also , do not worry if you are not so good at it , just keep doing it and enjoy yourself .
These are defined as plant - derived substances that occur naturally with no or minimal manufacturing processes and which manage and cure various health conditions effectively ( Bent , 2008 ; Tachjian ; Maria and Jahangir , 2010 ) .
Although herbal medicines have significantly performed well in the treatment and management of illness , people have increasingly consumed these products via self - directed therapy .
This essay will demonstrate that there is considerable evidence for a possible detrimental affect on public health due to the increasing use of self - prescribed herbal medicines and that a health crisis is likely if no action is taken by health organisations .
The most recent thriller I 've seen is " The Miserables " .
However , I 'm not referring to the musical , nor the intermediate version ; the oldest version is the relevant one .
It is a movie that presents a lot of richness in characters and historical facts .
You are able to analyse human emotions and rationalise moral situations , so it is a movie that provides a lot of factors .
I found it very exciting because it shows a pre - revolutionary era when Jean Valjean is sent to work as a slave for stealing a small piece of bread .
After he ends his sentence , he has to solve many moral situations that prove who he really is .
What really makes the difference is if you choose to help others or not .
I think people who read the book ( written by Victor Hugo ) who are interested in this historical incident , or who merely want to analyse human relationships must see the movie .
Meanwhile , wild animals which have forests and wetlands as their habitats will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to find after the destruction of their homelands .
To reduce the above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before the construction of buildings and transport and try their best to decrease the side effects .
They should provide financial support to those who once lived in such destroyed areas and help them develop professional skills to look for good jobs .
Although there will be many bad influences of large - scale building on people and animals , countries would develop better if governments could make efforts to solve the above problems .
Personally , for me , shopping is very pleasant , but sometimes it can be a little tiring .
In my opinion , there are a few advantages of shopping .
First of all , if we are in shops , we can buy everything we want .
Anyway , there are also some disadvantages of shopping .
He had great talent , but no one understood his creative mind .
Everyone considered him a crazy and boring guy obsessed by his passion , except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to give up his dream .
At that time , Kate was working in an international advertising agency .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutionary at the same time , something that could give a new vision of reality , and Kate started to offer some information about many artists .
One night she was working at home . She was in difficulty because no one satisfied her clients .
She started to be a little bit nervous , she was n't able to find any solution when , suddenly , she remembered that Michael 's art had the features requested by her clients .
She immediately picked up the phone and called Michael and she started to explain her project .
Michael was very excited because he finally had the opportunity to introduce his view of art through his pictures .
After lots of meetings and conferences with the representation of China , Japan , the USA and Oceania , Michael began to be the man who he had dreamed of being since he was a child .
Everything was going well except his behaviour towards his friend Kate .
Kate was really angry and she ordered him to leave her room immediately .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to propose the best places for visiting and to show the wide range of existing facilities which can be used by young people who are going to make a trip to my area .
Whenever I hear about famous actors or singers complaining about photographers following them , I ca n't get a smile off my face .
What 's the description of a famous person ?
Despite the fact I said that famous people need to be well known , I think that ca n't be applied to politicians .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie star 's , but they should make their decisions transparent for most of the population though .
Computers and Information Faculty
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Letter of Recommendation
It is my pleasure to write a recommendation letter for Mr
I have known Kadeer since 2012 , when he joined the faculty of Computers and Information , Fayoum University , as an undergraduate student .
He attended my labs on the " structured programming " course during the first year .
We frequently discussed various difficult problems in the scope of the course , and I was impressed by his analytical abilities .
He showed a distinct intellectual level compared to other students .
Also during this course , he had to work in a team and deliver a project as a requirement for the course .
He contributed excellent and innovative ideas during this project and he showed that he is an excellent team player .
Kadeer as one of the most excellent and outstanding personalities among his colleagues .
I believe that Mr Kadeer will perform very well and I strongly recommend him for the " Google Student Ambassador MENA Program " .

He was very naughty and was not very interested in his studies .
He was a very big menace and the villagers hated him because of his mischievous behavior .
People gathered around his house hearing him screaming out loud and within no time the fire brigade also arrived at the destination .
He was even made to apologize to all the neighboring villagers .
The chasing of Jason vs. Vin was so exciting . Furthermore , a walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jason is interrupted by another party .
The next scene was the demolishing of the whole building as well as the blowing up of Jason 's helicopter .
Vin 's family lived happily ever after because the enemy was eradicated and the rest got jailed .
The film was the last movie starring Paul Walker as , during the film production process , he passed away due to a car accident .
This film 's Soundtrack , ' See You Again ' , was composed by Wiz Khalifa and dedicated to Paul .
This film will keep everyone 's attention because the scenarios , the action scenes , and drama beyond Paul 's death are harmonized rigorously .
I know how much you like both activities so I suppose you are having a hard time .
I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson . You promised me you would never give up ! You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you achieved it .
You 've kept working on it for almost your entire life now and , although you have not become a professional one , you have never given up .
When I first introduced you to it , you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements .
Proof not only that you are very determined , but that piano playing was meant to be .
I 'd suggest we take some days off together and head for any particular place he would like to go to .
Then , once we got on the car , I 'd let the music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words .
At that point , I would let his talking go on without stopping him through interruption .
Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive .
I really enjoy volleyball and horse riding , although my favourite sport is swimming .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , especially in the summer , because in the water you can cool down .
Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling , but public transportation is the most effective way to take people from one place to another .
In fact , travelling by car is not convenient when people have their own cars for their family or themselves .
The main advantage of public transportation is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively low cost .
For example , a bus can take more than 40 passengers at one time at a low cost .
The second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution in a city .
In conclusion , public transportation will still play an important role in transportation in a city , unless environmentally - friendly vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well to accommodate a huge number of cars .
Personally , people must dedicate most of their time to things they should do for two important reasons .
By doing so , you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential .
For example , when I was 17 , I was starting my first day of class at the university .
I started to feel bored with the complementary courses on my curriculum because they were the kind of courses that did n't have any relevance to my university course , which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Law , and so on .
I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with when I went for a vacation in the countryside .
That experience taught me how important it is to do whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in life .
Second , if you avoid doing things just because you do n't like them , you 'll miss opportunities .
As you can see , my friend missed the opportunity because he did n't like what he was asked to do .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention of the last century , while others think that there are a lot of inventions throughout history that are more important than the computer .
Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and it is for that that I think it is the most important invention .
Some people say that the computer changes the way people see the world , and this changes the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .
On the other hand , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with their friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that it is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that there exist inventions more important than the computer that we still use nowadays .
Personally , I prefer different movies .
Therefore , I feel more peaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and undemanding .
Thank you for your reply , it was so useful , but I still have some questions and I would be really pleased if you could give me this necessary information .
First of all , I want to know what water sports you offer , because our group of students would probably be interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surfing , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would also like to ask you about the type of equipment you can lend us to do these kinds of activities and sports I have just mentioned .
As you said , the safety of the students is our main concern . We must be completely sure that you will take care of them , chiefly because most of the students are still young and we have a strong commitment to their parents .
However , I do n't think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city , especially if you take into account the economic aspects .
In my view , using public transport in this case has two important advantages : the first one is you do n't have to worry about parking ; the second one is you can move in a relaxed way , reading a book , listening to music or talking with other passengers .
Nevertheless , having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not only because the price of petrol is continuously rising , but also because you have to pay high taxes for the car .
In short , although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than doing it by public transport , it is not probable that it will disappear in the near future .
Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life . I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioning or anything which can make travelling enjoyable .
Most people are frustrated or agitated because they have to use public transport .
If the bus drivers could follow their timetables there would n't be any argument .
Artificial intelligence is one of the best ways , we can switch drivers to these vehicles .
In conclusion , we have a lot of things to improve .
We can also help by paying for our tickets . Yes , this is simple , but these companies need money to improve their businesses .
In fact , probably it was n't a significant thing for most people , but it was for her .
Hello I 'm Mathieu Sanabria and I 'm here to deny and explain everything about the case of my sextape . I went to a party with my football team - mates and we were having a whale of time . Then some girls arrived and I started to talk with one of them . I like her and she likes me so , we went to my room to have privacy and I do n't know how , but some guys got into my room and started to record me with the girl and I did n't notice . Then many days later , I received a call from a guy who told me that he had a very explicit video of me doing things with a girl and that if I did n't give him some money he would put that video on the Internet .
The British band announced that the album was coming with news ; a new singer , Bruce Dickison , joined the group and made the fans completely astonished by his nice - sounding voice .
The infrastructure built for controlling and maintaining the environmental ecosystem is bad . In other words , the government and people do not care about the environment , rather they spoil the environment .
The government always say they are doing their best to improve the environment but nothing is done . Perhaps they are mismanaging people 's money in terms of various projects that control the pollution of the city .
The government is not the only one to blame , but also the people who live here , who never care about their environment .
Although many factories and people are polluting the environment drastically , some people and organizations are protecting the environment , but most often these people are discriminated against by society .
But they do n't care about this and continue with their work . Often these people tend to demonstrate the effect of the pollution on people and future generations and have made some people change the way they look at the city , but often , most people do n't care about what they try to say and sometimes these people are scolded .
So far , people do n't understand the consequences of pollution , but within a decade they will suffer and understand the consequences of pollution in their life for sure .
I have seen your advertisement and I would be more than delighted to take part in a summer camp as an assistant .
I think I have some experience with young children as I have to take care of my own brothers every day .
And in order to help them defend themselves , I can also teach them some techniques for self - defense .
Yours faithfully
As the only Brazilian president from an underprivileged background , Lula has made history after running for President four times .
Since he took up office in 2002 , Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking more than forty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
During Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom like never before and became a world economic power .
Democracy also had fundamental changes in that period .
To curb corruption , new laws were created , institutions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .
Minority groups received more attention to protect their rights and investments in education , health and well - being increased .
Curiously , Lula is the only Brazilian president without a university degree .
For the poorest Brazilians , Lula and his history is something to be proud of .
For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor migrant from northern Brazil , overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own , privileged , university - educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems .
I am writing to apply for a job in the USA I saw recently in your advertisement in a local newspaper of my city .
Further to our recent telephone conversation , I have worked as a babysitter with children aged 5 - 10 for five years .
Furthermore , I worked for some major companies when I finished my degree in Journalism five years ago .
By the way , I have experience in the organization of sport and evening activities because , at university , I did a course in Public Relations .
If you want to see my reports , I can send you them whenever you want or , if you prefer to ask my teachers about me , I can send you their phone numbers in case you want references from my job .
My teachers have said to me that , if you want , they can write a letter about my experience .
Yours faithfully ,
Most people like to drive cars instead of using public transportation .
Students go to school or university by car as well .
The government had to start major public transportation projects in order to solve the problem .
The underground metro in Riyadh is one of those projects .
It 's fast , easy , comfortable and safe .
Buses are much more convenient for driving kids to schools .
Transporting workers by public transportation or by bus is more convenient for big companies .
Public transport or travelling by car ?
I think travelling by car is a very comfortable way to travel .
You do n't have to think about bus timetables and stops .
You must know the timetables and from which platform the train will leave .
I think it 's true that travelling by car will be more popular .
It is really good . It is better than the previous novel , FSOGrey . I really mean it . It is not porn . BE GROWN UP PLEASE . If you do n't want to read the " sex parts " , just turn over the next page till it ends , that 's all . I did that to finish that novel . This novel is just to tell us the passionate love story between a successful businessman , chairmen man with a very unhappy childhood , and he only refers to his birth mother as " the crack whore " , which is related to his recent behaviour - BDSM . And the girl seemed very bored of her routine life , innocent , did nt know anything about life . Apparently , THEY were so different from each other , but somehow , some magic connected them and made them a very lovely couple .
The two maps depict the main changes which took place in Shipsmouth between the years 1995 and 2010 .
Overall , it can be seen that the city has became more modern , with more transport and entertainment facilities .
One striking change is that a new station has been built , to connect the north of the city with the city centre and the road has been pedestrianized .
Another interesting redevelopment is that the factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre , and in the same way , so was the Church , which was pulled down to be replaced by a pub .
The urban areas were demolished , to make way for skyscrapers .
One must recognize the field and the strengths , as well as the weaknesses , of his opponent to score a goal .
Thus , it is a game with a combination of mental and physical skills .
For people starting to do this sport , one can try to train individually .
Information about the basic theory and technique of tennis can be gathered from the internet / books .
Learning to do juggling would also be beneficial .
Many coaches advise their pupils to practise it for better coordination of hand and eye .
But most importantly , one should enjoy all of this fun .
I do n't exactly understand why people want to learn about the private lives of politicians and film stars ,
Unfortunately , a lot of people are interested in others .
These happenings are not strange .
Because all people have got predicaments .
But the public wants to see famous politicians and stars in every situation .
For example , they want to see well - known people with their boyfriend / girlfriend or want to see them in causal attire or want to see famous women without make - up .
On the other hand , this opinion should be considered : Some big names are important for someone who seems them like an ideal .
However , being able to protect themselves against an invasion of privacy is a fundamental human right of stars .
The government should give superstars the right to protection of personal relationships and activities .
Ultimately , crowd - pleasing people also have got civic rights just like everyone else .
It is more convenient as you can travel straight to the place you want to go .
First of all , public transport provides the experience of the journey .
They give you the experience of flying in the sky or floating on the sea .
That is an experience you can not get by car .
Last but not least , public transport can share the cost of travelling .
Third , public transport is good for the environment .
The " Times " newspaper publishes an intercepted letter written by the Spanish Ambassador , Dupuy de Lowe , that will make him resign due to what he wrote about the USA .
Next , to the explosion of the North American steamer , Maine , the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures us that it could n't have been done from the outside , but must have been done from the inside .
On the other hand , the USA commission brings their results to Parliament without previously notifying Spain of their results and with the opposite conclusion to that of the Spanish commission .
However , the Spanish government does not agree with the USA 's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with international arbitration .
Later , the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba , but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans .
Mackinley asks for the arbitration of Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain asks North Americans to get off of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict .
The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba .
Later , the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to militarily intervene in Cuba if necessary .
The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date .
In this Memorandum , the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of president Mackinley .
Also , this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict , which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blowing - up of the steamer Maine , the latter being remarked concerning the USA having rejected the Spanish proposal to carry out the arbitration together .
The 21st of April EEUU denies Spanish sovereignty of Cuba . The 23rd of April , Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and on the 25th , the USA declares war on Spain .
From that day , diplomatic relations between both nations will be suspended .
So it is not just a fundamental element of being a good person , but also affects your society .
But the problem is , I do really care about my friends , so I always say " Yes " to my friends , because I do n't want to disappoint them .
That way you wo n't have lots of pressure , and you can be an honourable person .
I 'm glad you have graduated from school and that you have plans to go to university .
It 's good for you to take a year 's break before continuing with your studies .
Then we can go visit the Fortress in Sighisoara , which is the only fortress in Europe to be actually inhabited .
Concerning your work plans , I have an uncle who owns a farm , so I think we can arrange for you to work there .
He says I shop too much , but the fact is , he does n't want to spend money , he has stopped buying me flowers and chocolates and he has stopped being romantic .
He keeps saying " I love you " but I do n't feel it any more . I sacrificed my life in my lovely country for him and left my family to be with him , but it seems like it was one huge mistake , as I feel like I am living with a stranger and he is nothing like the man he promised to be .
Anyway , I still love him and still have the hope that this is just a temporary period in our life and he will be back to the man I loved once , especially since we have the most amazing reason to live for ; it 's our beautiful son , our angel and the amazing love of our lives .
Although some people would suggest that such a service has no future because people rely more on the car , as it is convenient , it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has a future .
Firstly , society today is more concerned about being environmentally friendly .
The more cars on the road , the more greenhouse gases are produced .
Therefore , public transport plays an important role in mitigating global warming .
For example , if a bus can carry 100 passengers , at least 25 cars can be reduced on the road , solving the problem of traffic jams .
In addition , scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles , so they become less harmful to the environment .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should have a future .
Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco - friendly , and there are still many people who rely on public transport .
Everyone deserves to have a private life , even celebrities and stars , who are the life and soul of the party during their working hours .
We all need a shelter where we can hide from daily difficulties .
This is the only way to maintain our mental health and not to fall into depression .
We can say for sure that stars and celebrities are also people .
What is more , celebrities , like ordinary people , need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationships with others .
They are not able to buy real relationships such as friendship and love .
They can gain fame and admiration thanks to their skills , but their stage personality is more like a powerful creation .
Sometimes , in everyday life , they are not even interesting in terms of character and appearance .
That is why a private life is so important , especially for stars , who are assessed all the time by society .
They showed me everything I had to do .
I had to carry some musical instruments and install software .
Then I helped with organization and selling tickets .
I love to help people and the best thing was that I met members of the band and have their autographs !
I believe that knowing more languages is always better . That way , people have a lot more culture and are more knowledgeable .
In conclusion , learning languages may be very handy , but can also be a time - wasting activity .
I saw your advertisement looking for a children 's monitor , and I think I could be the best person to fill that position .
I have worked at schools in Spain and I have first - hand knowledge of organising sports and activities .
We could learn new activities from each other .
Although I have no qualifications , I love cooking .
Nevertheless , I realize this is not the ideal reference .
See my curriculum vitae , enclosed , for more details .
I would love to answer any question you could ask at this email address , qq@gmail.com , and this mobile phone number , 666666666 . I would be delighted to attend an interview whenever suits you .
Yours faithfully ,
They can barely breath with all those photographers around them .
It can really damage someone 's reputation .
For example , when a fan follows a cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredictable , or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
My opinion is , that famous people deserve a quiet time , when they are with their partners or with family , but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym .
Years ago , we used to get through to other people by ringing them up or texting messages via our mobile phone and , as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate via social networks such as Twitter , Facebook , Whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news and social issues via Twitter instead of newspapers , for instance . It 's common to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings the news on their smartphone , an image so far from years back .
We also can have more knowledge about current issues via Facebook pages , which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes , such as political discussions , strikes , the economy ... As far I am concerned , the present - day population knows more about what 's going on in the world than in previous years .
One example of this could be North Korea or some Arab countries , where their governments ban internet access for citizens . In other words , they want to mislead the people about reality to avoid the population claiming via these networks or being up in arms against their system .
On the other hand , we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends via Facebook , uploading photos at any time , having a coffee , watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere .
So , this means we are getting less intimate and becoming more gossipy at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow your favourite celebrities and have direct interaction , but this also has negative consequences such as some followers criticise them .
Michael Xander is the famous team captain of Onix University , one of the most prestigious schools in the Philippines .
He has everything : the looks , the brains and the charm , but he has never felt contented .
Everything has been easy for him , he is used to getting what he wants .
She was starstruck .
Everyone in that school knows him and how flirtatious he is . '
This guy actually asked her out and she 's not that stupid not to know his intentions .
She had just challenged him .
Since then , everything had gone so perfectly between the two of them .
Celine realised that Michael was not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael 's reputation .
She was on her way to the court where Michael was practising when she heard guys talking .
Tears automatically fell down her face .
Everything Michael had done for her was just for a bet .
The last time he remembered he had never invited anyone .
He just loved that girl so much that he wanted to protect her from everything .
His eyes looked automatically at how Celine looked today .
Celine came in and kissed him aggressively .
Everything felt amazing and beautiful .
I know everything .
Everything was just a bet , right ? ' Celine said .
Everything that happened between us was too good to be true .
The very first reason for my disagreement is that I do not have enough money to purchase everything that I would like to buy .
Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and , furthermore , it gives me a great amount of sadness .
The next thing about unpleasant shopping is enormous lines .
The last , but not least , reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a long way to a store in which I can buy everything I want .
Of course , I could go to a few different shops , but without a driving license , travelling is a tough task .
Architects , builders , painters and sculptors were brought from Europe by ship as well as all the construction materials that were necessary for its building .
It is a sophisticated building , full of details everywhere around the theater , from the floor to the ceiling , everything carefully designed according to that period .
The place set out important concerts , presentations and international festivals still nowadays .
During the rubber age , there was no urban life around the building , which is completely different from today , of course , since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater , that are the same age as the theater and it is surrounded by art galleries , pubs , offices , houses , restaurants , where groups of friends , tourists and families usually go to appreciate the breeze at the end of a warm day and during the night .
In big cities , there 's a similar sport called basketball and this one is more for boys .
You can find more information also on the Internet .
However , the lecturer points out the problems in all his assertions .
In contrast , the professor argues that it was impossible that they were weapons because they show no damage .
Nevertheless , the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible .
Science is developing very quickly and nowadays scientists are discovering new things .
I think people will not go out of their homes to buy goods and food or clothes , because professional robots will be invented and they will do anything that you want , and they will obey your orders .
However , this could cause a problem for humans and some people will face the threat of compulsory redundancies .
I assume that another problem will be robots , because little by little they will capture the world and they will become human 's enemy , and that would be one of the possibilities in the future .
In conclusion , I would say that developing is not very good for humankind , and little by little the world will be demolished by human errors .
' The Go - between ' by L.P.Hartley
This is an original and moving love story that has people who are against the relationship between the main characters .
Leo is a kind of popular boy at school as he invents special spells and shows them to his schoolmates , but everything he knows changes when he 's invited to the house of Marcus , who is his classmate at school .
So , there he meets the gorgeous eldest sister of Marcus and he immediately falls in love and from then the go - between appears in the story .
This paper is a review of scientific research , including magazines , newspapers , websites and others , with the purpose of exploring ecotourism , presenting the tourist attractions and beaches to people , in order to call it to their attention in relation to commercial promotion and local development , where a lot of people do not know the natural beauties of our city .
Warning the responsible departments how much they can do for the city in relation to employment opportunities , tourist attractions , environmental education , ecological preservation and make it the best tourist city in Litoral Paulista .
Through marketing and advertising , we want to encourage young people who enjoy surfing the dissemination of the best beaches of this city to practise it with others that may have .
Preserving , exploring the trails and beaches , encouraging extreme sports are what we believe are attractive to tourists of this wonderful coastal city .
Key words : ecotourism , marketing , track , the Guarujá beaches , tourism .
Nevertheless , travelling by car could pose a real threat to public transport because it is much more comfortable .
Firstly , having a car makes travelling much easier .
A car offers comfort because you can personalise your space and your ride .
However , public transport is not threatened by the car .
First of all , too many cars make towns crowded and create traffic jams , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one car makes as much pollution as one bus which transports many more people .
It will even get more popular because it will be faster , more modern , and cheaper than travelling by car .
It is about an ordinary young woman who has everything she needs in life .
This book is very exciting because there are a lot of things that are happening and it 's not monotonous at all .
Recently , I saw an advertisement for a job .
I have taken courses in the last 2 months with an organization that organizes activities for children aged between one and 15 .
This organization taught us how to deal with children , and how to make their lives happier and more joyful .
In addition , we were also taught how to organize sports and activities for them in a way they will enjoy .
I believe that I am suitable for this job as I have broad experience in what is required . I would be on top of the world if you allowed me to be part of the team .
Yours faithfully ,
Everything happened that summer I spent in Egypt .
My mother had found a new job in some ancient ruins , right in the middle of the desert . I should mention that she was an important archaeologist , known all over the world , and she had to travel to every corner on Earth .
I used to spend my whole holidays at my grandparents ' country house , surrounded by green fields , forest and rivers , but when I turned eighteen my mother thought I was old enough to take a plane on my own and stay with her for a month .
On the other hand , the taxi did n't even have air conditioning , so I spent the two hours of the journey trying to fan myself with a magazine I borrowed from the driver .
I reached the hotel well in the afternoon . Nevertheless , the air was still oppressive and hot like at midday .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give some tips for tourist who come to the city . I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping for clothes in the city , as well as some recommendations .
In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes . You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if you are a shopaholic , it will be worth it .
Linda is a modern shop where you can find the latest fashion in Milano and luxury accessories from the most well - known companies .
If the idea of a street market does not seduce you , I recommend you visit a little shop in Saint Peter street , The Old Bag , where you can buy bags and other accessories , such as umbrellas , gloves and scarfs .
Recommendations
I suggest a quick visit to every shop and making comparisons of price and quality .
This is a short report which will include my recommendation of the most interesting places in my town for them to enjoy .
In the " Culture Centre " , your young visitors will be able to attend daily cultural activities , such as theater , cinema and drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Centre " , they will have an opportunity to take part in many sports activities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics and karate classes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months , I suggest that they should enrol in a Polish language course .
It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish at least at a basic level .
The course would be three times a week only , and fully paid by the Polish government .
In short , a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience for your students .
Every year , in my house , we play the same role : my mother and my sister prepare different dishes for Christmas dinner , and I am highly likely to be the one responsible for carrying those dishes from the kitchen to the dining room , because the rest of the family is lost in their conversations trying to save the world .
It was an unforgettable moment . I was looking at her , slightly excited because she was eating alone without help and fast , which was and still is , unusual coming from her .
If there were more buses or trains at any time ( also in the night ) , it would be convenient to use them and to leave the car in the garage .
Unfortunately , it 's not possible because of the costs that the Economic System would be compelled to support .
So , people often prefer using the car and paying for petrol instead of a bus ticket because of having more advantages : not being forced to wait for the buses and not having to take a taxi in the night when they come back from the disco , for example .
It 's a cheap service and it 's greatly appreciated by people who need a car not every day and only for a little time .
The Internship , a film by Shawn Levy with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn .
In the beginning , one of them looks for a job by asking his sister 's boyfriend , but fortunately , his friend convinces him to find another job .
Of course , they are much older than the other candidates , and when the staff check their CVs only one member confirmed their candidature .
Despite everything , they could take part in the competition .
The Google agency invites a lot of people and declares that only one group will have the possibility to win .
Of course , when the groups arrange themselves , the two old men remain alone and they are forced to create a group with the discards .
Of course , on paper , this group does n't have a chance , but events demonstrate something different .
This film is interesting because it drafts work problems , but not only this , it also shows some important values , like the importance of solidarity , group cohesion and the importance of not losing faith in dreams , even if the situation is withstands .
Of course , there are also negative observations about this film . For example , there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story . They are n't interesting and they last too long .
In addition , some situations in the film are taken from High School Movie .
In conclusion , this film is plain and a little discounted but , at the same time , a light and funny film to watch during the summer with some friends .
So you can see nearly all of Spain in a month and it is very worthwhile , according to my best friend .
It may help you to choose what to study at university , as I know you haven't decided yet .
If you do n't like this idea , there is an excellent website which offers a lot of jobs and maybe you will find something interesting .
It must be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to ask question or to take photos .
If something changes in your life it will be a news item on television , and people will invent rumours about you .
On the other hand , I disagree with the statement because if they are public people , fans will be interested in them .
There are celebrities that sell their life on television and then do not want journalists to chase them .
There are other famous people who do not appear on television and they are chased by reporters .
This is because something new has occurred and they want to collect information .
It is impossible to have a private life if you are a celebrity , because people who love you want to know about your private life .
To summarize , if you expose yourself on television you will not have a private life .
I would like to apply for the job of instructor in the USA Summer Camp as advertised in the newspaper .
Last winter I worked as a coach for my basketball team with kids about ten years old .
I have training in basketball and Physical Education .
Moreover , I am very active and hardworking , as you request .
Also , I feel that I can be a positive incorporation in the Summer Camps .
Yours faithfully
The house in which we will live in the future will be full of complicated - to - use computers and robots .
The television of the future will be amazing , because it will have a 3D projector , which means that movies will look extremely realistic .
Robots will , of course , be remarkable , which will help us with everyday chores , for instance , by cooking delicious dishes , cleaning everything in the house or even washing and ironing clothes .
To be perfectly honest , every human being dreams of the home of the future and every dream is individual , but in the future , will our dreams come true ?
If you want to visit some interesting place or building , you should go to our zoo , which is near Zlín in Lešná .
In the chateau there is an exhibition of snakes and spiders .
It 's a beautiful place for all generations in nature and you can spend all day there .
If you were hungry , there are some restaurants and fast food restaurants .
It is argued that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
In my opinion , sometimes stars ' behaviour is very surprising .
To illustrate my point of view I want to give some examples .
First of all , being on the covers of newspapers and magazines helps them make themselves more attractive to directors .
The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable , because popularity gives the possibility to earn more money .
Honestly , I do not like nature programmes so much because they are so boring !
I personally like sports programmes and comedy shows , because I love sports and also enjoy having a good laugh .
My favourite TV shows are " Hablemos de Football " , " Sports Center " , " Fox Sport " and " The Simpsons " . All these except " The Simpsons " are about sports , mainly football , basketball and rugby .
And as a sports lover I am glad to be informed about the latest matches of the international leagues like the " NBA " , " Premium League " and also the " National League " because of my deep love of sports .
I watch some football matches repetitions and comedy shows .
Jabalpur(M.P )
to your engagement party .
You are like Romeo and juliett . But I am really sorry I am not coming to the engagement party because my mother has been admitted to the hospital .
I think you will understand my situation .
Please send me some engagement photographs .
Talk to me via video conferencing after the party .
I enjoyed the summer holiday , it was entertaining and I usually travelled around Hong Kong with my family during the weekends .
I usually woke up at around nine o'clock in the morning and spent the day reading newspapers and books , and also digitalized some video tapes .
I enjoy reading newspapers so I can get updates on the latest developments and news .
Furthermore , it can also improve my language skills .
I usually watch television programs on the Discovery Network at night .
Besides , I find those programs talking about building massive structures and science interesting and I gained some knowledge from those programs .
To get prepared for the things to be taught in grade 9 , I also flipped through some textbooks , including Integrated Science , Geography , etc .
And I find the knowledge to be taught in some subjects interesting , while some is n't .
As I am a member of the Robotics Team , I went to school for 3 days during the summer holiday to prepare for a competition on fourth of October .
Despite the hard work , I enjoyed the process of preparing for the competition a lot .
We are looking for better conditions everywhere .
First of all is traffic jams ; if you are stuck in a traffic jam in a big bus you will waste much more time than you expected on the road . Besides , public transport is overcrowded in rush hours . Another downside is that most buses are old and dirty .
That 's why people choose to travel by car , because it is more convenient and faster .
Green And Clean Environment
Introduction
The aim of this report is to explain the way our Community have decided to preserve the environment of our town and which other activities could be useful in order to achieve this purpose .
On the one hand , if you belong to a school , you can participate by giving information to the children about the catastrophic image our village would have if we did not reduce the pollution to the minimum range .
On the other hand , everyone has the opportunity to clean the streets where they spend most of their time .
Nobody needs to be worried about the vacuum or the broom because it is provided by the Government .
If you do not have time to help with those kinds of activities , there is a rule you must follow .
Recommendations
My recommendation is to invest in a good cleaning machine , consequently we will not have to spend hours cleaning the streets .
A high number of tourists visit Cáceres searching for culture , heritage and typical food from Extremadura .
For that reason , this town has a lot of facilities to meet that demand and to offer a good time too .
The most attractive resource in Cáceres is its heritage .
The old town is an historical and cultural center where a great part of the tourism is focused .
One of the most characteristic things about this region is the food and Cáceres is the top city of gastronomy in Europe .
" Atrio " is the most important restaurant in the city and it has been recognised with two stars by the most famous guide for restaurants in Spain .
Anyway , " Atrio " is not just a fine food restaurant , but it is a five - star hotel in the middle of the old town .
Pintores Street is the commercial place of the city and it has a great selection of shops and restaurants with typical food from Spain .
Garlic is a plant , a member of the lily family , with a characteristic odor and taste .
It has been known in human history since at least 3000 B.C. In many cultures , garlic is associated with superstitions , bringing bad or good luck .
The slaves , who constructed the pyramids , were fed with garlic , because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger , so they could work harder .
At the present time , modern science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption on human health .
Experiments carried out with garlic and some types of bacteria , revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria .
Therefore , the bactericidal effect of garlic can probably explain some ancients ' beliefs that this plant could help in some illness treatments .
Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic on the blood system .
It was demonstrated that garlic has a compound that can make the blood " thinner " .
Therefore , including garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health , as some cultures believed .
How many of us today are really into helping the environment ?
Is it worth all the time , energy and money spent on convincing people to be responsible for their environment ?
I recently joined a campaign program in Manila , Philippines , dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources .
I was very enthusiastic in all the activities until after one event .
I found out that the leaders of this organization were not realizing the beliefs and principles they were imparting to the public .
They were not a good representation of their ideals .
I backed off and decided to just continue to make my personal contribution to helping mother earth .
Maybe we can not convince the whole world to participate in helping the environment right away , but it can begin with ourselves .
I have been living an environment - friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago .
This does n't just save me from excessive gasoline expenses , but it also made me physically fit .
Fourthly , I only buy organic products for consumption and keep a small spice garden in my backyard .
And finally , I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing in order to help our environment .
All in all , I think that helping our environment does n't have to be a big deal . We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable and irrevocable .
That is a small start , but it will eventually reap a huge outcome .
To begin with , I would like to tell you that I am really interested in the course because I think it would provide me with some professional advantages in my career as a school teacher .
Learning languages is increasingly important in the teaching sector , so I want to improve it .
I think my weak points are speaking and listening skills . Nevertheless , I would also be interested in working over writing and grammar points .
Although I am in my late forties I am still very active , so I like practising sports , music and going to the cinema as well .
Yours Faithfully .
Michael is an American guy , living and studying in the Netherlands at Leiden University .
He has been living in the Netherlands for about a year .
The next day , he woke up with a hangover and realized that he had made love without using protection .
Without a second thought I decided to follow the directions on the puzzling map .
The directions took me along a path towards a cave and I went into it .
I am writing in connection with your stay in Cracow .
I know you 're looking for an interesting place to visit , so I want to offer you a place where you can rest , have a lot of fun and have a great time with your group .
I want to recommend the amusement park , one of the most interesting places to visit here .
This is a huge amusement park with many attractions for young people looking for excitement .
Yours faithfully ,
First and foremost , the bank notes should be designed and the design includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Next is the preparation of metal plates .
In this step , skilled machinists are required .
The last but most important step is the inspection .
dispatched .
The difference is , the good part will be kept while the bad part will be destroyed .
Well , I 'm sorry but , although I studied French when I was young , I have forgotten almost everything .
So , I tried to translate your French on Google translator and I could n't understand what you meant about my English and Google translator . I 'm used to writing English and I at am intermediate level .
I use Google translator to find an equivalent word to a Spanish word sometimes .
It is n't easy at all , they 're very different languages , and I prefer to use the software " Grammarly spellchecker " to get some help .
There is a new and stunning generation of basketball players .
He 's improving his game in a spectacular way .
It is n't only that he 's a very good player ( He is :D ) , but also , thanks to his style of play , his assists , and points have served as a lever to his team , which has improved dramatically .
He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old , and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old .
His current team is preparing him physically in the gym . His physical form has improved a lot and now he is faster , stronger and he 's still 23 years old .
Watching him play is a delight , especially his assists and juggling games while he looks in the opposite direction .
The " Di Roma restaurant " is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village , " Monção " . It is very popular with teenagers and adults who love to eat pizza or any other fast food .
As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting , a lot of paintings of the city .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best - quality ingredients .
The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the region , which are very popular around the country .
I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours .
For this reason , I highly recommend going to Di Roma restaurant .
Firstly , it is very good for the environment because it reduces a lot of carbon dioxide gas which , if everybody took their car instead of taking public transport , would pollute the atmosphere .
Secondly , travelling on public transport makes it much easier to travel in rush hours or in those periods in which you should not take your car .
Finally , it is a good way of travelling because it is safer than travelling in a car or on a motorbike and also because you are much more relaxed than in a car and it saves time , too .
To conclude , public transport is good for the environment , it makes it much easier and cheaper to travel , and it , in some ways , saves lives .
It 's some kilometers outside of it .
It 's a big country and does n't have many inhabitants .
But they also were the ones that first discovered Greenland , North America and Asia .
Most people in Sweden are Christians .
The climate in Sweden can be very cold , especially in the northern parts of Sweden .
Most people go to high school and university .
In Sweden we are very proud of a free downloadable program where you can listen to almost all the music in the world .
He 's one of the best football players in the world and is really popular both in Sweden and in other countries , especially in Europe .
That can be really painful for those who are n't from Sweden originally .
After the handover in 1997 , it became a special administrative region of China .
From the 1980 's , it has been developed as an international financial centre and so many global investors have set up their headquarters there .
The Hong Kong government has invested lots of capital in developing a better education system to build a knowledge - based society and a better future .
As mentioned , Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China , whose systems and laws are different from Mainland China .
Residents in Hong Kong are enjoying a high level of freedom in religion , speech , organization , activities , going abroad during their life .
Owing to those separate characteristics , actually , Hong Kong can be described as a colourful and brilliant city .
Going places is of paramount importance for people , and going quickly even more so ; that 's why I think public transport is not the most efficient way to go places .
The use of public transport takes more time than using a car , which can be considered as a waste of time .
All this makes using a car much more convenient , due to the fact that not only do you leave when you want , but also straightaway from the very door of your own house .
When you go by car you can control your timing , stop at will , and if you go with someone else , it may be cheaper : provided the cost of the journey will be the same , no matter how many passengers you take with you , while on public transport you have to pay for a ticket for every single passenger .
Anyway , to tell you the truth , I 'd rather take a train . For instance , it means travelling in a relaxing way , not running risks of accidents , having the chance to read or play " travel " chess , meeting new people , like on a stage coach but moving faster .
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which appeared in this month 's edition of EnglishAcademy magazine .
As you will see from my enclosed CV , I have worked the last three years as a personal assistant to the director of a well - known international company based in London while I am finishing my part - time degree in Modern Languages ( English - German ) .
Throughout my work history and studies , I have displayed excellent teamwork and people - oriented skills , which I believe are crucial skills in an administrative position .
I have also worked under pressure and met deadlines without any problems , because I am used to being resourceful and managing time efficiently .
In terms of my suitability for reception and administrative roles , I am organized , amiable and helpful .
In addition , I have excellent customer service skills and am highly efficient in the use of computers in a wide variety of applications .
Therefore , I consider myself competent and optimistic to respond to the challenge offered by the post of receptionist in your language school .
I would genuinely welcome the opportunity of an invitation to work for your language school .
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information or to arrange a personal meeting .
Yours faithfully
I do n't know what I have to say , but the only thing that I know is that my English pronunciation is not very good .
I want to improve my English pronunciation skills so I will be able to understand native speakers .
I have an American girlfriend and she is very fluent in English because it is her mother tongue .
I want to be fluent so she can understand what I want to tell her .
Now I have decided to improve my writing skills , because once they have improved , I will be very happy and I think that my ideas ' expression will be good .
I think that my pronunciation will be good when I can speak for a long period of time and in all situations .
Thank you for sending me the corrected form of my writing , and I really appreciate that very much .
He completed his studies six years ago , but since then he has been unable to find proper employment in his country .
Therefore , he decided to migrate , looking for better job opportunities .
After a complex and difficult journey , Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coast in 2011 . Helped by the Senegalese community , he eventually found a job as a fruit seller in a local market .
Despite his high qualified studies in education , Mohamed had to do a job in a completely different field .
The phenomenon of the immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last decades .
However , nowadays , even in rich Western Europe , many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find employment .
This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other countries .
Such a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools , which has failed to adapt to the changes brought about in society by globalization .
Therefore , once graduated , qualified young people find themselves facing both the economic crisis and a hostile job market .
I believe that governments of different countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and , therefore , contribute to exacerbating the impact of the economic crisis .
I go cycling and running regularly so I think I could describe myself as a sportswoman .
I am a passionate reader , in particular of thrillers and French poetry .
My passion for travel goes back years to when I was just a child . As I am a curious person , I like tasting new foods and discovering new places .
Therefore , I think this experience of three months could offer me a unique chance to grow as a person and better understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent .
I think this experience is the challenge that I need in order to become more mature and responsible .
Therefore , I would be more than willing to share this experience with another student .
As on the 6th of September there will be the university entry test for Medicine , I will have to fly back to Italy for a couple of days .
Last year , I did some graphic design for the website of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addition , last year , I participated in a work placement at the ASL in Rivoli .
I am going to repeat the experience in March at the local hospital .
Because , when we decide to go shopping and we have an idea what we want to buy and it appears that we ca n't find what we want , we are disappointed and frustrated .
Sometimes , shopping - particularly for women - is the best way to improve their mood .
Unfortunately , shopping can also bring displeasure .
For example , when we stay in a queue , coming to the cash register and it transpires that the price on the label is more expensive .
Because everybody drives their cars and motorcycles on the roads , the traffic jams will not only be a serious problem for the government but will also be a safety problem for citizens .
Therefore , the government need to introduce a good traffic policy to ensure citizens ' safety and welfare of have the privilege of driving on the road .
As a result , I think traveling only by car is not a wise choice for the earth , although it is convenient .
But we need to think that there is a better way to protect the earth and humans ' environment , such as riding a bicycle or waiting for an environmentally - friendly car to be invented .
People 's lifestyles have changed completely in the past 20 years .
Even though there are more and more cars on the roads , I do not think this tendency will completely reduce the demand for public transportation for the following reasons :
There are many people who have experienced a car crash , or are just simply afraid of driving , so they prefer to use public transport .
Not to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers ' lives and it is less about convenience , even if travelling by car means you do n't need to deal with other passengers .
I 'm from Ecuador , a country surrounded by a great number of natural resources .
We are an underdeveloped country , as other countries say , a " third world country " , but I 'm happy about that .
We see what they really are ; the underdeveloped countries that they are .
Recently , my country has started to develop its resources , our renewable energy , such as wind , solar , hydro - electric power , geothermal energy .
Starting to develop our nation is in effect starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment .
Traditional energies are focused on giving all the resources to big cities .
Also , it is a big opportunity to help them .
They need resources to improve their living conditions until my country has the possibility to give them better opportunities .
It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is in big cities , without looking after and helping the surroundings .
Nowadays , my country has started to build a great number of hydroelectric and wind parks and we are also starting to think about geothermal energy .
But I think one thing is necessary before implementing these types of energies .
All of them require further studies to be done and , with that , we could find out the feasibility of the projects and the size of them .
Implementation takes time and money , but if the project does not work , all of that could be spent in vain .
Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then building large constructions to extract them .
Sustainability is about finding the best way to interact with the environment .
Trying to take care of it , extracting only the necessary and trying to cause the least possible damage .
Starting to an take interest in alternative energy and trying to see ways to use it in your native country is the first step .
The implementation of projects does not need to be only about spending money .
Done in a good way , the implementation of projects helps to improve citizens ' lives .
All those little steps help our nation to build a developed country that is environmentally friendly .
It makes it mandatory for the inter - city buses , commercial vehicles and other heavy vehicles to use Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG ) instead of diesel .
It encourages people to plant more trees and cutting them has been made a punishable offence .
Burning of leaves and other waste products has also been made a punishable offence .
A large number of huge capacity waste treatment plants have been established to keep the city clean and green .
Recently , for the protection of the environment , the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehicles more than 15 years old .
Gradually , people in the city are becoming cautious with respect to the environment and they are trying their best to keep it clean and safe .
People are inculcating the habit of disposing of garbage at a defined place .
They are conserving rain water using a rain water harvesting process .
They are trying to reduce dependency on private vehicles and switching to public modes of transport .
Installation of solar heaters , solar lights , using solar cell watches and driving electric cars are in vogue in the city .
It was written by John Clees and Conni Both and it shows the daily life in a fictitious hotel .
There are four main characters : the hotel owner , a moody man and his bossy wife , and the workers , a pleasant maid and a Spanish waiter who does n't speak English .
In every episode , new clients go to this hotel and have a lot of crazy , funny and sarcastic situations , between workers , owners and customers .
Particularly when the owner gives orders to the waiter , these situations become hilarious .
As technology develops rather rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon now for us to find that large - scale buildings and transport networks are to be built for the sake of human economy , which means vast areas of farmland , forest and wetland are on the way to being ruined .
First of all , the environment that belongs to both man and wildlife is going to lose balance in the ecosystem .
It means that more kinds of species are endangered because they are unable to adapt themselves to the remaining land .
The planting of vegetables and other food on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of humans may not be met one day .
Moreover , with the decreasing number of trees and many other plants , carbon dioxide can not be coped with by those natural machines , which will melt the remaining ice in the world .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's critical for governments to take measures to reduce the problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principles should be put in place to forbid extravagant expansion in the natural system .
In addition , supervision of the protecting steps needs to be undertaken by the government .
What 's more , the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually , no matter whether it 's on campus or in public places .
Anyway , the key to protecting our living environment from being destroyed is to do it as individuals , step by step .
I 'm looking for a language centre which prepares students to take the Cambridge exams , especially the F.C.E. On reading the newspaper , I 've learned about your classes and your method seems efficient .
I am interested in applying for one - on - one classes in order to study in the most efficient way I can .
Please could you give me more information about it as soon as possible in order to book in quickly .
yours faithfully ,
Anyway , the man was wearing an orange costume , he was surprisingly tall and slim and he was completely bald except for a long black ponytail coming out of his head .
UNFORGETTABLE FRIEND
She was quiet , but interesting at the same time .
We are different , but I think that that is a curious thing about friendship .
8 years later , she has become my best friend , my lost sister , my complement .
She was hard to find , but impossible to forget .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He had forgotten he had a doctor 's appointment and he was running late .
He finishes getting ready for his appointment .
How could he forget the time of his appointment ?
He still needs to find an ATM to withdraw some money to pay for his appointment .
On the other hand , public transport is inconvenient .
Pickpockets can have a field day with all the commotion of rush hour .
Furthermore , there are certain forms of transport , such as trains , that do not travel to the suburbs , so people either have to walk long distances to reach the nearest stop or be dependent on one form of public transport to catch another , which can be a great source of stress if there is ever a delay .
There are many dogs who are more loyal and trustworthy than many people on the earth .
For that reason , I appreciate my pets as if they are my friends .
Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered like human friends .
Many people talk with their pets as if they understand them .
One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pet as if they are their psychiatrist .
After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness ,
I would argue that treating our pets as our friends is an indication of humanity .
They can take care of us and love us in a very interesting way .
I am writing to you with reference to your advertisement which I saw in the " Daily News " .
I am sixteen years of age , pursuing a degree of Intermediate at Imperial College , keen to work .
I would love to arrange fun activities for children .
I have gained some experience of working with children while baby - sitting my cousins last year .
I would feel relieved if you would let me know about the commencement of the program as I can travel this month and the salary offered per week .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if any further information is required .
Yours faithfully ,
My work was very interesting and exciting .
Unfortunately , my scholarship was ending and I was thinking about returning home .
I hung up the phone and I went out to celebrate the moment with my colleagues .
Unfortunately , the process only works for twelve hours .
We built a pilot plant to test our investigations in the laboratory .
The public authorities helped us when we showed our solutions .
We are going to build an industrial plant to achieve our dream : storing renewable energy without using toxic materials and mining resources from the Earth .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
However , Peter decided to turn down Tommy 's invitation , and continue to do his homework .
He was frustrated .
Maybe the day itself would n't be extraordinary , but , for sure , she would remember it all her life .
The day before , all the clothes which were inside the suitcase had been laid out on the bed : trousers , spring t - shirts , nightdresses and so on .
She was doing all the routine activities automatically , thinking of her next journey .
She was brave and intelligent , so she was going to start a new life with new opportunities in a different and fairer country .
They think that a famous person has a marvellous life with no problems , no duties or worries .
But people should realize , that there are many advantages and disadvantages to being celebrities .
As far as I 'm concerned , there are more disadvantages .
They ca n't go to the cinema or theatre , or just go for a walk without being recognised .
No matter where a famous person goes , he must realize that , next day , he will be on the front page of the newspapers with lots of rumours .
Celebrities do n't have an easy life .
Because , what is proper in living when journalists are following every step the famous person takes ?
In my opinion , journalists and other people should accept and respect it and sometimes they should just let go .
Nevertheless , celebrities decided on that kind of life .
So , I think that they must have known about the consequences and should just live as they like .
I have seen the advertisement for the vacancy in your cafe in the local newspaper and would like to apply for this position .
I am a 22-year - old part - time student of the local university .
The first was in a bar owned by my uncle , and the second , in a local restaurant named " Dragon " ( Chinese cuisine ) .
I am an accurate , punctual and trustworthy person .
My employers have never complained about my work .
I resigned from my last employment because the restaurant was closed for a long refurbishment .
I am also ready to work longer shifts on Wednesdays , and on Fridays and Saturdays I can work extra time .
If you need any references , I can request them from the University Student Center and from my last employer . I am available to start work next week .
My mobile number is 0789999999 .
Yours faithfully ,
The Colosseum is the most famous and biggest building of Ancient Rome and it is also the biggest amphitheater in the World .
The name of this construction is related to two reasons : one reason is related to the dimensions of the building ; the second reason is because near there is a bronze statue .
And it was inaugurated in 80 a .
The Colosse was often restored because it was often in difficult situations .
Finally , I can say that the Colosseum is a fantastic building as much for beauty as for importance , and if a tourist is coming to Italy for the first time he should see the Colosseum .
I wish to express my dissatisfaction with this course .
We felt hot and we had no refreshment facilities .
Never have I seen such a lack of organization .
When we complained to the course teacher , we were told that things did not depend on him .
Yours faithfully ,
My perfect hotel would be near to the beach , on the Mediterranean coast , because in this area there are many tourists .
The hotel would have many services and facilities , like a good reception , spa , wifi connection and pay - per - view TV in the rooms , a great chef who cooked the dishes of the Mediterranean cuisine , a swimming pool , a bar on the beach and a boat for trips around the Mediterranean sea .
This is the hotel of my dreams , but the most important thing is that the people are happy in their accommodation . If they are happy they will return next year .
The performance turned out to be enjoyable , with a lot of witty jokes .
The acting was surprisingly emotional , but a bit wooden .
After the show , I was introduced to one of the actors , who was my friend 's cousin .
His answer astonished me ; he did not want to become a professional actor .
Moreover , he found being famous extremely irritating .
I , like most people , took for granted that celebrities not only seek fame , but also benefit from it .
They experience gracious living , enjoy glitzy parties and admire their photos in glossy magazines .
When it turns out that all the people we got used to idolising are just people with their own shortcomings , we become disappointed .
We watch mercilessly how celebrities topple from their thrones and even find pleasure in that .
Why do n't we want to give people entertaining us a chance to be themselves and to have a real private life ?
I love MASTERCHEF .
It 's one of the best TV cooking programmes that I have ever seen and I absolutely agree with you when you say that this programme promotes individual and collective work .
I have a friend who went to MASTERCHEF and he taught the amateur cooks how to make bread .
He told me that it was an exciting experience .
I think that you give us a lot of information about the programme , and your opinion about it is very interesting .
" I would say stop the arrogance by my cousins " said Michael to his friends and thought about stealing the keys of one of their millionaire houses and having a party with his friends .
In the end , the party turned out a success . For Michael it was the beginning of his popularity .
But the house was destroyed and the neighbours , furred for the confusion caused during the night , had called the police , who , without his knowledge , were waiting outside the house to take him to the police station .
After everything that had happened , Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
I 've just finished my teaching degree and I have experience in schools . Could you send me a webpage where I can find more information about how to apply for a job in the UK ?
I think that it could be a great opportunity to improve my English skills and learn lots of things about the UK culture .
I would like to save some money , and at the end of my UK experience , spend my time travelling around your country .
Is it interesting ?
Could you tell me the most important attractions around your city ?
Send me some tourist information if you have some .
In a family , responsibilities increase with age . I have some , but not a lot .
Nowadays , environmental issues have become a great concern for scientists , as the problem is growing .
What can people do every day to help the environment ?
Water and electricity are wasted day after day , while a little change in people 's habits can make a difference .

She always believed in such premonitions .
She quickly packed her handbag and ran out to catch a bus to university .
Many people choose to go travelling to relax .
Going travelling , people may schedule various destinations and times .
Unlike public transportation , there is no limit on your route , no fixed timetable for car travel .
Most of the time , pets are not allowed to be on public transportation , which is not a good thing for a pet owner .
Above all , car travel is not only convenient , but also free in your journey , which leads public transportation to a fading future .
She has always looked for perfection .

I had never felt so nervous when , about six months ago , I finally decided to sit the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) exam .
Because I had decided to take my exam in June , it was absolutely necessary to enrol in an English preparation course as soon as possible .
So , I had started to learn English very frequently and pretty hard .
Very soon I had recognized that the process of learning was not as easy as I thought .
But I am a really lucky person . I found a good teacher who supported me all the time . I also had some classmates who had the same aims as mine .
We met to study frequently .
We organized some additional activities , such as an English movies night , a one day trip to London , and a book discussion about English writers and poets .
Because we did n't live in any English speaking country , we tried as much as possible to create an English - speaking environment .
Today is a big day for me and my classmates .
I want to be an expert in such areas as drilling , exploitation and development of oilfields . That is why I want to get a master 's degree abroad , or a PhD at my university .
I think I have the appropriate background , my GPA is good enough .
Besides that , throughout my university education , I have been a participant at scientific conferences and I took pains to practically assimilate everything I had learnt during my studies .
For example , I have successfully completed the " Offshore Drilling " course of " Total " Professors Association and I mean to broaden my outlook in the future .
The main attraction here is absolutely the beach .
I love the beach , because I can swim , go sunbathing , and dive into the ocean and see all kinds of fish .

Subject : Opinion on what young people are interested in
Date : 27.10.2015
about what young people are interested in today .
First of all , our generation of young people are more
Television series
programmes young people like to watch .
It soothes them , calms them , aggravates them , excites them .
clothes , not too hippy , but something comfortable .
time , then I suggest some other style . It has to be comfortable but
fashionable enough .
give those people a good international festival .
With reference to your recent ad about weekend cafe work . I am interested in applying .
I enjoy cooking and am interested in different kinds of food , especially Asian cuisine .
I have experience of cooking and reception for parties / functions as I was a member of the School Parents Association of my children 's school .
As a member , on many occasions , such as Christmas Party and School Open Day , I had opportunities to learn about different kinds of food from other members as well as providing reception duties .
I really enjoyed answering parents ' enquiries and introducing them to our school .
These was invaluable and relevant experience for the job I am applying for .
Whether movies and TV programs made in our own country are more interesting than movies and programs made in other countries has been widely discussed .
To begin with , foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating .
For example , in the first 3D movie , Avatar , the movie maker spent a lot of energy and time on developing a novel movie genre .
It eventually made a very good impression on its audience , and , most importantly for a commercial movie , it really did very well at the box office .
Additionally , people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies .
Furthermore , foreign TV programs are more international and educational .
What 's more , the National Geographic and Discovery channels also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I ca n't learn from domestic programs .
However , I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture , or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain , they can get more reflection as recreating .
Plus , watching foreign programs also could help those people attain their goal -- relaxation .
In sum , although there are some dissenting views , one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs .
With an intense passion for fashion , I aspire to become a professional product merchandiser in the apparel industry and set up my own branding business with my older sister and her husband .
Both of whom have more than five years of experience in marketing planning and own a large number of fabric sources .
Therefore , I plan to maximize my previous experience with knowledge of psychology , product development skills and design , to pursue graduate studies , and build up my ability in the Master of Fine Arts program in fashion merchandising at Academy of Art University .
It is said that the main objective of television is to entertain people and make their free time happier .
However , television should n't be used only for this purpose but for different reasons .
On the one hand , most people have , at least , one television in their homes , so it is very accessible to everyone .
For this reason , instead of entertaining , television should offer educative programmes .
They are used to managing different technologies like televisions or computers .
I think that children ca n't be supervised by their parents all the time because they have to work and do household tasks .
For this reason , it is important for them to have a good educative programme on television .
I am not saying that television has to educate our children , but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things like numbers or letters .
Television is very important for giving language skills to children .
When I was young , I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things like geography or maths and it helped me a lot .
Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation topic to talk about with friends .
In particular , every week you can find " Il panino più " , a special roll created by the imagination of the cook .
Of course , I prefer to go to this pub with my family or with my friends , especially if I have something to celebrate , for example , birthdays , anniversaries or something else .
I remember when one of my daughters celebrated her eighteenth birthday , the pub 's owner put the number eighteen , made of cheese on a roll , with a little candle .
They have many different cakes : profiterols , meringata , tiramisù and so on .
Especially with their mothers , girlfriends or wives .
But women also think that shopping can be an unpleasant experience .
Particularly when we talk about everyday running from shop to shop to buy lettuce , meat or toothpaste .
It can be really frustrating .
Without spending money , we can get inspired by new collections or people that we see in the city .
I can understand people who say that shopping is boring .
Especially when we go from shop to shop but we ca n't find anything interesting .
Generally , shopping can be seen as an enjoyable experience or just a basic need in order to survive .
The most famous person from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , who works in a department store and is always planning how to make people 's lives more comfortable and better .
Sometimes I listen to the radio and hear his comments about some problems in my own country and some suggestions about how to make our life better .
I had absolutely no idea .
She was surprisingly open to the thought that I could try it at least .
I was absolutely excited .
UNEXPECTED VISIT
How dare she come to my door?There were no words to express my feelings ...
Suddenly , he 'd cut the connection between us .
It was an engagement ring !
The words of congratulation below the picture explained everything : He 'd got married to someone else !
" He 's dead . " she said , as if she was whispering .
Now , after all those long years have gone by full of pain , disappointments , missing and regrets ; all I have is the memories which were saved by him in a little wooden box .
I 've never found out the reason that made him leave me , despite all his love for me , unfortunately ...
People argue that today 's television is a load of rubbish . The quality of many programs is absolutely questionable and in many cases the language is vulgar .
There are several reasons why television has inherited this reputation .
Then , the large number of entertainment programs broadcast discourage those who want more cultural or factual programs , as they have been drastically reduced .
It seems to be a result of the fact that , after a long day , people prefer to unwind in front of the television , watching " entertainment programs " rather then news or what 's happening in the world .
Moreover , on television , there is a lot of advertising constantly interrupting the broadcast , and of course , this fact is very unpleasant .
Despite all these facts , it is without doubt that television has changed our lives .
There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before condemning it .
For example , the wider choice of programs from all over the world allows us to discover new cultures , new languages and new societies without travelling , and this enhances our knowledge .
In addition to that , the cost of television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema , the theatre or opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone .
Also , it is very important to remember that we always have the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when .
To sum up , I think television is very good value for money . The point is being able to choose what we want to watch .
Firstly , there are two kinds of famous people : those who want to have a private life and who do n't want everybody knowing each aspect of their lives , and those who sell certain parts of their lives in magazines , newspapers or TV programmes , or even their entire private lives .
Secondly , taking this into account , I think that everybody has the right to have a private life and the right to live without journalists following them everywhere .
Of course , they can control that by complaining in a court .
But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and an embarrassing moment could arrive and , if you have sold things like this before , you ca n't say anything .
It is absolutely rewarding to receive good news from an old friend who has been absent from my life for so long .
I would be so happy to provide you with some accommodation while you stay in my country .
I am currently working at a place where I am getting a great wage , so I have the possibility to accompany you on your journey .
We could go to the most representative places in Mexico , such as Templo mayor , Cancún , Acapulco , among many others .
In Mexico , a foreign person does not face difficulties getting hired by a company . I would be pleased to help you with this part of your experience in my country . I know that you are someone who loves animals ,
Wrestling is a new sport which was unknown to many of my classmates at college .
Wrestling is both an interesting and an entertaining sport .
Traditionally , we provide a fire as a means of light at night for the sport .
It takes place in the middle of the village where there is enough space for the spectators .
Refreshments are on sale at a discounted price for the visiting team .
I am a teacher in a high school and the authorities in my country let me stay there , improving my English .
I would like to say that learning any language is complicated for anyone , wherever you come from , but , in my opinion , there are many matters to discuss .
A good illustration of this would be children .
A child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time . This child does n't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language , because they are listening to their parents speaking English , their native language , all the time and this lets them learn without any difficulty .
On the other hand , if you go abroad you will be able to improve your English in an anglophone country . In this case , your knowledge will be reinforced by your stay there .
But if you have an opportunity to go abroad , it would be so good for you and your English .

I am keen on sports , especially volleyball , which I started playing at an early age , and I suppose I would be able to teach them how to play it and to organise a tournament .
I think I would be a suitable candidate for the job because I am used to looking after my neighbours ' children and I have recently attended a course about first aid so I would be ready to treat children if they get injured .

Construction will be improved .
However the general appearance wo n't be different .
However , I think , that all the systems which work in homes ( electricity , gas , heating system , water , etc . ) will be upgraded .
New technologies are going to seize architecture .
Though it will affect the environment in a good way .
For one reason - convenience .
Huge , bulletproof windows are my biggest dream . I could n't live without them .
Apart from that , every room will be full of interactive gadgets .

THE MOST INTERESTING WEEKEND OF MY LIFE
I had always believed that the best memories of life were when you meet new people , new places , going out with your friends , sunbathing on the beach , things like that .
These are beautiful moments , but now I reckon that there is n't anything more interesting than having all your family together talking about whole background .
Surprising stories that we will not ever imagine .
My family is n't so close and is distributed around many cities in my country . After some incidents in the past , many things changed and each family followed their own way .
We rented a wonderful place outside our city with a spectacular atmosphere .
It was the most interesting and astonishing weekend that I have ever experienced .
Everything was amazing , a lot of memories . We laughed a lot , we did many activities like bbq , table games , watching movies , swimming , among others .
Now I believe that the best moments in life are when you have time with your family . It is the best way to recharge your battery for everything .
Many times we pay more attention to other things . It can do it in many opportunities .
In my opinion , travelling by car is more convenient than travelling by public transport because you can choose where you want to go and the time you prefer to start your trip .
Travelling around the city by car is faster than on public transport .
I 've seen your letter and I 'm writing this to you to say what I do in my country to help save the environment .
We tried to convince the Headmaster to help us financially , but it was n't enough .
Indroduction
The aim of this report is to outline what are the best places for young people to have fun in Valencia , what facilities exist for them and how these could be made better .
Activities around the city
Also , it would be a good idea to go to the beach to spend the day and play volleyball or sunbathe , because this is always a good plan .
Other activities in the surroundings .
In addition , I suggest going by bus around the surroundings of the city , where you can do adventure sports , like canoeing , climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoying the countryside
Recommendations
I recommend that they should do both activities , Valencia city and also the surroundings .
My favourite kinds of movie are comedy and comedy drama because they have interesting plots and characters , someone and who watches comedy can laugh all the time .
As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) said , playing the lottery is not economically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe , but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibility of escaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
Cohen 's knowledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Though this has been an amusing debate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that the lottery should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a tradition , it gives help , hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment .
I hope my suggestions will help you .
Taxi is the first possibility .
The swimming pool in Brunete has customers from all age groups , but it is especially suitable both for young people and elderly people who want to improve their mobility .
On the one hand , everything is very clean , including floor , bathrooms and corridors . In addition , if you are a disabled person , you will not have any trouble getting in there because there are some ramps to help you go in .
On the other hand , you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use the facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .
In my opinion , the swimming pool is convenient because you can walk to swim if you live in town , but it is very expensive , particularly for young people .
Famous people have always been surrounded by a lot of journalists and paparazzi who follow them wherever they go .
Those people could be politicians , film stars , singers , football players and so on , living in constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and , because of this , they have to keep calm and carry on with it .
Therefore , most of these famous people complain about this , but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constantly devoting every minute of the day to them , because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing who they are with , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but , in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people , though they have to accept some critics , because not everybody has to love them .
A shopping centre has many disadvantages .
We live in a time of acquisitiveness and people buy many things , even if they ca n't afford them .
The times in which we live are conducive to addictions .
In Italy there are few cities with an underground and often in the smaller cities there are only buses .
I hope for the next generations for a better public transport service and an increase of its use .
At 6:20 I open my laptop , go to Youtube.com and start to study French with Mrs .
I write down new French vocabulary or grammar in my notebook .
I pack my backpack , pick up my garbage bag and look around my room for one last time to make sure I have n't forgotten anything . I go downstairs and put the garbage bag into the trash bin .
You should n't spend so much time watching television because it is n't healthy .
Actually , I do n't watch much television , because I do n't have much free time , but if I had it , I think I would watch more .
Now that I 'm on holidays , I watch more TV , especially some series like Criminal Investigation or The Mentalist .
The reasons for Greece 's terrible economic situation are that Greece has surrendered its currency sovereignty to the European Central Bank , so that Greece could not apply monetary policy to spur its economy , and the Greek government is very corrupt , so that Greeks could easily dodge taxes .
In contrast , in Taiwan , we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well - organized .
Monetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy , and , from empirical experience , many countries have successfully applied such policy .
In 2012 , the Japanese central bank unprecedentedly depreciated the Yuan , which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation .
Obviously , Taiwan has its own currency , the new Taiwan dollar , and if Taiwan 's economy was worsening someday , the Taiwanese government could simply mimic what the Japanese government did in 2012 .
Not only is Taiwan different from Greece in currency sovereignty , it also wins in government efficiency .
According to a global survey , Taiwan has a reputation for effectiveness , in which the Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Therefore , the Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes .
Without a doubt , the efficiency of the Taiwanese government is beneficial to people 's welfare .
All in all , Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well - known for its effectiveness .
As a country , Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create a lovely and healthy environment for its citizens .
They told every dream to their dad , and they knew he would enforce it even though , under the circumstances , it seemed to be impossible , he would try .
He said that if Nick built a house with two floors , he would buy it and pay for the children 's studies lifelong , which gave a reverse to the impossible .
Nick started making the plans for the house . From that moment , he trended to get to his house and immediately drag the plans and continue working . When he finished the plans after months of working on them , he started to bring it to life . The house would be made of wood because he could not pay for more .
After months of working on the house , he finished , and his cousin gave him a bonus reward of one million dollars to start with , buying a big house with everything they wanted .
The pie chart shows the principal causes which explain why agricultural lands become less productive , whereas the table correlates these causes with three different regions of the world which had land degraded , namely North America , Europe and Oceania , during the 1990s .
Overall , it is clear that the main causes of land degradation were deforestation and over - grazing .
These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degraded .
A closer look at the pie chart reveals that over - grazing was the most significant reason why land was so degraded , with the highest percentage of 35% .
This was followed by deforestation , with 30% , while over - cultivation had 28% .
It may be explained by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity .
Not surprisingly , these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes , particularly in Europe and Oceania .
In the first case , Europe had the highest percentage of land degraded by deforestation and over - cultivation , 9.8% and 7.7% respectively .
On the other hand , Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% because of over - grazing , which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded .
By contrast , in general , North America had the lowest rates for deforestation and over - grazing , with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively .
For this reason , this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded , with only 5% .
Canton Tower is located at the intersection of Guangzhou New city Central Axes and the Pearl River .
This is not only a sightseeing building , but also has a lot of recreational facilities .
For example , the tower has a 4D cinema , the highest revolving restaurant , and so on .
Do you want to go to have a look after reading my introduction ?
I think that I should have more confidence in my family and remember that they wo n't leave me because of something I have done in the way my best friends could do .
Travelling by bus is expensive , boring and annoying .
It is much more convenient if you walk to the city centre .
At the same time , you can get fit by walking approximately 30 or 40 minutes , and you will not have a problem with parking your car .
You will spend the same time travelling by bus or walking , but the difference is getting angry or not .
Transportation is a means of movement from one geographical location to another by any means of transport .
We know in the olden days how our forefathers suffered in their movement .
Now , there are many means of transportation .
Technology brought about lots of development in transportation .
We can travel by air using aircraft ; aeroplane , helicopter etc .
The train is also a very useful means of transportation and very economical .
I believe that technology has really improve our means of our transport .
Although I have taken part in many competitions , there was one which was the most enjoyable experience of my life .
First , when I was on the starting line , I felt I could not finish the competition . Then , when we were in the water the coaches did not stop encouraging us so it was easy to swim to the finishing line . I was so excited to see our families waiting for us , clapping and shouting loudly every time one of us arrived .
If you are interested in taking part in this sport , I would suggest buying all the equipment you will need : a comfortable swimsuit , goggles and a huge bag to keep them .
' The moment of realisation hits you like a ton of bricks , leaving you with a life full of regret and guilt '
Anywhere she went , she was always surrounded by a handful of students .
People were attracted to her quite easily , and often , they would find themselves adoring and admiring her .
Although she was n't pretty , she had an aura of importance .
All his life , he had only wished to be popular but his dream of popularity had been long ago snatched by a girl .
They had n't abandoned him , neither had they distanced themselves from him .
His selfishness stood in the way .
Right now , he has the one thing he always wished for - popularity , but only now does he realise , that it was meaningless , pointless .
In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I strongly agree with , because the extra traffic caused by the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals causes massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad for the health of the walking and cycling citizens , especially young children and babies .
However , it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway .
All in all , I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than an advantage , because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it 's less important .
Local politicians should focus on sustainability , using vehicles which do not harm the environment .
Because I did n't find any tickets for the concert in London , I bought one for the concert in Birmingham .
As well as the ticket for the concert , I bought a VIP ticket as well , so I had to go to Birmingham before , because the entry to the venue was at 17:00 and , as I live close to London , I had to leave at about 12:00 so I would n't have to rush .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , and then , as I 'd never been to Birmingham , I had to look for the 02 Academy , where the event was taking place .
After 30 minutes , the acoustic performance started , which lasted for about 15 minutes . Afterwards , we took pictures .
My name is Maria and I saw your advertisement and am interested in the job .
On the one hand , I am studying to be a PE teacher , so I know how to organise activities for young people , such as fishing or doing a sport .
I'm good at entertaining . What is more , I really enjoy working with children since they are very active and willing to do any kind of activities .
Yours Faithfully ,
It 's true that commuting to work is n't as convenient as going to work by car .
On top of that , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that you will save time , because both buses and cars wo n't be able to move in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives you more freedom and flexibility to set your own schedule , while public transport limits you to a timetable that does not always meet your needs .
After cars prevailed among the public , our governments have tried to pave rough roads , which encourages people to use cars even more .
Nowadays , it might be argued if the current transportation system will work in the future like it does in the present , while there is a still plenty of room for public transportation remaining as a significant method .
This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be with us or if it will disappear completely .
For a start , the convenience for us for travelling around would probably be one of the main arguments .
In some countries , the amount of transportation such as trains is not sufficient , which forces people to use private cars .
However , it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also , for their parents , it is definitely more reliable .
What is also important is the impact on the environment , which is already considerably damaged by human technology .
If a car which emits no serious global - warming gases were developed , there would be no argument that people had better reduce their use of cars . Yet , as long as we are manufacturing them , we can not find more eco - friendly and efficient modes of transport than public transportation .
In conclusion , it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future , even though travelling by car is more convenient than travelling by just trains or buses .
But as with car development , our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco - friendly .
All of the world is constantly changing - we develop new technologies , people invent new things .
Everywhere , there will be cameras and motion sensors .
Kitchens will be better equipped , maybe with smart appliances , and people who ca n't cook will prepare the meal by themselves .
I think that the differences between homes now and homes in the future will be small .
Personally , I think houses in the future will not be cosy , but very sterile . I do not like that .
Home should be associated with family , happiness .
Travelling by car is getting more convenient .
Traffic accidents , the main problem of car travel , will be solved by self - driving technology .
Using public transport is cheaper than having a car , especially living in urban areas .
If one wants to go somewhere , one can use a shared car which is parked in a designated area .
If car - sharing and self - driving technology are mixed , it will be much more convenient than both the conventional public transport and travelling by car .
All my life I have practiced sports , but definitely , my favorite sport is squash .
The first year , I went to a tournament in Torreon and I won first place . During the first 3 years , I ranked in the first 10 places in Mexico , but then I had to reduce my practices because I had a problem with my knees .
For someone new to this sport , I would recommended being patient and constant in training , because practice is what will make you better and help to improve your level . And , finally , always enjoy the game .
Never had any serious relationship .
Now he was 35 and he was still keeping on smiling at the news of his colleagues ' and friends ' marriages .
Then , one day , he met a girl on the train . She was n't that beautiful , but she had , you know , that smile , so peaceful , so harmonious .
They started talking , complaining about the train being late , and after two hours they were still chatting .
Nowadays , everybody has one or more cars . As a consequence of that , some people believe that public transport is going to disappear .
There are several reasons to believe that . Firstly , many people are influenced by the advertising , which mixes happiness with driving cars and makes people think that public transport is not as smart an option as cars .
Secondly , it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground .
In addition , public transport is cheap because buying a car means spending a fortune and in big cities where people are concerned about the environment , such as Amsterdam or Tokyo , there are many facilities like mobile phone apps or special offers .
To sum up , no one knows the future . However , I believe that travelling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more so , because it is good to save money and to reduce pollution .
" There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient "
In my opinion , fewer people are travelling by public transport and have started to buy their own cars , which are more comfortable to use whether you are in a hurry or not .
In the first place , you feel more comfortable in your own car than on a bus , for example . You do n't need to be afraid that someone could suddenly steal your purse and you do n't have to listen to others when you travel in your car .
Studies have shown that your self - esteem and feelings of protection increase when you are a car driver .
In conclusion , travelling by car is far better than using public transport .

Before the show we were helping with installing the sound equipment .
He was signing autographs and chatting with fans .
That 's all for now , but I will write more when I find my feet ! I will appreciate my dad 's work forever .
I 'm sending this email to get some information because I 'm interested in studying at your university .
I'm supported by the government of Saudi Arabia and the scholarship will cover the tuition and everything related to my studies .
I graduated in 2010 , majoring in accounting , with a degree having an accumulated GPA of 2.49 out of 5 . Since I came here , I have been so ambitious that I will be getting my high studies as soon as I finish studying English . It turned out that I have to jump through a lot of hoops in order to overcome these obstacles which I believe are an ordinary requirement for getting a master 's degree for foreign students .
In addition , there are recent statistics that show that a very high percentage of Saudi Arabian students who come to America to do their master 's degree could n't get into university due to some requirements , for instance , GRE , G MAT , or even because their GPA did n't meet the university conditions .
In fact , I do n't want to be one of those student who ca n't accomplish their dream and have to go back to their home . I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to get into your university .
I would like to have the orientation material to increase my chances of getting into university and I will do my best to get very high grades in order to increase my GPA when it 's added to my transcript . To sum up , what I 'm looking for is to take a preparation class in business to be included in the final accumulated GPA .
Finally , I believe that it it a great opportunity to study in the United States and to improve my education and my lifestyle .
Besides , I 'm an eager , mature student , wanting to study a for master 's degree at your university and I 'm looking forward to getting a response and your recommendations .
In this essay I will comment on one of the last mistakes that I made and its consequences .
First , I want to focus your attention on the fact that , normally , mistakes have no importance , because all things have fix and , if they have not fix why do you worry ?
Every storey has a colored sign ; red , orange , green , blue and an intermediate color between red and orange and that was my confusion .
I left my car on the storey with the orange color , but when , some days later , I looked for my car I did it on the storey with the intermediate color .
When you come out onto the road you need to go straight until you reach a restaurant . Then you must go to the left where you will find a big square with swings and slides .
Recently , studying online has become a very popular alternative way to study .
Although it provides students with lots of advantages , not everything is as good as it sounds .
How can they solve their problems if there is a lack of student - teacher interaction ?
This is impossible if they study online , which means that their only classmate is the computer or the laptop they use .
However , this method of studying is cheaper than the usual way , and it also can be completely free , which is a big advantage .
Nevertheless , I can understand people who choose the second option .
Nowadays , people want to travel at their own conveyance using their own car , bike , scooter or something like that .
Everyone wants to have a stressless / happy journey , whether it is for a long journey or not .
In winter , it is fine . We can adjust to the crowd , but if we talk about the summer season , we can not adjust when we are travelling in a suffocating environment .
We need to book tickets in advance if we are planning to go via public transport , because again , there is the issue of availability of seats .
I live in Trieste , a very beautiful city , but this city has a big problem : it has a lot of cars , more cars than inhabitants .
Of course , it 's an exaggeration , but I say this to affirm that in this city the number of the cars is very high .
By the way , the public transport is not so convenient , because at certain hours you can not find a bus .
Another problem with the buses is that if you take one during certain times , it 's impossible to find a place free to sit down .
So travelling by bus is not convenient , not only in terms of time , but also because of the problems that you can have .
The other issue is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia , where the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy , so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fill up their car directly in Slovenia , where they can find much more competitive prices .
He wants to convince me to use alternative means of transport , but having seen the price of this ecological vehicle , I think that I 'll buy one of them only if the price becomes
And after that , it depends on the personality , status ( single , engaged or married ) , and even the ages of people , whether they will decide to study in their own country or go abroad to learn English .
On the one hand , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especially for young people .
They usually go abroad because they do n't have so many responsibilities . It just prepares them for their professional future .
But they can only afford it by working as an au pair , waiter , kitchen porter or porter , because these jobs include accommodation , normal wages and you do n't need a high level of English .
This way is cheap as well and they do n't have to change everything in their life to achieve this aim .
In addition , at this age , people normally have more responsibilities , maybe children , mortgage , partner , etc .
Trapagaran , environmentally friendly
The purpose of this report is to explain that my town has become more aware of the need to take care of the countryside .
In the last five years , many new bins have been installed near all neighbourhoods .
This one is very important because it contaminates so much .
Apart from that , there are other containers focused on every type of object .
For instance , clothes , shoes , toys , electronic devices , etc .
These are a great place where families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside .
Moreover , residents have become more conscious after they have read the leaflets which explain the importance of respecting the environment .
Conclusion
I really think that it is necessary to make people conscious of the importance of saving the planet .
I would like to apply for this vacancy because I think I have most of the requirements that you are asking for .
I enjoy learning new recipes and I try to find different flavours and sensations when cooking .
I worked for more than six years in a supermarket as well , so that is why I am accustomed to dealing with customers and coping with difficult people in a busy environment .
It is not necessary to say I am able to work to a cafe schedule . I have experience working shift days and weekends .
I would be glad if I could have an interview to give you more details about my work experience , my skills or whatever you need to ask me .
But do n't be afraid if your budget is quite limited , because we have some places where you can find great collections at 50% off .

Nowadays , people 's lives are undergoing an unexpected change all because of globalization .
Globalization started in the 20 's , so a huge proportion of the population has experienced this change . In my opinion , it is kind of good .
The need for exporting and importing items has increased in the last 10 years . Consequently , the life of the people has been raised in rapid response .
Personal contact shows a decrease in this time , because people do n't want to face their real problems . Instead , they can see all the problems happening in the world on their smartphones .
In the future , people will communicate via their computers , cellphones , and tablets , and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Nowadays , we already have things like smart phones , which can do nearly everything we want to .
But will people 's lives really change so dramatically in the next 50 years ?
I 'm of the opinion that people 's lives wo n't change dramatically in the next 50 years .
Of course , there will be some more electronic things like some new mobile phones with functions we could not expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
To put it in a nutshell , we could say that our global world will be more electronic , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo n't change our lives dramatically .
And the most comfortable ?
In my opinion , any transport is completely safe . However , people say the plane is the safest mode of transport .
And maybe the car is the most comfortable .
It is true that both have advantages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , dangerous and relaxing . I know this is a contradiction , but I can explain it .
If you are tired , you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax , and if there are more passengers in the car , you can swap with them , so you will feel less tired .
Even travelling by car , in my opinion , has a lot of problems .
Some disadvantages could be :
- There are n't enough parking spaces and they are very expensive . For example , when you travel to Madrid , it is impossible to find a free parking space .
- Often you can be involved in city traffic jams , especially in the rush hour .
On the other hand , travelling by plane , people say , is safer than travelling on other modes of transport .
I do n't make sure this affirmation .
I 'm afraid and that started when I was travelling to Mexico on my honeymoon .
At that time , there was a tropical storm , and the turbulence was horrible ; but a not time I have stopped travelling by plane .
I look for the perfect offer , but in summer it is impossible to find it .
I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle lane . In contrast to here in Spain , where few cities , like Madrid or Barcelona , strengthen their use .
Public transport is one part of social development .
It will make people feel comfortable .
The bar chart shows the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. and Jack&Jones Co.
we can see the number of projected sales of jeans of Jack&Jones Co. will be at 450 thousand pairs next Jan , it will be higher than the number of the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. ; about 300 thousand pairs . Then the number of Jack&Jones Co. will drop to 250 thousand pairs in Feb next year .
After this fall , the number of Jack&Jones Co. will rise gradually to hit a peak at 90 thousand pairs in Dec.
The pie chart illustrates the projected market share of Mango Co. , Jack&Jones Co. and other companies for jeans at the end of next year . Jack&Jones Co. will get 30% of the projected market share in jeans , Mango Co. take 20% of it .
As it was quite early in the morning , there was just silence everywhere .
" I encouraged myself .
Although many people believe that our lives are getting better than they were 20 years ago , scientists have proved that , if we carry on with our way of living , using , for instance , modern technology , we will lose control of our lives .
Technology has reached a point where we need to do anything in order to achieve something .
People were given the task of writing a piece of writing of their choice using resources already provided by the institution in charge .
Out of 20 tested people , 17 managed to write their composition within an hour .
Secondly , keeping the main task , they were given a tablet with wireless connection to use instead of books .
This time the study showed that all of the participants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes .
The objective of this study was to see how people adapted to new technologies and how our cultural roots are being forgotten .
If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences , we should start to understand how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it .
My name is Montserrat Márquez , I am 23 years old and I am really interested in the advertisement I saw the other day about working on summer camps in the USA . I have worked before but in my home town , Mexico city , and I think I would be a perfect candidate for this job .
I am a suitable person for the job because I am used to working with children of all ages , but I prefer to play with kids between 8 and 12 years old . Also , I am always trying to improve different activities to avoid getting bored , and I do not mind working in other areas of the camp .
Yours faithfully ,
Montserrat Márquez
I promise you will not regret coming , everything here is wonderful and there are many places we can go to visit .
If you want to become an artist or politician , you must be ready for journalists following you all the time .
I suppose that sometimes celebrities enjoys people gossipping about them .
and that is why I do n't understand why is it so important for people to know what happens to a celebrity ?
Also , when you spend time with your boyfriend or girlfriend , you know that someone is taking a photo of you .
WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform you about the ways in which my village carries out measures to look after the environment .
For this , we will analyse several aspects , such as what local residents do with rubbish and how Lanjarón tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people .
Nowadays , there is more and more rubbish because of the huge amount of packaging used to wrap products and the increase in consumption .
However , in recent years my village has been promoting ways for people to get rid of rubbish in an environmentally - friendly way .
A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to attend several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling .
Keeping the village clean and attractive
To achieve this , the council organises different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in .
For instance , every month there is a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village .
At the end of the competition , those whose area is cleanest and most attractive receive an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us .
Others consider that military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary .
First of all , there is absolutely no safety in the modern world .
Therefore , compulsory service in the army gives special military knowledge , which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict .
More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develops organizational skills and practises discipline .
Moreover , it can educate young people to be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents .
However , the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact .
For example , it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service , because during the one or two years of service , soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military knowledge .
Besides , there are accidents , which can happen with guns or weapons , such as explosions and accidents .
Furthermore , there are hazing acts in the army .
Army years often have an impact on the whole family , especially in the case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to a warzone .
Finally , this is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages , but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world .
This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for them to learn .
Firstly , the food I make for myself is more reliable than the food that is made in restaurants .
Because I do n't know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant used .
Because all of the restaurants want to earn money , so they will just use cheap and unhealthy ingredients to cook the food .
But if I make my own food , of course , I wo n't use any kind of unhealthy ingredients .
So the food I make with my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants .
And also , homemade food has a better quality than low - price restaurants .
Secondly , it 's much cheaper to eat at home , because restaurants want to earn money .
Some people think cooking for themselves is too annoying or tiring , so they go out to eat .
Thirdly , eating at home is more comfortable .
When people are surrounded by strangers , people all think they are watching them so they ca n't do this or that .
Also , a restaurant does n't know how much you can eat , so sometimes , they give you so little food you do n't get full .
Fourthly , you wo n't have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and coming back home .
Because of these kinds of advantages and reasons , I prefer to eat at home .
To sum up , the fundamental characteristic of social media is the design of a " Virtual profile " . It takes time to maintain connections between links and friends and be part of groups . These connections will have negative effects , especially on psychological well - being .
This outcome , along with several studies , suggests reasonable use of networking media .
However , it is also likely that people 's lives , such as loneliness and depression , might explain the effects that social media can have .
Furthermore , it is also possible that , in the future , people will be a subject responses , posts and chat rooms , in which there is awareness of wrong vocabulary , poor routines and compulsive use .
In contrast , one positive aspect of social media relates to the education area , in which knowledge , the expansion of ideas , and the discovery of different ways of learning will contribute to the community .
On the one hand , we have technology .
Technology has developed really fast in the last twenty years , so it 's expected to develop the same way in the next fifty years .
Fifteen years ago , cell phones did n't have music or a camera , while nowadays they have cameras with high definition and you can download a lot of music .
Every aspect of science will evolve . For example , new medical discoveries will be made by doctors .
To sum up , I believe that people 's lives will change a lot because everything will evolve .
They help me to develop and to see the world from a different perspective .
Many people think living in the countryside provides a better way of life .
Most of us think it 's a great idea , but is it better than our comfortable life in the city ?
Would we live better without technology ?
As we know , the countryside has no pollution compared to big towns , because there are n't cars , lorries , mopeds or any other motor vehicles .
On the other hand , technology makes our life easier .
We can get information , chat with friends or even order food instantly over the Internet . However , unfortunately , we do n't have it in the countryside .
However , I think humans have evolved and we are very happy with technology and the Internet .
There is no doubt that using your private car is much more comfortable & convenient for any person .
Your car represents a kind of luxury & comfort , which is clearly illustrated during driving or travelling long distances , as long as you have a comfortable seat with a certain personal space .
Furthermore , you are not accompanied by some silly passengers or difficult people during your trip as you will relish your trip with some adorable friends , nice family members or close colleagues that you have chosen .
Besides , the presence of a car during a trip is very important for coping with the different conditions and environments you face during the journey .
On the other hand , public transport has now become unhygienic , as lots of people are crowded into a small and enclosed area , and so , a lot of breath & air droplets are easily propagated in this enclosed space , and consequently , you are more susceptible to the various contagious diseases , especially in the winter season when respiratory tract infections flourish , e.g. colds & flu .
Furthermore , your actions and movements are limited by the schedule and the route of the mode of transport you are taking .
And so you do n't own your time to do what you want whenever you like , although this is your leisure , your free time , which means a time of relaxation & meditation .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country . The authorities have arranged many procedures to ensure that the town stays clean at the same time as being environmentally friendly .
As a first step to keep the environment clean and healthy , the garbage needs to be separated into 3 categories . That is why the environment department decided to give each house three recycling bins ; one for food and green garbage , one only for paper and cardboard , and the last for the rest .
Another handy rule has been introduced , which is that plastic and glass need to be thrown in different bins that are available for public usage in each supermarket center . In these , people can find these bins at easy locations available everywhere .
All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town 's citizens in order to improve the environment and go together with all the procedures that help them live a happy , healthy life .
Firstly , we have a big issue in global warming . We can not deny that we have more and more extreme weather around the globe due to greenhouse gases .
We are used to just turning the lights or air - conditioning on when we do n't really need them .
A lot of us just turn on the engine of our cars without considering walking up to the bus stop .
The fares are high compared to other European countries and the fare system is complicated .
The punctuality of trains needs to be greatly improved , too .
In my opinion , we need to save a future for public transport for our future and it is vital to reduce the use of private cars . Travelling by car is more convenient , but with improved public transport , we need to reduce the use of cars .
That is our responsibility to future generations .
And then you always wonder what would have happened if you had chosen the alternative .
You do not particularly like that feeling , do you ?
There is a group of young people who decided once that it is ridiculous to choose if you can have all in one - do you want to meet them ?
The group is going to perform in The Globe theatre and they have promised to meet your expectations .
' Gravity ' is an outstanding , brilliant , sci - fi film , directed by Alfonso Cuaron , starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock .
This amazing film is about two people from a crew of astronauts sent out in space to launch the ' HUBBLE ' telescope .
Soon , one of them is informed that an asteroid hit a satellite and created debris which is heading for the Shuttle where the two astronauts are .
Eventually , the debris hits the Shuttle and thus more debris is created which follows the orbit of Earth and moved around it at a very high speed .
The damage which the impact of the debris caused to the Shuttle are catastrophic !
To survive , the astronauts have to get to the International Space Station , which is very far away from them .
After a long sequence of events , the remaining astronaut first gets to the ISS , then , with a Russian spacecraft , moves on to a Chinese space station called TIANGONG .
Her struggle for survival turns out to be successful !
My hometown , Piliyandala , is probably the smallest town in Colombo district and provides shelter for more than 100,000 people .
The town has approximately 15 villages and all of them are governed by the urban council .
The garbage control service is one of the main supporting subsidiaries of the urban council , which was founded two years ago .
With this garbage control system , household waste is collected on a weekly basis and transported to recycling centers .
The recycling centers sort this garbage and it is put into different categories to be recycled . Categorized garbage is then transported to the recycling process in the nearest factory .
Two years ago , the council started a wastebasket distribution program among the villages , with the intention of easing the garbage collection process .
With this approach , it is very convenient for the workers who are employed in the garbage control service , because they can collect all the garbage of a village from one place .
Meanwhile , the urban council strongly discourage the use of plastic products and other artificial materials for the sake of our own cleanliness .
Nowadays , lots of people are discussing the problems of life in the next 50 years . In 50 years ,
surely , science and technology will
Planes , trains and buses will be faster and maybe , thanks to the progress of technology , we will be able to beam - up everywhere .
This will be a great achievement !
Face - to - face communication , for example , will lose its importance . All the communication will be virtual . People will speak only on social networks .
I think that this will be tragic ! Also , all relationships and friendships will be virtual , and that is absurd .
Everything is going great !
Then what about my appearance ?
Also , we can go to some parks that I think are incredible there .
It tells the story of a beautiful woman , played by the always stunning and talented actress Milla Jovovich , who is pulled off a bridge by a mysterious serial killer .
As time goes by , Milla learns how to identify people 's body gestures . As she becomes more confident with her new ability , her life comes slowly back to normal , but not for too long , because she becomes suspicious the murderer could be closer than she would ever have expected .
To most of her friends in the dorm of University of Education , Mimi is just an ordinary girl , neither beautiful nor smart .
Michael loved her at first sight when he first met her and he tried to take advantage of opportunities to win her heart .
There is no doubt that the Southerners in Vietnam have had prejudices against Northerners for a long time .
It was unfortunate for Michael to get access to her because she was a Southerner .
Overcoming many prejudices and obstacles from her family , he proved to be a loyal and sincere man who Mimi could depend on .
But everything has changed since he came to Danang city for further study .
Everything was fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises .
Right after getting off the plane , she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view to satisfying her long wait for him .
The more excited she was , the more disappointment she had . Mimi caught sight of her lover kissing another young girl in his room .
Hey ! how are you ? How is life ? Hope your done with your prestigious exams that you told me about .
Anyway , I 've recently been organizing an environment - saving event for our beautiful city by doing a recycling campaign .
Since your dad has a recycling factory , I thought that he would be pleased to get the bottles and the other recyclable material as well .
As you know , in our country there 's trash being thrown everywhere and most of the things that are thrown away are recyclable .
This is the main reason why our environment is being destroyed .
The charity I chose to invest in was the envirosavers charity , as they have recently done a good job of re - building animal habitats , so I thought that they might need money , since they have just spent money on building the habitats .
At the event , there will be charged entertainments for all age groups . There will be live music , and we also have a lottery which will be going on .
You never told me that you were thinking of playing an instrument .
What kind of instrument are you going to play ?
In my opinion , you should try to organise a schedule for your activities .
I 'm Vincenzo Manna , an engineering student who , by means of linguaenglish , is going to spend three weeks in Brighton ( as you already know , my colleague Gelsomina Davide and I are arriving on 27th of July ) .
I would like to ask you for just one piece of information .
Surfing the Internet , I have found that if I catch a bus I will be able to get off at several stops ( Coach station , Patcham , Preston Circus and so on ... ) , while when travelling by train , I can choose between Brighton and New Brighton .
I hope to improve my English skills thanks to this trip , and especially my listening and spoken English .
In fact , I am studying a lot to pass the CAE examination ( Certificate in Advanced English ) , but I am facing several difficulties .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat and I have lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area has changed so rapidly , such as , now it has a lot of condominiums a long the main road and nowadays this area has a big shopping mall and a modern hospital and a large police station . That makes my life so convenient and safe because I can walk from my house to go to the shopping mall in about 10 minutes and I can walk to the hospital in just about 5 minutes , so I did n't worry when I got sick and the large police station is located in front of the hospital . That can assure safety for everyone who lives in this area .
For this reason , this is the advantage of living in this area but because of many people in this area , traffic in rush hours especially in the morning is very heavy and it takes so long to drive a car to work .That is the disadvantage of living in this area . So , in my opinion , this area should have an improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to cover this area .
Mary and Amber were having lunch at a restaurant .
Mary yelled loudly at the young man to call him to stop and everyone in the restaurant noticed him .
To his surprise , Amber and the manager of this restaurant were already standing in front of the door .
As a result , even though he kept expressing his apologies to Amber , she still decided to call the police .
Although the two movies are from completely different genres , similarities still exist .
The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones , and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life - altering events .
Ali , an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son , saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet .
Once again , their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges .
In sum , both movies portrayed love as a chemical reaction that grows when two people are willing to help each other out of life challenges .
On the other hand , after Ali starts his kickboxing career , Stephanie always cares about his conditions , and then becomes his middleman .
And in Silver Linings Playbook , Pat and Tiffany , who both used to be stuck in their misfortune in the past , leave their past behind and move on with each other 's love and support .
Although they have those things in common , at the beginning of the movies , the depression of the characters came from different situations .
Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psychological difficulties ; Pat 's desire for his ex - wife can not be fulfilled , while Tiffany can not get over her guilt over her husband 's death .
On the other hand , the characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality ; Stephanie lost her legs , and Ali is a poor man .
Although their hearts are all empty , the harsh environment is harder to survive .
In conclusion , every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways , whereas people can always find distinct inspiration .
In my opinion , being included in the latest TV news is a huge contribution , a great opportunity to introduce yourself in the way you like .
They 're being followed constantly by paparazzi , and their private photos are being bought for millions of dollars .
We should n't underestimate the importance of societal and environmental problems .
On the one hand , I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems , including environmental ones .
Their activities had lots of negative consequences , such as air , water and land pollution , deforestation and climate change .
These issues are so burning in developing countries .
Whereas developed countries have become aware of these problems , poor countries have plenty of societal problems , so they continue to affect the environment in a negative way .
For example , developing countries can not protect the environment because of their poverty , low incomes , and population illiteracy .
On the other hand , sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal ones .
Such disasters as earthquakes , floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year .
Unfortunately , we can not prevent natural disasters , but we can solve societal problems .
If people take responsibility for their actions , we will avoid plenty of consequences .
In my view , we can achieve this through developing leadership .
He must inspire others to achieve appropriate goals and to do their best for the world .
In my organization , we strive for peace in the world .
We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and in these ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society .
Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something , but I do n't know how to do it properly .
I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing my country 's welfare .
Though new problems occur quickly in our state , some people and communities try to do their best to develop a civil and democratic society .
We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environmental problems .
Moreover , our country pays little attention to them , so the population has to do everything on their own .
For instance , I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and saving energy .
These skills are necessary for us , and they help us to improve our ecological situation a little .
In conclusion , each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede the further progress of our civilization .
What is more , this project will give me valuable experience , including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendencies in the social sphere and careful attitudes towards the environment .
Television can entertain everybody today . It does n't matter the age . It can be a baby or an elderly person ; we can see that there are interesting topics for all kinds of audience .
It 's a multimedia device so that while you watch TV , you can listen and see other people or cartoons , and it seems the characters are alive talking directly to you .
Today the networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , you can watch the programs at any time you want to , and if you do n't like a program , you can change the channel and watch something else . Through the increase in channels and competitiveness , the audience has also increased its power of choice .
We have the power to choose what we want , but with so many options , we must be aware of our own decisions . I want to say that , although we have so many options , not all of them are effective for us . We are able to decide if we 'd rather see a comedy or a documentary .
The programs tend to reproduce our real life and our desires , such as a soap opera which presents characters with difficulties in their lives , but there are also the solutions to all the problems at the end ; the lady gets married and lives happily with her love forever .
Although they have a nice ending , we need to remember that real life is different and the difficulties are part of our lives . They are there for us to give value to everything we have and to remind us how fragile and , at the same time , how powerful we are .
We can also watch a documentary that teaches us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so much care that they provide us with a lot of information . Sometimes it 's much better than reading a book or having a class .
Many of the automobile owners live in big towns and they often park their cars in the city centres , where they work or study .
Recently , governments in many countries imposed a ban on parking or even a ban on driving in major city centres , because this leads to increasing traffic jams .
Moreover , cars pollute the air significantly and it becomes unhealthy for breathing .
Underground car parks are built in many towns , where you can leave your car when you have some work in the city centre .
Some drivers are not keen on this ban , because this is inconvenient for them .

How does Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' , Shakespeare creates a magical mood and setting by using characters , such as the fairies , and events ( such as transforming Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers ' relationship , as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia . Consequently , Helena is in love with Demetrius .
There 'd be no humour to make it interesting .
The fairies control nearly everything .
The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania 's argument , which makes ' contagious fogs ' ( 2:1:90 ) and ' hoary - headed frosts ' ( 2:1:107 ) .
The fairies also affect nature as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute results in the wind ' piping ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Having fairies as characters adds magic , as fairies do n't exist in the human world .
As a reoccurring theme , Puck 's use of magic creates humour , conflict and balance in the play .
Puck 's magic also adds to his naughty , cheeky , attractive character in this play .
This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her ' sweet love'(4:3:30 ) .
It also creates the comparison of Titania , a beautiful , delicate creature , whilst Bottom is completely grotesque .
The idea of Titania having a ' flowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and the idea of Bottom , at that time , looking ' monstrous ' and ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey 's head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seems ridiculous .
As well as for his needs , he uses his magic to help ' A sweet Athenian lady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) ; namely , Helena , with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is shown as a sympathetic character .
However , Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania .
When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head , he gets annoyed at first at Puck 's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a ' vile thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an ass ' head .
In the book , Titania does n't seem to use her magic much . Nevertheless , she uses it a few times .
Titania uses her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the bride 's bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta will have beautiful children and live a happy married life .
Titania 's fairies are also characters who use magic . They use it to protect their ' fairy queen'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted snakes with double tongue ' , ' newts and blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , like Oberon 's , is used to help people , and not for themselves .
She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies .
The food they eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as well as not being our daily meals or snacks , which also shows another contrast between the humans and the fairies .
The language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us probably haven't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
He talks about ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beautiful land , with green grass and all sorts of flowers .
Let her shine as gloriously
OBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language used in this spell contains many references to nature ( ' Venus ' and ' Sky ' ) .
This is how it creates magic and creates the setting , as in William Shakespeare 's time , they did n't use many props .
Just by reading this , you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called ' love in idleness ' and you can understand Cupid ( the Greek god of love ) had blessed this flower with his archery , giving you an understanding that this is a love potion .
Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as ' let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky ' to create the thought that Helena should look like a ' goddess , nymph , ' in addition to being ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
Shakespeare says ' Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid 's archery ' , causing mystery and making us think about what he means .
Shakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters . For example , when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nature many times .
She refers to the moon as ' the governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasons quite a lot .
She describes the winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of as a miserable season .
Spotted snakes ' and ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are references to animals .
Animals , insects and plants are commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to the magic .
The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical .
After all , the book is called ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' .
Due to the magic , the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream , as there 's no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened .
Thinking of it as a dream creates innocence and vulnerability .
Also , Shakespeare uses the thought of plays .
He adds the play ' Pyramus and Thisbe ' which is a bit like a mini - play based on the storyline ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' , as there are two lovers whose parents do n't permit their marriage .
When the ' mechanicals ' , or workers , change into their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The characters in the play , like ' moonlight ' , are basic ideas of transformations like the ones that magic creates .
Also , there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) into expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world .
At this time , the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion creates magic .
The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play .
To summarize my points , I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations , spells , potions and aspects that do n't exist in the human world .
I personally think , without magic , this book would not be as popular or engaging .
Shakespeare has done it again !
You will enjoy the friendly atmosphere here .
If you like artworks and antiques , you can go shopping for stone sculptures and papyrus there .
You will never forget this amazing experience and the fragrance of the land of the pharaohs , legends and history .
Nowadays , most schools and universities help students to find their most suitable jobs .
This is caused by the changes that the labor market has experienced recently .
Businesses want to recruit young and experienced people and universities and schools have noticed that , so they are hands on the task .
It has been suggested that businesses offer " work experience programs " .
It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but also because of the experience that it could bring them .
Some businesses require experienced employees and if young people have it , they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
So , including experience in the CV , seems to me , a step further in the student ' s career .
Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualifications .
Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a job involves .But sometimes , universities give them more theoretical training instead of the practical training which businesses are looking for .
Generally speaking , students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience .
I would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of " training " for their work life and some theoretical knowledge .
They have to learn the skills that a job involves and the only way to get this is by practicing .
Nowadays , we have " n " number of international sports where one can prove one 's own talent and socialise .
The fun in this game is that you need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait until the opponent responds to it .
My suggestion for people who want to start badminton as a hobby , firstly one needs to know the rules and regulations of the game .
As it 's a mind - set game , the player needs to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
To be a successful player , one has to learn some tricks which help make the game easier .
Thus , pushing themselves leads to success .
I am very pleased to hear that you finally managed to open your restaurant .
I 'm really sorry that I can not accept your offer to work at your restaurant .
But I have someone in mind that can help you at the restaurant . It 's my sister Sorina . You met her at my party . She is a lovely girl , hard working , flexible . You will love working with her .
She has a lot of experience . She worked in a restaurant for 5 years and can also cook .
Let me know if you are interested in getting to know her better .
In Vietnam , many places are worth travelling to , such as Da Lat , Sa Pa , or especially Ninh Thuan .
VH Bay in Ninh Thuan is seen as one of the best bays in Vietnam , so I especially recommend you to go there .
To experience it well , you should stay there at least three days .
Besides , you could sell your own food on the streets , which sounds very interesting .
Every Monday a different guest speaker is invited to the Film Club to manage the discussion over a good drink , thanks to the Coffee Bar 's special late opening .
They spoke about their films from a point of view that will uncover for you a new wonderful way of interpreting the meaning of the iconic messages that they 've introduced into their movies .
For the next season there 's going to be a new cycle about WWII and Tom Hanks and Matt Damon will visit the Film Club to speak about the film in which they appeared : " Saving Private Ryan " , and their process for getting involved in their characters for realistic acting .
CONCLUSION
If you love the cinema or if you only want to take a break from your daily routine and meet new people and make new friends , you should n't miss this great opportunity to turn a grey Monday into an amazing start to the week .
I 'm suggesting you choose between two different places : the beach or the mountains .
First of all , remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess ( Spanish omelette , fried chicken breast , sandwiches , chips ... ) and , also , you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming , jumping the waves , surfing and so on .
Playing in the sand , burying one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors .
Furthermore , going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy city life , too .
In my opinion , no matter where you go , just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful , amazing even unforgettable time .
The purpose of this report is to showcase the ways in which energy consumption is reduced , together with the saving of natural resources in my city .
In Cluj , each year , during the summer , the local authorities give citizens the opportunity to rent bicycles , something that can reduce the air pollution produced by car exhaust .
Surprisingly , people support this project and every year the number of bicycles rented rises .
The local authorities could also organise events in which they can encourage people to start saving natural resources like water , or to convince people that power consumption can be reduced in many other ways .
La Cacharrería is a small , Spanish restaurant in the old town of Cáceres .
The tables are small and tall but they are comfortable .
The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed .
La Cacharreriaes is a tapas restaurant , so you can choose lots of different small dishes and share them .
The service at La Cacharreria is very good .
Another thing about this restaurant is that it is cheap , about 20E per person .
La Cacharrería has a disadvantage : you ca n't reserve a table and it is very popular .
I recommend La Cacharería , because it is a great place for a quiet meal with friends .
Different factors such as stress , psychological problems , noise , lights , do not let you rest .
I do not have trouble sleeping , or suffer from interrupted sleep .
I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and , that way , I will see improvement .
There are different medications or even natural things to improve these conditions .
Implementing each piece of advice and telling others about your improvements , is a good way to help others .
Some people think there is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars actually have many advantages .
The main reason to think there is a future for public transport is that , according to ecologists , we must cut down the massive use of cars .
So , public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport , but we 'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in acceptable conditions .
Please find below clarification related to the below issue :
During a meeting with the head of department in MOH , I was complaining about servicing of the microscope by their staff ( almost 99.9% from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract , and handling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested providing the required training for all his staff , in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service .
The next day I received a call from one of the technicians , Mr. Humam Altannous ( who has a compliant against us ) , asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lab ( which are not under warranty or contract ) .
But he is not ready to accept this and is asking us to go and repair the unit without any repair request being issued . Please note that our telephone conversation was for only 2 minutes and during this conversation he was misbehaving and mistreating me and hung up the phone ) .
He did not ask any manual / trouble - shooting instruction during our call , which he mentioned in his email .
The next day I complained about him to the head of the department . It was only during that time I got to know that he is one of the technicians who is taking care of repairs of the microscopes in the department , and his manager requested me not to repair any unit without an official request , and he would come back to me regarding my complaint against his employee .
Please note that we maintain a good relationship with our customers and always give good service as well .
We hope that the above explanation is sufficiently clear and exhaustive .
Thanks for your kind understanding
Because there will be an international festival for young people in our region , I have written this report in order to find out the their preferences and the trends which are in nowadays .
In fact , they can hardly ever define themselves as pop fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plenty of girls who were interviewed told us they could n't stand reggaeton music , but they usually want to listen to it at discos because they can dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't have a musical culture and magnificent bands like the Rolling Stones are going to have to remain in oblivion .
Secondly , I debated with young people about the television programmes that are watched currently .
Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people , in order to gossip about them .
However , documentaries are being forgotten and only twenty - six percent of them would like to watch more interesting TV series like Lost .
Nowadays , everyone uses the Internet and apps everywhere .
In addition , it is very easy to make friends and communicate with somebody .
Furthermore , if you are a shy person , this way is very useful for you because you can talk more directly with someone .
Secondly , if you use the Internet to meet new people , it 's a good way to find people with similar interests . You can enter an app and you can describe what you look like and someone will be interested in you .
In conclusion , I agree that the Internet is a good way to meet friends because you can get to know a lot of people around the world .
The statement - ' There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . ' can be discussed in relation to two different aspects .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and this can be attributed to a lot of factors , such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
On the other hand , if I were travelling to see my friends or family in a nearby town or just on a holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
If you are travelling in your car , it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination , you can make any number of stops , and even stop for your favorite ice cream .
In future , the environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these modes of transport .
Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints ; they are trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative will definitely help countries to reduce pollution .
This is the reason why government decisions about education play an essential role . I have always thought that it should be accessible to all .
I studied in a state school and I believe that I got a good education , not only academic training but also strong principles to live in society .
For instance , knowing other languages , like English , is increasing day by day .
To sum up , education is , in my opinion , the most important basis of any society and it should be accessible to all people .
There are many reasons for travelling , and to travel from one place to another people use different means .
because the public means of transport can carry a lot , and this helps to move cargoes everywhere at a low cost .
All these points support the importance of public means of transport , and demonstrate how useful they are .
In my view , public transport will keep on offering their services , and will never be affected by the appearance of private means .
Introduction :
This report is intended to evaluate the Active Leisure Club and to give some suggestions regarding the Club 's new facilities .
I believe that should be borne in mind when the new facilities are built .
The Club offers a wide range of activities to spend time doing .
Those activities developed my interest in sports and nature .
The staff must also be congratulated .
Everyone in the organisation is kind , helpful and cheerful .
Recommendations :
Although the facilities are well organised , they are too small , because more and more people are becoming members of the club .
However , the advantages outweigh the worst aspects and I will be happy to join the club again next Summer .
Thanks a lot for your letter ! I am pleased to hear that everything is well with you and that you are coming to Poland .
I 'm very sorry that I haven't replied earlier , but I was having a hard time at university .
In my opinion , Poland is beautiful country , so you will not be disappointed ! I would recommend you starting your trip in Poznan .
If I were you , I would start looking for a job by checking local advertisements on the Internet .
I am writing in reference to the advertisement for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , in order to apply for the job .
I appreciate your attention to this letter . Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions .
Yours faithfully ,
Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life . You focus on the competition and it is like having a rest from everyday life .
In conclusion , personally , despite the danger of some sports , doing sports is by far better than just sitting in your house and watching them .
I 'm so glad to hear that you are giving me an opportunity to make your club facilities better .
It would be a great chance for your club to share my ideas to improve your facilities .
1 . All the people who work in the club are attentive and professional
2 . The facilities are cheap to use
The temperature of the changing room is too low
yours faithfully ,
The problem with this mansion is that it hides a lot of secrets and mysteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners , who are a family whose husband went to war and died . So the real occupants of the house are Nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister Anne , who turns out to be one of the most important characters in the film , and their mother , who is called Grace and has a particular obsession with catholisism .
The other characters that also play an important part in the movie are the servants .
The film describes how the love that a mother can give to her children can easily turn into an obsession . However , what makes this film so special is that it pretends to be a typical horror movie , but in its final scene , there is a sudden change which makes it more interesting .
It was made in the right place for such an unexpected film as it was made in a big manor on an abandoned foggy island .
I would recommend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared , because it is not like the rest of the horror movies . It is a film in which you are continuously discovering secrets as if you were another character .
Public transport is the mode of transport for passengers who can travel from one place to another for less money .
At first , this transport was greatly appreciated .
Everyone felt so delighted , but unfortunately , now people feel uncomfortable when it comes to travelling by public transport .
Today , every single person is keen to earn as much money as they can and the interesting part is that this eagerness is increasing day by day , and so is their income .
And people feel comfortable in their own vehicle .
The main advantage of having your own transport is that you do not have to wait for public transport . You can save time as you only need to accelerate your own transport and drive to your destination .
Public transport is slow now , even though it is very comfortable , but unfortunately , people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class were to travel on public transport , it would affect their status .
But still there are so many people who use public transport frequently , but that is only their compulsion and poverty .
If they were financially stable , they would surely buy their own vehicle .
Exhaust fumes are one of the great problems for the environment .
So it is a question that requires deeper reflection from all of us .
Firstly , many people think public transport has no future because travelling by car is faster and more independent .
Secondly , people think buying a car is a cheaper option in the long term than travelling by public transport every day .
However , a lot of people are becoming more and more conscientious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of the most important reasons is precisely to take care of the environment .
I am very happy with the idea of encouraging public transport 's use because it makes cities a better place to live .
I really liked working with special effects and the best thing was that I learnt a lot about that technology .
Public transportation is the most popular way of travelling to places .
These modes of transportation can easily be found anywhere to reach your destination .
On the other hand , travelling by car is more convenient and safe .
Travelling by car is preferred by some people because of its convenience and advantages .
In addition to this , we do n't have to spend too much time looking for a bus which will go specifically to our destination .
But we can not deny the fact that public transportation has been around for years and in every country as a means of travel .
Most people prefer this kind of transport , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
I disagree that there is no future for public transportation as it is still widely used all over the world .
Moreover , this has helped a lot of people , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
However , public transportation in the future might be improved and developed and will still be used by many people .
The side effect of depending only on cars as our main means of transportation are remarkable .
We should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has a huge number of cars on its streets and this number is going up rapidly . Having this huge increase in cars will impact badly on public health & the environment and infrastructure .
It is more convenient with modern lifestyle to travel in a car because of the privacy and independence.the remarkable development of cars ' luxury features and other options .
However , it will be over cost in full , car service and the effort of concentration on driving . All of these negative points can easily be avoided by using public transportation . It should be cheaper than using your own car , you do not have to look after it , and you can do activities while you are on it , like reading or chatting with your friends or making important phone calls .
The environmental impact is an important factor we should consider . Having this number of cars is like having thousands of factories on our streets giving out tons of CO2 gas and many other polluting gases . The speed of new trains or planes or even buses is now competing with car speeds and is even faster than cars in a lot of places .
Using public transportation is better than using individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury facilities . Extending the use of electric cars and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environmental pollution as much as we can .
It was so impressive .
Hope my thoughts will be interesting for you .
As for my personal experience of sports , I do n't do it professionally .
Most of all , I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton .
There was a time when I used to visit a volleyball club , but I gave it up .
It 's easy , interesting and fun .
It makes my day more productive .
It 's also good for the cardiovascular system .
I 'm absolutely convinced everyone should realize that the most important thing is their health and sport really can help .
Predictable , some of the solutions will remain intact .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comfort .
Nonetheless , changes will be visible on the interior as well as the exterior .
Buildings will become smaller , yet more functional and organised .
Furthermore , they will be ecological , the main reason being the use of renewable sources of energy .
As a matter of fact , reduction of living space will not be noticeable due to thinner walls .
The electronic devices will undergo the most obvious changes .
All electronic devices will be controlled by the voice or thoughts .
I am writing this letter because I am concerned about facilities for shoppers in our area .
I also appreciate that it is located near to the housing estate .
Unfortunately , I think there are some aspects that demand improvements .
Furthermore , the shopping area lacks restaurants and entertainment facilities .
People usually become hungry after shopping , so opening eating places in this area would be very beneficial .
In addition , the shops arrangement is actually very messy and finding the store I need is hard .
Moreover , you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area into certain sections ( e.g. clothes , food , and house ) .
Finally , opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainment facilities like movie theatres and gyms should be considered .
Yours faithfully ,
My favourite sport is undoubtedly jogging .
Furthermore , it would be useful to have a chronometer to check out your improvement .
I would also recommend stretching after every workout to avoid any kind of muscular pain .
If you prefer , you can substitute stretching with a few yoga exercises as well .
Personally I do not completely agree with this way of thinking .
Also , you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets .
Otherwise , you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need , everything on the rack is calling for your attention , after a while you want to buy everything .
The diagrams illustrate the process of making bank notes .
The first step is design , which includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then they move to the next step ; preparation of metal plates . Skilled machinists are needed in this process .
Printing is quite closely related to the first two steps , because the design and skilled machinists should both be considered .
The most important step is inspection , where printed sheets have to be inspected manually and carefully .
However , there is a big difference between these three types .
If the quality of sheets and bank notes is good , then they will be packaged and distributed .
Conversely , bad sheets and bank notes will be destroyed .
My name is Elvira Vergara and I am applying for the job in the summer camp in your advertisement .
In addition , I am very keen on children and teach them the marvels of the environment .
I have worked in out - of - school activities before and in other summer camps in the south of America , too .
Also , I have studied teaching and I practise with my father , who is a teacher . I have been swimming since I was five , so I could teach your camp 's children about swimming and other sports like basketball or hockey .
Yours faithfully ,
There are so many options on television that sometimes it 's hard to make up your mind , do n't you think ?
You can watch international channels and live shows around the world , something that in the past would have been too good to be true .
Moreover , the repetition is massive . I bet that at least once a week you can find that old series called " Friends " , ca n't you ?
Even knowing that not too much has changed our options nowadays still make television a very good tool to get the family together and have an enjoyable time .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received when I spent a night at your hotel on 20th March 2014 .
Firstly , I must inform you that I was dissatisfied with the hotel receptionist , because he forgot to place my wake - up call and , as a result , I overslept and I missed my flight .
Furthermore , I was late for a very important appointment and I lost a lot of money .
I am writing to inform you about one of the most interesting places in our town .
There are a lot outstanding views and places worth visiting but let me tell you about the Warriors Museum .
The breathing landscapes you can see from the museum are also a great advantage .
Yours faithfully ,
When you do any sport , you have to be confident in yourself , without confidence you will not have any progress .
You know you like a sport when you enjoy it and you feel comfortable doing it , that 's what I recommend you do . Enjoy yourself and be happy doing it , because Muay Thai is a beautiful sport !
I am an economics student at National Chung Cheng University , which is in Taiwan .
I would like to be a graduate school student of Financial Accounting at The University of Texas at Austin .
The reason why I want to change my major is that I found that I had a bigger interest in Accounting than in economics when I studied in the first year of university .
So , if I can join your school , I will cherish this opportunity and work hard in school .
At university , my accounting grade was better than others .
As a result , I enjoy studying accounting .
Also , I have some work experience that is relevant to Accounting .
My first job was as an assistant to my financial accounting professor .
My job was to find the company 's financial statement that corresponded to a news report .
My work was to close the accounts every day , so my carefulness had to be improved during the time , because the money did n't belong to me .
I think patience and carefulness are two pivotal personal traits to major in financial accounting .
I believe my work experience can help me to be a better graduate school student of financial accounting .
This is a nervous and exciting decision for me , but I wo n't regret it and I am ready to join the field of Accounting and to be a graduate school student .
He 's been doing great in both academic and extra - curricular activities in the school .
He has been one of the players of basketball from when he was an elementary student until now he 's in college .
As the tournament began , he 'd been getting high points for his team , and because of that nice contribution they had won the game .
It had been a very intense and tiring day for all of them but Mike felt he had achieved something really good because fortunately he was the most valuable player too .
He 's not only doing excellently as a student , but he 's known as one of the most popular students because he works voluntarily as a coach for the younger kids in his town .
He wants other kids to be inspired also in everything they are capable of doing .
So in their generation they have something good that they contribute to society at their very young age .
For him , it 's absolutely right to begin doing something meaningful in their lives .
A mistake is something you may do unintentionally . However , people believe that mistakes can later be improved or ignored , whereas sometimes we may make mistakes that could break somebody 's heart .
Who was not only fair but a very attractive girl .
And they both had a great understanding . However , this innocent girl had caught the attention of all the viewers including these two .
Michael could not digest this fact , since he could not compromise on anything .
Henry fell down and his head was injured . Michael left him to bleed profusely and later a pedestrian saw his body , tried to check his pulse rate , but found that he was dead .
Later , the girl discovered that Michael was behind the incident .
If you are old enough , you can see how far technology has progressed in the last 20 years .
As a rule , a friend or psychologist plays this role .
We must pay to receive a psychologist 's attention , but friendship is free of charge .
What if you 're alone and no one can understand you ( and you have no money and insurance to visit a psychologist ) ?
He is still in his twenties and he has studied computer engineering .
He had everything that any person would want to have : living abroad , earning a lot of money , having a partner , working for an international company , and so on .
At night , we can stay at home , as you said , and also we can buy chocolates and watch a movie . That 's great for me !
Finally , I 'm afraid my parents ca n't bring me to your home on Friday evening because it 's my grandfather 's birthday .
The population grows , with more business skyscrapers , residential houses and advanced transportation , at the cost of diminishing farmland and wetland as well as deforestation .
Though the modern cities are emerging rapidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the environment are severely various .
The red coral reef off the coast of Australia , for instance , serves as a shelter for algae and other tiny sea fishes and an index of environmental fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there is cut off and environmental variations are gone away .
On top of that , it is the regulation capacities of the environment for temperature , moisture and even sandstorms are eroding as less plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen into the whole system .
What 's more , extreme weather occurs with EL NINO periodically causing catastrophic floods in northern cities in China and long - lasting drought in South American .
Because the population density is increasing all the time currently , the losses triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family .
In a bid to address these side effects that civilization has brought about , governments must take measures step by step to tackle them .
Firstly , governing authorities should set up protection areas for animals and plants , banning hunting or even leisure activities like hiking .
Secondly , the government must fund environmental organizations , in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop illegal hunting , deforestation and animal extinction .
Furthermore , the government should go out of their way to stand united in such a way that joint endeavours can be effective globally .
In conclusion , governments are supposed to balance modernization and sustainable development .
We prepared for it for a long time , but I had a wonderful experience .
The course is going to finish , so the teacher wants us to go out to a restaurant .
The choice was n't easy because the teacher is vegetarian .
In the end , we decided to go to a restaurant near the school .
The atmosphere is friendly and familiar .
There are many kinds of cafes , ones for those who like sports , art , literature or music .
In this place , there are guys and girls attending pedagogy who organize activities to entertain children of every age .
The most popular restaurant is " Mario 's Pizza " , where you can eat delicious pizza with the topping you like best .
Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter for discussion .
At the moment of choosing , very different aspects , like ecological effects , economic viability and even time uses , take part in the decision .
Firstly , the car option is the best one in terms of comfort , because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities .
Then public transport is not as comfortable as the former , because if you 're lucky , you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour .
On the other hand , traffic is the biggest problem when talking about transport , the car 's conveniences are replaced by the need for punctuality and , depending on the city , delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or train .
However , the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience . Cars are the most expensive mode of transport .
In comparison with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come .
To sum up , neither cars nor public transport are considered the perfect option , but considering the long term consequences , as is common nowadays in some European countries , bicycles are the best way .
Riding a bicycle reduces traffic , costs , ecological impact , and even car crashes .
it 's so kind of you to send me my favourite Glaswegian postcards !
I fancy living in a family and not in a college or in a shared flat as it will give me the opportunity to be continuously in touch with English people , day and night ; then , it is the ideal solution for me : you know I 've recently been given the sack !
What about looking for colleges which offer Wi - fi Internet connection and a proper meal at lunch ?
Looking forward to receiving your next letter , and on tenterhooks about the information you 'll provide .
Fashion , clothes style , trendy appearance , make - up , hair ...
Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our lives ; but , should it be like this ?
It is certainly true that people are very critical of appearances .
We have subjective opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconceived idea .
We match clothes style with a lifestyle and a personality .
That is why appearances should not have consequences in our lives .
However , there are people who do not follow that , and they wear the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most .
For example , in work interviews and jobs that have direct contact with the public , it is better to wear a formal or smart style .
Overall , my personal opinion is that we give too much importance to clothes and appearance than we should .
Although on some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have the freedom to choose what clothes they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our lives .
The death of public transportation
People do not think about the environment , they only think about the time that they will spend in the traffic . Scientists say the new society can be called " the fat society " because the people do not want to do any exercise , people do not walk anymore , people just use elevators , etc .
A lot of convenience , this is the reason why there is no future for public transportation , people do not want to spend a little time walking to the bus station or to get a cab . Also , the service on public transportation it is not very good because of many things like the inflation of prices , the way that the bus or cab drivers refer to the people , the way the bus or cab drivers drive , etc .
In countries like Mexico , some people have the opportunity to use Uber , which is a service that you can use if you have a credit card . It is an amazing service , but not all the population have a car or the financial status to use an Uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the bus or cab driver yells at them or drives badly . In Mexico , the public transportation , in particular the cabs , are not a very secure services , because some of the drivers steal and kidnap , in many situations they could kill you if you do not take precautions . But despite this , it is very sad that in that place people can not do some things because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more , so they have to take public transport .
In countries like the United States of America , people have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged social status , so for the American people , public transportation does not matter . They have the possibility to take public transportation or not , they can decide , so they decide for convenience .
The future of public transportation can be death or can be in growth , it depends on your point of view . In Mexico , maybe it will never die , but in the United States the public transportation is now dying .
She went to the kitchen and saw a beautifully prepared breakfast .
Suddenly , she remembered that for three days she had been living with Chuck - her boyfriend .
It was the first day of spring and everything was coming to life .
It transpired that at the fountain stood Chuck , waiting for her .
Sarah was concentrating on her cellphone , and Stephan was listening to music loudly on his MP3 .
Fortunately , there was a mother with her child strolling behind them , and she saw Sarah get hurt .
Stephan went to the hospital immediately to see how Sarah was .
After these incidents , not only Sarah but also Stephan realized how dangerous it is when you focus on technological gadgets instead of the things around you .
They are both determined to pay more attention to their surroundings .
When I started reading I could not put it down because it is a fascinating story that grabs you .
Katniss , the protagonist , is a teenage girl of 16 who has been forced to poach to feed her family since her father died
An increasing number of people have begun to discuss success in school or work , and whether having an ability to adapt or adjust to conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge of a field of study .
However , does the claim really ring true , conforming the real situation ?
It is my contention that people who have the ability to adapt or adjust to conditions or circumstances have a higher likelihood of being successful in school or work .
That is why it should not be the key point that is considered the key to success .
To explain , there is a trend that many universities all over the world set up free courses for people who thirst for knowledge , also often inviting famous scholars to give a speech to the public that is open to everyone .
People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interested in .
Excellent performance in the field of study is not a determining factor for your success .
According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank , the percentage of people using the knowledge in the world of work that they learnt from school has surprisingly decreased in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent , a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of a half - century ago .
This phenomenon had been curiously many experts .
Does knowledge from school make any difference in the world of work ?
However , after deeper analysis , we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast changing world and the text book can not catch up with it . Knowledge changes from time to time .
Hence , this research reminds us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor for success rather than of having excellent knowledge of a field of study .
Nowadays , the statistics show that many parents are younger than in generations before .
Previously , most women used to have a baby after marrying their partners . But today , it is not so important anymore .
Actually , teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children .
Apart from this , the small difference between ages is also an advantage .
Although they have less experience , they recognize what a child wants to do .
On the other hand , a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their children without having experience of that .
However , progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life , so I believe both are good at bringing up their children .
He started to do his homework , but he had trouble concentrating as the memories came back to his mind .
It is very important to think about possibilities that could create your fortune .
In conclusion , if I have to think about one thing , which is more important in my life than the other one ,
There are some solutions to prevent the rise in the consumption of sugar - sweetened drinks .
The National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) points out that most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar - sweetened soft drinks .
The limitation of this solution is the public may not be satisfied with this size of soft drink .
To overcome that , the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it .
This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverages decrease sugar intake efficiently .
Family education would be introduced to their kids .
The National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) reports that teenagers are the main soft drinks consumers and the most popular beverages are sugar - sweetened drinks .
Parents ' words are key to restricting their kids ' actions .
In conclusion , increasing consumption of soft drinks is one of the issues to protect people from obesity .
A number of strategies could be efficient to address these problems .
If we take these measures soon and keep them up for a long time , obesity will not happen in the next generations .
We can say that Coyle 's idea is well developed thanks to two features that run through the chapter and the entire book : first of all , many significant references and specialized people are mentioned to define what " deep practice " is ( a psychologist , some experts in their own field , authors who have already analyzed that particular topic … ) ; secondly , but no less important , Coyle himself collected most of his information while visiting at least nine places , nine " hotbeds " ( 12 ) where talents grow , as a sort of collection of data gathered from laboratory experiments .
As a consequence , theory and examples proceed together in such a natural way , that the reader must undoubtedly exclaim , as if she / he were before a Sherlock Holmes investigation : " That 's it !
In my day friendships were easily made with neighbours , schoolmates and social club friends .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other , more than these virtual friendships prevailing today .
I have already experienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a charitable association established for youth friendship .
I have personal experience that dates back to 1987 . In that year , I started a pen friendship with a German girl called Claudia who was 17 years old then .
The surprise is , today I am 44 years old and Claudia is 40 years old and we still correspond with each other through the modern means of Facebook and Whatsapp . Of course , we can no longer wait for thirty days when we can chat and see each other live .
In my country , I hav had two close friends since we were about 7 years old and we still have a strong friendship now .
It is not necessary to agree with each other on everything where we always debate and challenge whose opinion is correct .
Real friendships that are ever - lasting like what I actually made with my two best friends , should be founded on trust and faith .
The best of all in real friendships is to always believe in your friend 's abilities and be his real mirror for good and bad actions . He will be the same for you .
As I am in my late 20s , I 've found it hard to find a sports activity that would be neither as competitive as those in fashion in my country nor as demanding , so I could do it in my free time .
In one of the windows I found a skateboard and along came the memories of the year 2000 and the MTV channel that I was brought up on .
Recent studies found that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient when combining a bike with a train .
In addition , travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee .
On the other hand , studies showed , in many other cases and especially in irregular trips it is more convenient to use a car .
A car is unbeatable for its flexibility .
It is much easier to use a car when going shopping , or making a leisure or occasional trip .
Although there are some disadvantages to using a car , such as traffic jams and high maintenance costs .
The popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , studies say there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable .
There are those who try to avoid the use of public transport and prefer driving their own car due to the advantages it offers .
Firstly , it allows you to go somewhere directly , without finding out information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains .
Moreover , the use of your own car has more advantages . Travelling by car prevents you getting wet when the weather is rainy .
If you travelled by bus or train , you would probably spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination .
Despite the bad weather , if you travelled by car , you could park your car near your destination , so that you could arrive comfortably .
The government usually advise the population to use public transport to cut down pollution and the amount of gases which damage the atmosphere .
In addition , it is often claimed that it is cheaper than travelling by car .
Although it has some benefits , in most parts of the country , especially in the smallest towns , the public transport is not developed enough .
In my opinion , it could be useful hardly ever times , so a great number of improvements will be necessary .
.H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the needs of the people regarding a high number of properties .
First of all , to a certain degree , I agree with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in one 's grasp , because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family .
This speaks to the idea of the government or another organization having control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods .
This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and does n't necessarily break any rule of personal space .
Secondly , as I said , " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling people 's choices regarding house choice and what they can do with their houses takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should do .
In conclusion , I can not say whether or not control over people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only speaking hypothetically , without any form of testing . However , it does have its strong and weak points .
My English is improvable but by speaking I hope that I 'll do it well .
I like organising activities and games to make people enjoy their time .
Also I 'm very responsible and hardworking , so I would take care of the children and I would do my tasks the best I could .
Finally , I want to say that this is an important opportunity for me to learn and to do new things .
It is the world 's biggest youth cup and is held in Gothenburg in Sweden .
This centre offers various activities , like swimming pool , paddle , tennis , ritmica gym , judo , ballet ...
Furthermore , it has various coaches and a perfect timetable for parents that are busy in the daytime and for young people that need to go to classes after lessons .
This building is near the football pitch and basketball court .
In my view , it is a good location because children can do different after - school activities without moving too much .
I want to emphasize that , thanks to its full schedule and the number of coaches , adults , as well as children , can do different activities at the same time instead of having to wait .
On the other hand , the only disadvantage I can see is that there are n't activities for old people .
This centre should provide activities that do not require much physical effort for these kinds of people , like petanque or something like that .
Finally , to say that it is a perfect sports centre and inexpensive , including a range of activities .
A friendship that ends never started
Thomas , David and I were neighbours and grew up in an ordinary quiet village .
He is one of the most persevering people I know .
Thomas is a calmer person and has control over circumstances .
It 's the fastest and most comfortable way to get to your favourite destination .
I especially like to have a first class seat on a plane .
It really feels like you are in a five - star Hotel in a luxury suite and not travelling 10000 meters above the ground .
I do n't like to travel by boat , because it 's uncomfortable and it takes ages till you arrive at your destination .
Travelling by train is not an option for me .
I would like to talk about a diamond jewellery set that I gifted to my wife on our last wedding anniversary .
The tool to communicate with foreigners .
From my personal experience , I can say that if you learn a foreign language like English , you wo n't have a problem when you go abroad on holiday .
However , I must pay the fee and every evening it 's my commitment to study something or do my homework .
I suggest that all youngsters who want to learn another language ought to go abroad .
Young people should have an experience like this .
If you would like to spend some time travelling , my country , Spain , is a fantastic place , because the weather is good most of the year .
The main attraction in Córdoba is the Mosque . It is a building where Catholic and Arabic elements are mixed .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Only a few long seconds spent thinking about what he had to do : he had to save the passengers .
He desperately ran through the train towards the driver .
Desperately he started to kick the door , furiously , blind with rage , harder , faster .
Fortunately , a voice from the radio was trying to contact the man .
In a hurry , he dashed to the microphone and answered the control station .
I played basketball for three years and it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun .
I enjoyed playing basketball , not only because I wanted to play a sport , but also because it 's a healthy way of living .
The advice that I would give people that would like to start playing this sport is that they should have a bit of experience of working in a team that is full of new people .
The most important thing that a person should know about this game is that a lot of intelligence is required , because you must know how to reach , how to get nearer to making your aim become reality , and that is that the team should score as often as they can to win the match and have fun .
I am writing to you in response to your advertisement which I saw on the noticeboard of your school .
I like managing the conversation in a group .
I enclose my CV , which gives full details about my experience , ability and skills .
I strongly believe that research has valuable benefits for society and the environment .
For example , making life better and more comfortable .
Bachelor 's paper [ 1 ] is one of the good sources describing what research means .
First of all , researchers should be interested in what they are doing .
Being interested in the area of research leads to innovation and optimizes ideas that already exist .
Second , critical thinking , which is deep thinking about the problem and the way to solve it , is an important factor in successful research .
Also , honesty , originality , which is the ability to think critically , independence and creativity , and precision make research more valuable .
Moreover , working as a team for research , allows researchers to gain lots of research benefits .
All members of the team will get benefits and push each other to achieve the goal by giving some advice and more information .
In addition , clear , easy to understand , and precise scientific papers are one way to present , share , and discuss the ideas and results with others in a scientific environment .
Exchanging information with other researchers , via scientific papers or seminars , sometimes provides solutions for other researchers ' problems .
Researchers should not give up when they face difficult problems with the research and should keep trying different ways to solve them and they will do it in the end .
To conclude , there are some important research principles .
Whenever researchers consider most or all of them when working on the research , researchers will get results with a high precision .
Researchers experience their research as an enjoyable activity .
Second , I feel comfortable when I travel in my own car . I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy .
Furthermore , I do not worry about theft or any crime which used to happen when I traveled by train .
However , I find traveling in my own car has many more advantages than disadvantages .
Immediately , I contacted their manager , asking if they could do with some help .
She said that they would need someone who can take care of their performance outfits .
In the spotlights , they all looked so beautiful !
That was what I particularly liked about that experience !
So do other people in my country , especially old people who have not got their own cars .
We can help our environment to be healthier !
I was absolutely thrilled to read that you 've got a job as a tour guide in the Congo rainforest !
I 'm sorry it has taken me so long to write , but I have been working my fingers to the bone preparing for my exams , about which I 'm annoyingly nervous .
Speaking of nervousness , I think I 've found a solution for you to shake off your nerves about using the English tenses correctly .
However , there 's no need to worry any longer , if you have a look at www.elihinkel.org/tips/tenses.htm .
On this website , you can find a clear , detailed explanation of the tenses , with illuminating animations .
I 'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there , you 'll have mastered the tenses next time we see each other .
Keep me posted on your experiences in the jungle !
Getting into your car and giving the directions and then having a stress - free drive towards your destination and letting a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore .
But are driverless cars as safe as old - fashioned cars ?
It is surely a fact that autopilots in car 's sure are handy .
It takes hours to drive to and from ; hours where one just has to concentrate on driving , hours that are futile .
Although it must be admitted that driverless vehicles are expected to help children , the blind , the elderly and others who currently can not safely drive themselves .
The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption .
To put the whole matter in a nutshell , the self - driving system is good for preventing accidents .
It was an immense amphitheater .
Thousands of people fought as gladiators .
Today , not many amphitheaters are standing .
It is the most popular amphitheater in the whole world .
During the last year , I watched a lot of famous and priced films , so that I am prepared to follow discussions about them .
I am a communicative person and I often meet with my friends .
Among my acquaintances I have a reputation for being a friendly , positive and talkative woman .
In my job , I have daily work with groups of people and I give presentations in front of them .
I have good organizational skills and can explain things clearly in order for people to understand them easily .
Yours faithfully
Many people consider them indispensable .
In fact , a significant number of people agree that computers have made our lives much easier than before .
Computers help us with organizing our data . Also you can find any information you want very fast as it has lots of search engines .
Computers can help you with your homework by finding the information you need .
That was the key to opening the treasure chest full of golden opportunities .
The truth is that everybody had really high expectations of him .
I have read your hotel 's advertisement about the Niagara Fall s romance package in a newspaper .
I am writing to you because I am interested in booking this service at your hotel and would like to receive some further information in advance .
First of all , could you provide me with information about the total cost of the package ?
What I am most interested in , is a room with a fall s view .
Since I want to spend a night with my partner at your hotel at the end of December , I need a confirmation on your part of providing a room at that time .
In addition , could you provide me with information about the nearest airport and about the way to get to your hotel from there ? We must know this for any case since we are going to travel by plane from Budapest , Hungary . I would be pleased if you could assist me in booking a cheap flight as well .
Yours faithfully ,
Now we are spending too much time waiting for public transport and , of course , we would like to get to our destination as fast as possible , but public transport does n't provide such a possibility for us .
Furthermore , we use personal vehicles or rent cars for travelling , because it is more convenient and gives us the feeling of independence .
I understand completely that some types of public transport such as airplanes and ships , will exist for some time .
But this is an exception , because existing technologies do not allow the usage of such personal transport as we want at this time .
First of all , my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help others .
For instance , one day I was walking in the park when I saw a girl falling down from a children 's swing in the playing area . I helped her immediately , and after I was sure that she was fine , I called her mother and told her about this incident . She thanked me a lot .
I thought she was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the same every time .
In addition , young people display altruistic behavior from the 18th month .
For example , last week I was stressed out , so I lost my phone at the university . I did not realize that until I returned home . While I was on my way to the university , my little sister prayed for me to find my phone .
Finally , scientists hypothesize that our brains are helpful enough when we can help out other people .
How are you ? I hope everything is alright .
If you 're not up for that , you can just get a taxi at Barajas airport to the same destination .
Saving the environment
This is because human activity releases into the air substances that damage several things on our planet , such as the atmosphere and ecosystems .
Global warming , deforestation and drought are some of the consequences . Therefore , we should do countless things that appear to be meaningless , but if everyone does them we can live on a much healthier planet .
Every day , scientists try to develop new ways to improve the way we live , so that we are able to pollute the planet less .
One of the things discovered by these scientists is Eco - homes . Eco - homes are a type of home that helps us cause less damage to the planet and atmosphere in our everyday life .
It sounds a little bit strange , but by installing solar panels and other features in these homes , we live a much greener life . Undoubtedly , there will be some changes but , because we know why we are doing it , there would be no problems .
Also , the effects of those actions would be huge and would help improve the environmental situation . Nevertheless , we will still have to change some activities and be less self - centred , so that we can all work for a greater objective .
In my opinion , in a decade we will be living in these homes . I ca n't wait to experience it .
I enjoy playing this sport because it is very funny and competitive .
Furthermore , football gives you the opportunity to make friends because it is a team sport .
So wear comfortable clothes and good trainers .
There are a lot of opportunities .
You 're right , in fact it was very difficult for me but I finally took this decision because I want to have new experiences .
And my parents refused to give it to me because they say I must become indipendent .
I definitely ca n't get a full - time job 'cause I want to relax and have fun .
St . Petersburg
The Vietnamese education and study system is completely different from the Australian one .
Like Asian countries , such as Korea , China , and Singapore , the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive for all students , especially for primary students .
These subjects mainly focus on math skills , grammar , writing , but there are not any courses related to life and communication skills or innovative science .
Meanwhile , the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than the Vietnamese system .
Additionally , the subjects in the school are given with the aim of developing the thinking and creativity of students .
They also play many interesting sports .
Secondly , it is not only the school but also Vietnamese parents of primary students who are expected in the education of their children .
Therefore , outside school , Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes , such as math , writing , grammar , … .
Consequently , Vietnamese children do n't have any life skills and have many health problems , such as short - sightedness , tummy - ache , spinal column … Sadly , the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short - sighted has tended to increase in recent years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents also care about their children but in a different way to Vietnamese parents .
Outside school , they send their kids to sports centres or social activities .
To sum up , Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children . I think that primary students need to spend more time playing and enjoying their childhood .
My first time was an exciting experience I will never forget : the touch of the rock , the height , the pain in your fingers ... I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive , even if sometimes I feel fear .
But do n't think that climbing is a dangerous activity!. Although you climb to the top of a rock wall , you always do it with checked safety equipment .
You should try this amusing and thrilling sport because it 's a sort of competition with yourself : every day a little bit higher , every day a little bit more difficult .
I love holidays and summer , the season I like best because of a lot of things . In summer I always go to the mountains , to my grandparents ' house , where I have fun with my uncles and cousins .
Grandma 's food is great and I spend days staying outside , playing badminton or volleyball or having a walk in the woods .
But what I love best are the afternoons with my favourite cousin , Sara , and her brother , Luke .
I have recently watched The Ultiamtum of Bourne and I 'm so excited to share it with you . I believe you 'll absolutely love it .
Eventually , he reads about a journalist who is writing about him and a program called Black Brare .
Just before the assets get the journalist , Jason Bourne helps him to escape .
He tries to get some information from the guy , but unfortunately a sniper shoots him dead .
I will not tell you what happens afterwards so as not to spoil it for you .
In the end , all went fatastically .
Throughout my life , I have lived in a few cities and villages located in the South of Russia .
In villages , the only means of public transportation is small buses , most of which can carry up to twenty passengers at any moment of time .
In regional centers , most people commute on trolleybuses and trams .
The latter is the transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely waste time in traffic jams thanks to dedicated railway lines .
Those who are not satisfied with the public transportation system may use private vehicles .
But recently I bought a cheap bike and really enjoyed cycling in the summertime .
Thanks to my mom , to my travels and to the people I 've met , I 've learnt how to speak fearlessly and quite fluently in English .
I absolutely love children and they honestly love me ; I think it is a sort of a gift , because not all people love children and can get on well with them .
I 've had a little bit of experience of summer babysitting for some kids . In Italy it is more difficult to be a babysitter because , if you are underage , parents should take responsibility for you , so it is better to be over 18 .
During those few times through which I built up my experience , we all played together and we cooked together , so I taught them how to make some chicken and some pasta in the Italian way .
One of my characteristics is that I 'm a very precise person . For example , I enjoy making lists because they make my mind clearer , and I strictly follow what I wrote so everything , hopefully , ends well .
It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship with the horse you ride .
If you provide confidence , the horse will trust you .
With this reliance , you can go through everything together .
Surely this is not everything .
As the production of cars has increased , it seems that the need for public transportation has declined .
Unfortunately , there is a certain limit to space , so it is not possible that everyone can use their car every day , especially in mega cities like Seoul , New York , and London .
It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway , because you do n't have to worry about your car while working .
It is related to the environmental issues .
There are so many kinds of problems which environmental pollution causes .
Surely , the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means .
I am writing to enquire about the job of Camp Assistant in a summer camp , which was advertised in a magazine .
I am 25 years old and I finished my studies in psychology this year and I am available to work from July to September .
I am a very active person and I am accustomed to doing different kinds of sports activities , such as swimming and riding .
I consider myself a responsible person with the ability to face any kinds of problems .
As for languages , I speak native Spanish and Catalan and also I speak French and German fluently and recently I passed the First certificate in English .
I feel that I have the right experience and qualifications to do this job .
If you think that I am the most suitable person to be recruited , I would be interested to hear from you .
Yours faithfully ,
This topic leads me to think of the professional skill " Architecture design " .
I hold the belief that the topic is completely wrong for me , even if some improvements are easy to use and solve most problems .
First , the growth of the population still continues , the space for living is still a serious problem , although the skyscraper has already solved most problems related to the population crisis .
On the other hand , the skyscraper causes more problems , such as pollution .
For example , I designed the high - rise architecture in a highly populated city in Taiwan .
The skyscraper provides more space for excess population . However , the building will produce more pollution if the skyscrapers are constructed from modern materials , such as steel and concrete .
They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site .
The pollution will harm the local people and the environment from the site of raw materials .
Second , computer systems look like they solve most problems . However , these systems are more dangerous in specific situations .
A " BUG " may appear from a man - made system because of incomplete coding .
That is why our personal information always leaks to the " hacker " .
For instance , when we enjoy the electronic commerce and shop for goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal private information at the same time .
They will use that information to steal people 's money over the phone and we will trust them because they have the correct personal information .
This is a normal phenomenon in Taiwan . However , the police ca n't do anything because of the hacker 's anonymity .
That is why I said that the best improvements still do not exist , even though computer systems have already solved some problems .
That being said , I still feel the reasons I have presented are strong ones , such as architecture and computer systems .
As soon as I read the letter about your problem , I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions , since I have a similar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongly that daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be in shape .
For example , you could go on foot or on your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead . By doing this , you will burn more and more calories daily without special equipment and having fun with your pals .
Furthermore , if I were you , I would go with joining a health club .
As a result , you will save time and embarrassment , especially if you are out of shape .
You will not feel self - confident and happy , but your outward appearance will be better .
Friendship today
Friendship is actually a really important issue nowadays .
In my opinion , the best way to develop your new friendship is meeting them ; having a coffee , a drink or whatever .
For all of these reasons , we have to take care of our friendships these days and social networks are OK for being in touch with your friends . But if you want to make new ones .
Money : essential for youngsters ?
A new , tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for college or to embark on their professional career .
We have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this younger generation .
Why do we call them youngsters ?
I 'm not dismissing the idea of financial aid , though .
What I 'm doing is challenging the way we approach it .
We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time as we help the next generation to succeed by their own means .
If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid their growing lazy , then financial relief is welcome .
Undoubtedly , I 'm presenting a major challenge to every parent : will we be able to take care of youngsters and yet teach them that money does n't grow on trees ?
Money is almost essential , but the way young people learn to interact with it is essential to shaping a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort .
The Tuesday was an extraordinary beach day .
All day I was lying on the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredible time with them .
Those two day were family days . I had to go to the church to a mess which represents the last days alive of Jesus Christ : the last supper and the passion .
Travelling by car is so much more convenient if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
Imagine going by car to cities like London . Is the car more convenient ?
In the last few years , public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology , flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables , tickets and destinations .
Besides these , public transport is better for the environment , especially the electric bus .
The electric bus is an option in many countries as a way to improve the environment .
This type of transport is a great contribution to the environment , because it 's cleaner than those that need petrol or diesel to work .
The subject of the environment is very important nowadays and can cost a country a lot .
A country has to pay for their carbon footprint and this means the more pollution is produced , the more the environmental damage . In other words a , bigger carbon footprint means more has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental policies in order to decrease the cost of carbon footprints .
Such policies will involve taxes on polluting cars , the increasing of fuel prices and the introduction of benefits for those who opt for more environmental means of transport .
So , the convenience of travelling by car is not entirely true .
Of course , you are in control of your time and destinations , but is it enough ?
Think about its impact on your finances and on the environment . Would n't it be better to take a bus , the underground , or a train ?
I am Ana Alicea Benavidez , a student from the Faculty of Medicine of Málaga , where a girl , who was one of your volunteers , was talking about this project last week . She suggested we join it .
I have worked in various activities like this . For example , in a famous basketball team as a volunteer , or in the hospital with children and their parents who live there .
I consider myself a fun , communicative and responsible person with experience in these kinds of activities , and who can help with all the things you need .
These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading throughout mankind 's history .
Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea , this article focuses on the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain .
First of all , the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimuli .
However , reading is the most important stimulus to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind .
For instance , when you read , you have to associate characters and places , and memorize details .
Those kinds of things help the brain to be more active and process information faster .
This statement is based on the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain by reading books .
This is another big reason to care about reading , because in this competitive world , only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society .
Thirdly , when people read , they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what 's going on .
There are many good movies , thrillers , especially , are always enjoyable in my opinion .
One of those is the movie ' Silence of the Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBI agent in training , has been asked to talk to an imprisoned Hannibal Lecter who has information about a serial killer the FBI has been trying to catch .
First , I was really impressed by the performances of Jodi Foster ( Clarice ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
Not only in their individual roles , but also in the scenes they did together .
Secondly , the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and , because of that , really enjoyable .
You had to pay attention throughout the entire movie to keep up with the story .
This movie is outstanding . I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it .
As I mentioned before , both the acting and the storyline are really impressive .
How was your first English literature lesson at school ? I hope it was loads of fun with plenty of new knowledge acquired !
I learnt about the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London , as well as the life of William Shakespeare .
You may think theatres were fashionable place for royalty , courtiers and merchants .
During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I , play watching was an entertainment for the locals to relax .
These actors paid full attention to convincing the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting .
They used props , thick make - up , gowns , wigs and all sorts of accessories .
The ' Juliets ' even had to shave their beard and moustache and enjoy their role throughout the play .
What a gargantuan sacrifice of self - esteem and reputation they made !
One more interesting fact is that both the lovers in the play were Italians , but their playwright had never been to Italy .
It could reflect the fact that 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in contact with Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors .
Cannonballs were rolled around to make the sound of thunder .
Pig 's blood was used for casualties or deaths in sword fights .
Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter , romance , and tragedies .
The play lover King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men .
By now , I have widened my horizons and increased my interest in the spotlight on playhouses .
As you asked I am going to give information on how my village looks after the environment .
My village has been working on this project for decades . They have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort , we started with the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an area where the population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when it comes to taking care of the environment .
All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) . Every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy that provides part of the energy to each house on the days that the sun shines , but if there is no sun , the village has a dam beside it which provides us with enough water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only do we have hydraulic energy , but also wind energy ; on the outskirts of the village , there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .
Also , our water has one of the best purification methods . After we use it , we clean it so we do n't contaminate the water of the river or dam .
To try to keep the environment clean , we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking up all the rubbish and checking the whole area in case there is something not normal .
Apart from this group of volunteers , every person in the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as low as possible . Here the bicycle is the most popular mode of transport . Cars are n't common . They are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances .
Some people think that buying things is very boring and unnecessary .
The first advantage of buying new things in shops is that it is very satisfying , in particular for women .
Many of them are relaxed when they are searching for new , remarkable clothes .
We would buy next , impractical high - heel shoes , which will spend a couple of years in the wardrobe .
The last but not least disadvantage of doing shopping , is that in the mall could prowl many pickpockets , and they could rob us .
In conclusion , buying new things is a good idea to spend an interesting time with friends , but we could also lose a lot of money .
Personally , I do not agree with the statement " shopping is not always enjoyable " , because I like this way of spending leisure time , for instance , with my mom or friends .
This bar chart deals with the costs of three different photocopiers .
Interestingly , the purchase price of " Carde " and " KD " is almost the same .
In " Carda 's " case , the amount is $ 600 and " KDs " price is approximately $ 700 .
All the photocopiers show a very low warranty price .
As a long term investment , I would choose the " Sebus " model even though its purchase price is very high .
The reasons for this are its low warranty cost and in particular its low running costs .
The kenn running expenses will compensate for the purchase price in the future .
Many people claim that wearing fashionable clothes is very important .
They spend a fortune on outfits and wait to be admired and appreciated .
I agree with the idea that clothes can help with expressing ourselves .
It is very important to choose those items which represent your personality .
In this way , they represent originality just by using their creativity .
The latest fashion is often designed for slim people , so it is recommended to choose the right ones .
The most significant thing is that it is not what makes you beautiful .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter ran into his father 's arms , but he disappeared and he promised himself that he would never ever tell anyone about the secret .
I do not think that there is no future for public transport because not all people can have a car , especially poor people in a developing country .
In addition , some people do not like travelling in their private cars on the highways because they fear accidents .
But on the other hand , l agree to some extent that travelling in my private car is much more convenient .
I can travel at any time without being restricted to specific times , and l can rest at any cafe to drink my favorite coffee .
I enjoy using GPS when travelling on my own to explore new places .
Consequently , we can not dispense with public transport , even if some of us would rather use our private cars .
Some non - building areas , in some countries , are now occupied by housing and other residential buildings .
Human beings need more natural environment to live better and to ensure the standard of living .
Inhabitants can go to the countryside to have a picnic or excursion with their friends or families to relax .
The consequence is that they can easily get sick in modern buildings , which will influence their mental health , and even worse .
Without a pleasant place to live , they are facing extinction .
As a result , some of the most vulnerable species will face dying out .
For governments , restrictions on exploring human land is one of the ways to solve these problems .
Policy - makers could enact a law to reduce land development .
As long as there are some places for them to live , the natural environment can be balanced .
In conclusion , a wide range of buildings and constructions can not only destroy our own living environment , but also that of animals .
Governments are responsible for solving these problems to achieve harmony between man , nature and animals .

" Your granddaughter must be born , with a curse that causes scorn . Imperceptible she must become until she finds love .

It is hard to believe during the time of segregation , black people were treated as second - class citizens not only in real life but also in the constitution .
The movie revealed the ironic reality and the ignorance and stupidity of some unkind people during segregation .
I had heard about slavery , discrimination , hate crimes against black people , but I did not know what really happened at that time .
Now , from books , movies , I know some of the most influential movements . I know Martin Luther King , Jr. was more than an activist and a public speaker .
I know the first person who ended segregation in the south was a 9-year - old girl .
What if I was an African - American ? What if I had been born during segregation ?
Would I be brave , determined ?
I was born and raised in China . Being a Chinese person , it is our obligation to remember what Japanese soldiers did to us during World War II .
We learned enormous heroic stories about how those heroes sacrificed their lives for victory .
When they got to the location , the guide decided to call the wildlife protection in that area to come help .
Once the wildlife protection had been able to help the puma , everyone congratulated Max for his bravery and help .
The last documentary I saw was a documentary by National Geographic called Ocean .
It was about life in the ocean and the consequences of climate change .
The first thing I learnt was that we are destroying the Earth and , especially , the oceans .
So , overall , I would recommend this documentary to everybody because everyone must know what we are doing to the Earth and they must learn to look after it because we only have one Earth and if we destroy it , we wo n't have any place where we can live .
I conduct group and individual training in Hatha Yoga and Thai Yoga ( Ruesi Dat Ton ) .
I am also a Therapeutic Thai massage professional .
All my yoga lessons and massage sessions are conducted in line with the Correct Approach to Spine ( CAS ) method , so they are very safe and based on scientific theory .
Safety and knowledge of body mechanics are very important to the CAS vision as they give a feeling of confidence and understanding to yoga practitioners .
I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of yoga and four years of teaching .
I practised Ashtanga and Iyengar 's styles of yoga and Ruesi Dat Ton ( yoga of Thai hermits ) , learned different approaches during my training in India and Thailand , and my practice brought me to Classical Yoga - Correct Approach to Spine school , the way of exercising I found the safest , the most beneficial for health and scientifically grounded .
For me , the practitioner 's safety is one of the most important things , as ahimsa ( non harm ) is one of the crucial principles of yoga .

My husband and I appreciate very much that you are receptive to new ideas .
As you know , we frequently visit your Health and Fitness Club .
Can you imagine that we were a bit disappointed when we read your plans to build a second sauna cabin beside the swimming pool ?
For them ( or do I have to admit us ) , it would be a better idea to build a changing room with more space in that particular place .
In addition , your proposal to provide additional equipment for the gym and a widescreen TV for the snack bar did not get applause in our home .
My recommendation : do not hesitate to invest in a second microwave .
Maybe you could consider updating it with new classes , such as kickboxing .
Thank you once again for allowing us to give our suggestions for your wonderful place .
I read your advertisement on your internet Website .
I am good at organizing and I am able to get to know a lot of people in a short time .
I would like to have a meeting with you to explain my skills to you in more detail and I 'll also bring you a copy of my Curriculum Vitae .

He took the case and planned to travel to Casablanca the next weekend , taking advantage of a bank holiday on Monday .

I live right by the sea and I 've been working in restaurants and pubs since I was 16 , where I learned to cook and serve tables .
I am the eldest of four brothers and sisters and I used to take care of them when my parents were at work , especially because I love babysitting !
I can cook and I like organizing sports and different types of activities , so I think I would be really suitable to work for you .
I can speak English and German and I am a really hardworking girl , always happy and cheerful with everybody .
I attach my English C.V. so you can read my references and my past experience .
Homes of the future will definitely be different from those in which we live currently .
For sure , technology will play the main role in every home .
Everything will work remotely ; lightning , heating - probably there will be a possibility to program everything by time , day , month and so on .
All appliances will be eco - friendly .
There will not be a home without air - conditioning anymore .
Room configurations and style will be somewhat different - more glazing , more open spaces .
Unfortunately , we ca n't know that for sure .
One year ago , Robert Stromerg directed " Maleficent " , from the film " Sleeping beauty " .
The film is about Maleficent , who becomes bad because she is abused by Stefan , her true love .
Later , Stefan becomes King and decides to cut down the magic forest , where lives Maleficent .
Maleficent finds Aurora and they become friends .
When Aurora is sixteen , she falls asleep because Maleficent had cast a spell when Aurora was young .
Maleficent is sad and she makes apologies and she kisses Aurora .
Finally , Maleficent overpowers Stefan .
At the end , Aurora lives with Maleficent in the magic forest .
The cast is excellent and the color in the photography is spectacular .
I think learning is like a weapon for any individual and enables him to be like a champion .
Learning has no end . We spend all of our lives learning from circumstances we face .
Learning not only means studying in schools , universities , etc .
This can be easy only when you are determined to achieve what you want .
This composition is about a famous person from my country .
I chose this man because he was a significant player during the slave trade .
He fought for the liberation of slavery in West Africa .
This has led to many black Americans visiting the Gambia for investment purposes .
He was captured while hunting with his colleagues in the forest .
He worked very hard in the sugar plantation for the slave master .
He was later given the opportunity to learn English .
He did very well during their exam and was given another opportunity to teach English to other slaves .
He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolition of slavery .
He died during the demonstration .
But his name was written in all western nation newspapers as a brave man .
The Gambia is well known to adventurers and tourists .
In view of all of these points , it is not wrong to say that public transport is still available and very useful in our daily life ; even though there are many types of car , which are more convenient .
So , there will be a future for public transport because of its benefits or advantages to human society .
It is very friendly transportation where people from all places meet on one transport system and they can build a relationship between them .
Additionally , the pollution , such as haze , will be decreased because fewer people use the car .
As a conclusion , there is a future for public transport and it is also convenient to use it for travelling .
I have seen your advertisement for the job at the USA Summer Camps advertised in the local newspaper on the seventh of June .
I believe I 'm a good candidate for this job because I have passed the FCE examination and in a few months I will be taking the CAE exam .
I also speak Spanish and Portuguese due to the fact that I have family in both countries .
I am particularly interested in this job due to the fact that I have already worked in summer camps ( In Spain and France ) for two years and I 'm very passionate about being with children . I would be able to organise sports and evening activities too , because I have helped with many events at my school .
Unfortunately , I do n't have much experience of working in kitchens , but I think I 'm hardworking enough to pull it off .
With reference to my character , I am very organised , friendly and determined .
Yours faithfully , Laura

Subject : Application .
Dear Mr Cunningham ,
I am writing to apply for one of the camp monitor positions you advertised in last Monday 's Daily News . I am interested because this post will give me complementary experience .
I have been working in several camps during the last year . For this reason , I have some relevant experience in this area . In addition , I am doing a degree in teaching at the University of London , and during the last quarter I have been in charge of a group of six children during activities related to sports and cooking .
If you require any further information , do n't hesitate to contact me on 666777555 in the evenings .
I would be very grateful if you would consider my application for this post .
I 'm not a sportsman . I like watching basketball , tennis , football , but my favorite sport is running .
For me it is like meditation . I can think about everything or nothing .
It is very good for the circulation . Running helps me to be in good shape .
The restaurant I would love to review for the class is one of the most popular restaurants located just near the downtown plaza .
It is called the ' Egyptian Cuisine ' and its name actually represents what it has to offer .
It offers a delicious Egyptian menu which provides enough dishes to cover all tastes . As an example , their delicious fresh eggplant traditional salad .
If there is anything that favors this restaurant , it has to be the quantity they serve ; a surely sufficient quantity along with the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town , if not in the whole country .
What about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer ? With a soulful live band and an elegant dining set , their atmosphere adds to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit the whole class , professionally named the meeting table .
This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons . Firstly , it offers a traditional menu which will be sure to cover all different tastes .
Secondly , the lively atmosphere it offers will surely keep the class entertained during the entire dinner .
At the end of my essay , I would like to devote this paragraph to thanking my wonderful teacher for this opportunity to offer my sincere opinion on the topic .
Many thanks and I hope for a wonderful trip , regardless of the restaurant voted for .
It was a very different experience to learning in Korea .
Participation in class by asking and answering questions demands more active thinking from us .
Nobody would deny the significance and effectiveness of modern technology , having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable advantages , such as mass production , information and communication devices , as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs .
However , it has also created some alarming problems , namely environmental destruction , and increasing unemployment and health concerns .
This essay will attempt to analyse both sides of this controversial phenomenon with some applicable supporting ideas .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhanced quality of individuals ' lives , contributing to the economic growth of numerous nations .
To illustrate , machinery and the use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop mass production and increase the availability and quantity of various types of food , having made them cheaper and more affordable .
It is played in a box drawn on the ground the size of a volleyball court .
A central line divides the box and a line is drawn inside each box about 2 feet from the line which ends the box , and this line is proudly called Ellai kodu(Border Line ) in Tamil .
The rules of engagement are quite simple .
But before retreating , if he touches anyone among them and leaves their field without getting caught , then the raider gets a point and the person who was touched by the raider is dead ( Out ) .
Each team gets an opportunity to raid the other 's field alternately , and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin , as is usual in most games .
One might wonder , but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature , written circa 300 BCE .
It says the bravery of a man is reckoned by the number of scars on his body , except on his back , because they thought to be dead on the field was far better than retreating .
I love to play the game with my friends in my village , a very refreshing game , I would say .
It is a popular English science fiction series and it tells the story of the adventures of the " Doctor " .
The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and he travels in all of time and space with his companions , who are normally humans . In his experiences he saved whole planets from other bad aliens .
I think Doctor Who is totally different from other science fiction films . It has always done the unthinkable , the impossible , things that no one else has even dreamed of .
Doctor 's travelsmachine is a Policebox ... it is small and blue outside , but it is bigger on the inside .
I like Doctor Who very much . I have always dreamt of travelling everywhere in time and space since I was a little child ! ! !
! If , ( one day ) I have the possibility to do it , I will go to distant galaxies and I will see how the universe began .

The Headmaster had asked his school 's teachers to begin a class in English and she was one of them .
I think that people will live more ecologically .
In The Home of the Future everybody will segregate waste and take care of the environment .
We will also discover flowers that irrigate themselves and machines that walk the dog or wash it when we do not have enough time to do this .
We will all have vacuum cleaners that will dust everything without our knowledge .
If the place where you live is a relatively large city , you will say indeed : " We obviously need public transport ! Everyone knows what happens on the streets in the rush hour ?
Your attitude to public transportation strongly affects the quality of public transport itself .
I mean the timetable punctuality , time interval until the next bus and so on .
Finally , how big the crowds are on the bus or subway car in the rush hour , how convenient it is for you to be there , rather than sitting in your own air - conditioned and perfect looking car .
" Resolution number one : Obviously will lose twenty pounds . Number two : Always put last night 's panties in the laundry basket .
Equally important , will find sensible boyfriend to go out with and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of the following : alcoholics , workaholics , commitment phobic 's , peeping toms , megalomaniacs , emotional fuckwits or perverts .
And especially will not fantasize about a particular person who embodies all these things "
I was always fascinated by this American tradition of making a resolution list .
I had a copybook where I wrote some interesting facts about that remarkable trip for me .
Since then I have been dreaming about collecting my impressions and memories .
As my sister constantly says , " You 're lucky because you have the memory of a goldfish . You remember absolutely nothing . "
In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory ) , I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures .
He recommended me to write in order to apply my English knowledge .
Maybe it 's really time to make a resolution and to begin writing it .
It was a family tragedy when I got a task to write a composition for my literature class .
Humbly and respectfully , I would like to inform you and your organization that I am the appropriate candidate for you .
I have recently finished my undergraduate program .
Which is in sport management and I also have experience of kitchen work .
I have completed a 6 month vocational cookery course .
I am a 24-year - old male , and I love to do challenging tasks .
I am the best candidate for your job to execute high result of excellence .
It will be my great pleasure to work with you and your organization .
If you could give me a chance to work with you and your organization , it would be a great pleasure for me .
The cosmic era , communications , easy access to the Internet - all of these things will become common in the distant future .
For example , the spread of IT technologies will change economics and the financial system .
People will start purchasing all items from the Internet .
New methods of transportation may speed up the delivery to the purchaser 's home and , as a result , it will improve the quality of service .
The new communication networks will transform the whole world into a big village where everyone will be able to contact any person .
The development of space technologies and companies connected to construction of spacecraft may give rise to space tourism .
I believe that public transport does n't have a future because travelling by car is so much more convenient and comfortable .
The seats are more comfortable in a car than in a bus or the underground .
That 's why I prefer travelling by car instead of public transport .
I am very glad to read this good news . It is the first step towards the final result and I will try to do my best to give you useful information for your interview .
Remember this is fundamental for each interview .
Try to be spontaneous and not too sliced .
Maybe you can give some general information about your last job .
I worked on that team more than ten years ago ( new employee recruitment ) and I can guarantee that for the first interview it is important only to make a good impression .
If you do it ( and I 'm sure you will do it ) you 'll receive another appointment .
I hope to have said everything .
This film is about the kidnapping of two little girls .
The man is really frightened and this situation makes him more and more desperate and he can not control his reactions .
In my opinion , it is really exciting , because you are constantly thinking about where the girls are or who could be the kidnaper .
I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller , this thriller is the right one .
We want to know and understand what is happening nowadays and , for this reason , it is important to know what happened before .
Because that can give us a lot of new information about ourselves that we did n't know .
On the one hand , it can be funny to imagine and create the story of how everything happened formerly .
But on the other hand , we can have too much imagination and be disappointed with the truth .
Consequently , there will be constant research into the field of our origins .
I enjoy playing it so much because it 's really challenging .
If you are very good , you can take part in competitions .
There are German championships every year and there is a league , too , where teams of 4 play against each other .
I really ca n't understand why chess is considered to be a sport and skat is n't .
When it comes to helping communities , people have different attitudes towards whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities or not .
Some people think young people spend enough time on helping their communities . However , others disagree with the idea .
Although young people are required to help their communities every week , actually it is still not enough .
It is true that young people are required to help their communities by their schools or companies .
It is also true that these kinds of requirements really work , and many communities are benefited .
Actually , there are many communities that still do not receive enough help , otherwise many social issues and events would not be discussed again and again .
Many factors result in this phenomenon .
The world is becoming more and more competitive . Young people have to spend a lot of time educating themselves to survive in this society .
Young people not only have to spend a lot of time making themselves qualified in one specific subject , they also have to have a wide range of knowledge .
For example , to be outstanding enough to go to the best university , students have to perform well in their curriculum , such as literature and science , they also have to be good at music or doing exercise .
Therefore , they do not have much time to help their communities .
To sum up , the world nowadays makes young people survive by themselves , and they do spend a lot of time helping others .
Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rather thorny .
This is not surprising .
While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the thespian art flourish in England , in Russia it was the very dark and sinister period of Ivan the Terrible 's reign .
So , in Russian print , the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748 .
First translations appeared at the end of the 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actually , because they are translated from German or French and the translators changed the plots as they wanted ( and turned them into tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations , the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia , in the meantime , turns out to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet 's torture completely unbearable ) .
It is close to unbelievable , but at first critics and educated people found Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and narrow - minded people !
But everything changed quite rapidly then .
The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original was published in 1828 .
By 1855 , only six plays had been left untranslated .
It came into fashion and became honorable to translate Shakespeare .
Russian society gradually began to appreciate Shakespeare 's skill at portraying the greatness , depth , and complexity of a human being .
" The sun of Russian poetry " , Alexander Pushkin , took English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare .
In the poetical drama Masquerade by another famous Russian poet , Mikhail Lermontov , we clearly read Othello 's features .
And these are like branches on the tree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Since that time , Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists .
We love his simplicity and veracity . We adore his multiplicity and imagination . We appreciate his straightness and audacity . We prize his delicacy and his sense of humour , of course !
I got cold feet . I could n't understand what was happening .
All in all , he apologized and in the end , everything was resolved .
Hello , my name is Sebastian and I will talk about Azul Historico , which is a restaurant in Mexico City .
The restaurant is on Isabela Católica number 30 , suburb Centro Historico in Mexico City .
Azul Historico is a different restaurant and is located on the patio of an old building in the zocalo . The type of architecture of the place is colonial and between the tables are some trees , and these trees shade the diners when they are eating .
When you are eating you can see some birds that are in the trees , so it makes this restaurant unusual and different than others .
The service is good , the waiters serve excellently , the food is delicious , but some periods of the year the place is full of people and you need a reservation or to wait a long time for a table .
The cost of the restaurant dishes is expensive and is around 150 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to choose the three best dishes of the place but these three are some of the best typical dishes in Mexico : the " Cochinita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carne Enchipoclada " .
" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to choose the meat ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deer meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chille chipotle with potatoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dish and you need to choose one of the three types of meat that I mentioned , but this is accompanied by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating from Oaxaca and the last dish is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexico .
If you want a different and unique restaurant , you must go to Azul Historico , because it has delicious food , sometimes has regional music and the service is excellent .
If we consider the potentiality of this means of communication , the television would be one of the most important inventions of this last century .
On the other hand , despite the numerous documentaries , news and cultural programs which are broadcast every day , another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of so - called rubbish TV , which has been impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children .
Furthermore , I should probably mention the enormous number of advertisements that people are forced to watch every single day once they have switched on this box .
In my opinion , the real problem of this potentially useful tool is the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication .
As a matter of fact , viewers are not able to decide the script , but they can still decide to switch the television off .
Over the past years , humans have renewed and improved scientific progress and this causes a big change in the life of every day .
First , technology has radically changed the daily life of a simple family : a computer seems to be necessary and in every house there is more than one TV .
Conversely , with the latest medical discoveries , doctors are able to treat many of the world 's diseases .
Finally , with the exploitation of new renewable energy , humans have an infinite source of energy .
Well , there are a lot of different opinions , but I do not agree that the effects of scientific progress may be dangerous for the individual .
I am writing to apply for the position of floor manager in your large department store .
As you can see on my CV , which I enclose with this letter , I have studied International Trade and have a degree in Economics and Marketing with high grades from the London Economics School during four years .
I did a Master 's in Business Management in the prestigious University of Harvard .
Also , I have a degree in IT from the Google University . I did that course online .

Nowadays there are a lot of different forms of conditioning that deeply influence people so that they feel the need to buy specific brands of items , object , cars and so on .
For example , every day we are invaded by facts from news on TV but it very often happens that some information is left in the background , whereas less important information is broadcast in its place .
For this reason , I think that every day we are continuously surrounded by information , news , advertising so that we do n't have enough time to think what is really important and what we really need in our life and we can all be influenced very easily .
I am writing to you regarding your advertisement for a job in the USA , called USA SUMMER CAMPS .

The film I would like to review is an old film I 've always enjoyed : Young Frankenstein directed by Mel Brooks in 1974 .
This comedy , entirely shot in black and white , is a parody of the classical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of those films based on Mary Shelley 's better - known book , and presents a lot of elements that give this film a really hilarious mark .
The performance of Gene Wilder , as the main character Dr Frankenstein , Marty Feldman , as the hunchbacked assistant Igor ( pronounced eye - gore ) , and the other members of the cast is amazing and has made Young Frankenstein one of the top comedies of all time .
I am writing because I would like to attain the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) .
Yours faithfully
Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?
It has its own rules , tools and people who are specialized in it .
We need music most of the time or even every single day , to enrich our days with happiness and joy , and also to melt away sorrows or depression that can affect us and prevent us from doing our best .
It has many branches and types . Some are traditional : owned by any part of the world , and the other international types that all people throughout the world share .
The traditional or local music of a certain area has its thumb print on the people in that part of the world .
And the instruments used in that local music may vary from one sort to another .
For example , In Northern Sudan , people have been using the " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .
Internationally , the kinds of music are many . However , most of them share the same instruments .
In particular , the piano is a universal instrument that is used by many musicians as a primary controller of the rhythm of the orchestra .
Last but not the least , music is a sort of treatment for those who are suffering , so , regardless of its type or nationality , it 's a kind of medicine for the soul .
The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods like the inquisition . Knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies , since knowledge through books had become a threat to their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .
Although some ideas were maintained , ( for instance , the astronomy of Galileo Galilei ) , the book - burning caused a delay in knowledge because , if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the movable type printing press by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) because it gave access to knowledge , recovering significant books by Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues could spread their ideas to more people who were becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .
In addition , it produced collective readings through the ecclesiastical method , with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in books to all social classes .
On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet , in which access to knowledge is easier and faster , leaving aside books .
People die , but books never die " , it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time , taking into account that knowledge revolution is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the spread of the information . For instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
Nonetheless , with the invention of the movable type printing press , knowledge was different for the access to it .
If one book was burned , there were ten books more without restriction .
In contrast , nowadays , books are not necessary at all , because the internet facilitates knowledge even more .
Nowadays what we most need is to find ways to prevent childhood obesity because nowadays it is a very common sickness that attacks more and more children every day , causing them to feel bad about themselves .
According to the CDC , the percentage of children aged 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years in the United States .
This means that in the past three decades , obesity has more than doubled in children , same that had diseases just like diabetes , asthma , cardiovascular risk factors , mental health disorders and musculoskeletal problems .
This disease is not just about all the physical and health consequences that sufferers have , but also the mental ones .
The best way we can prevent childhood obesity is by recommending all families a special doctor that can help them to give a safe life to their children .
Nutritionists are specialists that know a lot about all the types of sickness that can attack children and even the ones that will kill them .
Giving them the opportunity to take care of you and your situation will change all your life in a good way .
So it seems that these people can live happily and peacefully , without problems , but this is not true .
In fact , especially in rich families , the children are in trouble with their parents , above all when they have parents who are separated .
I have little cousins and sisters so I 'm very good with kids . I 've experienced all kinds of situations , so I think they wo n't be a problem for me .
As I said before , I have young cousins and we meet on Saturdays so I need to think of activities and games to keep them entertained .
I 'm an outdoors person , so I will be very happy with the accommodation . I would be very thankful to work for you if you decide to accept my application .
I have seen your advertisement on the internet and I would like to apply for the post as activity coordinator .
I am 16 years of age and , due to having a sister , I really like working with children and also know their interests well . I have enjoyed and practised swimming since I was eight years old and I have also won some competitions , so I believe that I am suitable for the job .
My reason for applying for this position is that I am good at combining my experience of swimming with my broad knowledge of the countryside , which I think will be interesting for the children .
Today , human civilisation is changing at a higher speed than any time in the past .
If this will also be the case in our future , then I think that today we underestimate our future .
I am only sure about one thing : technologies will have a more important place in our lives .
Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that will solve all our problems .
Maybe by doing this we will be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
That morning his , grandmother had gone to the hospital because she had to have an operation and she told him to buy some magazines for her , because at the hospital she 'd be bored and she could n't get out of bed for a few days .
So Peter went home to get his wallet , but before that he decided to take a nap because he was tired , so he started to sleep , but it ended up that he slept for over 3 hours and his mother started calling him on the telephone and she was really angry because he forgot to buy the magazines for his grandmother .
So he woke up and looked at his watch and knew that he had to buy them immediately or his mother would be even more angry than before .
Unfortunately , the hospital was already closed to visitors , so he had to wait until the next morning .
But I do n't think that in ten or twenty years scientific progress will be able to produce this type of transport , so we should imagine something simpler .
And how will our way of travelling change ?
Transport will also respect the environment and nature .
Scientists have been able to provide , in recent years , new means of transport , from cycles , to motorcycles , motorcars , trains , metros , which have been used to arrange and accomplish complete public transportation networks throughout a country , and sometimes extend it beyond another country 's border by agreement between those countries .
Many people say that they prefer using their own cars , but they are being forced to use public transport for many reasons , such as , the complications they face with the driver 's license , in addition to the high cost of fuel .
Let 's not forget the hard times during cold weather , especially in winter , while going to the bus stops , or their low chances of having a good place to sit . Maybe there is another important reason that raises private transport 's score compared to public transport , which is molestation .
Moreover , I went to Vilnius primary school and invited schoolchildren to come to the concert .
I had to make one hundred invitation cards .
It was a very good and useful experience .
I gained a lot of experience while organizing the event .
Also , I learned that you have to be very enthusiastic and self - confident because finding the sponsors for a concert is quite a difficult task . I liked that the teacher trusted me .
I did everything by myself because everyone had something to do on their own .
I hope that I will use this experience in my future .
And now I can easily speak about many shopping facilities in my city .
If you have enough money for Kiev luxury shopping , called ' gold shoppping ' , you 'd better go on Khreshatik Street .
In conclusion , I have to say that in Kiev you can find everything , if you really want to .
Art / Music is less important than science / technology .
In my opinion , technology is becoming more and more important than art and is a necessary part of our lives .
Most people in this world ca n't live without technology .
As soon as we open our eyes every day , we begin to use technology , such as alarms , cell phones and lights .
The more technology we use , the more important it is .
Technology makes it easy to connect with our family , friends and co - workers .
We can talk to our family and friends immediately , which is not limited by space .
However , technology made it easier ten years ago and it has become more common in recent years .
Technology is one important part of our lives which has made life more convenient .
Therefore , we use a calculator to count numbers in a few seconds .
In the old days , we calculated numbers with our brains and that could lead to some mistakes .
Our life has been transformed into an easy life by technology .
It is easier to contract entertainment which can release our stress immediately .
Pressure exists everywhere ; for instance , your boss was angry and shouted at you or you have to carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father - in - law .
When you ca n't breathe in your life , you need some entertainment ; for example , you can listened to music on your cellphone or watch some funny videos after all the things that bothered you .
Technology enables us to access entertainment immediately .
Technology has changed our lives in many ways , which brings many advantages for us , such as convenience , making it easy to connect with friends and easier to access entertainment .
In conclusion , in these three premises , I consider that technology and science are more important than art and music .
Science practically improves our lives .
With modern technology , we can see a game which happened on the opposite side of the earth .
However , in soccer , every single player touches the ball , even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
The second reason is that soccer involves all players participating in the game .
Can we say these players participated in the game ?
If somebody wanted to play soccer , I would recommend that he or she has to do some stretching because soccer is a very active sport , so you always have a possibility to be injured .
We need to respect other sports and other people 's perspectives .
When she came back from school , her parents and all her classmates were hiding in the living room and waiting for her .
Anna did n't understand what had just happened .
She slept all the day after this big celebration .
For example , in our capital city , Prague , there are many historical buildings like Carl 's Bridge , the Cathedral of St. Vit , the big clock called Orloj , and so many others .
If you prefer to go to the countryside , I can recommend our mountains , Krkonoše , Jeseníky or Šumava .
There there is very beautiful countryside , peace and fresh air .
If you go to south Morava , you should definitely try some wines or the drink called Slivovice .
For example , near Prague is the castle called Karlštejn , where Karel IV lived , or the castle called Buchlovice , which is in the south - east of our country near the city of Uherské Hradiště .
Otherwise , the opportunities for a job here are quite plentiful .
If you would like to ask anything or get to know more information about some place , just let me know .
I am Melina and I am interested in your job vacancy .
In my opinion , we should build a perfect world for them to grow up in a safe and environmentally friendly place .
I have experience of taking care of children .
I have enrolled in different courses about child development and currently I am working as an au pair where I have to speak English .
Although I am very keen on rugby and basketball , during university I took belonged to the badminton club .
English will not be a problem because I know how to communicate with young people .
My favourite sports are gymnastics and martial arts .
I have been doing gymnastics for 4 months and am fascinated with it , I like to be tired from doing stunts , and I also feel very healthy because I exercise daily . If it 's not gymnastics , it 's kung fu .
I like those sports because you need a lot of strength and dedication to get better . I like kung fu weapons and hands - free forms . To do something spectacular in kung fu , you have to do acrobatic gymnastics .
I invited my friends to try these sports and apparently they liked it , many did not because they did not know what it was , but after experiencing it for yourself , you realize that they are very beautiful sports .
I tried to renew my membership twice yesterday and there was an error message both times .
After authorizing my credit card company , I tried to renew it , but again , there was the same error message .
I am waiting for some instructions about what I have to do now to renew my membership .
One more advantage of owning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and caring .
On the other hand , there are a lot of disadvantages to owning a pet in big cities .
Television can be capable of both entertaining and educating at the same time .
Environmental protection for instance , or more practically , the correct use of the water in our houses .
Another example could be represented by first aid activities and so on .
The topics can be easily focused on if we have in mind a model of society where individuals have a central role .
Various contents could have an educative value . For example , those concerning our relationships with others , or our relationship with nature and with different cultures and religions .
All these topics , by using creativity and new technologies , can be dealt with in a way to make them soft and able to entertain .
Here is some basic information about the news .
A charter plane carrying 72 passengers , including players from Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense , crashed near Rionegro , Colombia , according to the country 's civil aviation department .
The civil aviation agency had initially announced that six passengers , three players , two crew members , and one journalist , survived the crash .
I think it is a catastrophe to victims and their families .
To avoid accidents , the government and airline companies have to do something to prevent tragedies .
For example , regularly examination of the condition of airplanes is needed . At the same time , teaching people how to act when facing an emergency .
Next , when you are in a class , focus on what the teacher says , she / he will teach you and give you a clearer understanding about grammar .
And they will also remind you about some key points you did n't understand when you previewed it .
If you do all the things above , I promise your grammar will improve and you 'll master it eventually .
Usually I go there with my friends or colleagues for dinner or lunch .
Surprisingly , they serve it with a half cut bone which is quite fun in itself , even before you taste the dish . The mashed potato is creamy and full of butter .
Try one of the cloudy ciders on tap and you will not be disappointed !
Taking care of our environment is considered , by many of us , one of the most important things in our lives .
Nowadays , in order to have the best for the current and future generations , there are common international ways for individuals to contribute to solving environmental problems .
Recycling is both a popular and an undervalued method .
Everybody knows what separating rubbish into different bins means , but , a large part of society believes that it is not worth doing it if there are people that do not recycle .
Using respective light bulbs , household appliances and any other thing that saves energy is the only way that individuals can help but , it is not effective .
Although an entire town or city contributes to saving energy in their homes , it can not be compared with the waste of energy that industries are responsible for .
In this case , restrictions should be implemented by the government .
Taking everything into consideration , there is a good argument for supporting recycling , which is the following one : the biggest waste of energy takes place in primal resources industries . If we reused all the materials that had already been exploited , we would reduce its costs by at least half .
The chilis restaurant at 123 Street , Toronto , is really a great place to hang out .
The scrumptious food served makes me go back there often . If you want to have a lip - smacking dessert , this is the ultimate place .
Everyone will love the appetizers and main courses served there .
Also , the ambience of the restaurant is marvelous .
Whereas if you are going there to party with friends or watch a game , you get a table in a suitable place . I believe that if we could all go to this restaurant at the end of our course , we will surely have a great time .
For several years , the number of secondhand clothing stores increased and a lot of people use them .
There were many specialists to repair , recycle and collect products in the Edo period .
In 1723 , there were 1182 secondhand clothing stores .
That was just the number of union members , so in fact , there were more secondhand clothing stores in the Edo period .
However , secondhand clothing stores have been increasing in recent years .
There are many secondhand clothing stores now .
The media , also known as mass media , is one of the most powerful means of spreading information .
It gives people the opportunity to get to know what is happening all around the world regarding every issue , such as poverty , occupation , discrimination , suppression of human rights , and so on .
Nowadays , we can easily get information we need through the Internet , in the newspapers , on the TV .
As European citizens , we are surrounded , directly or indirectly , with loads of social problems and issues in Europe , so we have to acquire our right of free access to information privately and randomly in order to stop corruption , to acquire knowledge about our rights .
Nevertheless , today I usually go to the cinema when I really want to watch a particular film .
Nowadays , I try to choose films with good actors or actresses , special scripts and plots , documentary stories or special renowned Directors ' films , like Almodovar , Sanchez Arévalo or Alex de la Iglesia .
On the one hand , comedies are my favourites because I need to laugh when I have finished my work .
Once , I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours . I did not manage to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others did not seem to be valuable for fixed prices .
Second , shopping malls have places full of advertisements and loud songs playing .
He hears different kinds of songs , advertisements for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality .
Finally , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriately .
There are some assistants who , if you ask or even do not ask , start suggesting the best products as well as the most expensive ones to you .
This can make your shopping really annoying , because some types of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of a product .
To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoyable thing , because it takes time , the shops are often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products .
If I were you , I would join the one in the avenue , because of the facilities
I really do hope you get used to the neighborhood .
Football is the most beautiful sport in the world . It 's the dream profession of almost all boys when they are kids . When you play in your neighbourhood , you are playing that you 're Messi , or Cristiano Ronaldo or your favourite player of your team .
But the passion is not only when you are playing football , you can increase your passion by supporting a team in the good times and the bad times , going to the stadium , and when your team achieve glory , you can also feel that , and in those moments , you are the happiest person in the world .
So I invite you to experience the love and passion that you feel when you are playing or watching a football match . And if you share this love with another person , the passion increases a lot , your feelings are at a higher level , in this sport you can feel the glory , and in the next second , you can start to cry because you r team ca n't finish the journey to the championship .
There are lots of interesting sports , but there is normally one that you like the most .
I am talking about dancing , specifically ballet .
I consider it one of the best sporty and cultural activities because you keep fit at the same time as you express yourself making an artwork .
You have to be a disciplined and well - balanced person . That 's it .
Both characteristics will help you in other types of tasks and will improve your future development .
The start is the hardest part , considering that your body is not used to doing this kind of sport . However , once you are into it , everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active .
So , if you are starting it , do n't give up because difficulties arise , just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity .
You will notice how the improvements come without thinking too much .
You must not be on your own , otherwise you can not dance in a company , so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that makes a strong relationship forever .
4 . Everything was kept neatly .
Nothing was found difficult or struggling .
Nevertheless , I would like to improve some skills and although I did very well , I still got confused .
1 . I overthought every so often , because I was not sure if what I was doing was alright .
2 . I should stop thinking in Spanish and think more in English since translating might be confusing .
Choosing a sport to practise is a complicated thing . You should choose something that you enjoy , but at the same time , something you can afford to pay for .
Although you may think that is a dangerous sport , which it can be , the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in the water makes it worth the danger .
If you are going to start doing it , I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor .
Nowadays , people are aware of environmental problems and they will try to figure out solutions .
For example , all future houses will use solar cells to produce electricity .
Moreover , there will be important technological advances in our lives , like intelligent mobile phones which can help us with day - to - day tasks .
They will check your empty fridge and if you run out of any vegetables , your mobile phone will warn your supermarket and they will bring them .
To conclude , it is impossible to argue against the fact that people 's lives will change in the next years , but these changes will help to improve our environment and our daily life .
It is often said , that shopping is a pleasant activity , but sometimes it becomes bothersome .
However , there are situations we do not find enjoyable at all .
I will mention some of the reasons why and times when shopping can be unenjoyable .
Shopping may cause frustration , mainly when we have to squeeze through the crowd .
Secondly , shopping definitely become unenjoyable when we are not able to find products we want and desire .
Also , overspending .
Nevertheless , people try to save money by every conceivable means .
To conclude , we have to know when and to which shop we should go to avoid stressful and not enjoyable situations .
Researchers have proved that human activities such as industrialization , deforestation etc . can trigger global warming .
In this essay I will be highlighting some of the dangers of climate change and different ways through which governments and individuals may help to overcome this challenge .
One of the most obvious effects of global warming is the depletion of the ice at the North & South Poles , in turn causing the sea level to rise and encroachment of land .
These phenomena cause serious damage to ecosystems and sea life .
Further , continuous rising temperatures are impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters .
There is scientific evidence that disasters like Katrina and Hud - Hud can be linked to global warming .
Governments can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints .
For example , governments can impose limits on emissions produced by manufacturing plants and force industries to help with reforestation .
Individuals can also play their part in controlling global warming .
For example , individuals can reduce the use of plastic materials , use public transport to control emissions , recycle waste etc .
Governments & individuals both have a role to play in facing this the biggest challenge of the time the Earth is facing .
I have two kids ; one is 8 years old and the other one is 10 years old , so I have plenty of experience with kids .
My tasks there were working with children of all ages to organise events , sports activities and evening activities . I also helped with cleaning the centre , helping in the kitchen with cooking and working closely with clients and customers in our Café .
It would be a great experience for me to work so close to the countryside .
Yours faithfully ,
Michael is an editor for an international student magazine .
He held a short story competition to improve students ' writing .
When I saw that message , I was excited about persuading my friends to enter this competition .
I thought , no matter who wins the competition , we all must get 1 dollar as a prize .
But my friends were not interested in that competition , they thought writing was boring and getting 1 dollar was small .
Finally , they copied my article for this competition .
When he read the contents of the article , he discovered many of them were similar .
Academic culture refers to the attitudes and values that are shown by the people who work or study at universities .
After I joined ACU ( Australian Catholic University ) , I found vast differences in teaching methods between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal , students study individually and do not ask questions of the tutor even if they are confused .
Meanwhile , Australian education is based on making students learn new skills .
Students need to take active participation in discussion with their peers .
Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement .
It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks .
According to Hamp ( 2002 ) , the goal of an EAP ( English For Academic Purpose ) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree .
It helps to share ideas and knowledge , among students and make them think critically , by using formal language while writing , and so on .
In conclusion , the adoption of the Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning .
I have become an independent learner and started to raise questions and share my opinion with the tutor .
In the future , I will improve my learning strategies by working actively in groups .
I want to talk about a restaurant called " Bierkeller "
It 's a restaurant located in Villa General Belgrano , Cordoba and its speciality is German food .
The restaurant is beautiful , it 's of a normal size , with a lot of space and very well decorated , you have many photos and paintings to look at .
People at the restaurant are very kind , they treat you in a very polite way and it is worth going there
If we go to Bierkeller , we wo n't regret it and we will have a great time trying different types of food , learning maybe a little bit of the history of the town and being happy as a group
Almost everybody has at some time thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but do we really know all the advantages and disadvantages that it entails ?
On one hand , a large proportion of the global population consider this year off a way of learning and gaining experience while you enjoy travelling all around the world and you get to know people from all the different cultures .
Nowadays , employers are looking for experienced people who know how to adapt to all the different situations they could be involved in , such as an international lecture or a difficult plight .
It is also said that at the time of heading to college , those people who have taken a year off are the ones who have least difficulties learning and relating with other students because they have got used to it before .
It is a fact that those who spend a year abroad working on something can save money for university and they become more independent .
But taking a year off has its downsides as well , like the time people waste working on something they are not going to do in the future , because with any kind of extracurricular studies , people strangely find a good job .
That is why it is recommended to wait until you finish university to look for a job .
Another fact that should be highlighted is that while you are working for a year , people of your age are at university , and that means that they will probably finish their degrees a year earlier than you , and this could be an inconvenience for you , because you will have to have classmates who are a year younger .
Many automobile companies are working for a new future of automobiles .
For many years , Apple , Google and several traditional automakers have been running prototypes which drive by themselves and nobody needs to steer the car .
The question arises if driverless cars will be a boon or a bane to us ?
At the moment , people who have got a handicap can not drive a car by themselves .
This has a devastating effect on their independence and living freely .
When these people can drive a self - driving car , they feel more comfortable and they can live more freely .
However , it is also important to remember that people with a handicap have got the same rights and opportunities as people without a handicap .
The automobile companies have to work on a plan so that self - driving can be bought by people from the middle class too .
When this happens , self - driving cars will be an enrichment in our lives .
The Reading museum in Berkshere has visitors from all age groups , but is particularly suitable for young people who need help with school projects or want to take up creative things as a hobby .
They have a number of workshops for young people from beginner to semi - professional , and most of those are not so expensive .
You can learn various interesting such as painting , photography , ceramics , from the lifework professionals .
Their lunch menus are gorgeous and the prices are reasonable .

introduction :
As requested , I have investigated the features of the main means of transport which are used in my local area .
These are very cheap and people who do not have a car use them to go everywhere . However , this mode of transport is not so comfortable , because sometimes you have to travel with lots of people .
People use their cars for travelling a long or short distance . This is really comfortable because you can manage the speed and where you will direct .
If you are not keen on travelling by bus and you do not want to get the car out of the garage , taxis may be the best option .
These are a combination of buses and your own car .
Conclusion
I believe that there should be more buses for the convenience of people .
There are several options to choose from , but the choice depends on each individual .
My advice to people who want to play football is to be passionate , to like and feel football .
And for those who like football but are scared of getting injured , they still have the opportunity to watch games on TV and play video games .
During summer it is common to see many people in parks practising sports , like running , cycling , or just doing every kind of physical activity .
So , when I wake up every morning , also pushed because I am a very active person , I get such motivation to go out and do something .
But , I do n't only do sports in summer , because in winter I also do fun sports , like skiing , snowboarding , and Ice skating , among others .
So , when my friends ask me which is my favourite sport , a problematic decision comes to my mind , simply because I like them all .
If you want to do this sport , you can simply take a pair of sneakers and any light sportswear , and start to run anywhere .
Nonetheless , if you really want to get into this sport as a pro , you can invest a lot in clothing and gadgets .
Nevertheless , once you start to go running , and want to really get into it , and improve , I do recommend you to take care of your health and to find professional assistance .
Injuries may happen as a result of doing it often if you do not know the way you run , or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistance that your body needs , for example .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The relationship between famous people and journalists is an attractive focus in our society .
Famous people need love , family , entertainment and support .
As we all know , technology is making life better .
Society is growing and as it grows it gets more used to technology being everywhere .
They just prefer to travel long or short distances in individual vehicles , known as cars .
This is because technology has given us this opportunity , and as time goes by , more and better modifications are made to cars .
This is happening now , and we are not even fully developed in technology .
The clients benefit from professional coaches , who train them in order to perform the exercises correctly .
There are appliances such as treadmills , bikes , weightlifting and many others .
You should build one to improve the popularity of your leisure club .
Those people who use the spa can benefit from treatments of the highest quality .
However , their children do not have a special place , so it is recommended you arrange a safe place for them to play .
I hope that my report helped you and Active Leisure Club will improve its facilities .
There are plenty of choices ; novel , historical , drama or comedy .
But something happens unexpectedly and the new chapter is completely different to what you had imagined .
In my opinion , a good book has to have surprise , has to have a good plot , a good variety of characters and , as I said , has to involve you .
On this CD , the singer expresses all her feelings and tells us about her experiences during recent years .
Firstly , you can find songs about her children , lack of affection , broken heart and some commercial songs which have interesting lyrics .
People might think that if you buy this type of music , you will waste your money and it is just commercial music .
Time passed and John had an unimaginable inspiration for his experiment .
One night , he went to a party with his colleagues .
He thought it would be good to be distracted for a while .
It was already night when he was at Luck 's house ( Luck was an old friend ) and all of them were talking about life things , but then Luck remembered that John was working on an experiment and he did n't know what it was about , so he asked John in front of everyone :
I heard that you were working on an experiment ! "
When Peter heard that , he was interested in knowing about John 's experiment .
He had the feeling that the experiment could be something vital to human life .
John accepted his help and told him to come to his laboratory .
After four months of hard work , they took the experiment with all the information for inspection .
They decided to design a vertical field to expand the laboratory .
Everything was going very well ; nonetheless , Peter 's intentions changed and became riddle .
Furthermore , the court has walls and the ball can bounce off them .
This letter is in regard to the summer camp job advertised in the newspaper .
I would like to work as a volunteer in the upcoming summer camp in Arizona which you are organizing from 20th March to 30th March .
I am a 32-year - old Computer Science graduate currently working as a software consultant .
So I would like to take this opportunity to work as a volunteer .
With my experience as a teaching assistant , I can easily handle young kids and keep them busy learning . I follow a lot of sports channels on TV during my free time and that helps me with setting up the rules for the sports activities and ensuring they are organized well .
It gives me great pleasure to help kids with their activities and teach them through play .
It makes me feel content that I am contributing to society by participating in the tasks that shape their future .
Having an energetic and cheerful attitude , I would like you to consider me as the best fit for the camp volunteer and accept my application .
Faithfully ,
In my opinion , public transport has been improved over the last years , because cities have been putting a lot of investment into it .
In big cities , such as New York , the main public transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
I do not agree with the idea that there is no future for public transport , because it is a perfect means of transport for commuters and , nowadays , a lot of people are conscious of global warming and the environment , and refuse to use the car every day .
In summary , I think public transport is a good way to get around and the number of users is increasing every day .
If I am not travelling with my parents , I will come to your city .
Nowadays , travelling on public transport is an experience who none has failed .
However , there is now a discussion about what people prefer , public transport or their own vehicle .
There are a lot of benefits to public transport . First , you do n't have to drive yourself , you can listen to music , read a book or whatever you want without having to pay attention to the traffic . It is true , too , that travelling on this mode of transport helps the government because you have to pay for it , and the majority of modes of transport are cheap enough for everyone .
In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has its own pros and cons , but in my opinion , the difference between both of these is that in the second you choose your own way .
Extremadura is a small place where you can not find many transport types .
First of all , most of the people in Extremadura use a car for going to work , to university or school .
When you use a car , you do not have to think about timetables and you do n't have to pay for expensive tickets for travelling .
However , I think that this mode of transport has some disadvantages . For instance , if there are a lot of cars in a small city , pollution will increase and the environment will be damaged .
Also , if a city is small , people should walk to different places since everything is near to their houses .
Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that Extremadura 's roads need a big repair programme because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive on it .
In Extremadura , the second most used mode of transport is the bus .
On the one hand , there are buses that connect the various neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them .
On the other hand , there are buses for travelling long distances .
Last year , the mayor changed the old buses for new buses without increasing the prices .
Finally , in Extremadura , the least used mode of transport is the train .
Hello , dear guests ! We are glad to see you in our city . I want to tell you about interesting places in my city .
We are in Moscow . It is a very big city , so there are many interesting places where I usually do some activities .
That 's why I decided to tell you about an interesting place in our city .
In the summer , it is a place where you can play volleyball in the special court with sand , play ping - pong , or if you are tired , you can sit in a special hammock .
Guys should not go snowboarding .
I think it is a good place for other activities .
I would prefer to eat lighter dishes , like vegetables with rice .
Supper always comprises sandwiches .
, later I took my degree in Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures , starting my to and from England to improve my skills .
While studying at University , my idea was to move to the UK to work there , but I got married so I could n't realize my dream !
I found myself teaching English in my country , far from the language competence I longed for .
Nearly every institution will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
First of all , before discussing this question , it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same course and at the same school .
Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
In addition , on placement , the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .
In a natural work pattern , you have to do , like school , your tasks , but the communication is also an important part of it .
This important way of communicating is lacking at school , because it 's a nearly a one - directional way of communication from the teachers .
While on placement , they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
However , public transport has been criticised more and more in recent years because of its inconvenience .
Therefore , buses do not run as frequently or regularly as they used to .
Especially in the countryside , public transport is no alternative to cars , due to the lack of frequency .
Consequently , people prefer taking the car .
Firstly , because they gain independence by doing that .
It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is leaving .
In addition , the car is also more convenient in terms of timing .
Furthermore , ticket prices have been increased rapidly in recent years .
Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car .
Nevertheless , public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car .
Sitting on the bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
Finally , it still provides a useful way of travelling for all who do n't have a driving licence .
The purpose of this report is to inform you about how the city of Granada takes care of the environment .
Granada can be considered a clean city in regard to rubbish treatment .
And there is a big university community involved in recycling .
Clean Infrastructures
As has been said , Granada has a decent public transport system and now it is being improved by adding a metropolitan train .
However , Granada can not be considered as cycle - friendly . There are fewer cycling lanes than in other cities of a similar size .
In addition , the old town is not as involved as it should be in clean behaviour , it being the university that make the biggest effort .
I consider that Granada scores 6.5 out of 10 for taking care of the environment .
The most interesting place in my town is obviously the Big Castle .
When you get to the highest tower , you will see the most breathtaking view .
It is a place where you can always find lots of tourists and foreigners .
When the weather is good enough , close to the castle take place many kinds of parties and entertainments .
Unfortunately , tickets are expensive but they are worth buying . I also strongly recommend you to see all the places around the Big Castle such as the Town Museum or Folk village .
Tomorrow , I 'm going to visit my grandparents in Galicia .
It 's a long trip but it does n't matter because I 've good friends there and I want to spend some time with my grandparents , David and Gema .
Regarding my preferences , I would like to admit that the silent genre has conquered me .
Of course , the unprepared viewer ca n't understand the inner beauty of this genre and will choose something mediocre .
However , simplicity in some cases can be very good and smart .
I do n't enjoy melodramas or love stories much , but they should be paid attention to .
In my opinion , very few people use movies for broadening the mind .
That day was a terrible day for Michael . He woke up and felt totally exhausted after an overwhelming birthday party .
His mom was disappointed about that , too .
He did not answer at all , besides , he hit the chair near her , and unfortunately , that chair hit her in a serious way .
She could not even yell a word , just looked at him disappointedly .
The aim of the site is to get together people interested in cars .
On this network you create a profile of your car , write a list of improvements you have made to it , upload photos and movies about your car and , of course , you meet a lot of people with the same interests .
So they often need the help of professionals .
I think that it is necessary to involve some professional mechanics to give advice to users .
The other website I often use is Google.com , because it is the greatest search engine ever created by human beings .
I think it is better than other search engines because it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing extra .
I think that many google users will be happy if the developers bring more useful information to the main page , for example , weather information , currency rates or hot news .
Moreover , google map service needs some improvements , such as street names , map accuracy and more city panoramas .
I hope your arrival was successful and you have been enjoying our town .
Your group will see many well - known monuments of architecture , which you will admire .
There , you will be able to find out a lot of information about the history of Moscow and Russian rulers .
I hope you will enjoy seeing this place and become really excited by this excursion , seeing the great architectural monuments
I enclose my CV for your information .
I have had extensive experience working face - to - face with customers .
I have worked two years for a well - known coffee franchise and previously for three years in a famous patisserie as an assistant chef , which has given me varied skills , like the ability to work with many different types of people and an extensive knowledge of cooking .
I am a conscientious person who works hard and pays attention to detail . I am flexible , quick to pick up new skills , and eager to learn from others .
I have lots of ideas and enthusiasm and I am available to work long hours .
I am keen to work for a company with a great reputation , like Green Pepper Cafe .
Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the future .
My brother only has one child , but my grandfather has four children .
My grandfather had to work hard to support his children through additional jobs .
They had no money they could spend on entertainment .
Nowadays , every child can get more and more resources from their parents because of less competition with other children .
These kinds of places can make parents comfortable and able to concentrate on their children 's care .
On the other hand , the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system .
This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care for their children .
That being said , I still feel that the reasons I have presented are strong ones , such as more resources and infrastructure .
Having a healthy lifestyle is one of the most important things for our health , because it reduces the chances of getting sick and it gives you the energy and concentration you need .
Eating according to a schedule is a very important tip you should take into consideration , and also , trying to avoid fried meals or fast food .
Unhealthy food and neglecting physical exercise increase the chances of getting fat and having problems with your heart , liver and other organs .
Fruits , vegetables and water
Your body requires many types of vitamins in order to function properly . These are found in fresh or boiled vegetables and fruits .
They help your immune system , and your skin and will also give you the amount of energy you need throughout the whole day .
Another thing you should take into consideration if you want to live a long happy life is doing physical exercise , such as walking in the park , going to the gym or playing team sports .
Besides that , you should also sleep between 8 - 10 hours per night , so that your body can function effectively .
-eat fruits and vegetables
-drink alcohol excessively
In conclusion , you do n't have to make a lot of effort to have a healthy lifestyle and there are plenty of benefits from it .
You will feel great , concentrate better , have more energy and have fewer health problems .
I am writing in connection with the advertisement for a job in the USA SUMMER CAMPS .

Thus , the state makes no effort to fight it . Transportation now is very overcrowded and difficult , especially in the rush hour when people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock . The main reason for that is the increasing number of people in our country ( housing problems ) and the result of that is a lot of accidents have happened and a lot of people have died .
According to a study published by the journal " American Journal of Medicine Brevintev " in August / August next that there is more public transport in cities where the population has become leaner and healthier .
The U.S. researchers from two universities in the state of Pennsylvania and the Foundation " Rand " American research and development staff to monitor regularly use public transportation or go to work by car in a year .
The study results showed that people who use transportation .
The public decreased their weight by three kilograms on average , compared to people who use a car to travel and the study attributed this result to walking to the bus stop and running to catch the bus in the expected position requires goer public transport more traffic , while this does not happen with motorists .
It appealed to experts in political circles in the United States to invest more money in public transportation and improve security in the ways of the infantry in cities and make them more attractive to encourage people to use public transport .
The supervisor of the study , John M .
MacDonald of the University of Pennsylvania , " investment in public transport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity " .
The transport sector in Arab countries suffers from many shortcomings and poor performance and is a cause of environmental pollution and this is due primarily to a lack of the capacity of public institutions to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately and allocate investments effectively and improve the organizational capacity and result .
So it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate costs and , in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries , public transport systems are still undeveloped and compel people to rely on private cars .
It has been observed , for example , that the increase in the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of severe congestion in urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
The optimistic opinion , some people say that " there is no future for public transport " , saying that the future of public transport is clear and the proof of that is that in ancient , times there was n't any transport and by the time people started to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle , cart , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars to the plane , so they hope that the transportation be best by creative people .
On the other hand , the pessimistic view , in developed countries like Japan and Kuwait we do n't find problems like these because they have good planning , they make routes underground and overground , then they have routes only for people and routes only for cars . Finally , we should have a good plan and the government should care about that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .
I recommend you , too , to visit the castle because it is very interesting .
I 'm not sure which is the most expensive restaurant in my town , maybe there are some near the beach because the tourists normally go there .
In my opinion , a trip will be fascinating because of the fact that the building of the Brewery was originally a German - owned brewery which has been brewing beer for almost 400 years .
It is a good purpose , to see and get to know the place where in Poland is produced a traditional and well - known beer .
I hope you will take it into consideration and go to see our local and famous brewery .
Yours faithfully ,
The Asian restaurant Tian review
For our dinner at the end of the course , I 'd recommend the Asian restaurant Tian .
The atmosphere seems exotic and calming .
The food is really tasty , each bite is an invitation to travel through the senses to far away places in Asia .
Finally , to add one more touch to the experience , you can take a ride in their tuk - tuk .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He got that mysterious look in his eyes .
He just realized how to solve one of the biggest physical challenges mankind has been interested in for ages .
Time is running , seemingly continuously , the same as the second hand on his clock .
But we got this perception just because our eyes can see only a limited number of images in a time period .
If a time period is long enough , like a minute , we can see a strict distinction between one and two .
Peter grabbed his notebook and immediately wrote all this down .
However , some people say that public transport has no future . They might be right . ple do n't like it . They prefer travelling by car .
Considering that companies are now moving to the outskirts of cities and there is a lack of more flexible timetables , some people discount the public transport option .
It is believed that travelling by car is more comfortable and convenient for everyone . Consequently , car manufacturers look on it as a new opportunity to create new hybrid cars in order not to damage the environment .
I personally believe that , because of all this , the public transport will have no future in our society .
She woke up in the morning full of enthusiasm and zest for life .
She was sure that everyone would remember about the celebration and have a gift for her .
She went to school very disappointed .
All of them were waiting for her with lots of gifts in a beautifully decorated room .
In the past , technology was poor and only a few people had a smartphone or a computer .
In the last ten years , technology has made a big jump and , thanks to the Internet , we can search for everything whenever we want .
In the past , it was better than now because grandparents or older people could tell you how to do something for the first time . They could give you some useful advice and you could establish a relationship with them .
Today , everyone knows how everything is easier with technological devices , but it 's sadder because you ca n't share your thoughts with anybody .
For that reason , I think that for me , young people in the past learned a lot from their grandparents and it should be the same today too .
Children are supposed to be the future of their countries , but in Africa , especially in the countries in sub - Saharan Africa , there are many cases of famine - extreme cases , so children have many difficulties .
Unfortunately , this is the sad reality .
Besides that , the lack of food and clean water are responsible for many diseases , which are responsible for a large number of deaths , because there are n't enough resources to treat the populations .
Here we have some of them : anemia/ anemia ; rickets and malnutrition …
The principal cause of famine in Africa is the ethnic conflicts , which cause wars , the decrease of fertile land and the use of ground only to produce monoculture to export .
At that moment , he understood that the mayor was going to build a big motorway there , next to the river .
Suddenly , he thought that the workers would cut down all the trees , and the squirrels would lose their refuges , so he thought that he had to do something immediately .
He wrote a letter to the town hall explaining the situation and asking them to stop the construction .
Firstly , the primary cause of bushfire is human activities .
The lack of a sense of civic responsibility leads easily to bushfire .
For instance , some people discard cigarettes or matches which are unattended , like barbeques or campfires .
In addition , in many developing countries , unemployment they also migrate to forest and set fire to enhance cultivated surface .
Bushfire is caused by numerous human activities but also started by the carelessness of people ( Roland as cited in Schauble , 2009 )
On Thursday I went with my family to Strasbourg Cathedral .
It 's big with many activities .
On Friday morning we did canoeing and paddle boating on the small river that ran along beside the center and in the evening we went to a restaurant .
She measures about 30 centimetres .
The lesson did not go very well ; she was interested in other dogs and she was not listening .
It was perfect . She jumped sixty centimeters .
The Alhambra gives you this opportunity !
The Alhambra is a group of palaces , gardens and fortresses built by Muslims and occupied by them for over four centuries .
Its true attractiveness , in addition to the decoration which is at the pinnacle of Andalusian art , is also its location , which is unique .
You will be impressed by the stunning views which are considered by some people to be the best in the world .
If you are lucky enough to visit this wonderful place in summer , I recommend you attend the Granada International festival of Music and Dance , which is celebrated in Genelalife 's gardens , where you can enjoy amazing artists and orchestras in an unrivalled setting .
The graphic information presented in the flow chart illustrates the procedure regarding the making of bank notes , which can be sorted into 6 main phases .
At the beginning , the format of the notes should first be designed considering the background color and security issues .
At the same time , skilled machinists prepare the metal plates in order to set up a fixed mould .
The most significant procedure is called inspection , which means manual checking by special machines and staff , and then they are classified into 3 different categories , including good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets , and bad sheets .
In the final stage , the well - produced sheets are packed and distributed to each branch , while the damaged ones are safely disposed of .
Namely , Design , Preparation of metal plates , Printing , Inspection , Packaging and Distribution and Disposal .
When you need bank notes , the first thing you should do is to design what aspects of information you want .
Afterwards , you are able to print the sheets of bank notes ( 50 bank notes per sheet ) .
The most significant part of the
process is inspection , where the printed sheets are
If they are not very good , we can destroy them securely . However , a few sheets may be partially damaged . That does n't matter due to the fact that further separation will assist you with getting rid of the wrong sheets .
Overview . It is clear that the process of making bank notes begins with Design and ends with Disposal or Distribution .
Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable .
This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances , but on long journeys , that will be very uncomfortable .
Travelling in your own car is much more comfortable .
There is the possibility to set up your seat .
It is your own decision when you get up , because there are no time limitations .
There is the risk that you will not get the connecting bus and , so , you are stressed .
In conclusion , travelling by car is the easiest and best way . I think that it is not possible to use public transport , because there are no buses or trains .
Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport .
There are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans .
As a result , there is a debate about whether educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing a field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement , with qualifications , for the following reasons .
Admittedly , some of the research needs investment in many resources that educational institutions can not afford .
Educational institutions should dissuade students .
However , if there is not a lack of resources for the field of study , educational institutions should support students in their field of study .
In addition , students , in the course of research , may create serendipity .
Like Alexander Flrming Alexander , the inventor of antibiotics , discovered Penicillin accidentally from research into the germ .
The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility into a possibility .
Therefore , educational institutions should encourage students attempting research which is unlikely to succeed .
Remember when in school you learned the three essential things for living ; reproduction , nutrition and interaction ?
Well , humans have become more and more sedentary with the passage of time and have forgotten about interaction and movement .
I might not have the typical sportswoman body type , but I really enjoy doing sport and feeling the glory of movement .
Apart from obviously having fun and socialising , the way you feel after running and burning feels really good .
Personally , I think the best time to come is in the summer .
Because at this time we have a lot of interesting activities like concerts , festivals and so on .
Thanks also for your invitation to join the group .
I will be able to show you and your friends the most interesting places in my area .
When I was in high school , I loved to go to different kinds of activities .
So , having good time - management has become important in my studies .
However , instead of focusing on my studies , I paid more attention to rehearsals .
At that moment , I felt regretful and frustrated .
From that experience , I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for successful studying .
Therefore , I avoided social activities during the exam period .
As Academic skill Unit ( 2012 ) states , a daily , weekly and semester planner can be beneficial for organizing our time ( P.22 ) .
In my case , I planned the activities into a proper timetable , because the planners clearly show me an outline of the near future .
Without a doubt , this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility for my own learning .
More significantly , I understand that time - management and planning are crucial in academic life .
Football : The most incredible sport in the world
It 's a great party and we can have real fun watching a football game even if it 's on television .
If you want to start practising this sport , you have to get fit and run a lot because you have got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
The aim of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in my town and make recommendations to try to encourage tourists to visit the shops .
Some of the information was collected from the shops , and from the web .
According to the investigation , the majority of the shops are in two areas ; Firstly the Puerto shopping center , it is located in Puerto Marina , and the the shops on offer are mainly fashion , coffee shops and pubs .
The other big commercial area is in the city center , with a more varied offer : fashion , bars , supermarkets , local food shops , wine shops etc ....
Alternatively , every Friday in the parking lot next to Tivoli World , there is a street market where you can find every kind of product : local products , food , CDs , DVDs , etc ....
In light of the results , I feel it would be to our advantage if we did promotions of the city center as a good destination .
In conclusion , the tourist office should have more adverts for the city center .
I was stunned by her words and became speechless for a moment .
Let me introduce myself . I am Luis from Spain and I work as a civil engineer in a Spanish infrastructure company called Acciona .
I completely agree with you , maybe each word you say .
My company is making redundancies and I am always worried about that .
The point is that I completely focus on my projects , so I spend ten hours every day making a tremendous effort with my budgets , trying to increase profits and I am doing well .
I manage risky projects and , eventually , I get high revenues .
Most of the islands are suitable for snorkelling , so if you are going to snorkel , you will have the chance to see many different types of marine organisms like corals , fish and shells .
There are also many historical buildings in my country .
As you know , my country is made up of different races , so there are many different traditional foods in my country , so you can try different cuisines like banana leaf rice and hainanese chicken rice .
There are many interesting films with valuable plots and famous actors .
Most of them are extremely interesting and worth seeing .
My favourite actor is Tom Cruise and , consequently , the best film I have ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he plays the starring role with his ex - wife Nicole Kidman .
I was impressed by the production because of its valuable plot .
They both go through a lot of difficulties and live a poor life .
The aim of the two characters was to win a piece of land in America .
They take part in a competition riding horses .
Only the fastest competitors were given the land .
The historical context is recreated in the film .
Most people in Bali rely too much on their private vehicles , hence they have totally abandoned public transportation .
They say , " there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In order to do that , there will need to be a huge transformation .
Aside from a great blue - print of a well - organized transportation system , which covers a good 25 to 50 years ' planning , it also involves local culture .
It is definitely a hard job to do if we want to change people 's culture .
The consciousness that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live in should be raised first .
People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling on a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to having two to four of them trapped in a car . In other words , one mass transportation means against twelve or more cars on the same road .
The next is an understanding of what we can do for the environment by changing our transportation means .
The world is constantly changing and technology is advancing fast .
This affects people 's lives considerably , so we can say that in 50 years , the lifestyle will be completely different to what we have today .
We can say that 50 years ago we had not thought of having the technology that currently exists , such as the Internet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Also , the lifestyle was completely different ; the industry had not developed technology that now allows you to be more efficient and many people did work that can now be done by a few of them .
So , if technology continues to advance as it has done until now , our lifestyle will change too .
Perhaps in 50 years more , we will live in a world where technology makes our life much easier , but at the same time , we will be depending on it .
I was very surprised to hear that you want to spend your year off from university in my country and I am also extremely flattered .
I would recommend a job as a waitress because you do n't need much experience , and I know you do n't have any , and if you get a job in the summer as a result , you 'll be at the beach most of the time and you can spend the rest of the year visiting other places .
It 's one of the most beautiful castles , in my opinion , and it represents the most important thing this country is known for , and that is Dracula .
Another attraction which is a unique one is " the merry cemetery " . It is famous for the colourful paintings on the tombstones describing , in a very original way , the people buried there and their lives .
The first reason is that I have already studied there three years ago and it was a wonderful experience . I met very nice people from all over the world . I improved my English level thanks to very skilled teachers and I really enjoyed my stay in Oxford .
The second is a pragmatic reason . I have a five year degree and I worked for two years in a medical devices company but now I am unemployed .
In Italy , it is quite hard to find a job at the moment and I want to try work experience in the UK , but it is necessary to become more confident with my English and that is what I hope to obtain from the IELTS course .
I already know that it could be tough , especially to be far from my family and my girlfriend , but it is something that I feel could be right for me , and for my career .
However , as countries develop and the economy grows and life changes , people change and standards of living change too . The factors that lead people to have their own car are dependent on and limited to several factors . There are also factors such as social and financial conditions that tend to influence people to have their own car instead of travelling by public bus / train . We should also consider the conditions of roads , access and traffic , giving people an opportunity to chooses to travel in their own car or on public transport . In some countries , there are separate lanes dedicated to public transport which help and ease the traffic in conditions of heavy traffic . With traffic technology solutions , owning a car is always better .
Another factor we should consider is the public transport stops on the way to destinations , which require planning and catching public transport to avoid late arrival at your destination .
The subject , no future for public transport is ambiguous as the advantages and disadvantages are both consider on .
There are many shops around the town . For example , we have one where children can make teddy bears while the parents can see them from the restaurant ; many children said that it was the best place in the world .
For adults , we have a little old museum where you can live one day like sixty years ago . So , if you have never been in one , you should go , because it does not cost very much . Besides , the museum has a kindergarten for the kids .
Apart from that , the town is near the beach , and there we have many restaurants where you can eat while you are watching the waves on the sea .
Our personal recommendation is the " Sir Hotel " . It is a muddy hotel because many years ago it was a castle , and you can sleep in the king 's bed and every night it has theatre , where you can take a part in a play .
As you can see in the attached CV , I have experience working with children of different ages .
In addition , for the last three years , I have been a volunteer at my tennis club , where I have developed different skills to organize activities , sports games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 years old .
Working with children , I have learned to be more patient and , moreover , I am able to motivate them to give the best of themselves .
Also , I have gained communication skills through speaking with the children and the families .
Yours faithfully
Public transport is a useful way to commute from place to place , especially in big cities .
Besides its advantages , which are that it is cheap and fast , there are many disadvantages to taking a bus or train , such as time , quality of service , and overcrowding .
It is said that , instead of taking public transport , commuters will travel by car because of its convenience . In my opinion ,
public transport will hardly be replaced by travelling by car .
Secondly , the infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars .
It has been affecting the environment , causing climate change , increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to the increasing demand for using petrol for private cars .
In conclusion , public transport will be an excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the available local transport and possible improvement .
Children often use them to go to school and back , and the older population , with increased problems seeing far away , prefer to use the bus to travel around the city .
Most of them do n't have air conditioning , meaning that in the summer they are tremendously hot , and some have problems with the windows that cause the bus to be extremely cold in winter .
The alternative - Taxis
Taxis are available throughout the city , and can be called by a simple phone message .
Recommendation
There have been rumors of the construction of a Metro in our town .
That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation , since it is fast , is n't affected by traffic , and it is generally cheaper ( since it relies on electricity ) .
I 'll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting to them for sure .
First of all , if they are staying in České Budějovice , they can spend at least three days there sightseeing .
Anyway , they must visit our main square , which has many historical buildings .
There is a huge number of shops in the centre , so what about going shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is very convenient for tourists because they can reach everything on foot .
If the weather is nice , they should definitely take a trip to Kleť .
It 's the biggest hill , where you can go up the lookout tower and it 's not far from České Budějovice .
There is an interesting observatory too , and what 's more , the best restaurant I have ever been to .
They must definitely order the best soup in the world .
There 's a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle located on the big rock .
If you want to know more about the destination , just write me a message or give me a call .
First of all , vehicles designed to carry large numbers of people can not be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megalopolises are suffering because of a surplus of automobiles .
This happens not only because of environmental aspects , but mental aspects as well .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of the average person , who spends most of the time downtown , to replace a car with a bus or an underground train .
Whatever type of journey you take , you would be more likely to prefer to use a train or plane , because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical exertion .
Overall , there are a number of causes for disagreeing with the suggestion that private transport is becoming more and more popular in comparison with public transport .
The only thing that definitely should be changed in the future , is the approach to the usage of cars powered by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Concert Hall , you will find a Japanese restaurant named " Ichiban " . Opened a few years ago , it 's not well known yet , but this does n't prevent it quickly getting busy at lunch time at the weekends .
Although sometimes it might be rather noisy because of the people gathered there , I find its decor quite attractive and , as usual in this kind of restaurant , relaxing .
I have to mention the soups , especially the seafood soup .
the great variety of rice and noodles deserves to be mentioned - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes are served with careful presentation , are highly creative and very attractive to the eye .
A negative point of the restaurant , in my view , is the lack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusion , I recommend visiting " Ichiban Restaurant " , you 'll have the chance of enjoying a delicious meal in a very agreeable atmosphere .
Reflective Writing
I have done to take responsibility for my own learning .
Independent learning has become an indispensable part of finishing tertiary - level education successfully .
However , traditional teaching methods , force - feeding students , have made me overly dependent on teachers in China , which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately .
Compared with EAP course , it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently , especially for academic writing .
Firstly , it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time , because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers ' supervision , so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently .
Following this trend , I have become a procrastinator in the end , which made me unable to face the problems of time management .
In this sense , the term " time management " means the ability to control time by prioritizing tasks and planning the effective scheduling of time to balance study and work , and to keep concentration on motivating yourself to learn towards a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Developing a strategy for studying is vital .
Rowh ( 2006 ) states that you will stay up late to complete assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance .
Based on examining my current experience and research , I noticed that a gap , unsuccessful time management in independent learning , is the root cause of these problems .
Then I made a few conscious changes where I began to manage the deadlines for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks , as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life .
As an independent learner , it is my sole responsibility to autonomously learn , which will be a very important factor in future for passing EAP1 successfully , as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of my future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
The most historical place in Spain is the city of Cáceres .
Therefore , it is a multicultural and multiracial society .
As well as the historical city , which has short and narrow streets .
The center of the historical city is the Big Square . There are mixed Arabs and Roman buildings , and two cathedrals .
In the third place , this year , Cáceres is the capital of gastronomy in Spain .
My favourite restaurant is Chinese .
Some people do n't like this food , but at this restaurant you can eat other types of food . For example , Spanish food and Mexican food .
The atmosphere in this restaurant is very good and it 's very clean .
This restaurant is very big , so we would n't have a problem .
The waitresses and waiters are very friendly and funny .
This restaurant is buffet style . We paid 15€/person and we could eat and drink all that we wanted .
From my point of view , this restaurant has one drawback ; the waiters and waitresses do n't come to the table , you have to go to get your food and drink .
I love this restaurant . The food is absolutely delicious .
In this set of materials , the listening passage discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it contributes to improving health and personality , and the reading contradicts this by revealing the downside of it .
In the listening passage , the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent , due to the fact that it reduces blood clots and slows down the deterioration of brain function .
In addition , moderate drinking helps to maintain healthy movement , because some research has shown that people who drink moderately have a lesser proportion of body fat , because alcohol speeds up the metabolism , which makes calories burn quickly .
Moreover , it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior , which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non - drinkers , and they are more social , popular and they are more likely to be married .
On the other hand , the reading contrasts with this by mentioning the disadvantages of alcohol .
Furthermore , studies have shown that alcohol stimulates the appetite , which makes people consume more than they need .
For example , researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol .
Second , alcohol can cause some serious health issues , especially cirrhosis of the liver , heart failure , brain damage and a variety of cancers .
Third , people who drink alcohol tend towards aggression and violence .
With the development of globalization , there are varieties of impacts on different aspects of daily life .
People also discuss its advantages and disadvantages .
This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China using some examples .
Firstly , there is a benefit of globalization that people can buy some special products from various countries on the internet instead of buying in the production site .
So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses .
In recent years , some different sized logistics companies have been hold , and different modes of transportation have developed rapidly .
For example , in the past , the main modes of transportation were ships , trains and trucks , so people had to wait a long time for their parcels and letters .
However , now , an increasing number of consumers and logistics companies have chosen airplanes , which can save a lot of time for transporting their parcels .
Secondly , there is still a disadvantage of globalization relating to transportation in China .
The reason is that the development of globalization has let our country improve its economy .
However , because of the increasing standard of living , a growing number of people have chosen to travel , which has put heavy pressure on transportation .
So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people , the government and experts have to think of some different ways to solve this problem .
For example , some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centres .
In conclusion , globalization of transportation has brought both positive and negative effects for Chinese people .
So in my opinion , people need to find the right ways to let globalization raise the standard of living while discussing its advantages and disadvantages .
Bra really takes care of the environment .
If you visit it , you will probably appreciate all the innovations applied to save our environment .
These engines use bio fuels , so the environment is not affected .
I think if we want to protect our environment , we should start with the little things .
You should speak accurately and also fluently .
Last year , I was in Poland and I could see how important it was to speak English . With this language , you can communicate with other people , not just English people but with all people around the world .
When I was a child I did n't understand why I needed to learn English , but now I can see how important it is . For this reason , I 'm motivated to learn .
On the other hand , I love travelling and if you know several languages everything will be easier .
You can understand the guide , the signs ...
It could be nice and give you more opportunities to do whatever you want . And do n't lose heart , at the beginning it could be difficult but , bit by bit , you will see your progress .
With strong patriotism , the Vietnamese people nowadays are trying to develop the nation , to get into the globalization process .
Each nation has their own historical place . Vietnam is not an outcast , we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand about the past .
Those places will help them to take a close look at the roots of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture , customs and tradition .
We can mention many places , such as Sword Lake , Hỏa Lò prison , the Temple of Literature ...
It is the Temple of Literature , the first university of the nation .
The Temple of Literature was built in 1070 , in the Ly dynasty .
In spite of wars and the destruction of time , the Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape now .
We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time .
Like many other Asian countries , in the past , we were greatly influenced by the ideology of Confucius , a philosopher from China .
He built a system which was based on 4 essential relationships in society .
Apart from that , they learned mostly about literature and poetry .
We can briefly describe the overall structure of the Temple of Literature , which consists of six parts .
Firstly , there were 3 main gates , the center one only for the king , the left side one was for administrators , the right side one was for the military .
Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside .
One remarkable feature of the Temple of Literature is that the people who passed 4 rounds of examinations then gained position titles would have their names engraved on the stone grave carried on stone turtles .
Right at the moment of entering , you can see them from two sides of the courtyards .
The Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now .
Before the university entrance examinations , many students come here and wish for luck .
The Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy ) can be seen as the most well - known historical place in Vietnam .
I do a lot of sports , for example , cycling , karting , football and basketball but my favourite sport is swimming because I have been doing this sport with my grandfather since 1995 .
Actually , this sport is very healthy , so some doctors are recommending this type of sport .
If you begin to do this sport , you should wear good snorkeling goggles and you should warm up five minutes before you get into the pool .
Also , you should have a cold shower after and before you swim . This is good because your body temperature is hotter than the water in the pool and if you get into the pool very quickly you could have a problem with your body temperature .
In Japan , there are many interesting places to visit .
For example , Kyoto is a popular place to visit because it has a lot of invaluable temples .
Sapporo is an attractive place because the raw fish and vegetables are fresh and nice to eat .
Fuji is the most wonderful place in Japan . Because its scenery is so beautiful , it is a popular place and it offers several exciting activities .
Fuji makes various beautiful sights and it always fascinates many people .
Fuji offers several exciting leisure activities .
Climbing to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters .
However , numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful views , such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt .
This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope , so people who are proud of having a strong body try this marathon .
Furthermore , around Mt .
Fuji has beautiful scenery , it is popular and it offers exciting activities for people .
Fuji will continue to make a wonderful impression on many people forever .
The next time such a thing happened to me I felt no wind but smelled this particular stink .
It was as if somebody was cooking some cauliflower .
At that time , I was unemployed , so I was n't able to move house and as I was n't afraid of it I had to put up with those strange events .
These are quite interesting and have helped me to know deeper children 's pleasures .
I have learnt a lot of activities which let them have fun at the same time as they get in touch with nature .
My grandmother used to run a restaurant and she taught me some Italian recipes .
Please contact me if you need any more information about me .

This month , on the 9th , I 'm going to have an oral and writing examination on my English language knowledge .
I am particularly concerned about my speaking skills and I hope I will not be too nervous in front of the teachers .
The exam is supposed to be on professional matters .
Subjects like passports , travel documents , third country citizens , inhumane treatment or punishment will be the main criteria of the exam .
I 'm going to travel all the way to the capital of my country , approximately three hundred and fifty kilometres .
In fact , she will also participate in the exam .
Afterwards , I will have the right to take part in the international missions to maintain peace under the patronage of the European Union .
I am writing in regard to the environmental problem you are researching .
First of all , I am going to present to you some general information about the environment in our village .
- Our village has only 200 citizens , therefore the amount of rubbish produced in a year is insignificant to the environment in our area .
Lastly , I am going to explain how our village is kept attractive .
- Last year there was a campaign to renew and repair the most attractive parts of the village .
In conclusion , I would say that our village is an example of an environmentally aware city .
I hope this report informed you fully on the environmental situation in our village .
Yours faithfully ,
Kalina Yevtushenkova .
Report : How Budapest takes care of its environment ?
It 's very hard to organise a big city 's rubbish collection system and to keep the city clean .
In connection with the first issue , Budapest accomplishes the task very well .
In Budapest the rubbish is collected separately .
So , almost everybody who lives in Budapest has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection .
However , it would n't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often - it 's just a matter of organisation .
The ecological situation is seriously bad , not only in my city , but in my country in general .
All the rubbish is taken to a huge dump a few kilometres away from the city .
We keep on generating rubbish and using harmful things .
We still use plastic bags and bottles , phosphate detergents , throw batteries away .
Unfortunately , we do n't separate rubbish .
I have just read your advertisement on your page for recruiting people for summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , I have provided experience working with children in that age range .
I have taken courses in First Aid and I am even doing a course as a personnel trainer for children with some delay and disability .
Secondly , I have been working in a restaurant for more than five years .
Starting there , beginning as a dishwasher , being promoted until I got the main position as a Chef .
In my spare time I work for a not - for - profit organization as a clown .
I have been learning English for 8 years and after I sat r the FCE exam two years ago , as soon as I passed the exam , I started preparing for the certificate in advanced English exam so that I could demonstrate my English skill even more , both written and spoken .
I have further professional and personal references .
Finally , I am available to have an interview if you consider my qualifications positively .
Yours faithfully ,
The fact that " shopping is not always enjoyable " might be considered a universal truth .
Although it is true that shopping might not be a very interesting topic , it must be stated that it is necessary .
There are many different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furniture , instruments , etc .
Groceries and furniture , as well as instruments , follow the same pattern .
It all depends on the type of person buying them , their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now .
Lastly , it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are shopping ( i.e. the room , the organization , the prices , the distance , etc ) and the unknown people who are in it , who may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable .
In conclusion , shopping might be both : enjoyable and not .
Although there are a lot of people who strongly believe the best way of travelling around the city is by motorbike , there is also a large proportion of society who are sure it has too many drawbacks to be worth buying one .
Owning a motorbike has advantages .
One very important positive aspect is that , thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is very economical .
In addition , as it is smaller than a car , parking becomes much less complicated .
On the other hand , motorbikes do also have drawbacks .
For example , the lack of safety , which raises the probability of getting hurt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage this kind of vehicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike . Consequently , not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable to own one .
In conclusion , owning a motorbike can be useful or useless depending on the lifestyle you have , your economic status , and the number of people you need to travel with .
If you must go a long way , then you 'll probably opt for travelling by plane ...
It 's a good idea , but ... I 've got aviophobia !
It makes my every journey unpleasant and I feel uneasy all the week before the flight .
But this mode of transport is n't so comfortable , especially when we must travel onshore ; then it 's complicated because travelling by boat is allowed only on the sea or any sizeable river , the courses of which are usually placed less conveniently than roads or even railway tracks .
For me , it has some very important advantages , like that you do n't stand in traffic , there are reductions for students , low risk of accidents , possibility of sleeping , possibility of travelling with a bike or other big luggage .
Most railway lines are quite spruce and , for me , travelling by train is a pleasure !
In my opinion , everything depends on our preferences , but the train is a general - purpose means of transport , I recommend it !
At first , I was not interested in it , since I did n't have any idea how to play , as I had only played basketball and volleyball . However , I did n't enjoy those two at all .
Moreover , I also did n't like to do exercise which was tiring and my strength was extremely weak so that every time we did 800 kilometers , I always ranked in the last three .
After he understood the reason why I did n't have any desire to play , he told me to give it a try , and if I still did n't like it , he would't force me .
The funniest thing to me was that I thought I was a kid who was studying in kindergarten because of the way he taught .
When hitting the ball back successfully , he would say ' ' good , keep going " or " you did it '' .
Hitting the ball again and again , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , because it not only includes running , but also concentrating .
I am writing to apply for a chance to work at weekends in your cafe as advertised .
In addition , having been equipped with my rather good English - speaking skills and cross - cultural communication skills obtained during my time working as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company , I feel very confident and approachable when dealing with customers .
Another reason I am applying for this job is that it will be really a good chance for me to help partly increase my income at this time and improve my family 's living conditions .
Your consideration and acceptance of my application will be much appreciated .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admit that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advances that older people tend not to understand well .
Also , because of the fact that urbanization has not helped most countries to adapt the cities into more accessible places for senior citizens .
The new technologies are something that we can not live without anymore .
But , unfortunately , the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master , especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university ( older people ) .
I am one of the fortunate people who was born in the technological era , which means that I have had access to computers , gps and mobiles , for example , since I was a little child .
The technological devices help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them .
On the other hand , to someone who did not have these when they were younger and more active , such as grandmothers and grandfathers , the new devices are just things that they can not use or understand .
The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home , on the street , in a museum , etc .
Another transformation , which is related to the advances that humanity has been seeing lately , is the changes in the cities and our living habits .
Since last century , the world population is more present in the bigger cities , which , as a result , have been increasing in size and in problems .
The urbanization implemented by governments across the decades in the cities is sometimes not suitable for all members of the public .
For instance , older people or people with disabilities have great difficulty using the metro system because of the number of stairs .
My mother is a perfect case study for me because she can not use the transportation system in Paris or New York without getting lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting .
Sometimes , the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement in big cities compels the older population to stay at home .
In this case , they do not have the possibility to go out and enjoy the benefits that cities may bring to their lives .
Therefore , the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who are capable of understanding how to manage the modern devices and use all kinds of transportation .
On the other hand , for older people , the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle to them enjoying all that there is out there .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give my opinion about the facilities and services of the Active Leisure Clubs .
Facilities
In general , the facilities are well maintained but the majority of the users think that the installation should be improved in the basketball and tennis courts and maybe the bathroom should be remodelled .
Advantages
The workers are very kind and sympathetic and enjoy teaching .
Disadvantages
The activities are expensive .
I believe that it would be a good idea to reduce the cost of some activities .
Recommendations
It 's recommend that you improve the facilities , reduce the prices and open every day until 10.00 p.m.
Since the car was invented , we have been seeing a large increase in car production and in car use .
However , as time went by , improvements were made to public transport .
Nowadays , they are modern and comfortable and they are n't as late as they used to be .
Travelling by car might be more pleasant , but it can also be costly , because fuel can be very expensive , depending on the current economy .
With regards to traffic , travelling by public transport can also be quicker , as there is a bus lane and no traffic for the tube .
However , over the past years , people have been travelling mostly by car , which seems to have led to higher levels of air pollution .
This is undoubtedly an important environmental issue that should definitely have our attention .
Celebrities and their lives take intrinsic place in the lives of contemporary people .
The process of this fact becoming real and common in our society began about 100 years ago , and what is really interesting , nearly 95 percent of people in advanced society can not imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all .
Probably , if you hear about heroic attitudes you will be able to do , without doubt , something magnificent as well .
In this way , I think that it is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous .
There are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them - it is called low self - esteem .
Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities ' private lives and professional careers , you have to remember that the media distorts reality .
Of course , you can look up to celebrities but you have to be aware of the consequences .
INTRODUCTION
The school provides lots of different activities for those who are interested in music , drawing , dance and theatre .
The atmosphere at school is very creative .
During the whole school year , a great number of exhibitions , concerts and performances are given by pupils themselves and by invited musicians and artists as well .
Children have to take an entrance examination .
The other thing is that students are not able to refuse to attend some classes they do not like because those are considered to be a part of an educational standard for the particular artistic area .
CONCLUSION
It is definitely worthwhile to study there , although it is advised to let students choose the activities they prefer .
The phenomenon of homeless people has become a serious problem and many countries can not solve this problem .
The number of homeless people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world .
One of the major reasons for this problem is wars , especially in the Arab countries like Syria , Libya and Yemen .
In addition , financial crises . Most companies have financial problems , so the ideal solution to them is downsizing .
Furthermore , street children are a result of family troubles .
Cases of divorce are increasing and many children run away and prefer to live in the streets instead of in a home full of problems .
To conclude , the world has a complicated problem , so governments and charitable organizations must take a quick decision and put in place a real solution to solve this problem .
After the second false start you 'll be disqualified and then you can kiss victory goodbye , - that 's how I mentally tune myself , - Take it easy !
I look around tribunes : there are n't so many people , despite the fact that today the Australian Hurdle Champion of the season will be decided .
Although who am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervously stretching out my stiff neck .
Everyone 's nervous except for Jerome Tanny , last year 's champion , famous for his threatening pre - start grin , that we all call the " Shark 's Smile " .
Tanny is a human rocket that 's warming up on a neighboring track lane .
That 's strange , but before the start my thoughts are as if an old steam locomotive is going to those depths of memory which are really hard to get to in ordinary life .
Owing to the increase in the population , human beings use more land to build houses , which leads to the decline of forest areas .
Floods , droughts , and famines . All of these have great effects on humans and animals . For instance , the loss of property , the disappearance of people , which is not good for the development of human beings .
For one thing , animals do not have homes , so some of them become endangered species , worse still , die out .
I think that efforts must be made quickly by governments to protect our homes .
Firstly , the population should be controlled . If humans continue to increase rapidly , there will be no more room for humans .
Secondly , governments should teach their people how to protect the environment , such as making them aware that destroying too much farmland is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be set up to provide room for animals , and we can help the endangered animals in this way .
Finally , governments should use the space properly , for example , making plans before building buildings , estimating the effects on humans and animals .
Faithfully yours .
Personal experiences
This is a question that I struggle to answer , but I have to say the most important person in my life was and is my marvellous father .
He is always on my mind , even though he is not physically present .
This should be enough to make you feel happy like a comfortable blanket does .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty sure that you do n't need much money to be happy .
The urban myth that statues can move makes contemporary people frightened .
And the Doctor Who Sci - Fi TV series from the BBC externalized this terror with the Weeping Angels .
According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine , Radio Times , the Weeping Angels were picked as the scariest villains of the Doctor Who series twice by about half of respondents .
These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of the Doctor , like the Daleks , exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe , or the Cybermen , transforming all living things into cyborgs .
Then , what makes the Weeping Angels frightening ?
This uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originating from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar .
This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - living as life - like .
In Blink , the Weeping Angels ' uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make the audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
They look unnatural , in spite of their similar appearances to humans .
And the expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre , due to the lack of pupils .
Also , they have deadpan expressions .
These factors make angels more like grotesque psychopathic assassins .
But when it comes to their interior factor , the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning an unconscious physiological reaction into a conscious one .
After the Doctor 's warning , we may not turn our backs , look away , and blink as we are protagonists of the episode .
In several scenes , Weeping Angels , the lonely assassins never shift their positions and postures , even though the protagonists and supporting players blink , look away or turn their backs .
The reason is that TV viewers are watching them simultaneously .
To change the pose of the horrific statues technically , directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally , for a moment .
Finally , Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar .
For instance , the angels camouflage themselves as monuments or tombs in graveyards , carvings of the cathedral on the streets , and ornamental carvings in front of an old police office .
Consequently , it makes the audience unfamiliar with their circumstances .
Then TV viewers are terrified at the basis of their livelihoods and people grab blankets tight !
She began to study at a prestigious University .
That was a great responsibility for her , as well as bringing great prestige .
Anna feared that she would have difficulties coping with the expectations .
However , acquaintances of hers , the students at the University , comforted her .
Her grandfather , the first doctor in the family , was her role model .
From now on , Anna would have to direct her attention to making her grandfather proud of her qualifications .
Surprisingly , when you are playing this sport you improve your speed and coordination too , so that could be an interesting reason for taking it up if you are not involved in it .
Personally , what I can say is that playing this sport makes me feel really alive and not only when I am playing it , it also happens when I am watching it , especially during the World Cup .
I am encouraging those people who do not like doing sport that it is the best way to maintain your health .
Potential issues such as rule violations and conflicts may arise because foreigners may not understand the rules .
Japanese , as pointed out by Trompenaars ( cited in Morrison , 2006 ) , is highly influenced by the values of universalism .
Similarly , the high level of uncertainty avoidance and the low level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) cause Japanese people to seem to be obedient and self - disciplined .
Also , Japanese people think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment .
As a result , in Australia , conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) . People may usually emphasize their self - satisfaction and think of themselves first , instead of the public .
They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users .
Consequently , the bathing pool may face hygiene problems , such as someone not washing before bathing , and scrambling issues .
In order to achieve cost efficiency , the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered .
The location , whether it has a sufficient quantity of water or not , is the essential consideration .
Rental cost is also a limitation , as it is relatively high in Australia .
I am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit while you 're in Poland .
It is a majestic castle conveniently located on the river .
It 's a huge , breath - taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens .
The place is fascinating , because it is loaded with history and it 's nice to spend a day and relax in the royal gardens .
It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners come to Poland just to see Cracow city and , among other things , Wawel Castle .
I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit , because it is beautiful , full of other worth - seeing monuments , cute little cafes , a varied choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside .
I hope you will describe your impressions of the city after visiting it .
Yours faithfully
Evidence s that many natural systems have been affected by climate change , particularly by temperature rises .
I think it is time we started adopting environmentally friendly attitudes to help the planet .
First of all , as dioxides and carbon gases have been increasing ozone pollution in big cities worldwide , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative use of transportation .
Also , the adoption of bicycles and walking , for instance , seems to be a responsible attitude to the planet .
In addition , water pollution is a global problem as well , as so many industries dump a large amount of waste into rivers and lakes and also human waste and rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be found by improving recycling , waste disposal and even , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moreover , life may not be possible for future generations , unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy , like green , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency , avoiding side effects for the planet .
To conclude , I firmly believe that we can reduce the damage and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .
During the lesson I was very impressed by Socrative ( www.socrative.com ) , therefore I decided to devise a quiz about HTML and CSS .
At the end of the test , the teacher shows the results ( correct answers percentage for each student ) .
The teacher asks the students to comment on the results and the activity , and discuss the opportunity to repeat the activity .
This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant , which is situated in the heart of Cannes by the seashore .
All this can be accompanied by different selections of white wines .
All the produce is fresh and the chef takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
In addition to that , the service well accompanies the high quality of the cooking .
Despite the high price of the food , I had a pleasant dining experience .
This is the reason why I highly recommend going to the Astoux restaurant .
Suddenly , Michael saw his brother crying and he asked him . why " Where is my Playstation ? ? " , said Paul , inconsolably , and he ran to the kitchen .
When both of them started to search for clues around the house , they did n't find anything interesting , but after a while , they had seen several paw prints and , at that moment , Michael remembered a fact : he had left his dog inside the house , but the puppy had disappeared !
Obviously , he knew their dog Spooky had been into Paul 's bedroom and taken his Playstation .
First of all , they are supposed to be designed with great care and many considerations , such as the background colour , artwork and security issues , all of which are crucial for bank notes .
Secondly , skilled machinists will make preparations for the metal plates that are one of the most vital ways to ensure the quality of bank notes .
Next , it will come to the most important step , inspection .
If they are good quality sheets or partially damaged but still in good condition , they will be packaged and dispatched .
I hope the charity event you organised with your school was successful .
I know how much you care about animals and love them , especially dogs .
We decided to organize a play and donate the money we earnt to a Dog Foundation .
We tried to involve as many students as possible , since we needed actors , costume designers and technicians .
The event was very successful as we earned € 2,000 in just a day .
Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would be additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
On the other hand , aside from my bedroom , I would love to have my own reading nook , where I could read peacefully .
So , if my mental estimates are correct , there should still be enough space available to also place a little armchair , where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my desk chair , not very far from the window .
As far as television is concerned , well , to be honest , I haven't watched much TV for years .
Nevertheless , it 's something dispensable for me and , for this reason , I think I could get by without having one .
Now that I have already finished describing the arrangement of my hypothetical bedroom , I am going to talk about its lighting .
Firstly , I would only use energy - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .
Since the desk is just beside the bed , the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head ; that way , placing another lamp on the furniture would be unnecessary .
Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted in a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colour as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than them .
Lastly , I would like my curtains to be red , given that that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains , because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
My parents divorced when I was 16 years old , so I do n't have a close relationship with my mom and dad .
My son is 13 years old and we understand each other very well .
He does not conceal anything from me , as I try to understand what he really needs and support him .
We speak about everything and respect each other .
I completely disagree with the statement " there is no future for public transport " .
I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities being convenient for everyone .
Although a private car is more convenient for its owner than public transport , it is not in use the majority of the time and that means wasting city space on parking while it could be used as a public space .
At the same time , it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously .
For instance , a network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine the comfort of a personal car and the work - load of public transportation .
Nowadays , all the car manufacturers have accepted the task of designing a robot - driven car that in future would resolve the issues of safety and availability of taxis 24 hours 7 days a week .
Unfortunately , the main method is to make private cars , if not a luxury , then to make their usage economically less efficient compared to public transportation .
And the underground , and light tram system are still more ecological and faster .
The aim of this report is to describe the training course that I attended last month , for a week , and the activities in which I was involved during that period of time .
It turned out to be a disadvantage for me , given that I am interested in the theory .
I managed to find out very few things about the theory , due to the large number of participants .
I realised there is no time to think much when it comes to practice , because you have to act quickly and to prove to yourself and the others that you use your knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .
Efficiency is one of the most important things in terms of time management .
I would strongly recommend this training course on time management , because it is useful not just to gain some theoretical aspects for those who want to be more organised , but also if you want to really manage in a daily situation .
As a result of useful activities putting theory into practice , you will have a better chance to achieve your goal .
You may think that I met them or I got an autograph , but I must disappoint you .
But I loved this experience , I really enjoyed it .
It 's an unforgettable experience and it gave me a lot .
Yours faithfully
This picture illustrates the process of producing bank notes .
The first step is to design the appearance of the bank notes and then prepare skilled machinists for metal plates .
The next step is the most important and it involves inspection , which means good and bad sheets are separated during this process .
The good quality sheets are cut into individual notes and dispatched after packing and the bad sheets and notes are destroyed for security reasons in the very last step .
Overall , the whole process of making bank notes has six steps and they are design , metal plate preparation , printing , inspection , dividing sheets into three groups and distribution or disposal .
Greenhouse gases have put a red light warning on the planet , and countries around the world are starting to realize the importance of reducing these gases .
Big cities are crowded with vehicles and , as a result , levels of pollution are dangerously increasing .
Engineers are studying new engines that are more environmentally friendly , but even so , we have to reduce vehicles to help reduce the greenhouse effect and pollution .
Plans and programmes are being developed to reduce the number of cars driving through cities .
From the Metro system , the bus , the train , to the high speed rail , all this public transportation has become more and more popular .
Lots of people really enjoy the time when taking public transportation because it is more convenient , costs less and is more eco - friendly .
In my opinion , taking public transport is more convenient .
We do n't have to drive ourselves , and we do n't have to think about which way we should go to reach the destination .
Additionally , taking public transport costs less .
Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time , which leads to the greenhouse effect and a rise in the average sea level .
Taking public transport can efficiently reduce the emission of carbon dioxide and will help the earth to recover from those disorders .
The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statement that public transport has no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Can you imagine transportation which never appears ?
For a century , many modes of transport have been invented . Therefore , our lives have become convenient .
What transportation we need and should be invented now is hard to imagine , because there is no place we ca n't go .
For example , the speed of transportation could become faster , use green energy sources , increase the capacity of the public vehicles and so on .
With the advance of technology , a lot of problems have arisen . Natural resources are becoming in storted , and the air pollution is getting worse .
This is harmful to everything in the world .
So , we have to consider how to solve these problems for the next generation .
Learning another language is very useful these days , because of globalization and also cooperation between countries .
It is important when we work or study in international areas .
People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their lives .
They can have a better position , work for a foreign company , communicate with foreign companies , etc .
It can be a benefit at school as well , because if you need some information for some project , you can look at foreign literature too .
Also , you can take part in travel and work experience which your school can offer .
If you want to try this option , you need to have a very good level in a particular language .
Another very important benefit of learning a new language is that you can travel . You will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them .
It helps you to ask people for a lot of important information which you need during your journey .
For example , which way you should go , where is a good restaurant , how to travel in a country , how to solve your problems , where is the cheapest accommodation and much more .
Thanks to learning another language , you can also have friends from all over the world and you can better understand the culture of a new country .
I think that there are not many disadvantages of learning another language .
One of them could be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them .
It can be really interrupting if it continues for a long time .
In conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will always be important for today 's people and the next generation too , and in addition , the need to communicate in another language will increase .
I am writing to you in reference to the First Certificate exam .
I found a bilingual Spaniard ( with several international certificates and now he 's teaching in a bilingual school in Madrid ) .
With the process of globalization , people are eager to know about other countries more than ever .
In the past , most people considered a museum the best way to get to know an unfamiliar country .
First , as technology has developed , we may find visiting museums is far from convenient .
People using new techniques have gradually become the majority .
It leads to an increasing number of people choosing to use the online museum .
On the other hand , needless to say , the limitation of a museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings . It is far from an enjoyable visit when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and not touch it .
Admittedly , a museum has its own merits ; it is easy to find on a map and is always emphasized as a symbol of a country .
A documentary , a book about the culture is cheap and easy . We can consider it an economical method .
Visiting a museum is undoubtedly a good way to learn about a country , but not the best way anymore .
If you decide to find out some information about a totally unknown country , a museum is not a wise option .
But do n't panic . Let 's think rationally .
Technology will control our homes .
With technology we will clean our house , technology will protect us , we will spend our free time with technology .
In every room we will have a big screen , where we 'll be able to see where our children are and if everything 's OK .
Do we need friends or family members if technology can take care of us ?
Machines can tell us lots of important information .
I would really appreciate it if you could give me a piece of advice about what course I should take .
I 'd like you to take into account the following requirements :
Secondly , I 'd like the college to be located not too far from accommodation if possible . I would n't like to spend too much time on public transport every day .
As far as accommodation is concerned , I 'd like bed and breakfast included in the price .
Summer camp is all about providing fun activities in a safe environment .
In my opinion , to be a suitable person for the summer camp job you should have qualifications to create fun activities and to keep kids safe .
Creating fun activities is an important role of summer camp workers .
As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7 - 10 years , I have the ability to create and perform fun activities .
In the morning program , the kids enjoyed playing football , soccer ball , basketball and water ball .
The program included many competitive activities that were full of fun and cheerful .
In the afternoon , the kids enjoyed a multi - dance program that had different international dances .
Safety is a core component in the summer camps ' activities .
While designing fun activities , the camp workers have to take into account the safety level of those activities , the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed .
As a retired nurse , I have a high sense of safety and harm prevention .
In addition , I have experience of providing basic , advanced life saving , and airway protection .
While these situations are rare , they need effective fast intervention to save kids ' lives .
In conclusion , I think providing fun in a safe environment is the main component of summer camp that each family is looking for . As a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun , to provide safe activities , and most important is my ability to intervene in emergency situations .
Foster Hollywood is an American restaurant in the center of Caceres .
The interior is spectacular because it is decorated like a Hollywood film .
The tables and the chairs are very beautiful because they are like in the American films but they are very uncomfortable .
The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed but it is always crowded .
I love this restaurant because the food is really good . It is the tastiest food that I have eaten .
My favourite dishes are the " Nachos " and " Catarapi " , the second is a dish of spicy pasta , it is spectacular .
I think this restaurant would be suitable for us because it is a great place for everyone , it is in the center and most importantly its food is really tasty .
We can get a lot of up - to - date information around the world through watching television .
There are many channels on TV , not only entertainment , but also technology , health , environment , weather forecast and news channel , etc .
Discovery Channel is a knowledge bank and Animal Planet is very interesting .
Mathematics , English and environmental knowledge quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children .
We can also improve our moral attitude by watching discussions and speeches by outstanding leaders .
So , I think the advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the person watching .
So , we need to try to get an equal balance between entertainment and education from TV .
I have seen your advertisement on the Internet and I am really interested in it .
Because of this , I have learnt many activities and games that I could use in your summer camp .
I always work with a lot of children , so I have experience managing and organising groups .
About my personal characteristics , I am friendly and self - confident but I have another quality that children love : I am really creative . I can make costumes with not many materials , so they will enjoy dressing up a lot .
I usually do sports like tennis or running , but I am especially interested in having adventures , and I would like to have this one together .
I enclose my CV to complete the information .
Yours faithfully
It would be incredible if you started your trip in Cartagena , which is a Caribbean and tropical city .
After that , you should go to Medellín . At that time of the year they will be celebrating some traditional holidays .
So , you will be able to experience and watch all these amazing exotic flowers , to hear Colombian music and see traditional dances .
To finish , if you want to , you can be an English tutor at my University for the whole time you stay in the city .
Please write to me and tell me if you are interested .
By the way , my boyfriend will finish a PhD program this summer :-) , and then he needs to do compulsory military service beginning 7th August for one year .
Fortunately , he is assigned to substitute services , so he does n't have to join the real army .
We think that it will be convenient for him to apply for a Postdoc position during his military service .
To take public transport or not , that is the question . Travelling by car is convenient , however , it
ignores the car congestion problems and the pollution because of CO2 .
preference .
Public transport reduces the car congestion problems .
going to work or travelling by car .
For example , taking the train from Taipei , a city in Taiwan , to Taoyuan in the New Year only takes half an hour in contrast to nearly two hours owing to the car congestion on the highway .
In terms of protecting the environment , taking public transport may cut down the carbon emissions .
It is urgent timing to avoid the greenhouse effect that people should think about how to decrease the carbon emissions .
To be brief , taking public transport not only avoids congestion problems to save time but benefits mother nature 's future .
Admittedly , travelling by car has its merits , such as being more convenient to go anywhere we want , and we can enjoy time with family in a car .
Nevertheless , it causes a lot of problems and pollution .
He competed in a local motorcycle race and won the $ 5000 cash prize .
Three consecutive years he had competed in the local race , but at most he had managed get second place .
Tom asked him about insurance and the old man said the insurance only paid 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease .
He thought he should perform a show jumping over several wrecked cars , but it was too risky because he had not had any experience of that kind of show .
We need advertising and to find a suitable place for the show by 3 pm " .
Short - term and enticing Russian loans are very attractive for Serbian politicians who are struggling with financial difficulties .
As an Orthodox and Slavic country which is yet to become a member of the EU and does not want to become a member of NATO , in a difficult economic situation with the public exposed to strong propaganda , Serbia is an easy target of Russia 's soft power .
People have been changing for ages and , at the same time , they have been building an astonishing history .
They have been thinking about what the world will look like , and with that thought , civilization was created .
Our curiosity is not restraining .
Many buildings , like skyscrapers suggest we will live in flats which exist above the ground , and that is not extraordinary , but how about whole cites prospering under the water with their own source of light which could replace the Sun ?
Despite the fact that the visual aspect is the most important thing to most people , in my opinion , in this case , everything has been said and no new forms can be created .
The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters . For instance , Cyclone Tracy in Darwin , Australia , the Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America , etc .
It concisely depicts the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters .
The book is also very readable , not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply giving us an overview of handling natural disasters , so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon .
The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is about the people who live along the Yellow River , how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and found a better solution .
At the beginning , the Yellow River was always unleashing terrible floods that swept through towns , villages and farmland .
After days of heavy rain , the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed can not contain the water when it is out of its limitation .
The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas . Fortunately , the flood also makes the plains fertile and feeds millions of people .
While I was flicking through the pages , I let my imagination run wild with the story .
Even though mother nature is complicated sometimes , she will give us a light of hope .
People will continue to suffer dangerous floods and there will be no end after many years unless the government take effective action to stop flooding .
It is hard for people living in devastating surroundings .
The Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization .
Reading this book is like unwrapping a present which is packed in layers of sheets .
My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people along the Yellow River .
Meanwhile , a surge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with lots of thought - provoking words .
That 's all for my presentation today .
I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity .
The World Cup , the Olympics and other international games work to ease tensions between different nations .
During that time , the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship .
Sports events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between nations .
On the other hand , some sports matches can make international relations worse .
Patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way .
For example , during the semi - final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia , the players played quite violently , and the supporters of the two teams were very tense .
Even after the end of the match , assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams .
I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the best ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely .
However , I believe that games can not be fundamental ways for sound patriotism or peaceful international relations .
I am very interested in this management trainee - marketing position with your corporation , and believe that my education and employment background are appropriate for the position .
During my tenure at the University of Economics and Law , I have noticed my growing interest in marketing and public relations .
Last month , I did an internship at the Hoan My Medical Corporation in Ho Chi Minh City .
My position involved developing marketing content on the web pages and slideshows publicizing the success of the company 's events .
I was able to utilize my marketing skills to assist the organization in their goal to promote SEO .
The marketing department also gave me the responsibility of publicizing events via Facebook .
I believe that my experience in marketing and my interpersonal skills make me a prime candidate for this position . I am a diligent worker , and passionate about my work . I will be a valuable asset to your company and will use this as an opportunity to grow and further the development of my marketing skill set .
Thank you very much for considering my application for candidacy .
People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
First of all , we can define ourselves as " slaves of technology " , because now we all have a telephone that has lots of functions and that turns us away from real life .
In my opinion , the obsession with business transforms society into a ring inside which every man is against his friend only for the sake of an excellent career .
In this way , everyone is the perfect copy of someone else and originality or a creative mind is considered as something bad .
Yes , they will , and I hope that we will improve our thoughts and we will have the consciousness that we are not " supreme " and that we will never have the right to imposing us in the world .
Taking acceptance the strength of music , it is hard to imagine human life without it . "
For example , there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which are organized in many countries .
People from almost all over the world attend to participate in it .
Being at the core of the culture of a country , it influences national reputation .
For instance , in our country , music consists of two main parts : Mougam and Folk music , which have been gaining popularity in all regions of the world since they began .
However , modern music is not always acceptable to different people .
To take account that it has been improving day by day , we can notice the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music in almost every country .
Most countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music .
This process makes people closer to each other , encouraging them to cooperate and become friends .
To sum up , it is necessary to point out that there is not any negativity or perfection of national or modern music at all .
It is essential to treasure music as one of the significant kinds of art .

I think that Spain is an incredible country since it has all kinds of landscapes : mountains , beaches , lakes , and you can enjoy adventure activities , for example , trekking routes , climbing , bungee jumping , surfing ... You can do different kinds of tourism depending on the city where you want to go .
First of all , I would like to talk about Extremadura .
Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has good weather all year .
However , I recommend travelling to Extremadura in spring or autumn because in summer it is too hot .
In Extremadura , you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfragüe National Park or Tajo - International Natural Park .
In addition , you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones ( I recommend this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it ) or small natural lakes in the North of Extremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many towns and cities with impressive ancient neighbourhoods , for instance , Cáceres , Mérida , Trujillo , Guadalupe , Alcántara ...
Other places that I would recommend are : the towns of the South of Andalucia , which have clean beaches , cold water and good leisure facilities , with many restaurants , shops , parks , zoos , aquatic parks ...
On the other hand , near the Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches where the water is very clean and warm .
In particular , I recommend you to go to the Baleares Islands .
In addition , you could visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches .
However , you must go and discover these unforgettable places .
The first one was very boring for him because he was very tired and he was n't listening to everything that the teacher was saying .
When the time for science class arrived , he felt really excited because John , the science teacher , told them that he was going to explain to them a very interesting thing .
It was about what problems we are going to have in a few years if we do n't change anything related to polluting our environment .
John talked about the serious problems caused by not recycling things like plastic bags , bottles … that end up floating in the sea because humans do n't take care of their environment , and all this is causing loads of aquatic animals to die .
We worked with Nikita for 1 year during my account management of Enter .
As AC category manager , Nikita demonstrated in - depth knowledge of the AC market , a high level of negotiating skills , and a professional attitude to everything he did .
Nikita has shared with me his understanding of e - retail , analysis of sales channels , product strategy in online and offline mix .
Nikita has superior communication skills , a positive mindset , and is highly approachable .
I 'm completely confident in recommending Nikita as an experienced Product Manager .
This is to apply for the position advertised concerning the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
Due to my background , I believe myself to be the ideal person for the above - mentioned job .
I have been involved in summer camps with children from different backgrounds and with diverse needs .
In particular , I have been dealing with children with disabilities for 10 years .
This experience has been an eye - opener for me .
I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at everyday life through different eyes .
Children can indeed teach you a lot , being able to express their feelings with the spontaneity that adults often lack .
It was impressive to see the strength shown by those children .
Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core , children with disabilities were growing up very independent and strong , despite all the challenges they could face along the way .
During the year in Ghana , I was part of a team of volunteers working with children .
After consulting some children 's representatives , we organized Olympic games for the children attending the schools of the area .
You do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition .
As volunteers , we also helped the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room .
In conclusion , I believe myself to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it .
My experience with children of different ages and countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your esteemed company .
Yours faithfully ,
There seems to be nothing better , nothing more interesting , exhilarating , breathtaking or stunning than taking up this sport .
Being on the court is fun , gives me a feeling of fulfilment .
Not everybody knows how much devotion and determination is required to be a good player .
You just have to work your fingers to the bone , but it 's definitely worth it .
It 's also not said but tennis is one of the sports which causes an enormous amount of injuries , so it 's necessary to be under the constant supervision of your doctor !
The amount of pleasure I can get is simply incomparable to anything else .
ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS
There are a lot of bargains and cheap items on the market , which very often catch our eye , but I definitely want to warn you against them !
In terms of differences is that this houses will be modern , more secure , economical .
Most of the furnishings will be machines and domestic activities will be done for us .
However , they will lose the atmosphere of houses with antique furniture and interior which create a unique and homely atmosphere .
Everything is going forward , so everything will be changed .
First of all , it 's a man 's sport , simple and at the same time complicated .
Being a fan of an NFL team is a very special experience .
If you plan to play this game , you definitely should be an outstanding athlete . You should understand the " pros " and " cons " of every move you make on the field .
I 'm a friendly , open - minded and quite easy - going guy who lives in one of the most beautiful cities in Russia - St. Petersburg .
I love my city and I love to travel , try new things , socialize and experience new cultures .
Working as an IT engineer , I can afford 2 - 4 short trips per year , and I always take this opportunity .
Introduction
the aim of this report is the desciption of the shopping facilities in my home town - Vienna .
Conclusions
I would like to start off with one of the most well - known malls , called " Donauzentrum " .
The mall is linked to an entertainment section , called " Donauplex " .
The entertainment section stays open after the mall closes .
There you can find a cinema , some restaurants and bars .
In the countryside , you can find a recently built mall named " G3 " .
It contains nearly the same shops as the " Donauzentrum " and several restaurants and cafés .
The " Mariahilferstraße " is the perfect place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls .
Even the most illustrious shops can be found there .
It is not only worthwhile visiting the street by day , but also by night .
As well as the shops , some nice bars and restaurants can be found .
Recommendations
Especially on a rainy afternoon , the " Donauzentrum " and " G3 " are the perfect way to spend your day .
I 've just read your advertisement for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , and I 'm really interested in it .
I 'm also a volunteer for the Red Cross , so I 'm used to looking after children and organising all kinds of events .
Does the accommodation belong to the summer camp structure ?
We do the collection , to recycle as many things as possible .
All the buildings here have been built to respect the environment . In fact , every house has photovoltaic panels on the roof .
These panels are used to harness the light of the sun to produce electricity .
The first Sunday of every month , a group of volunteers goes to the parks of the village to clean it and to cut the grass .
I always participate in these events because I love the environment and I 'd like to keep my village clean .
We all know that the Roman Empire affected Italian culture and history a lot . In fact , if you want to go on a tour around the most beautiful cities in the country , you should definitely go to Florence , Venice , Naples and many others .
You will be able to see ancient and modern buildings such as theatres , churches , cathedrals and civic buildings built by the most famous artists in the entire world !
Cities are full of museums where tourists can see all the customs and traditions that have characterized Italian culture .
That 's why Italy is such an interesting and historical country .
So , I think that both hobbies have their advantages and disadvantages .
Many people feel that learning English , especially in ' England ' or in ' the USA ' , is better than learning that in a country that does not have English as its mother tongue .
For instance , in Peru everybody speaks Spanish , so you are not accustomed to the language .
The advantages of learning English abroad are the daily practice which you should have if you are in an English - speaking country and all the people who you get to know from all over the world .
One argument in favour of this idea is that Peruvian people who learn English for a short period and then travel abroad show an improvement in just one or two months .
However , the disadvantages are that you do not know how to behave in another culture .
In conclusion , I am of the opinion that people ought to study abroad if they have the opportunity , because apart from your lessons , you can interact with native people and learn common phrases .
She knew that her eighteenth birthday was approaching and she would spend it and all the preceding week with her friends in Spain .
If a person is going for an interview for a job , punctuality is a must . Hence , he can drive his car fast or can go earlier in his car to get there early .
But he could not travel very fast on a bus in order to reach his destination very quickly .
In conclusion , use of public transportation is decreasing day by day .
In order to boost the use of public transport , the government or the governing body should consider these factors and must find a solution to these problems .
Technology has changed us much faster and more dramatically than we used to think .
Nowadays , all we need is a fully charged smartphone with the Google Map application .
In the past , people could only make a purchase from a store by themselves , now we can browse almost hundreds of goods online and buy them via a simple click .
Because of this tremendous outcome , I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , with greater extension to every aspect of our lives .
In my imagination , the future will be more messy and crowded with fewer species of creature but more of us , human beings .
We will face more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental damage .
Some countries will be submerged entirely under the sea , some will survive , and there will be less space for an increasing population .
Fortunately , the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living , to clean air for breathing , and to purify water and food for supply .
Other than the situation I mentioned above , we will have our memories and knowledge being replicated in the form of digital data .
If we have dementia ( a steady degenerative disease of our brains ) , we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of online " Big Cloud " memories .
No longer do we suffer studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we know through a link to the huge online database .
We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects on our personalities .
Moreover , our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns or even physical functions corresponding to the changing environments or simply in response to our specific commands .
However , the more we feel comfortable , the more the damage to our intellect .
We do n't have to think too much about almost anything , needing no person for company since we have all these distracting devices for entertainment and relaxation .
The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of this unrealistic convenience we have .
For example , saving the endangered wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient .
Time - saving and convenience are admittedly considered two essential values of modern lives .
Nonetheless , we have to confront the truth that resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly .
We may think that depends on how you like to travel , as they all have their advantages and disadvantages .
But personally , my favorite way to travel is by plane .
It is faster than the other two , it is not difficult to travel on it and it is quite comfortable .
Also , you can travel to different places and longer distances , whereas while boating , for example , you can only travel to places where there is a connection to the sea .
I 'm really glad to know about your future plans . I definitely think that this year of travelling and exploring will be a great way to grow up and meet new people from different cultures .
If I have the opportunity to help you with your planning , please have no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Firstly , I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital , which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites , such as museums , art galleries , monuments and churches .
If , at some point , you are fed up with art and culture , the city offers you a lot of leisure facilities such as concerts , exhibitions , festivals and so on !
As you will arrive during the summer , you should then have a vacation in the south , where the beaches are breathtaking , with such clean water and long golden shores .
In connection with your desire to find a job , you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field : as you wrote , you 're searching for a job for a month and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly meet your expectations .
If you are interested , I could give you his phone number and e - mail so that you two can speak about the matter and maybe reach an agreement .
My statement to apply to a university
I graduated from AL - mustansiria University / College of Arts / Department of Translation in 1998 .
I started working for the Ministry of Oil as senior translator in 2000 .
My country 's history inspired me all my life . The important role that my city ( Baghdad ) played in the history of education and translation especially affects the history of human civilization .
Which inspired me to study translation , which considers science and art at the same time .
I pursued my life 's dream of higher education by searching for the best universities in the UK .
I found your Translation and Interpretation program for a master 's degree meets my requirements and needs .
Since my graduation , I have acquired broad experience in translation .
After my graduation ,
I spent two years translating hundreds of essays in different fields for higher education students .
I worked in the OIL MINISTRY 's central library on foreign scientific books which mainly concerned the petroleum field .
This gives me broad knowledge of petroleum jargon which opens endless horizons of experience and of how to work on developing my knowledge and skills .
My enriched experience in the English language and my knowledge of petroleum expressions qualified me to work in the Training and Developing Directorate mainly in training abroad .
I did many important translations for training manuals and petroleum institutions student description .
In addition , the higher administration in the Training & Development Directorate selected me to join a focal committee to build up a competency system for petroleum staff in cooperation with the British government .
I want to study at your university in the pre - sessional courses to meet your standard in English language .
All the above - mentioned crystallized my ambition to continue higher education at a respected university .
I want to specialize in translation concerned with the petroleum sector .
It goes without saying that I am from a petroleum country and I want to work in OPEC as a representative of my country and enhance the Ministry of Oil 's translation staff with highly educated translators .
I plan to help the freshman translators in the Ministry to further their career under my supervision by coaching and mentoring them .
First you should visit sights like the churches and cathedrals , then move to the town centre and go through the town park .
There you will find beautiful countryside and gorgeous swans , which stay there for the whole year .
It 's quite an architecturally important building , I think , plus there are about a million books , so you can learn something new about our culture .
There are also good pubs and restaurants .
There you can taste our national cuisine but their international cuisine is also tasty .
In front of the building are enormous reflectors which shine into the darkness .
You definitely have to visit it .
Their novels have a lot in common : first of all , the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heights by E. Bronte ) , and so are the characters , who are always well described , especially on a psychological level . Furthermore , both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class .
There is also a lot in contrast . Most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities , while Bronte prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , . In fact , Dickens mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of the lower classes and the bad consequences of industrialisation , In contrast , Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroines do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prudery .
Then we can notice that the narrators of the novels have different roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient ; Bronte 's one is part of the story itself and can change , revealing other characters ' perspectives .
We feel happier during a conversation when someone has a good sense of humor .
Also , people can have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor .
I would like to provide examples to illustrate my thesis .
Consequently , we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor .
To illustrate , my nephew did not get a great score in his test .
Also , people can have a good relationship with their humor .
Furthermore , sometimes people with a sense of humor can help others to conquer difficult issues .
In the trend of globalization today , the success or failure of a business depends on many different factors .
First of all , the products that are manufactured must meet the requirements of customers perfectly .
In addition , good products with reasonable prices will always attract the attention of customers .
Second , the management of business leaders plays an important role in the success of the company 's business .
The head of the enterprise must have the knowledge and experience to make the right and reasonable decisions .
The leader of the business must also have a way of handling active and innovative work to save time and money .
Himselves of leader must have discipline , know working on time , and know how to create a group - working consensus , seriously .
Marketing 's job is to deliver content to customers so that they learn more about the company and the products and services , in order to increase their advantage in the consumption of goods and increase profits .
Companies can create a site dedicated to introducing the value of the products , prices and service deals .
In addition , an enterprise may do marketing through advertising , newspapers ... it is important to listen to feedback from customers to understand and supply what they need .
Good products with reasonable prices , a good manager with strong leadership and an excellent marketing plan are the factors that lead to success in business .
Importance of outdoor games
Our world 's great scientists have invented the internet to solve various distant problems .
Students have started to forget their physical games and get stuck in this internet world . They are spending so much time on using the internet and they engage in only meaningless gossip on social networking websites .
If they want to use it , they should try to focus on getting important information which is beneficial to improving their knowledge .
By playing physical games , they will not only improve their health but they can also gain concentration .
They should try to understand the importance of physical games and also play them regularly .
I am writing to you to ask if I may be considered for a place on your program .
I have all the characteristics which you require and , so , am an ideal person for the job .
I 've taught at many schools , including primary , so I have a good understanding of children .
As I 've also run the marathon three times and play in the local netball team , I am quite energetic , plus , I 'm also hardworking , as I try my best to achieve my ambition .
I become especially happy when I 'm with children !

country , Indonesia , is full of natural attractions .
It is an archipelago , so there are definitely many tourist spots here .
Also , you can interact for longer with other passengers , especially native Indonesians , just in case you need to find out more about Indonesia as you would like to get a temporary job here .
Indonesian people are famous for their friendliness , so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia ; they will answer your questions with pleasure .
Here are a few tips for starting a conversation with Indonesians : an Indonesian person will respond to a smile with a smile , so you can start with that . Not all Indonesians speak English , but most students can speak English .
I suggest you choose college students , because they are more familiar with English . Besides , they will welcome you with pleasure to practise their English skills . When you use public transportation , you can ask for the information you need from the official employee in the station or from students for the same reason ; not many Indonesians speak English .
Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people . Many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia .
The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than on the other islands mentioned above , but other islands are more challenging and natural .
It can be a little bit difficult to find a temporary job here , unless you have got any connections with agencies or local people .
Personally , I think this development has both positive and negative sides .
Thanks to increasing living standards , people are able to afford a bigger and more expensive wedding .
If , in the past , they just held weddings at home to save money , now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead .
Secondly , it is likely that , nowadays , people focus more on appearance , so a luxurious and elegant wedding is an opportunity for them to show off .
Finally , people have more relationships in life as well as in business .
As a result , more new relationships are created , people get more chance to co - ordinate in business and help each other in life .
Those who lose contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again .
Furthermore , modern weddings bring people new experiences of food , lifestyle and cultural exchange .
These big and expensive weddings waste a lot of money and time on preparation .
Grooms , brides and their parents usually have to book a restaurant , a hotel , invite a singer and a famous master of ceremonies to make the wedding serious .
To conclude , marriage is a landmark for an individual .
However , a wedding on a reasonable scale would both satisfy the guests and reduce the burden on the couple and their families .
Some days before , we had decided to organize an excursion to a nature trail nearby . As soon as we arrived at the railway station , we were so fascinated by what surrounded us that we walked for three hours along a path , Suddenly , our surroundings appeared to be far wilder than they had been before , so we stopped trekking and we had a look at our map .
We immediately turned towards the bushes . We were worried , as we had heard on the radio that a bear might live there .
Fortunately , it was a beautiful deer like Bambi , which looked at us and ran away more frightened than us .
Eventually , it was a special trip !
I am interested in the job because this would be an opportunity to spend my summer in a more fun way .
Another thing is that I would improve my skills in working with children and I would find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications .
I also take pleasure in playing tennis , for the benefits of practising sports and staying active .
Besides , I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor ones .
I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons : I am familiar with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one .
Another reason is that I have gained experience of taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a great sense of leadership , as well as the social skills needed , from being a scout for five years .
Because of that , I hope my letter will be taken into consideration .
At the end of the third school day , one of my classmates caught me in the hall and asked if I wanted to join them that night for dinner .
There was only one problem : I could not communicate well in English and I was really shy about it .
But when the dinner started , there was nothing to worry about , because my classmates appeared supportive and patient .
That evening was so delightful !
I told them about my country and family , I was speaking English and they were understanding me !
I am going to France this December , and Francois will show me independent Paris !
The artists invited all the staff to a big party in a restaurant .
It was unbelievable to speak with the artists and ask them questions about their life and habits .
Nowadays , it 's common to think that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport , but it 's not true at all .
Some surveys have demonstrated that travelling by car is more expensive than travelling by public transport .
Moreover , other costs will act upon the cost of travelling by private vehicle .
In the same surveys , the researchers show how travelling by public transport is safer than travelling by car .
Significant changes have to be made to ensure the quality of service and the conditions of the coaches , trains and other public means of transport .
In this way , the customer can feel as comfortable as they felt in their own cars .
The latest research carried out by The Health Department in Spain shows that young people are not as healthy as twenty years ago .
That could be a bigger problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could rise 60 % in the next 10 years .
Finally , it is proved that youths are devoting less time to doing exercise than they should and , as a consequence , they are not improving their general health enough .
As far as I am concerned , I think the Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertising campaigns in order to improve health in the young population .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should pay more attention to this matter and teach children how to develop a healthy lifestyle .
Travelling by car is only convenient in a restricted sense , while public transport is more convenient overall .
What is meant by a restricted sense , is that for adults , who are healthy and able bodied , having access to personal transportation is arguably quite attractive .
However , note my emphasis on adult , healthy and able - bodied . For young people , for older people , for people with disabilities , being able to drive brings more costs than benefits .
A public transport system is much more convenient for this group of people because they wo n't need to worry about the skill and attention needed for driving .
Furthermore , the monetary costs in the long run are much lower using public transport , both for individuals and for the wider society .
Even when celebrities are having holidays , people ask them to give them an autograph .
Hello James ! I have already read your email and I 'm going to try to give you some advice . I know you love doing sports , especially golf , and it helps you a lot to be in shape , but , do you really have to do it ?
The complexity of human behaviour is critical in sport .
As a result of this , many studies have shown that athletes should be motivated to push themselves beyond the record .
You need motivation to believe in yourself , that you can achieve it .
This attitude is especially true for sportsmen and women .
One of the most difficult sports on Earth will teach you what hard work , sacrifice , pain , strain but also satisfaction , determination , pride and struggle mean .
The complexities of swimming are not only for the body workout but above all for the mind .
If you want to swim every day , pushing yourself beyond your limits , you definitely need a strong psyche and solid motivation .
Furthermore , as Michael Phelps said : " There will be obstacles , there will be doubters , there will be mistakes , but with hard work ... there are no limits " .
