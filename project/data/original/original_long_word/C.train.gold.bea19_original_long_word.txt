People have had a need in communication since the dawn of time .
Every human being has a need in socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends .
Personally I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert ( or so I think ) .
It usually starts with small talks or compliments , as at school I was taught that expressing appritiation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationships .
A true friendship itself forms on a base of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time .
Mr Smith was found on the floor with next to him a glass , which was completely broken .
She opened the room with some keys that all the waitresses have , and saw Mr Smith lying dead on the floor .
The detectives analysed what was in the glass and it was poison .
In fact I discovered that Mr Smith 's nephew wanted all his fortune .
First I completely agree with this but then when I started to think about it I realized that it 's not like that .
Firstly I think that if you work as a team you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation you could have a better and more completely answer because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group .
In conclusion , I believe that it 's better to work as a team than to work on your own because they give you love , company and you could pass a very good time
It is well known that an image is better than a thousand words and that may be the reason for the success of television in a recent survey as the most important invention of the last 100 years .
However , this election could not be the wisest as there are other inventions more useful than television and with better future applications .
I am referring to the Internet . Born in the 1970 's as a military project to interconnect the missile facilities and the central headquarters , it soon spread to universities and educational centers .
This fact , along with the spreading of personal computers , quickly became in a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century .
Nobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements .
For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio , theater , cinema and , sadly , also books .
In its first years television was also an important channel to culture ( theater plays , classic films , etc . ) .
Unfortunately , in the last years television has lost this educational focus .
The Internet , on the other side , has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet does n't play a major role .
The Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows , especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV .
This experience is unbelievable and unforgettable to me .
While the fire was spreading all over the bedroom , I woke up and Matxi was unconscious because there was a lot of smoke in the bedroom .
Fortunately , we managed to wake her up .
At the beginning , we could n't stop the fire , and although this night sound impossible , we managed to put out the fire .
That day I was afraid , but now I remember this experience as a good time .
Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always space for further discussion .
Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages .
In smaller towns without underground there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area , so , all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you 'll reach the destination .
It is obvious that is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with an only person inside .
You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive ) pose a greater danger to road users than than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic .
Moreover , cities ' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment , lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity .
So , my opinion is that public transport does have the future . Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well .
Peter was already there and he immediately told Michael about a trip to Italy that he had planned for them .
Everything sounded great , they only needed a little bit more money and a car .
He knew that Peter was a little bit irisponcibile , but he taught that the arragement sounded perfect and nothing could go wrong .
He was thinking that this time it would be different , everything was planned and they will have a great time .
Alison read the note , smiled and immediately put on her coat .
Occasionally her older sister would watch her down from the hall and poke her index finger on her forehead . " What a jerk " she 'd mutter under her breath .
Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless his young age of seventeen , he would quit school and start earning money .
She was weak , but preferred to be called fragile , as if that made a significant difference .
Her major health problem was asthma , as well as anemia , low immune system and underweight .
But there 's something in her big bright eyes , circled with long brown eyelashes and frecles , that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom 's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing stare .
Small snub nose , full lips and high cheekbones .
Rest is anything but completely different .
That 's why Mary is constantly surrounded with a bunch of fellas meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back .
ROMEO AND JULIET , Franco Zeffirelli ( 1968 )
The best known love story of all time - Romeo and Juliet - has been adapted a number of times for the cinema and also made into successful musicals .
One of the most renowned romance films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968 .
The script is a faithful translation of the original text and the plot , as well , sticks to Shakespeare 's work .
This remarkable story is set in Verona in the 15th century .
The film , instead , was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn't even been filmed in Verona .
The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village .
The play becomes tremendously thrilling until the couple 's death .
The acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task , and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly .
Believable costumes and location , unforgettable soundtrack and outstanding performances celebrate a gripping and moving story that will charm you .
If you fancy travelling back in time , do n't miss this piece of art .
The aim of this report is to make suggestions about the facilities of the club .
The swimming pool is big enough and the temperature of the water is fine .
However the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week .
The gym is nice and comfortable , but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are actually in use .
Apart from the above mentioned points , there maybe so many other ideas which can make a big difference to the club .
Her family and her homeland had disappeared .
But , just as hope almost disappeared , she had remembered the words of the old lady .
As unbelievable as it seems , it had been a gate of time .
It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed , but Alice 's willingness had been stronger than her fears .
She , without any hesitation , had gone through the gate .
More specifically , it was Alice when she was starting her journey .
And finally , she went on to her destination , her beloved homeland .
Has you told me that I will win some literary competitions and that some people will speak well of me , I would n't have believe you .
The year was 2012 and I had n't written anything until that day - I just had been translating some stories and once even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish .
But that day - it was on spring and I believe it was Thursday - my English teacher told us about a literary competition .
And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email .
First days I was a little bit nervous but day by day I started forgetting about any competition .
And the more won competitions , the more proud was I of myself .
Disassembling games , building things of wood and playing Lego were my favorite hobbies .
Through the years , my interest in machines and electrical devices increased , so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance , and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down .
When I was in secondary school , and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists , I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer , so I entered the scientific branch .
During my study , my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics .
Also , I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry , that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering .
Since I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering , I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America .
After searching and asking , I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities , and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways .
Moreover , Germany is one of the biggest industrial countries in the world and it has many huge factories .
Additionally , the living costs are quite affordable .
I have been working as a teacher of mechanical materials in a vocational school since my graduation .
I really like this profession and how good it feels to spread science and knowledge to new generations .
Therefore , I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university .
I have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to .
First , I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program .
Second , TU - Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de .
Third , TU - Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a language center .
Finally , TU - Clausthal located in fascinating nature .
I hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world .
The most common reasons to study a language are the job and travelling .
Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentences in a few days .
All things considered , I think that English is the easiest option when you want to study a language .
Whereas there are a lot of options , we rarely start learning other language before we can communicate well in English .
Digital advertising ; an exciting but undesirable business
It is indisputable that advertising has become a permanent fixture in our daily lives .
Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment , it was welcomed as fun and informative .
It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore .
But we have now entered a new era of the attention - grabbing business : its digitalisation .
Their transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all - pervasive .
Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day .
Those involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them .
Multimedia , advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age , unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers .
They have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is : a nuisance .
The result are insincere , misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter .
I am writing with regard to the campaign that you are promoting in favour of an international sports competition that could be hosted in my town .
As a matter of fact Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition , which will last one day
The marathonetscoming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city , which offers a great deal of facilities
There are two separate communication networks in the city , that of the waterways and that of the narrow streets .
Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night .
Hotel receptions and travel agencies are always ready to help their guests with a wide range of information on the city 's entertainments , exhibitions and so on .
Sightseeing and excursions with private local guides are available on request .
In addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres , cinemas and night - clubs .
On the contrary participants will find a wide range of restaurants , trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food .
Some of these restaurants can be quite expensive .
In conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants .
Yours faithfully
I had asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed .
It was NICKELBACK !
My name is Lorin and I am 13 years old . I live in Djursholm at Riddarvägen 42 , close to a field .
I compete in skiing and I think it 's very funny . I often go skiing in Åre , Vemdalen and in Ramundberget .
Once every year I ski with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt .
In Zermatt you can see the mountain Matterhorn ( the mountain that you see on toblerone package ) .
In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called Kålhuvudet .
That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun .
My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree . I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them .
My favourite song is a song called Chandelier with an artist called Sia .
I like sushi because the combination with fish , rice and soya makes it delicious .
I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with béarnaise , it is a very good combination .
My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called dahlboms in Åre because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever .
The moment he reached the light everything changed .
Local people were invited and a talent competiton was held .
Everything started on Saturday afternoon on the main square in Krakow .
Number of people exceeded my expectations !
Generally , bands played great , but of course there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it did n't matter so much .
Unfortunately , not all of the food was tasty , so one of the thing I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoid the hot dogs .
It was fantastic experience , especially for people for which it was intended .
You wo n't be disappointed .
To be honest , I 've never understood why you enjoy boxing anyway .
Having said that , I also must admit that I know how hardworking you can be .
You 've been suspiciously quiet about that recently .
I discovered the English language when I was eight , and that amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course .
English was also the key for my passion for technology , the more that I understood the language , the more I understood how to use computers and the internet .
That is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences , and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential .
Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language , the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area , for it 's great universities and educational system .
I am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group , that , with the local city hall of Araraquara , aims to transform the city into a national technology , research and software producing center , accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and alghoritms to kids , diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses .
To bring back from this exchange technical knowledge in programming , as well as new methods of teaching , would be outstanding .
Although I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level , this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic grounds and interpersonal communication , as all of the most relevant papers , research and journals are written in English , I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good material for the scientific community , and to communicate better with all cultures .
In Brazil , there is a huge lack of professionals on the field of information technology in both academic and work market , travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qualify me in both areas .
Although I prefer the academic field , working in a company related to software design and creation would be a marvellous way of gaining experience in the field .
I would be happy too , if by any chance I could apply to summer jobs or internships , as another way of gaining experience .
Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market work for both academic and work careers .
In conclusion , I want to study in the U.S. for it 's differentiated educational system , for the work and research opportunities that I might find , to know better a culture that amazes me for its capacity to innovate in all fields , to become fluent in a language that I love , to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here , and , in long - term , become a better professional or teacher , with a good and solid background on computer sciences , information technology and finally , system analysis and development .
I am writing to inform you about the most beautiful places and interesting buildings in Vilnius .
This castle is very old and it is surrounded by water .
It is very beautiful and there are many interesting things to see in this castle .
This castle consists of many buildings and even underground tunnels .
Yours faithfully ,
" Installation art " is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media art works , used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way , different from traditional arts .
Installations are usually placed in big spaces because they have an important structure with the main task of making people reflect on something important that the artist needs to communicate to the biggest number of people .
Personally , I have seen only one " installation art " .
The second , in the centre of the stand , was a column made of coloured plastic baskets , surrounded by plastic bottles .
The artist wanted to represent the difference between the ecological recycling of plastic compared to the common collection of trash .
Seeing it for the first time it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile .
Only after having read the explanation it was possible to appreciate the installation art , and to have the complete attention to its meaning and shape .
Despite their beauty , new form of arts are very complicated to understand , especially compared to classical arts .
Seeing a Da Vinci 's portrait or a landscape painting , it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted .
At first sight those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer , and the name of the piece helps to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece .
On the other hand , looking at an installation art it is harder to have a clear emotion at the first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist .
In conclusion I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason , to communicate something .
In every historic period , artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways .
Classical art was more easy for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous , while modern arts are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance .
In my opinion the difference between installation arts and classical arts stands in the feeling that they can suscitate in the audience .
My name is Melissa , I am 14 years old and I can speak English . I love summer camps because you learn so much in them and have wonderful experiences too .
I have experience in looking after children .
Kitesurfing - this sport discipline is getting more and more popular not only in countries such as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , but also in other ones , just like Poland or Germany !
A feeling of being completely free , a joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board , an incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy .
When I tried kitesurfing by myself for the first time , I was a little bit scared . "
Despite the fact that it seems hard , kitesurfing is one of the easiest water sports !
My only advice is : go to the seaside , find a nice camp for surfers with a good instructor , and enjoy your moments of freedom !
During the concert I was responsible for supervision of sort - out in toiletes .
By the way , I met there your exgirlfriend with her new boyfriend .
Tell me everything about your new girlfriend .
Thus came the question of what I was going to do next , but I was n't ready to make that descission back then so with agreement of my parents I decided to take a gap - year .
The journey to the United States was surprisingly good , I had some friends on the plan who were going to the same destination as me and I actually did n't miss my family that much .
I also got to know myself better and I have reached a descission of what I want to do next year , I am going to study at the university .
So if you are ever even considering the fact of taking a gap - year , do n't doubt , just do it .
I was wondering that maybe it 's just my imagination .
Eventually , I slowly opened the door and came out of my room .
It was reassuring to hear a familiar voice .
We at Madhura Nagar , understand the need of protecting the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on it so that people can use them instead of plastic bags .
Each year , we encourage school - going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment .
We encourage people who come up with any innovative thoughts about how we could further protect the environment .
Besides this , we often visit our neighbouring towns and educate them on the issues of global warming , the threat to ecological balance etc . , and guide them on how to protect our environment .
I would like to apply for the job as a security guard for the Openair Frauenfeld as advertised in your Facebook - post from the 18th of July .
With these experiences I can safely escort people , which are knocked out or a bit ill and ca n't stand the concert anymore , out of a concert and help them .
I haven't got a family so I am independent and able to work wherever I can .
I feel I have the right experiences and attitude to be a great member of the crew and I hope you will consider my application favorably .
The only exception is volleyball - I just ca n't play it , I even do n't know why .
But I love basketball and handball - especially the first one - every time when we are playing basketball at school during Physical Education , I 'm so happy about it and I do my best . I do n't know how to explain why I love this game so much .
Maybe it 's because in basketball , you have to run a lot and you have to be really fast , and my second favourite sport is running .
Anyway - if someone asked me for advice about basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't the best player on the world . I 'm also not .
But no matter how fabulous it looks , it brings some consequences and even problems .
One of the biggest disadvantages of being popular is that they are on everybody 's lips .
Public loves to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details .
Whether they like it or not , they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them in every single moment of their life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being .
In my opinion , journalists and paparazzi should n't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life .
For example , when a popular film star goes to hospital because of his relative 's illness , reporters and photographers in particular should stay away and leave the celebrity alone .
Even though they are well known , they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them .
It has been an important subject especially for writers from the ' ' first generation '' like William Wordsworth ; he saw nature as an inseparable reality from man , whereas it comforts in sorrow and teaches to love and to act in a moral way .
It is associated with strong emotions caused natural spectacles , like hurricanes , waterfalls or starry sky
The sublime inspired many writers likeW. Wordworth and S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the view of infinite spaces , like desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the sublime that Wordswoth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Romantic sublime : forms of nature that inspire feeling of awe , danger or weakness .
Also Coleridge had a concept of sublime , but for him it was associated with infinite spaces and the sense of perdition and suspense .
It was an amazing and very instructive summer camp and I must say that I am the proud owner of the captain camp assistant badge .
It was in my duty to make sure everything was running smoothly , according to the program and I had to supervise and direct the other assistants if any problems should occur .
I have been volunteering for St John Ambulance for 6 years now and I can say that it is a truly amazing and eye opening experience .
Thank you for taking the time to read my application and I am looking forward to hearing from you .
The art of making a good impression .
An old saying goes ' You never get a second chance to make a first impression ' .
That 's always important when you meet someone for the first time , but especially when you come to a job interview .
Here are some tips to help you get a positive first impression .
You should dress appropriately for the job that you want to get .
Men should wear a suit and a tie , and women should wear an appropriate blouse and skirt or pants .
Everyone should have clean hands and fingernails .
When you first meet the interviewer , shake his or her hand firmly .
Then you should thank the interviewer for the invitation .
Instead of that you should show that you have experience or specific education in the area .
Try to avoid using filler words such as " like " , or " um " because they tell the interviewer that you 're nervous .
Never use monosyllabic answers .
Going on a job interview can be a stressful experience for even the most job seekers but if you use these tips , the first impression of you will be positive .
I am writing in response to the article about friendship that was published in your magazine .
I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation .
First of all , as far as special friendships are concerned , I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily , consequently I do not have a large circle of friends .
However , I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person .
Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend .
Throughout this friendship I have been given the support , the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams .
On the other hand , friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship .
Secondly , I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort .
A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart .
For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants , simply because they are not the same people as they were before .
As you gradually grow up your world expands , your personality changes and so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school , getting our first job or changing the old one , travelling or moving to another city .
All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones .
To summarize , I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it .
Yours faithfully ,
Viña del Mar is a wonderful city on the west coast of Central Chile and boasts a number of shopping facilities and different sorts of attractions for tourists of all ages .
The biggest and best one is the Marina Arauco Shopping Centre , located on 15 Norte St. It has two anchor department stores , Almacenes Paris and Almacenes Ripley , one at each end of the mall which is two blocks long .
There are four floors , each of which contains different departments of the anchor stores , and a number of small shops which sell a variety of products .
There is also a food court on the third floor , catering to all sorts of customers , as well as a few restaruants on the first and second floors .
There are two underground floors for parking , which can get a bit crowded at peak seasons , but which are very reasonably priced .
Nearby there is also a large supermarket and a home store which offers products for building purposes , also connected to a shopping gallery .
This street runs from the Viña Square towards the sea for about six or seven blocks , and has many small shops and businesses which attract a lot of people .
There are several supermarkets and two anchor shops at one end of the street , which are convenient shopping venues for people who live in the city centre .
There are also other areas in Viña del Mar where groups of shops have concentrated so as to offer facilities to residential areas , also convenient for people who live in the surroundings .
All in all , I consider there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town , so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer .
How my town takes care of the environment :
Introduction :
This report has the aim to show and discuss the main ways to reduce the pollution and to take care of the environment in Zaragoza .
Some information about what people do with their rubbish and how they try to keep the area clean , is described in the following lines .
Also , Zaragoza is provided with a number of collection points , where rubbish with big dimensions such as furniture can be collected and recycled .
There is a law which states that if someone throws rubbish such as papers , cigarettes or chewing gum to the street , they may be punished with a fine which could increase up to $ 100 .
A team of professional cleaners responsible for keeping the streets clean , scheduled every four hours and divided by areas .
A commercial team responsible for raise awareness of the critical situation the environment is suffering .
Conclusion :
Zaragoza 's population is aware of the importance of keeping the town clean and so they 're willing to do plenty of things to avoid the pollution and its environmental consequences .
I 've always liked to play with kifds and make fun activities with them .
My favorite activities would be : painting , and making up fun games .
I can cook anything , really , just give me the ingredients and I 'll make you whatever you want .
-Help organise sports and evening activities .
They announced that the Big One earthquake would occur that afternoon at 7:00 PM approximately , so they alerted that people had to leave the city or go to save places in the few hours .
Peter and his father were very busy solving problems of neighbours and it took them some hours .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I have really enjoyed SAWAN 2015 , and I would definitely participate in it again .
Narwal Ji has supported me throughout the preparation of this program .
As someone who hasn't sung classical before and has no background in Hindi Singing , I found it very confronting to sing at a concert after only four months of training .
He had given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginner singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate .
He has given me a large amount of motivation , which led me to come all the way from Canberra to Melbourne to perform in this concert .
The night had been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence a greatly .
In addition to this , the night was beautifully organised and each performance was professionally executed .
An original mix of cultures were represented consistently .
Overall the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching .
We will take great pleasure in helping the students to get around and feel at home in their accommodation .
We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations , and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour at and around the Grand Place of Brussels .
Away from busy and noisy roads , the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries ; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houess and shops in light colours and old - fashioned roofs .
We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to .
Most of the year I live in Poznań , because of my studies at the University , but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends .
Last summer I decided to do something more than just relax and have fun , so I started to look for an interesting summer job .
Like I previously said , Kętrzyn is a rather small town , so there is only one old movie theatre and it 's closed for most the time .
You know how much I love watching movies , especially in small and cosy movie theatres .
The main reason why I loved to work there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted .
There is only one auditorium so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes , for family shows , there was a 15 minutes break in the middle of the show , for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks .
This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere , regular visitors and people I worked with .
I bet it is an interesting story .
Re : Application for Primary 1
We do hope that she can be granted a second interview as we are very appreciated with your school vision , upholding the spirit of Faith , Hope and Love to nurture students .
Our elder daughter , Tsz Yin who is currently in Form 4 of St. Paul 's Co - educational College Secondary School ( " SPCC " ) , greatly enjoys her school life and at the same time achieved good results in the past three years .
She highly recommends your school to Tsz Huan and us .
And she has written a letter to you asking for granting Tsz Huan an opportunity to grow up in the family of St Paul 's .
It goes without saying , we would like to provide the best we can for the development of our children - Tsz Yin and Tsz Huan .
To enhance our parent - child relationship and facilities our understanding of her school and social life , we participate in kindergarten 's volunteer group .
We regularly go to parks , libraries , museums , visit the countryside together , and occasionally go on family holidays overseas .

The line graph illustrates the amount and type of fast food eaten by teenagers in Australia between 1795 and 2000 .
As an overall trend , it is clear that consumption of fish and chips decreased over the period while the amount of pizzas and hamburgers eaten increased during the same period .
In 1975 the consumption of fish and chips was ten times higher than the consumption of the other two types of fast food .
In contrast , the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975 , and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times respectively in 1995 .

The place is very near where I live , and I 've worked in a lot of Cafes before , unfortunately I had to leave them for school and college .
Work in the Cafe will also allow me to meet people from the neighborhood , which is very important for me right now , since I just moved in .
I can show all my recommendation letters from my previous jobs , but I 'll say right now that they all say good things about me .
I try to never let my personal problems interfere in my professional life , and if it does some day , I would ask you to tell me , so I can change .
I 'll take my time to practise everything I can at home .
Set in in the late 1950s France , Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different : whether they are gypsies , women that do n't depend on men , or people that do n't share the Christian faith .
The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher , a single mother and chocolate expert , opening a ' chocolaterie ' right before Lent in a small , close - minded French village , the mayor of which decides to boycott her .
During Lent , the protagonist gets to know other outcasts ( mainly women ) and help them .
One of the strengths of the film is its star - studded cast : Juliette Binoche as Vianne , Alfred Molina as the mayor , Judi Dench as a grumpy , elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village , and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan .
Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors do n't fail in bringing them to life .
Besides the cast , I would like to highlight the original soundtrack .
It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie , with a little bit of jazz manouche , a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities , and reminiscences of Mexican folklore , as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ' chocolaterie ' are a heritage from her Maya ancestors .
If I had to find a down side to Chocolat , it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines .
Had it not been written in the year 2000 , but today , I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters .
All in all , this is a gripping , moving , and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues .
A must - see if , like me , you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles , but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story .
Michael Clifford was a lucky man who had everything he could ever want : he was a thirty - year - old English businessman married to a sophisticated mathematician with whom he had two sons and a pretty talented daughter ; he owned a successful corporation and had a gorgeous chalet near the sea .
One night , having ended a meeting with an important sponsor , Michael decided to enter a pub with one of his colleagues in order to celebrate the successful meeting .
Travelling has become a great part of our daily lives , whether we only go to the nearby grocery store or choose to visit our relatives who live in another country .
Modern means of transport are constantly improving , being faster and more comfortable than ever before .
However , it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and personal transport , because they have both advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel .
Another advantage of cars is the fact that they are family friendly , meaning that people who use them do n't have to worry about travelling with strangers who might be dangerous .
Travelling across the Atlatic Ocean for example requires an airplane or a ship .
Trains are a great way of transport across intercontinental distances , especially since they have become faster .
Statistically speaking , car accidents are much more frequent than plane crashes or train accidents , so public transport is not only cheaper sometimes , but it 's also safer and faster .
Airplanes , busses , trains or ships are here to stay because they are more practical in some situations .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter flew from the classroom and tried to squeeze himself between the multiple students that were evacuating their classes .
All of them anxious to get outside and relax for a few hours Suffering from an endless punishment : knowledge .
As he got near his destination the density of students seemed to grow and it was becoming even more difficult for him to advance in that sea of moving bodies .
Fortunatley ,
Besides their past we can , fortunately adore their beauty .
One of these places is , undoubtedly , Kazimierz , the Old Jewish district of Cracow .
In this small part of Cracow , you can meet with Jewish culture and the architectural style .
It was established in 1800 .
For those who enter it will be an ' unforgettable ' experience .
Then , you really must visit the synagogues : The Temple Synagogue , Isaac Synagogue , The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue .
For the history lovers , I recommend going to the Historical Museum of The History and Culture of Jewish People .
It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century .
Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts , graphics and paintings .
You can buy there almost everything : fresh fruits , vegetables , and household products .
In my view , I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets , especially in terms of their personality development .
Specifically , they learn to take responsibility when taking care of pets .
I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then .
So , according to my personal experiences , I think that children can benefit from keeping a pet .
Some people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time , instead of children themselves .
Nevertheless , what those people have claimed is a digression from the topic here .
In other words , taking care of pets is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they are given an opportunity .
Moreover , children can also learn to sympathize with others by keeping a pet , apart from leaning to be responsible .
After that day , I started to be able to sympathize with people who have lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation .
Thus , keeping pets does enable people to be able to put themselves in others ' shoes .
Given upon my personal experiences , by taking care pets , children not only can learn to take responsibility , but also can learn to sympathize with others .
In other words , keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personality development .
On the other hand , if children are not allowed to keep a pet , the parents will have to come up with other ways to make the children both responsible and sympathetic .
We always believe that a city should never compromise the environment for the sake of development .
Not only financial development but also the environment is essential to a healthy city .
With this belief , we endeavor to keep our city as clean and attractive as possible .
Here , we are proud to report our accomplishments thus far .
Reducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of utmost importance in this regard .
Hence , we have incorporated the concept of environmental protection into our curriculum so that students can develop an awareness of the matter at a young age .
Different activities , including seminars and exhibitions have been held in different districts to spread the message of environmental conservation across the community .
Public Housing Estate Recycle Competitions have also been held every year to promote the concept of recycling plastic , paper or tin and to help the residents cultivate such a habit in daily life .
Tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools , community centres , etc .
Eco - tour is also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and , above all , to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature .
With concerted efforts , we have made a great stride in environmental protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of waste and increasing number of greenery .

Fortunately , Turkey postponed the law coming into force .
The round table in St. Petersburg State University has attracted quite a large audience .
During the break the participants enjoyed traditional Turkish sweets .
People often forget how important it is to help save the environment on a day - to - day basis , yet I believe it is not only the first step , but the most important to public awareness .
Living in a big city I can cycle to work every day , which I believe is a great way to exercise and reduce my environmental footprint .
Besides , cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and fowls ' chicks growing up , reminding me of the beauty of nature .
However I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources ; we are , obviously , very careful with turning off the taps as we wash our hands , brush our teeth and so on , and we recycle as much as possible .
We feed worms our food and organic waste , which has drastically decreased it .
Composting has made us more aware of our waste and the amount of packaging in the items we buy .
I 'd definitely recommend it to everyone , whether they live in a flat or in a house with a garden .
We live in the mass consumption century , when it requires more and more time of our daily routines .
For some this activity is a torture , for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time .
First of all , shopping is unavoidable as it is necessary to shop for food .
It depends on a person how often he goes to grocery , probably according to individual needs .
Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater variety of goods , but require more time , while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly .
Secondly , shopping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before annual celebrations , or during seasonal sales .
Hundreds gather there , parking spaces are full , again facing longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds , it is the reality of nowadays .
Afterwards some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it causes more tension and disimproves mood !
Also , some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential , they are attracted by commercials , advertisements , sales assistant recommendations , so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything , as they are excited by the shopping process itself , it causes regrets and financial problems afterwards .
Finally , it may be very fatigue , as you may waste the precious time just by walking around but not finding the thing are interested in and need .
On the other hand , the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions , without any rush , they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes , best quality garmets , stylish items .
Although , shopping may be entertaining , it is still a time consuming and tiresome job .
Being busy and spending time looking for clothes , presents , souvenirs , furniture or healthcare products especially for women may be a perfect way of spending even all day .
On the other hand , searching for your favourite brands , non - seasonal products , some special goods , just looking through shelves , trying the garmets on you , asking for consultations , testing products , there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it , after entering a colourful and attractive store .
Fortunately , this unnavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore , as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save time , money and energy for those who are not that willing to hit the mall .
It all began with my older sister Jennifer , as everything used to begin with her .
She always wanted to be in the spotlights , in which she had always succeeded , since everyone adored her .
Quite understandable , because Jennifer had the most beautiful , big blue eyes as well as thick blonde hair , a magnificent smile and an outstanding shape .
Until we received that remarkable letter , I had always been in her shadow .
Oh my God , I look absolutely gorgeous in this dress ! , " she shouted . "
Jennifer had auditioned , and she was 100% sure that she would become the main woman .
I had also auditioned , only because my best friends pushed me very hard , and I was 100% sure that I would n't even get a small role in the play .
She immediately ran to the doormat , ran back to the living room and showed me the envelope in her hands .
Unfortunately , your audition was really bad , Jennifer , so we could not give you a role in our play .
I could n't believe my ears ! I , Carly Brown , the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones , the most beautiful girl in town , was chosen to become the main woman in a big play !
The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place .
English economy changed from an agriculture one to an industrial one : in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygienic conditions , the landscape changed a lot and also houses , shops and people .
These strong changes influenced very much the poetry and we can see that for example in Blake , because in " The Tyger " he uses a lot of colors referred to the industrial life ( red , orange , silver .. ) and he describes the Tyger 's creator as an artisan that create it on a furnace .
Instead the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the idea of freedom , fraternity and equality , so also these concepts influenced strongly the poetry of the period .
We can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley 's " Ode to the West Wind " , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; instead , in the " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " , we can see the brotherhood of mariners in the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all the God 's creatures .
The idea of brotherhood is present also in " I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud " by Wordsworth because he sees nature , daffodils in this case , as a friend to men .
During recent thirteen years , the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries .
This essay will examine some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food .
First of all is convenience .
People who have just done their work are very hungry ; they can not go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs , so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger .
There are numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built everywhere .
On the other hand , eating fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer 's health .
Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers .
According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon .
Furthermore , most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full .
Finally is the loss of traditional meals .
As the consequence , they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone .
In conclusion , there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of fast food .
Some advantages are that fast food can help to save time and deal with the temporary hunger for white - collar - worker , but it can also harm their health .
Facebook is the most popular social networking site of all time .
First of all , I think Facebook , for example , is a great way for shy people to socialize , because it can boost their self - esteem , considering the fact that they do n't have to meet anyone face - to - face .
It 's also great if we want to manage our friendships , or create new ones .
As a shy person , I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interacion .
Social networking sites also benefit those who have " unusual " hobbies or those who have a hard time finding people with similar interests .
On the other hand , we are also exposed to many risks , such as cyberbullying or online predators .
While it can seem harmless , cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers , such as depression , suicidal thoughts or even worse .
To conclude , although social media seems flawless , we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up .
I saw the advertisement for a job to work this summer camp .
I am really hardworking and love kids , I used to babysit for my neighbour 's kids , so looking after kids will be easy for me .
I am also very cheerful and energetic , and am very good at organising fun activities .
Working in the kitchen does not seem so bad either , because I know that everything depends on our attitude and if I have a positive attitude I 'll have a good time no matter if I 'm doing a fun activity or cleaning dishes .
I hope you think I 'm the right person for this , I think this would be a great experience for me as well as for the kids .
This is certainly true and corresponds with my experience .
I feel that this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing nature of modern societies .
In the past , it was the norm for people to live in a limited geographical area all their lives and be involved in the same type of occupation all their working lives .
There was simply no alternative to this , especially if you lived in an agricultural society .
However , with the rise of industry and specialized companies , it became possible for workers to move jobs , often to places far away .
With the opportunity for change comes choice , although circumstances , economic and personal , can often force people to do what they might not normally choose .
This might be because they have strong obligations to family , might need to look after someone or might simply not have marketable skills to find a livelihood somewhere else .
It is perhaps the majority nowadays who find change refreshing because of the new opportunities it holds out and the possibilities of getting on professionally and socially .
Even though the boat was ready to go Jessica was afraid for it to break in pieces again , she almost could foresee that forthcoming heavy rain destroying her boat , so she had an idea .
Meanwhile Jacob is completely in love with that girl he met weeks before , her name was Scarlett , she said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high - tech portable device that will change gravity in low levels and in a short period of time , like a fraction of a second , but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive , but as her dad continued with the experiment his boss got so mad he kicked them from the city into that mysterious island .
She also explained that they did n't know how the majority of people on the island got there , thereby not all of them spoke the same language , but they learned how to communicate with signs .
Abortion is a controversial issue in our society today .
Some Pro - choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice , this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not .
Contradicting the Pro - choice groups , Pro - life supporters consider terminating any pregnancy unjustifiable .
Even though in some circumstances , such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies , it could be the best thing to do .
Abortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies .
The presence of a mother is important in a child 's life especially in the first few months .
During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops .
The baby 's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation , is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother 's empathetic response .
( Lier.l,1988 )
This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child 's development could be in this case negatively influenced .
Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result .
The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult - life .
Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option .
Besides , abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse .
Impregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice .
Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims , all areas of a victim 's life is affected .
Recovering is a hard and complicated process and when you add a pregnancy to this equation it just makes it even more painful .
Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy , and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly .
Even if , abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases , it is not a solutions for accidental pregnancies .
It is for the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception .
In order to prevent this , it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option .
Abortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies or if the mother has been sexually molested .
Undeterred by this , it still the mother 's decision if she wants to save her own life or carry and care for her rapist child .
I am pleased to recommend Dr. Oscar Montés for a teaching position at IHME and the Department of Global Health within the School of Medicine and the School of Public Health at the University of Washington .
I had the opportunity to be a student and work as a research assistant with Dr. Montés in the same field .
I can definitely affirm that he has excellent teaching skills .
He taught to people from different backgrounds , to undergraduate and postgraduate students , and managed to explain difficult public health topics marvellously .
Also in Master 's degree final project II , Dr Montés helped us to accomplish the master 's degree thesis with excellence .
In my work as a research assistant for Dr. Montés , I experienced great learning in many fields , not only in Public Health topics but also in research methodology , public speaking , and writing .
I witnessed and learn form his ability to work with other faculties such as Faculty of Medicine , Department of Engineering , Faculty of Economics , and School Law .
Moreover , we developed projects with multidisciplinary teams for the following institutions : the Colombian Ministry of Health , and the World Bank with excellent results .
I reckon Dr Montés fulfils the requirements of the position you offer .
Since he has great expertise teaching , and an excellent boss , respectful of the opinion , time , and personal background of everybody .
In the letter he complaints about the out - of - date system of schools in Italy and he made some suggestions about how this could be overcome by major educational reforms .
First of all , the professor says that the majority of Italian teachers are not well prepared to do their work and , consequently , students do n't achieve the skills they should to success in a future work , but I do n't agree with this statement .
As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain .
They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience , as something their future is based on .
I agree with this recommendation because I think it 's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year , offering always new materials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier .
This is what , in my opinion , must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate " out - of - date " system .
However , it also has some disadvantages .
On the one hand , I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information on textbooks because they have existed for many centuries .
Furthermore , if you go to a library , you could spend all day seeing books and learning about different things so in these places there are many ancient books .
On the other hand , I personally think that pupils enjoying more working with textbooks because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other .
Taking everything into account , in my opinion every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education .
As a writer - to - be I admire her work creating a fantastic world of magic and epic as well as dark characters which are recognizable all around the globe .
His ' Song of fire and ice ' saga has been brought into the television world in the name of Game of thrones and it is currently being awarded as the best drama tv series of all times .
However , when talking about great achievements , I will always talk about people like Nelson Mandela , Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks .
My fascination about those people is that they fought for their people 's rights , black race 's rights , in a world of white people treating them as slaves and bullying them .
That is why , nowadays , I feel a huge admiration for Malala Youszafi .
Our house is clean and comfortable , me and my family love to spend time at home .
Every weekend we leave everything and meet to spend time together , to share news , love and plans .
Sometimes our kids invite friends and today my son came with his girlfriend .
Friends , colleagues , family all thes people who was next to me on this way to this wonderful day .
If you 've been following my blog , you 'll know that I 've been on a journey of discovery and creation concerning using technology to create materials and using technology to teach .
I checked the equipment : I had a computer and projector , both in good working order , a fast internet connection and a full class .
As soon as the lights went out , the atmosphere changed in the classroom and I felt the tension rise .
One student said that she could n't see well , another student complained that the writing was too small , another felt she was getting too hot from the projector .
This is a group of beginners , the experience of a first lesson with a new teacher is daunting enough , without adding unfamiliar technology and teaching methods .
So I switched off the projector , took out my white board pen , dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching .
We 've had three lessons so far and I 'm thoroughly enjoying teaching this group ; it 's a pleasure to teach face - to - face and a challenge to teach adults at this level ; it 's really great to get ' back to basics ' .
This experience has reminded me that although there are many advantages to using technology in the class room , it 's not always appropriate and it 's helped me to establish some equilibrium in my teaching methods .
Instead of creating some online lessons for this wonderful group , I have taken the opportunity to create some new printable materials to hand out in class .
This post will be the first of three on the topic of the Present Simple tense , it contains a printable infographic covering the basics of the Present Simple and two printable worksheets .
Nowadays , there is an increasing concern about the health of young people , since there is no doubt that it is getting worse .
To begin with , recent statistics reveal that obese adolescents ' ratio is rising .
And last but not least , it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop their social and intellectual skills .
The reasons could be , firstly , fast food is cheaper and very accessible for young people .
In addition , spending too much time in activities like watching TV , surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports .
And finally , teenagers may become more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers .
Actually , it is not complicated to change habits in order to be healthier .
For instance , filling the fridges with a great amount of fresh fruit and vegetables , doing some exercise and have some fun with friends regularly .
I 'd like to find a part - time job but first of all I have to find an apartment to live , so I was wondering if you can look for a small apartment where I can live in ; it would be better if it 's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time .
Would you be so kind as to let me know if there are some restaurants or pubs that need staff ?
Advances in computer science have created a tremendous leap in technical innovations .
One of the most recent outstanding innovations is robotics .
Lavine , Voss and Coontz ( 2007 ) define robotics as the combination of " automation with action and at times a considerable amount of mobility " which is " becoming more and more humanoid"(p .
The more computer science influences human 's lives , the more important status robotics has in the field of engineering .
Only a decade year ago , robotics was just limited to scientific research .
However , today it is used in more fields , such as medical treatment , elderly - nursing and archaeological studies , as well as education .
This essay will discuss the current social consequences of robotics in the area of education , and then conclude by commenting on its possible future implications .
In the first place , robotics activity could provide learners with real situations which are related to irrelative courses , especially in scientific and medical ones .
2012 ) described an experiment from Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation .
The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots , out of 98 candidates , only 22% students correctly gave the diagnoses .
From a survey , 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training , whilst 63% of them thought it had a great value in training for surgical treatment .
It is obvious that in this experiment , students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also realize weakness of students specifically .
University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment , which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I - BLOCKS ( a modular electronic building block system ) could do on language tests .
Surprisingly , the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not .
Furthermore , the I - BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are smart to react to surroundings , and build binary expression to calculate in real - time and show both final results and sub - results ( Lund , Marti , & Palma , as cited in Nielsen & Lund , 2008 ) .
With the help of robotics , like I - BLOCKS , students and teachers might spend less time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well .
Nevertheless , robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate which is always the reason why operators are distracted .
Suh et al . ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to do tasks .
Two groups of participants were asked to do suture - tying task and a secondary task with distraction , such as decision - making , memory - task .
They are Group A : ten medical students aged 19 - 27 who only had general knowledge about surgery , and Group B : four experienced surgical postgraduates .
It was found that there was an apparent difference on average speed and completion time when comparing tasks from students with basic knowledge and the one from another group .
Moreover , in the task with distraction , experienced group was 1/3 - 1/2 faster in analyzing .
It is possible that the robotics would be a normal part of individual 's lives .
Mordoch et al.(2012 ) made some examples of robotics in daily lives : social human - robot , social assistive robot , therapeutic robot , mental commitment robot , care robot , robot - therapy .
To a country , robotics could be new weapons for the future technological wars .
However , there is some debate that it is against ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers ( Troop , 2012 ) .
However , disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to human 's lives .
In conclusion , with technology and computer science developing , application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now .
Besides influences on education , robotics has an effect on medical treatment , nursing and even design to future war as well .
Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages , its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve application of robotics .
Public transport is so necessary in big cities that car industry is continuously developing new means of transport .
Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute , but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes .
On the other hand , public transport is not so accepted in small villages , as it is not possible to offer a wide range of services and timetables .
Some places have scenic beauty in abundance while many are famous for their architectural wonders .
In addition every person has different tastes , choices and preferences .
Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty ; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interests .
I have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries like Belgium , Great Britain , Spain and others .
But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of Red Square .
An enormous 400 by 150 metres , Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin , GUM ( Department Store ) , State Historical Museum and Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos ( aka St. Basil 's Cathedral ) centres of government , commerce , history and religion .
The must - see place is St. Basil 's Cathedral , the beautiful architectural symbol of Russia .
At the northern end of the square you will find the State History Museum with its huge collection of artefacts charting Russia 's past right back to the stone age .
Indeed , the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and have unique spirit .
All these Victorian novelists use very detailed descriptions of places , people and feelings in order to make their novels as realistic as possible .
Anyway , Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism , which mixes comedy and pathos , while the Brontë sisters ' realism is plenty of Romantic and Gothic elements and it 's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors , where they grew up .
In addition , Dickens , as long as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels , uses quite frequently the first - person narration .
For example , in " David Copperfield " , Dickens 's most autobiographical novel , the story is talked with a first - person narration with the point of view of the protagonist as an adult .
Charlotte Brontë uses the same technique in Jane Eyre , her masterpiece .
Tennis is made of several ingredients : suspense , emotions , physical skills and training are combined with tactics and intelligence .
Athletic performance is definitely enhanced by having a fine physique and natural skills .
Nevertheless , a strong and balanced mind plays a huge role in the game of tennis , as shown by famous tennis champions , like Michael Chang and Justine Henin .
Much shorter than their fellow colleagues , they have always been able to compensate for their physical lacks with an extremely good tecnique accompanied by a strong head .
You have never to surrender : until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground , you have to keep fighting , regardeless of the score .
Tennis is considered a very individualistic sport .
Nonetheess , it helps to shape your own personality .
I would definitely recommend whoever would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit .
Although it might look difficult at the beginning , time after time you will come to realise how tennis will positively impact on your personal well - being .
I 'm pleasantly surprised by you visiting this part of the country , but let 's have fun together !
Furthermore there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together , since they 've got some very exciting films coming out .
I 've had lots of things on my head recently , especially after my mom died .
It was very considerate of you to send condolences so please , have my thanks .
Because I love talking to people and spending time with them and that job gave me that opportunity .
Also the staff there was very nice and they wanted me to stay , but I needed more money so unfortunately I could n't .
It was a cold night of November I was exploring a lost temple with my friend Michael , we have been looking for that temple since our teen years the temple of the silent cartographer .
The legend says that all the maps of the world are hidden into the temple protected by a guardian called Soneka the dreamer , he is an ancient warrior and his objective is to kill everyone who tries to steal the maps of the cartographer .
at the entrance of the temple were two statues the first was white and the second red , the statues were carrying a sword made of gold and diamonds those swords were used to fight Soneka and to open the gate of the cartographer , once we passed the sculptures our objective was to kill the beast and grab the map of the golden city .
Then we heard a big noise coming from inside the temple it was Soneka his appearance was glorious a big warrior using a golden armor and a big sword his skills were unmatched , he was faster than the sound our only chance was to run to the vault of the cartographer but only one can pass through the door of the cartographer Michael decide to stay out the vault I run into the cartographer and Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Since the concept and preliminary implementation model of the Yiddish Centre was developed in my office , it was expected that World ORT would participate in the project in a few capacities , rather than just including Yiddish component in our events , subject to the theme .
I think that , as Robert once recommended , we should discuss the whole spectrum of our cooperation , not just the seminars , define the feasible components and have a WJC - WO MOU on such subject signed .
Nowadays , travelling by car is much more common than we could ever imagine .
On the one hand owning a car means independence , so that , we can travel anywhere we want , whenever we want without being tied down to a set timetable and furthermore , it is certainly more comfortable than public transport .
Therefore , even though a car is more convenient and more comfortable than any form of public transport , it is also less economical than the latter which leaves people with no other choice than to use public transport .
One good news is that finally I gave up and bought my first Smartphone .
I can answer my e - mails immediately .
It 's very handy because I read the newspapers online and for free , but only the Spanish papers .
I also like to have a look at the foreign newspapers but they only let you to read the headlines and the beginning of the article .
It 's like a blog but it 's written by many people who write there their impressions about beautiful sights .
1 . INTRODUCTION
The aim of this paper is to show , through a transitivity analysis of the lyrics from three different songs , how language has influenced roles of gender
• Although the performers are women , is the language used sexist ?
- Method : Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzed and the reasons why we 've chose them
- Theoretical background- A review of our knowledge .
Our tools will be transitivity analysis and language .
Furthermore , we will give some examples of clauses that represent better the meaning of our songs .
- Conclusions : The questions we made before will be answered .
With our analysis done , this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning
- Bibliographical references : The part where the sources are revealed
These songs are relatively modern , but if we take a look we will find some sexism in some parts .
Still , women are the victim in three different ways . We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret , made by some specific situations .
Usually , in these types of songs , the performers describe actions in the relationships as well as at the end of it .
We have found this kind of agent in the songs with the love relationship as the subject .
In this category of processes , there is another participant known as the affected , because the action of the verb affects or concerns it .
In our research , the cognition verbs have been the most common inside of the group of the mental ones followed by the affection ones , which is quite normal when describing a love relationship
The main participants are the woman and the man .
The processes that appears more usually are mental and relational ( attributive type ) .
These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man
The mental processes , specifically the cognition ones , tells us that she had thought a lot about what she did and that she is wrong .
The other participants appears a few times , but these participants tell us important things about the relationship .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to understand better the situation , but actually they just confirm what the girl feels .
She is regreting because their relationship get worse and it was n't what she supposed it could be .
She says " swallowing my pride " .
Maybe she feels bad , but not completely guilty .
He is confusedly in love .
Finally , the woman tells him that she would understand that he does n't want to restart the relationship , but she makes a promise :
This sentence and some others sound like if they were pronounced by a man …
Learning a new language is always an exciting experience .
There could be many reasons that lead to the need to learn new languages but , the advantages are vast .
You will thus broaden your way of thinking and in the end as you learn you will enhance your intelligence .
However , you need to understand that learning a new language is not an easy task .
There is a lot of stress associated with it , bearing in mind that in most cases a new language will revolve around a culture that is different from what you are used to .
Enthusiasm to learn is all that you will need so as to get the first few steps done .
After the first few words , you will like the experience and will be hard for you to stop .
It is always interesting to communicate with natives of a foreign language comfortably .
Encouraging yourself that you can work perfectly well for you .
To speed up the learning process , you need to read many comic books in the language that want to learn . I will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you .
This is important because you understand their way of writing and will be easy to understand . Enrolling in different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great aid to you .
I 've got a lot of assignments to work on .
And this depressing weather is just making the situation worse .
So , what 's the typical English approach to nutritional needs ?
Proposal for the development of a sports activity .
Introduction
Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practice this kind of activities .
In my opinión running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to start moving and getting fit , in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time .
This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and with a non - significant investment would help a large group of people who desperately need it .
Minimal investment with huge benefits
To begin with , it is important that the government develops a program which creates social awareness .
A significant part of the population in this town do not know the importance of practising sports and having a healthier life .
Once people know all the benefits this sport has , they will need a space where to practice it comfortably .
With this in mind money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no - one would have to worry about traffic or obstacules in their way .
There are almost no contraindications to practise this sport so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once .
Conclusión
In my opinion improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives .
The lecturer 's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers .
It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered .
Because the young frogs look alike , it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads .
In short , the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads .
The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America , it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem . To sum up , the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading .
To conclude , the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons .
National fence , volunteers , and virus are not good solutions to the cane toads spreading problem .
" Mission : Impossible " soars again with stunning five outing !
It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the " Mission : Impossible " series , much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties , and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25 years old " Days of Thunder " .
To start , " Rogue Nation " follows the same basic formula of the movies preceding it : fast - paced action , a focus on the espionage and gadgetry of the core team , and some of the most breathtaking set pieces Hollywood has to offer .
Together with a solid foe and the deft and stylish hand of director Christopher McQuarrie , all elements combine to give this fifth outing a refined sense of urgency , perfecting the pace to deliver constant , ever - topping thrills .
Finally , a special mention goes for Joe Kraemer 's superbly thrilling score , just a masterclass of old - school , kickass orchestral action music .
With all things considered , the bottom line is that Cruise & Co have delivered what has to be considered as the finest film in the series yet .
The social debate between progress and traditions has been going on for centuries .
One of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability .
In most Latin American countries , millenary practices such as silversmithing , not only keep the region in touch with its heritage , but they have become the sole source of income for many communities .
Nations like Mexico and Peru , with internationally recognized cuisines , have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods , like chipotle peppers and quinoa , to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors .
On the other hand , the greatest disadvantage of traditions , is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress .
Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments , all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community .
In conclusion , traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations .
However , the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the wellbeing of the collective .
Progress and traditions are not opposites in a socie ty were respect and tolerance for others is the priority .
What is the recommended source for extracting the prepaid roaming revenues ?
" Prison has long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes .
Some people believe , however , that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases .
In recent years , the most common punishment for criminals has been prison .
People who break the law , should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds , when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally .
Community service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally .
This is unfair , because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society .
This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future .
For example , in Bulgaria , people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years , because they are considered " doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development " .
Community service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence , as this will help them realize their mistakes , without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison .
The last movie I watched was House Next Door , a captivating thriller that stars Jennifer Lawrence , Elizabeth Shue and Mark Thieriot .
As soon as they move in , they hear the rumors of the incident : a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared , and the other child of the family recently moved in there .
As the movie develops , it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer form his / her own conclusions .
I myself am a fan of horror movies , which are highly predictable , so it was a great satisfaction to see such a complex film .
The end completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it .
Although it had bad critics , the movie was well received by the audience ; not to mention Jennifer Lawrence 's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising .
In conclusion , I highly recommend this film for those who like drama and plot twists .
I think that a law degree is such a practical degree and legal knowledge is applicable almost everywhere .
I believe that every human , organization and company has their own rights and it is in my duty to use my legal knowledge to help them from infringement of their rights .
My study plan is to untertake a pre - university programme locally to prepare myself for further studies overseas .
I aspire to further my studies in Law at the University of Cambridge .
I would love to be in an intellectually stimulating environment , being surrounded by the brightest young minds from all over the world .
One of the main advantages is the time that can be saved by using a computer .
This is especially beneficial in the workplace , where employees can do their work far faster than they could in the past .
In addition to this , computers can be educational and fun .
From a very young age children can gain basic computer skills through programmes that allow them to learn , draw , paint and play .
In today 's technological world , this knowledge can only help them in the future .
Many jobs have been lost due to the fact that computers can do a lot of tasks more efficiently than humans .
This has led to high unemployment in many countries .
To sum up , it seems that computers are a useful addition to our fast - moving world of high technology .
However , it must be remembered that they are here to serve us - not to replace us .
Social networking is a tool used by people all around the world .
Its purpose is to promote and aid communication .
However I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good .
It is not only changing how we communicate , but how we interact with each other in daily life .
In conclusion I can say that the social network that affects population the most is Facebook .
It may be on the verge of replacing traditional personal interactions for the next generation .
It affects our lives in many ways , including our communication , self- expression , bullying , isolations , friendships , and even our very own sense of humanity .
On this networking site , users create pages that represent them in some way .
They post pictures of themselves and their friends .
Facebook has more bad effects in adolescents than in adults , they are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online .
It is more likely that adults would , use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves , their family , find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took .
Teenagers , however , use this technology in a way that could be dangerous .
Adults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abuse from using social networks , specially Facebook .
Teachers at school may improve more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extremely way .
At work , bosses may reduce employee 's salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are produced by social networks .
Proposal to improve School 's facilities for language learners .
Introduction :
The aim of this proposal is to make recommendations in order to improve the school facilities .
Aspects such as space , internet access and materials will be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the service for students learning languages .
First , an inspection to the school 's facilities was organised , in order to assess the school premises .
From the visit , it was concluded that even if the majority of students express satisfaction with the space , some of them wish to have more classrooms that allow a more reasonable number of students per class .
Currently , each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes .
Secondly , It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room .
Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers , the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills .
Therefore , I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board .
The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages .
Magazines and newspapers allow learners to have direct contact with language in real contexts .
Thus , I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school 's library .
Conclusion .
I strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention , the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced .
How would the entire world in general and the mountaineering fraternity in particular , judge my decision ?
I needed to survive in light of the fact that it was impossible to haul Joe up to safety .
I needed some consolation to return to a state of psychological normalcy ; it was a step towards survival .
Ever since I started learning English I have found quite handy watching TV series , especially those which are perfectly subtitled , in order to follow the plot properly .
In fact , it is quite useful if you are actually interested in improving your skills , when it comes to listening and speaking .
Although the story is focused on the Lord 's family , the service has an important part to play , as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is getting old - fashioned .
The main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed , with its own characteristics and personalities .
Even the background is cleverly chosen what enhances the intriguing and dramatic script .
Needless to say , the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role , especially Maggie Smith , which is one of my favourite actress .
I wish to apply for the Assistants & management support for the " Asset Allocation & Macro Research " ( AA&MR ) position as I believe it is in perfect alignment with my skills and professional experience .
My penultimate position was as chief executive of a company with photocomposition , which was followed by the creation of a publication service serving the " Sell Side " department of Pictet , then Helvea demonstrated my sense of organization and easy adaptation to new environment .
My goal has always been to combine speed with quality , using good organization skills and an excellent mastery of different technological tools .
Furthermore , I am fluent in English language , with good writing skills .
Conscientious by nature , I always strive to be thorough in my work , to be diligent , and consistently completing my tasks .
In addition , I am a team player with good interpersonal skills .
Yours faithfully ,
NB : In addition , in the case of employment , I would receive an allowance of a participation of 50% of the salary for a period of two years .
Well , first of all , there are a lot of activities you can do for fun , such as visiting some historical places that are attractive for many tourists .
Since you are coming in summer , you should visit Sharm or Hurghada for some sea activities like swimming , diving and snorkeling .
They will pay you a reasonable salary .
And it will be good preparation for your study at college .
Brazilian people are known for their creativity and enthusiasm for soap operas .
As a typical Brazilian I have a favorite soap opera , is called Floribella .
The story is about a poor girl called Floribella she is an eccentric seamstress , she has amazing friend and they have a band together .
He is arrogant but Flor is the only one who can calm him down in difficult situations .
She falls in love with him , but unfortunately he is engaged and his fiancée is an awful person who always try to humiliate Flor .
I 'm afraid to say that this soap opera does n't have a happy end and I did n't enjoy the end either , but I still recommend it because it 's a beautiful love story and the characters are really amusing and the story is funny and lovely .
Despite its end and all others odds that it may have , I 'm still a big fan of Floribella and I ca n't wait to watch it again on Netflix .
And by the way , the soundtracks are awesome , you 'll be addicted to them .
Taking care of environment has become an essential need in our daily life .
Countries , states , cities and even municipalities are focusing on how to include green plans in their future work plans .
Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) is indicated in more than 90% of missions statements around the world .
Saying that taking care of the environment is not only the concern of citizens but also the national and international organizations .
As for my city , the mayor gives environment his top priority and a budgeted plan under the process of implementation .
awareness sessions have been made to explain the difference among re - use , recycle and reduce .
a different color trash bags were distributed to citizens to be used at home to separate the trash according to each material .
Also , Films on soaring birds were played to explain the importance of birds in cleaning the atmosphere .
It is worth to mention that schools are considering Environment subject is part of the education sytem that should be taught to students .
Finally , I 'm proud to say that taking care of the environment is part of my and my family daily life .
Trash distribution , using green products that repect the ozone layer , not wasting water and many other actions .
I am writing to apply for the position of assistant professor of English with an emphasis in nineteenth - century American literature that you advertised in the February 20XX MLA Job Information List .
I am a Dean 's Fellow and Ph.D. candidate at XYZ University , currently revising the final chapter of my dissertation , and expecting to graduate in May 20XX .
I am confident that my teaching experience and my research interests make me an ideal candidate for your open position .
I have taught a number of American literature survey courses , as well as writing courses , including technical writing and first - year writing .
I have extensive experience working with ESL students , as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities , including dyslexia and dysgraphia , and disabilities like ADD and ADHD .
I pride myself in creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thought and writing skills .
Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts , through a combination of individual conferences , class activities , and group discussion .
I know I would thrive as a teacher in your college , due to your belief in small classroom size and individualized support for students .
Not only does my teaching experience suit the needs of your school and department , but my research interests also fit perfectly with your description of the ideal candidate .
My dissertation project , " Ferns and Leaves : Nineteenth - Century Female Authorial Space , " examines the rise and development of American female authors in the 1840s and 1850s , with a particular focus on patterns of magazine publication .
I argue that , rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher , female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than previously has been assumed .
I apply recent print - culture and book - history theory to my readings of novels , magazine articles , letters , and diary entries by various female authors , with a particularly focus on Sara Willis ( known by her pseudonym Fanny Fern ) .
I plan to develop my dissertation into a book manuscript , and continue to research the role of female writers in antebellum magazine culture , with a particular focus on the rise and influence of female magazine editors on literary culture .
My research interests have both shaped and been shaped by my recent teaching experiences .
I combined readings on theory and literature that addressed issues of print with visits to local historical museums and archives .
My students conducted in - depth studies on particular texts ( magazines , newspapers , novels ) for their final papers .
I believe my interdisciplinary teaching style , particularly my emphasis on material culture , would fit in well with the interdisciplinary nature of your English department .
I am therefore confident that my teaching experience , my skill in working with ESL and LD students , and my research interests all make me an excellent candidate for the assistant professor of English position at ABC College .
I have attached my curriculum vitae and the two requested sample publications .
I would be happy to send you any additional materials such as letters of reference , teaching evaluations , and past and proposed course syllabi . I will be available to meet with you at either the MLA or C19 conference , or anywhere else at your convenience .
Thank you so much for your consideration ; I look forward to hearing from you .
The main hero is a mysterious stranger , betrayed by everyone , sold into slavery , chosen by fate to administer revenge , will become one of 47 warriors that defy death .
They were very different and very colorful , but at the same time corresponded with the time period of the film .
With this film , I was able to get a clear idea about traditions and customs of that time .
And I just could n't forget to mention beautiful decorations and realistic special effects .
I think other people will like it as much as I did , because it is a very interesting and exciting story about true love that lives through time and space , and about real friendship and loyalty .
A transportation vehicle that has changed people 's live .
That transportation exerts a far - reaching influence on people 's daily routines and lifestyle is true .
Not only that , what prides itself as the most influential vehicle - as most public recognized - is the automobile .
It is generally believed that the invention of car leads to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers , to the growth of the suburbs .
Prior to the automobile , is the horse and wagon life , it is not feasible for people to live far from their place of work .
Moreover , it leads to an important expansion in commerce , resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls , department stores , serving as a powerful pull to tourism .
What greatly increased mobility leads to significant changes , additionally , lies in various lifestyles .
Being able to live far from one 's workplace , people could travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip .
In the urban city , the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted the growth of the tourist industry .
Though being good enough , yet the growth of population and mobility do not tell the whole story .
This powerful vehicle is counted vital for another reason : being an indispensable factor in many aspects .
It is the key that supports many industrial fields , such as steel , machinery , plastic .
The whole business success would not have met perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well .
Last but not least , the booming prosperity often parallels the numbers of job in the city .
Although other forms of transportation may be more comfortable , none has changed the way we do business and live our lives more than the car .
Thanks to the speed , excitement , and convenience of the cars , our lives are enriched .
Travelling to Japan through food !
The newest Japanese restaurant in town - Ohana restaurant is the place to be on a Friday night .
Its atmosphere is that of an old Buddhist temple situated on a mountain somewhere in Japan .
The staff 's clothes are beautifully coloured and believe it or not , all of them are Japanese and can speak English fluently .
What I particularly appreciated was that you can sit around the chefs and watch them prepare the food .
Unfortunately , the music was a bit too loud for my taste .
After eight o'clock , a professional band of musicians start playing traditional Japanese music and it can be a bit loud .
However , overall I think that this new restaurant has the potential of becoming very popular in a short time due to the food and the great atmosphere .
You really should go and try this amazing restaurant at the first opportunity .
In my opinion , my social interaction balances my life more than does my working experience .
With the increasing competition in the workplace , people bear more and more stress .
The companionship of our loved people is always the best solution to release our pressure .
For example , every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me , and makes me breathless .
Therefore , the happiness brought from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work .
In addition , attending social activities widens my life 's experiences wholesomely .
This might suggest that being surrounded by people at work with whom we need to socialize would have more of an effect on our emotions .
However , most of the time people keep a good relationship with their co - workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously .
For example , we talk about something trivial , such as gripes , and gossip , with our colleagues .
Conversely , we share our deepest worries and problems with our close family and friends because we are not afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust .
Therefore , the more deeply our emotions interact , the more tremendously our happiness is influenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate support , growth in life experiences , and emotional interaction , I agree with the statement that the social life has more of an effect on my happiness than does my occupation .
In other words , even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co - workers , personally I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love .
As a result , I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than does my job .
The only post ever sent to me was an anniversary card , sent by my grandmother before she passed away .
Nonetheless , I managed to remove the box from the ground and staggered through the doorway , in the direction of the living room .
Anyway , I did n't notice the skateboard which lay in front of my feet .
Immediately , I opened the box and found a short letter , saying : " Dear Jane , here 's the inheritance from your grandmother : her glass tea service ... "
There is no doubt that travelling by car is the most comfortable option , but claiming that public transport has no future is too much .
Travelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment .
In big cities , the air is very polluted because there are too many cars . Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment , something that most people are aware of , but still they prefer to use their own vehicle .
I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future .
In general , shopping is associated with something pleasant , but unfortunately this is not always true .
For some people , shopping is one of their obligations .
For others it is overall a pleasant experience they can not enjoy as much as they would like .
Firstly , shopping may be uncomfortable , because more often than not we can hear there tiring music , saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queue usually are very long .
To sum up , doing shopping is inevitable , so we can make everyday shopping more enjoyable .
This is a great opportunity to spend some quality time together , exchange ideas and opinions ; opt for evening shopping , specifically about half an hour before the stores close if you want to avoid big crowds ; if possible , choose only one store for your everyday shopping .
Going from one store to another can waste your time , cost you a lot in gas , as well as mentally and physically exhaust you ; when it comes to products that your regularly use , buying in bulk is the best option you have , since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price ; or just choose online shopping - is a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home , without having to go out on a rainy day , deal with noisy ( and sometimes even smelly ) crowds , spend money on gas and wait in huge lines .
First of all I would like to begin with giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting belongs to .
The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey which constitutes the country 's economic , cultural , and historical heart .
The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within city limits .
Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires had been ruled from .
There are many historical places in the Historical Peninsula such as mosques , churches and palaces .
The most important ones are Hagia Sophia , Topkapi Palace , Sultanahmet Mosque , Suleymaniye Mosque , Yeni Mosque , the Grand Bazaar , Basilica Cistern , Beyazit Tower and the Spice Bazaar .
In order to give brief information on them I would like to touch on some of them .
Beyazit Tower is 85 meter located in the courtyard of Istanbul University 's main campus in Beyazıt Square .
Actually I was asked to recommend only one place , but Historical Peninsula is already an area where those historical distincts got together .
I hope the given information is useful for you .
The following conversation was so engaging that I forgot the time and , as a result I got late for my departure to Chicago .
I am not completely certain , but I remember that the last time I kept them was near the tiny blue table located at the left corner of the room .
I am contacting you because those papers are sensitive to my company .
As you can imagine , they are confidential and they should be handled with caution .
Yours faithfully ,
Having goals in life will make ones ' life meaningful and purposeful .
They are studying in an English university abroad and becoming a programmer .
First , I want to attend an English university abroad .
Being able to study in an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience .
As we all know , nowadays , English proficiency is on the list of the required skills to be employed and the market highly demands it .
Secondly , the experiences one gets from a multicultural medium is very valuable and makes one more matured .
and I feel that only an overseas English university can offer that .
Second , I want to be employed as a programmer .
there are many reasons why I want to be a programmer .
primarily , because being a developer is my dream job and secondly because developers make a lot of money .
I wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old .
I was fascinated by this field of science .
To sum it up , graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my mine aims .
With the advent of individually owned vehicles like the car , an individual 's dependence on public transport has certainly reduced .
I 'd like to highlight the factors that would support my opinion in a certain order that pertains to a wider acceptance .
First of all , from a cost perspective , public transport is much cheaper compared to a car , especially when a cost reduction concept like ' car pooling ' is not followed .
The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none , especially in common situations like long distance commutes for daily work .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angle , increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and lights .
From an environmental standpoint , use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented helping in preserving the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi where the carbon emissions are very high .
Cookery programmes , films , documentaries , talkshows … It 's clear that there are lots of different programmes on TV nowadays .
Maybe you think of television as a waste of money .
In that case , I can guarantee you that today 's telly is definitely worth the money .
It 's true that there are lots of repeats on TV and there may be many programmes you regard as poor quality .
Besides that , it 's very likely that you can find some programmes you like between all the trash because of the wide variety .
In addition , the price of watching television for a whole month is much lower than the price of tickets for the cinema to watch a film for only two hours .
In my opinion , TV provides something for everyone 's taste nowadays , including good quality programmes , for a reasonable price .
It should be possible for everyone to enjoy watching television !

We use cash everyday and it is of great importance to our daily life .
Firstly , something about designing must be taken into consideration .
Not only the background colour but also the artwork we need to choose .
Secondly , we have to do some preparation of metal plates .
Some good quality sheets will be packaged and distributed to the market but the bad sheets would be disposaled .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter tryed to stop them but it was impossible , so he tried to find somebody to separate them .
Lucas wanted to apologise and forget what happened but Louis was really hungry , so Lucasdecided to go home .
The police went to school to talk with Lucas and try to find a fare punishment .
Peter knew that Lucas was n't guilty but he and Louis were best friends since the elementary school , he had to do his decision and he only had two minutes until they took Lucas to the police station .
Louis had to pay the window and also clean the school 's canteen for two months , but he realized that what he did was wrong so he apologised to Lucas .
It seemed that the man in the wheelchair was looking for something but suddenly , he took a couple of books and put into a hidden pocket in his wheelchair .
Unfortunately , the thief was more intelligent than them because while they were speaking , he could run away with the books that he had just stolen .
When it seemed impossible to catch him , a girl , who was crossing the street in a wheelchair , crashed into the thief and he fell down on the paviment .
To express her gratitude , Angie called the girl as " honorary customer " of her bookshop and gave her a crime novel collection like a present .
When the American series ' House ' was firstly broadcasted on TV , it immediately hooked the audience .
The unusual scenario and the great actor Hugh Laurie made the result really innovative for a TV series .
It is based on Dr. Gregory House , a reputable diagnostician who uses strange and sometimes inappropriate approaches in order to find out what is wrong with his patients .
Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on his leg , he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson , but he never really wants to so he gets addicted again .
Nevertheless , he is willing to do literary anything to save a patient 's live , although sometimes he goes too far .
The series had a great appeal on many countries , which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced .
His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series huge success .
Also , the medical cases are intriguing and although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much , the struggle to save a person 's life captures everyone 's interest .
The innovative aspect of ' House ' is that he often takes illegal action , for example breaking into a patient 's house to investigate environmental factors , which may have caused the particular disease and hardly ever is he punished for it .
I believe it well deserved such popularity , as apart from its scenario , it was on the whole qualitative .
Nevertheless , it distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks out of the box .
The first time I knew about volleyball , I was in my last Secondary School year and we were invited to cheer up a local team during a Regional Tournament in Lima , Peru .
I was amazed with the atmosphere at the Coliseum , with its shiny wooden court , the noisy people around it , that sharp sound of the referees 's whistles ... Then I decided to take up the game .
Once I got fitter enough , I started enjoying the game , learning its strategies , developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time .
They will soon be engaged in a healthy , defiant and never boring activity and also will develop strong bonds with each other , responsibility and compromise .
Volleyball is the best sport ever !
Introduction
The aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used if the benefit of the students and , indirectly , in the benefit of the local community .
Needless to say , in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire , the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector .
Sportive activities might boots the student 's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary .
It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health .
A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares ' more enjoyable than solely studying them will .
Cookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life .
As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms , without their parents , they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves .
The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives .
Citizenship classes
Another kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field .
Conclusion
The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue .
Organising clubs and courses such as the ones mentioned above would ensure the improvement of the situation .
Today 's television is the paradigm of our society , because of dozens of new channels constantly popping up and only a very few controls are done on the quality of what it 's actually broadcast .
So TV , which could be an invaluable source of information and entertainment , actually is becoming a big issue to the development of our society and new generations in particular .
The potential risks for our new generations
Having an easy access to such a rich offer before having developed the ability to operate correct choices or filter the information received , our kids and juniors are constantly under attack of dangerous behaviour models , being attracted by the ones who seem the most winning and cool ones , without any chance to distinguish if they can be taken as a guide to their growth or not .
It 's not too late , though , to try to have our beloved TV back to the importance which radio had for our parents and grandparents , we only need to see it as a potential new social problem and start a process of control and continuous improvement , maybe giving the most virtuous networks the chance to be highlighted .
I believe that if public transport has no future , then our environment will not have it either .
The car is sometimes represented as an icon of freedom ; moreover , owning a modern car is sometimes related to wealth .
Compared to the use of public transport , one can not deny the convenience of using a car for moving around .
However , the use of public transport , especially in high density cities , allows people to save time while commuting to their study or workplace , as trains and trams do not get stuck in traffic jams .
It not only helps reducing pollution , but also allows users to save money , in a world where the cost of gasoline is exponentially increasing .
I believe that people should limit the use of their cars only to special occasions , such as road trips or long - weekend leisure activities .
Only by doing so , we will help to preserve our atmosphere free of CO2 emissions , and all the grim consequences they have .
I m 16 years old , tall , extroverted , very energetic and cheerful and friendly .
But I am doing this because I really enjoy creating activities with kids and having a great time with them .
In the historical river , there was a dynasty called Jin , during which this story took place .
On the contrary , the fact was inconsistent with what he expected .
Lucky Wang 's stepmother was such a snake - hearted woman that she did as many cruel things as she could to torture this poor boy .
One day in an especially chilly winter , Lucky Wang 's stepmother got sick suddenly .
Not concerning the harsh environment but her own appetite , she commanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish .
In desperation , he stepped to the river bank .
It was exactly when he was hesitating whether went home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two craps leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him .
Surprised and delighted , the boy took the fish home and prepare delicious fish soup for his stepmother .
Moved by this little boy 's filial devotion , his stepmother changed her attitude and started to love him from her deep heart .
After listening to the small story , some people were deeply moved by the happy ending , however , others thought it was unrealistic .
No matter what the fact was , or even it never happened , the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety .
Even if it was a fiction , the goal to make all the people in the society be filial could also be achieved , which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time .
Only through this cultural education combined with other ways , could they keep their government generation by generation as they expected .
How to ensure an adequately financed retirement ?
Our society is becoming an increasingly elderly one .
It does not boost their confidence in future perspectives .
We often hear than no obstacle is ever insurmountable , however , is it true ?
Only in that moment we will understand that we are one of the millions pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent life as we deserve .
The taxpayers try not to go against the establishment .
They help our ageing population , but we should make some new reforms to subsidise the shortfall in our budget .
Otherwise , this situation will have a detrimental effect on the taxpayers .
Yesterdays ' petrified men will become confident .
The pensioners will receive their money when they retire .
Our state will have a large sum of money which is an invaluable source .
On the other hand the pensioners will be sure in their future .
The law of the jungle is not appropriate here .
We can not make a killing immediately .
Firstly , I have to say that I disagree about the statement " There is no future for public transport " . I think public transport has lots of advantages , more than travelling by car .
You can relax when you are travelling , listening music or reading a book .
Finally , travelling by public transport is generally cheaper than travelling by car .
Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it worth it , because you can save money .
So , I think the statement would be like this " There is no future for travelling by car , because public transport is so much more convenient and cheaper " .
I 'm not a huge fan of sports in general , but I do take pleasure in engaging in smaller scale basketball matches , most of which would probably fall into the so - called ' street ' category , or streetball to be more specific .
It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match , since its flexible rules , no - coach system , intensified relationship between the player and the crowd , and reduced number of participants widen and complexify its field of possible actions .
The ' style ' factor of it ( or " aesthetic value " if you will ) also plays an important role , again , intensifying the relationship between team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences , finishing a play , or just stylishly mocking your opponent .
Not to mention the socially bonding ability of it , while on game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable , the irreverent , human , no strings attached nature of streetball events always compensate its negative aspects ( which , upon closer inspection , reveal to be shared between every single sports event ) .
It is a fun , culturally - enriching experience which I recommend anyone interested in going beyond the competitive aspect of sports to engage .
Researchers have claimed that new generations are likely to suffer from more diseases .
Firstly , teenagers today eat lots of junk food , which is definitely harmful , as it leads to obesity ( Summerfield , 2013 ) .
Moreover , they often smoke and drink alcohol , which produces serious physical and mental diseases ( CasaColumbia , 2007 ) .
Furthermore , teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary , since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports .
Nevertheless , governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past .
For instance , in Chile the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions , where fun activities are promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano , 2012 ) .
Lastly , everyone must understand that good health is above wealth .
Parents and children should be informed about the use of drugs and junk food consumption , in order to raise awareness and improve their quality of life .
Travelling by car is great .
We can personalise our needs and wishes , such as listening to songs , talking to our friends and family members , eating and drinking and stopping for food or toilet needs anytime , anywhere .
On the one hand , public transport is more convenient for large cities as it provides service to a larger number of people and we avoid traffic jams and the need to find parking spots , besides the fact that we wo n't get worried about leaving our cars parked on the street and , when we come back , the car could have been robbed or stolen .
On the other hand , cars tend to pollute more than electric trains and such problem ought to be taken into consideration when someone has to decide between using public transport or a car .
The world is getting smaller for people with so many cars around ; it 's about time everyone thought about the community and not about themselves .
The government ought to plan campaigns to make people aware of that and try to find ways to reduce transport fares .
With both sides benefiting , the future of public transport will be safe .
Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable , prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car .
When considering the bus , users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is taken when no other option is possible .
As I see it , drivers really appreciate the freedom of choosing their destination , the time to leave or to arrive , even the people to go with .
If not , they would not make the investment of a car , pay its maintenance cost and fuel .
More and more , the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase so does for transport ; economic policy of importing countries tend to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent .
Moreover , considering pollution , private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage because it is an individual decision .
In the near future , this fact will be seriously taken into account by governments .
To sum up , future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and surely public transport will play an important role .
He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rush where you have to line up for an hour and finish eating in like 20 minutes before they kick you out .
There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $ 108 to $ 138 while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $ 328 . I could n't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting so I asked the chef for recommendations .
He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate which was perfect for me !
Each dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse our palate .
The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat .
The salt brought out the sweetness of the watermelon while working as a balancing agent so the juice would not be too sweet .
I was told that the drink / soup changes frequently depending on what would be suitable at the moment .
Bamboo Charcoal ( $ 138 ) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to taste his artful presentation as it came to life !
This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream , chocolate ice marshmallow , chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet .
The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy .
He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraint and timing .
The dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as well .
The smell was wondrous from the lavender while the flavor was almost mint - like and refreshing to drink .
Verdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth !
It would be perfect if they served alcohol as well and they told me that they are in talks with the building management to do so .
The price was n't cheap for dessert but if you take into the entire experience and compared to what you pay for drinks at a bar or lounge , it 's pretty comparable actually .
They also told me that they plan on introducing a new tea set menu during the day so stay tune !
As the days go by , more discoveries are being unearthed in a rapid pace .
Some advantages are given in the following passage .
Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class , Einstein in his first science class and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time .
Nonetheless , there are some disadvantages . If a person possesses the magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves from , he or she can basically rule the world .
Additionally , terrible wars will break out if one side of the magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people 's powers .
Undeniably , the food culture disparity between China and Japan is tremendous , although our ancestors were originated from the same ethic .
Due to the geographicall conditions where Japan is located aside Pacific Ocean , people here are adapted to eat raw fish and would like to put it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants .
Unfortunately , I do n't like eating raw foods , especially for under - cooked fish .
Apart from the eating culture , everything is going well as people here are generous and hospitable .
My host family take me to different hot spots and teach me how to speak Japanese , in order to facilitate the
progress of integrating to their culture .
That was magnificent and mind - blowing .
I enjoy playing football with my friends as it can strengthen our friendship and bolster our love .
When we play football , we are definitely will cooperate with the other teammates in order to be the winner .
This clearly shows that football needs a strong cooperation from all of the team 's players .
My advice to those who are starting this sport is to practise a lot as football needs an unstoppable practice to master the game and be the king of field .
My second advice for them is to always have a cooperative game with the teammates .
Who does not want to feel like an astronaut on our own planet exploring the magical underwater world just on a recreational trip ?
I surely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiast members , not only bringing a unique experience into your life , but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues towards a broad public .
The downside of this is that hordes of eager newly trained divers populate the underwater world , often with little clue of the life - threatening risks that they are facing .
I am writing this letter as a wake up call to those who think that their recently earned certification gives them the skills to go out diving wherever they want .
How thoughtless is that ?
Consequently I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport .
To my great astonishment I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again .
I saw dive - buddy 's and even professional dive masters pushing and stimulating fresh divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it .
Unbelievable !
Please , let everybody take their own responsibility !
The bottom line is : get as much out of your diving experiences as you can , but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal education and practice .
I also love to see the spark flashing in students ' eyes when they understand a concept , try to express themselves with Chinese and finally use it correctly .
For me , learning a language is not only translating the forms to express oneself , but a way to understand how the native speakers describe and interpret this world .
A successful communication between different cultures will happen only when we express oueselves precisely and interpret the information accurately .
Meanwhile , students should have deeper understanding of Chinese culture and viewpoints .
Acquiring a language and culture is a long - term process , which includes learning , practicing , making mistakes and correcting .
As a language teacher , I hope my students will have a deeper and broader understanding of this language , their interest in this language will be stimulated by the course and learn the language constantly .
So at least it 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live . "
Let 's take into consideration the last sentence , " It 's something I experience , but that 's not where I live . "
Fame is a side effect of job in the media and so is spine disease for people who work in an office or threat to life or health for firefighters .
It would be completely pointless if we were judging people on the basis of job they have .
They lose their anonymity , become recognizable ,
what is inseparable part of this kind of occupations .
Because of their fame , they also give employment to other people like paparazzi , journalists .
We live in times where people are very curious about other people 's lives so above - mentioned occupations are necessary ,
but let 's think ... is it really so interesting to know , for example , what Madonna 's second husband eat for breakfast ?
I think we all have our own magnificent lives and we should focus on them .
So let politicians , film stars , singers and others be .
Besides being in charge with organizing his younger sister 's surprise birthday party he had also been put in charge with the entire Information Technology department of the company he worked for .
His former boss retired and nominated him for the position , claiming he was more than qualified and had the adequate skill set in order to keep the department on track as well as making any necessary changes .
Michael did n't mean to sound ungrateful , because he was delighted , but the timing was n't anything but the worst .
As soon as one problem in the company would be solved another one just as infuriating would come up at the party planning .
The scope of this report is to give readers an overview in the historical development of water treatment , the changing perception of standardization of water treatment , and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored .
This report is an introductory document meant for students interested in the field of water treatment .
Clean and adequate water supply system is vital aspect in public health and social prosperity .
It is essential for all forms of life by which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients , removal of metabolic waste , and body temperature regulation .
Water treatment must meet requirements for public and industrial standards .
Mithen 's ( 2010 ) researches show that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport .
Although an understanding of water quality was not well understood , the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors .
80 - 20 BC , wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather ( 1939 ) , Siculus provided early documents of purifying water such as boiling and sand filtration , dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greek .
Since microbiology was yet studied , people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water .
The main precaution measure was purely by judging turbidity of the water and this false practice had remained ever since , even nowadays .
Figure 1 A qunat at the National Library of Iran , Tehran ( http://media-1.boo.britainica.com/eb-media/72/987654-004-03E63A41.jpg )
The development of qunats ( Figure 1 ) began about 2500 years ago in Iran , a sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater .
For example , in 1933 the capital city of Iran , Tehran , drew its entire water supply system using the same principle of qunats , though with a lot more complications added into it .
These complications were primarily caused by pollution in the underground water which was previously unknown .
Unlike the past , where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene ; with better scientific understanding and public education , people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day .
2.3 BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
The history of water treatment continued in 1670 , as two Dutch glasses makers investigated on magnification glasses led to the invention of the microscope .
This scientific discovery broken down the barrier and enables biologist to observe organism that were invisible to the naked eye ( Figure 2 ) .
In 1676 , Scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek ,
The Chachas Restaurant
The " Chachas " is a restaurant situated in a mall in a fringe area of Bern .
The restaurants ' slogan is " positive eating " and they definitely live out that phrase .
The large dining room with high ceiling is what catches everybody 's eye , especially if you set your foot into the restaurant for the first time .
There are no walls separating the foyer from the dining room or the kitchen from the guests .
This being said , you can imagine the atmosphere being comfortably airy .
Additionally , they offer a monthly alternating " special menu " card presenting five main courses .
They avoid using convenience food and any kind of artificial flavors .
Definitely worth pointing out are the excellent fruit juices .
They are courtous and industrious .
The restaurant offers good quality food for reasonable prices and the atmosphere is very welcoming .
And as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food , I highly recommend going to the " Chachas " restaurant .
There has been substantial attention to writers ' self - presentation and identity in online social media recently ; Boyed ( 2008 ) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site ; Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) reports that people illustrate a different identity in facebook through using " a different language and writing style " .
He asserts that language choice and identity are not " predetermined " and are prone to change ( Lee 2014 : 91 ) ; their change is derived from the context where discourse is negotiated and how " interlocutors interpret the identities being projected " ( ibid : 91 ) .
Therefore , context , including the participants , their social purpose , their means and channel of communication , plays a role in language choice and identity construction .
Lee ( 2014 : 92 ) refers to the " forms of participation " in a social media and having the sense of audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change " the way people think of themselves " that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online thereby .
He refers to using nicknames , for example , as a way of self - expression that can shape the audience 's mind and interpretation of writers ' identity .
Lee ( 2014 ) defines three ways of self - presentations in most social media : ( 1 ) " online profile " ( p. 97 ) , that is the " entry point to social networking " .
In Boyed 's terms , profile is an important space where writers tell the audience " who they are and how they want to be seen " ; a link that connects people 's " offline and online identities"(2008 : 129 ) .
Examining teens ' identity construction in social media , he states that profile is where teens " express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret " ( 2008 : 129 ) ; ( 2 ) " continuous status updating " that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the " first person " point of view and ( 3 ) " visual representation " that is " visual images " ( p. 98)(emphasized as in original ) .
Continuous updating , as a way of self - presentation , is one of the features of blog writing by which blog - writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience .
If the weblog - writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle , through using the first person pronoun , or tell their stories through the readers ' eyes , by involving other grammatical subjects , is among the focuses of this study .
It seems that checking the Subject , as an interpersonal element in the clause , can provide evidence of my student - writers ' self - presentation and involvement in the discourse constructed in their blogs .
The children were playing outside , old and new couples were enjoying their love and everything seemed to be absolutely bright .
In the busy streets , a student was walking fast , apparently unaware of all this .
And then severything had crashed .
Her voice was weak and fleble while she said " .. and I was really depressed , you know and then I thought ... we always talked about going in India ... and I thought ... maybe we could fix everything .. so .. I'm just asking .. will you go with India with me ? "
I 'm glad to hear that you are having a great time abroad volunteering for this international cultural organization .
I think that it is a wonderful idea to collect different experiences before starting university studies .
As you know I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have a hands - on experience in organising a cultural festival and particularly musical concert .
I loved my job there and if I only had an opportunity to do it again , I definitely would .
During my staying there I was responsible for taking care of musicians and contacting media .
What I especially loved about my job there , was the opportunity to work in such a diverse group of people .
I learned how to respond to different people 's needs resulting from cultural differences and expectations .
I also appreciated much the practical experience I could get there - how to organise job at the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want , how to use social media for advertising and promotion , how to communicate with press and television etc .
I look forward to hearing from you soon and I hope that you 'll find this experience as amazing as I did .
It is known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do , the kind of clothes they wear or even the tattoos they have .
This happens because some people is famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer , so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not , and when it happened .
In the case of politicians , I do n't mind what they do in their holdidays , for example , if they work properly when they have to .
I mean , it would be better that there was more transparency as far as how they spend " our money " is concerned .
I think journalists should follow famous people only when they do something related to their profession or the fact that has made them famous .
Every week we watch a different type of film so that we can please every member and improve our cinematography knowledge .
This is followed by an animated discussion in English , accompanied by drinks from the coffee bar , which is open late , of course !
Every now and then , we have special guests coming over , such as professional reviewers or independent directors .
Next week we 'll be watching " Dancer in the Dark " , by Lars von Trier , a distinctive Danish filmmaker .
It was a bright sunny day and the birds were peacefully singing .
When Elena took it off she was blown away , completely amazed with what she saw .
That morning , Michael woke up full of energy , and feeling very optimistic about his first day in his new job .
Every single detail should be perfect to get the best first impression .
-You only have one opportunity to cause a good first impression- he said to himself .
He went out of his little apartment and walked full of confidence to the bus stop .
When he arrived the receptionist told him to go to his boss office .
She was a very kind and intelligent woman , and Michael was sure that she was going to be a perfect boss and they will work very easily together .
And congratulations for the baby!- His boss looked at him in anger:- Do you think that I am pregnant?- .
Our city offers to visitors a huge range of possibilities to go shopping .
For example , people interested in cooking has some gourmet shops where they will be able to taste our traditional products .
This magnificent building is situated in the city centre and it was built seventy years ago in an ancient palace .
When the weather is good , especially during spring , market street are really popular .
You can buy all you can imagine there but one of them is really extraordinary .
It is celebrated on the mother 's day on May , the first Sunday and it is located in the city 's longest avenue , around a kilometre plenty of flowers where you can make your own bouquet for your mother 's present .
Yes , that 's true that the car is far more convenient than the public transport .
You are sitting on a comfortable seat .
The temperature level is exactly what you like .
Well , there can be some pretty girls among the passengers for sure , but it 's far too often that you will have to sit near some stinky bum .
High cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation .
People would say that travelling on public transport it is the future for our lives .
But sincerely there is no future at all for it , as our lives nowadays are becoming more a more demanding in terms of multitasking , goal seekers and family conciliation .
Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains , buses or metro , but when it comes to deal with the day - to - day tasks we very often find travelling by our own car it is the easiest way .
For instance , travelling with children it is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved .
There is no easy way to carry our weekly shopping , stuff for the gym or instruments on public transport .
I hope you 're doing well and everything is ok .
I 'm writing to you because I want to tell you about my experience .
You wanted to know what I was said to do before and during the concert , so I try to explain everything .
Everything was so exciting about helping at this concert .
Starting from sending the invitations to the most famous people in the city and calling the shots .
I had to take care of other volounteers .
Dealing with other people is the hardest part , escpecially when they 're the same age as you .
Another good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists .
She 's a journalist from the New York Times .
She 's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show .
Before the concert started , me and my co - workers had to clean the stage , set up the equipment and make sure everything works well : the sound , the lightning and the instruments .
I particularly enjoy the sense of freedom that it gives me : there 's nothing better than being out on the water with only the sound of the waves , and of the wind on the sails .
In my experience I found that people either consider sailing a very boring sport , or a very dangerous one ;
I guess because I 've been practicing for such long time , I do n't agree in either case .
Sailing is all about cooperation , and to really enjoy it one needs to do it regularly , to be able get to know the crew and find the most suitable role on the deck .
Being a good sailor does n't mean knowing all about it , the point of sails , the winds , and so on , for me a good sailor is someone that knows the boat s / he 's sailing on , and is able to deal with all the possible situations and also kind of people s / he can possibly have to deal with .
If you take the time to ask around , you 'll find out that a lot of the most experienced sailors never took classes .
and if the first time is not so good , try again : in different weather conditions , with different people , and different kind of boats .
First of all public transport is far more convenient for people in big cities .
Nowadays environmental pollution is also important that 's why public transport should be promoted as environmentally friendly way of transport .
Not always car is much more convenient , for example in a big city it is far more convenient to use underground than a car during the rush hour .
When we use public transport we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it 's impossible .
Driving a car is also more tiring , driver must be concentrated all the time .
Of course not always public transport is more convenient .
When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside car is irreplecable for families with children or animals .
Also go on holidays by car can be very comfortable .
With car we are more independent than with public transport .
This summer I am bringing a group of 12 to 14 year - old students to Athens and I am looking for suitable accommodation .
While we are there , we not only want to look at the many attractions in the city , but we would like to visit some of the beautiful places nearby , so we are looking for a reasonable priced hotel , in the city centre , with good transport links .
Furthermore I would like to ask you if there are any individuals who can be able to look after groups like us ?
Are you able to arrange activities and local transportation for us ?
Also it would be great if you could inform me of some special discounts , such as cheaper air travelling .
Introduction
The principal objectives of this proposal are to outline the main problems that the company 's website has , and suggest ways that the web designers can deal with them .
The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to elevate the website aesthetic and improve user - friendliness .
A survey was conducted among the 200 people who filled the complaints .
The majority of people were of opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised .
Others problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website , connection issues and login problems , particularly correct credentials not working .
As for the server and database administrators , they should immediately resolve the issues regarding the backend part of the website .
Recommendations
I would like to make the following recommendations :
Implement a tutorial to facilitate the usability for new users , and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request .
I assure you that if these recommendations are implemented , the website will improve significantly .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss the latter was quite astonished .
That evening she met with a local guide she was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization .
Sport not only helps people to become strong and to develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities .
Many people do morning exercises , jog in the morning , train themselves in fitness clubs and gyms , and take part in sports competitions .
Other people like sports too , but they only watch sports competitions , listen to sports news .
They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sport events , but they do n't go in for sports .
The summer kinds of sports are , for example , swimming , athletics , football , volleyball , basketball and others .
Among the popular sports in our country are football , basketball , swimming , volleyball , tennis , gymnastics , figure skating and others .
Speaking about sport I ca n't help saying about football , because this is very spectacular kind of sports .
Some football players are world famous ; they make excellent careers and take part in each championship .
Football matches attract a lot of spectators , who come supporting their favorites .
Perhaps , they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting .
It is also known that extreme sports help to build character and form a strong personality .
There are different types of extreme sports , for example , rock climbing , rafting , scuba diving , surfing , snowboarding , parachuting , hang - gliding , bungee jumping etc .
These activities usually involve speed , height and a good level of physical training .
Doing such sports people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency .
More importantly , it gives the sense of achievement .
In skysurfing you jump out of an airplane and use a board to " surf " the air , doing gymnastics in mid - air !
For example snowboarding , which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow , is more dangerous even than skiing .
Ice diving is for those people who are absolutely crazy .
You should control your body very well if you wish to skate gracefully .
Of course , I watch sports competitions on TV from time to time , like swimming or running .
Television is not an issue of general consensus .
It is definitely a way of spending our free time .
It is possible to watch documentaries , the news , concerts , plays and learn about current affairs .
On the other hand , there are programmes which bring nothing new into our life .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others alike have nothing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment .
All in all , it is my belief that if we use it properly , i.e. , if we carefully choose what to see , television can have an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us , and in particular , in the life of the ones who can not afford travelling , buy books or live in an educated environment .
The film , directed by Louis Leterrier , is about four magicians , known as " The Four Horsemen " that join together by a mysterious benefactor , and during their presentations they do all kind of illegal stuff , such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss .
The characters in charge of the four magicians are Jesse Eisenberg , Isla Fisher , Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson .
The shots of Las Vegas , New Orleans , Paris and New York are wonderful , and the fact that nothing is computerized at the time to witness the magic tricks it absolutely amazing .
Sadly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga nor Justin Timberlake .
I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during vacations .
Staying at home all day is regrettable and not being kidnapped by aliens gets really boring .
After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens , I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York nor hang out with her and Justin Timberlake .
We three counldn't sing together nor make laugh of Kim Kardashian .
But , lets face it doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers , being kidnapped by aliens or singins a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga .
Just a few more days and then we will be on our way to our holiday destination .
We will be travelling by car to a campsite in Gemany .
One of the sights we definitely want to see is the former border between West - Germany and East - Germany .
The region where we will stay has a nice system that encourages people to hike .
For somewhat younger children this is a nice incentive to participate in these hikes .
They live in New York City and have a lot of comical and romantic adventures , all of them related to their friendship .
What could I say about the characters ?
Well , Ross is a paleontologist that works in the Natural History Museum , and he 's Monica 's older brother .
Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan , she is Rachel 's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend ( she finally marries Chandler ) .
Rachel has always been daddy 's little girl but , when she brakes her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera , she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe ( though she gets a job related to fashion world after a few years ) .
Joey is ... well , he 's Joey : not so clever , a great one for the girls and -the most important- Chandler 's best friend .
The most interesting thing of ' Friends ' , in my opinion , is the love story between Ross and Rachel : the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her .
But there are a lot of funny stories , like Phoebe having her stepbrother 's children , or Joey becoming a great soap opera actor .
Secondly , I have many friends living abroad . I communicate with them using Skype .
Will have to start buying magazines and newspapers to be informed ?
In conclusion , my life will be completely changed .
My daily routine is based on having access to the Internet : talking to my friends , reading he newspapers , the forecast weather , and so on ... I will have to change my life .
So , he decided to ignore him absolutely .
The work was done and Michael was proud because everything was done by himself .
The poor boy said he was inspired by Michael 's enthusiasm .
It was perfect and he would be glad just to improve some things , to change the structure , to exclude unnecessary facts , to add some bright illustrations and so on .
The boy had changed everything in the content of the work by the end of their conversation .
Most people love donating money to different charities , but have you ever thought why it gives us such pleasure ? I believe it 's because , as humans , when we see someone happy , it makes us happy , especially if we are the reason for that happiness .
Is it the poor , homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa , or is it some cancer organizations ?
I 've never understood why most people see a closed set of charitable organizations to choose from when they want to donate money .
When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases , and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them , but who do n't have enough money for research . I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they do n't know about them ?
Then I 'll look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure .
To sum up , I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations , to the ones who need more help .
It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their face .
According to Berkow ( 2004 ) , Airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient airway is opened .
An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using .
Also , this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care ( Scoot , 2012 ) .
The majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharma , must recover in a PACU ( Post Anaesthesia Care Unit ) to monitor the vital signs , specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia , impeding any postoperative complication ( Scoot , 2012 ; Farrell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
The first 24 hours of post surgery , is considered the most critical period , because the patient can present , primarily , lung disorders , and the nurse need to maintain the cardio - respiratory stability ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma 's admission on PACU , the first procedure that the nurse should do , is follow the A - G assessment protocol , to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient , sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position , but this position reduces his oxygenation ( Snowball , 2012 ) , and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect , where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward .
Hence , he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction .
Therefore , the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission , via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L / min , until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / min , because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes ( Farrell & Dempsey , 2010 ) .
To help in this issue , the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable , and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation , helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
I realise walking is not considered a sport by everyone .
Therefore , I am going to explain the advantages of walking .
This could be seen as something minor , but being able to do the sport you love without paying is an incredible advantage .
Thirdly , walking gives you a longer life expectancy .
Nevertheless , you learn a lot of things about any sport once you start doing it .
You can start walking as you like , despite that , you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes .
The sightseeing is very important once you start walking .
All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles , learning levels and achievements as well as motivation , personality , and pace of learning .
When there are students with varied levels in English , it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course .
First of all , determining the needs of the students is always the top priority .
While conducting a need analysis , you can have a general picture of learners ' motivation in learning English .
After that , teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual 's needs .
Through teamwork , students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions .
It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other .
Differentiated instructions , giving different tasks for the same activity , are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students .
Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty , or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels .
Moreover , instead of using a core textbook , or using different levels of textbooks , carrying out a theme - based approach is more appropriate , and it also saves teachers ' preparation time .
Finally , preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students , so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged , while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning .
Young people in Ukraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in USSR .
Now youngsters have open access to knowledge and information through the Internet .
Students have more opportunities to learn languages , discover foreign experience , pass internships and study abroad .
Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture , including arts , music , literature etc .
The most valuable thing is that there are so many supporters of different trends in all these areas .
That 's why it 's difficult to define one general style for the generation .
Discussing music styles , people in my country prefer pop and rock .
There are a lot of Ukrainian executives .
It 's necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and now is developed very fast .
If we speak about TV programs , Ukrainian youngsters like popular American and Russian serials , like the Theory of big bang , Suits , Breaking bad , the Game of thrones , the Kitchen and so on . I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian youth watch too many serials and waste a lot of their time .
In clothes , youngsters prefer to wear famous fashion brands .
It 's interesting to admit that there is fashion on Ukrainian traditional clothes " vishyvanka " now .
I hope after reading of my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality .
Also I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sightseens , to feel culture and speak to nice people !
It 's a small town and there are not too many options of travelling by public transport .
My town has got a lot of little villages around it , and it 's very difficult to create a public transport service , because there are long distances between the different places , and there are not enough people to make it profitable .
Train is more expensive , but at the same time , it is more comfortable .
So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages will help a lot of people , especially the older ones .
I am writing in connection with your job advertisement ( Club organiser ) which I 've seen on the noticeboard of my language school .
As a member of student club at my college , my responsibility is to organize events and collaborate with many students from different departments .
Working on projects help me improve my organizational and planning skills .
In order to create and maintain a team spirit , I use different tools like icebreakers and energizers .
Watching movies in groups is a great way to discuss different topics , like justice , personal identity and discrimination .
For the beginning , short and animated movies would be the best , such as movie " Validation " that teaches us how words have the power to change our lives .
With my experience and range of skills I am sure I can contribute to your idea and organise great movie nights .
If I can provide you with any further information on my background and qualifications , please let me know .
Thank you for your consideration .
First of all , I would like to share with you my thoughts on travelling in Brazil .
As a country with one of the longest coastline in the world , I definitely would recommend you to know the beautiful beaches we have .
I would also recommend you to know the city of Rio de Janeiro , there you will find beautiful beaches , wonderful weather and the wonders of nature in a modern and international city .
About working , I think you have a great chance to find an opportunity to work in one of many multinational companies we have in Brazil .
Most of the biggest American companies are in Brazil for a long time and as an English native speaker it will be easier to you to find and internship .
The nine months that you will spend travelling around Brazil will give you a better understanding of Portuguese and that will be an advantage to you find a new job here .
You will find top notch electronics and general goods .
If you want typical souvenirs , you can go to the Buckingham Palace , you will find a lot of small shops that sell souvenirs for a reasonnable price .
It was really exhausting , but illuminating experience .
The main task of the volunteers was to collect money .
There were many visitors from other countries , so we often had to translate the conversation and help in communication .
Everything was new to me and very exciting .
Apart from that , everything 's fine here in Poland .
I agree with you that I 'm brave , but I think I need this time to relax after all that problems that I had with my grandmother .
I 'm planning to improve my English and I have already registered for a course .
Besides that , I would love travelling to other European countries .
I 'm writing to apply for a job in summer camps advertised on your website .
I have graduated from Teacher Training University of Saint - Petersburg ( Russia ) , where I completed a degree in education .
I had penfriends in the United States of America and Australia .
I have some relevant experience , as I have worked in a kindergarten and done some babysitting simultaneously with my studies at the university .
On graduation , I spent two years working as a supplementary education teacher .
My tasks have included organizing sports and other activities for children .
I was also in charge of providing safe and entertaining interection .
References are enclosed .
I am very enthusiastic about working with children and would welcome the chance to make new friends .
I believe I would be suitable for the job advertised as I am a sociable , resourceful and industrious person .
I would readily meet the challenges of the job and handle the responsibilities .
I attach a full CV and if you require more information , I would be very happy to provide it .
Therefore , I do n't feel embarrassed to admit that I love ballet .
Since I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so graciously .
For me it was the perfect combination .
Just as my enthusiasm for ballet thrived , my grades in school kept falling .
Consequently , I had to leave .
There are some things you should take into consideration if you want to try this sport .
Furthermore , ballet is expensive . Supposing that this type of dance is n't a tradition in your country , prepare to open your wallet .
Some of the selected aspects for this assignment were the characteristics that Holden says he likes in others of his favorite books since this is one of them .
He does not like that his brother is " prostituting himself " by writing scripts for movies since he does not like movies .
The purpose of this assignment is to explore the possible short story D. B. wrote and that Holden liked so much .
This was achieved by using as a reference the information that Holden gives us about this short story and including things in it that he might like .
After giving instructions for stage three , I was busy checking the register . I did n't monitor Ss for the first four minutes .
Also , Ss were writing the sentences individually in their notebook instead of choosing only one person to write for the whole team .
When I approached them , they said they ca n't remember the exact words that were dictated .
Ss could hardly hear each other well because of the rectangular layout of the room .
Additionally , one team had finished reconstructing their story while other teams needed more time to finish the task .
I enjoyed every aspect of the experience : the people , the music , the atmosphere , ... When I first arrived at that building , I could not find the entrance .
From the corridor an underground pathway led to the basement of the strange building opposite .
It is still a mystery to me how so many people managed to find their way inside , but when we were in the concert hall at last , hundreds were there already and people were obviously laughing about the fact that the main entrance had magically disappeared .
The atmosphere was really nice ; the people were so light - hearted and I just felt like I could be friends with anyone immediately .
Of course , I originally came there to work : putting the chairs and tables right , ensuring that everyone in my appointed space was well - fed , and keeping an eye on the cash counter .
Raising the academic performance of Students
The principal is dedicated to developing a favourable learning environment .
Given the learning experiences in the past two year 's school - based support , some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs , ELPS and Thinking Tools .
All of the above have been taken a good progress in developing P.1 - 4 school - based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for developing in P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum .
In view of these favourable conditions , higher expectations could be set to improve the learning progress and enhance the learning performance of NCS .
The improvement of TSA results and internal results celebrated the success of teachers ' efforts .
More collaborative efforts should be paid to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS .
5.2 . Sustaining capacity building through CLP
Given the experiences gained in the support services , many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS .
The school could consider stepping up collaborative efforts in developing coherence in curriculum development .
More professional opportunities could be purposefully arranged to explore some effective strategies and promote discussion among teachers .
Sharing among teachers could be encouraged to understand the learning of NCS .
Technology plays a key role in our modern lives .
Nowadays , with the development of genetics , we might be able to stop world famine .
The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans , unfortunately , there is no evidence of GMC 's being completely safe for human consumption .
It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the command of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports , leaving a cluster of questions without any answer .
Companies as Monsanto that engineers plants with steeril seeds , encourage non - sustainable production models that promote the extinction of independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era .
According to an article published by UNAM in 2001 , the introduction of GMC 's has had a huge impact on the global market .
The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with the global food security .
The usage of genetically modified crops has proven to be dangerous for humans as well as for the environment .
In their quest for the perfect seed , genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds biodiversity , as stand by a research led by Greenpeace , GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non - modified crops .
Consequently , we must be careful with the decisions we make .
It is worth mentioning that we never know the impact that scientific research and harvesting techniques are going to have over our lives , but the fate of those improvements depends on the application that humans give them .
In conclusion , I would rather say that companies must reinforce our humanity before manipulating the environment in such a radical manner .
ENGLISH - LANGUAGE TV PROGRAMMES IN ITALY .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to analyse and assess the impact of English - language television programmes on Italian culture and to make suitable recommendations .
Popularity of English - language TV programmes
The presence on electronic devices of English - language TV programmes is becoming more and more prominent .
A survey was carried out in the most populated Italian cities and 2000 citizens were interviewed on 22nd October to quantify their interest in such segment of the national TV schedule with the following results :
• 40% of those interviewed , most of which have proven to be young people , declared they watch English - language TV programmes at least five times a week ;
People enjoy listening to the original audio , which entails realism and naturalness .
Although the importation of such programmes has produced positive effects , such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life , it has also produced negative outcomes .
Italian companies must face the challenge set by the market demand due to the importation of many foreign traditions .
Recommendations
It is highly recommended that the government should provide adequate financial support to traditional small businesses .
I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised , to be able to reply to the threat represented by low price imported ones .
One intelligent person once said : ' The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page . '
I totally agree with this statement and , to my mind , people should travel a lot because our world is incredible .
First of all , of course , travelling by car is much more convenient than , for example , by bus .
Even just in cities , let it alone travelling at long distances .
But , on the other hand , traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient .
Secondly , travelling by public transport is much cheaper .
Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport .
Thirdly , we should take care of our environment !
So , my advice is to travel by bicycle ( at least , use public transport ) because it is environmentally friendly !
The difference in work meetings between the British and France are that the British want to make decisions and the France way more like a debate , as is written in a guide for Franco - British business relationships .
The opinion of Simon Kuper is that the main reason for the misunderstandings are different languages .
This in contrast to the guide " Light at the End of the Tunnel : Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business " published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain .
The by the UK 's Foreign Office in 1944 published booklet " instructions for British Serviceman in France " is still useful for the most , nowadays .
When you get hired by a British employer it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports .
International relationships are built by people who can speak the same languish and who are at the same level of their vocabulary .
I live in a small town called Grycksbo and I 've been part of Unga Kris volunteering programs since the summer 2010 .
At first , I joined Unga KRIS and started volunteering to have fun and meet new people .
Now that I have been volunteering for a while , my expectations have changed : Unga KRIS is still a place where I expect to have fun and meet new people but I also expect to grow even more as a person , to take on responsibilities and face my fears in different social situation . »
Volunteer work provides an organization with free resources to help it achieve goals .
In many cases , volunteers are crucial to help maintain life , as when meals are delivered to homebound people .
Sometimes volunteer work , such as renovating a playground , benefits the broader community .
And while volunteer work is important for the individuals and communities served , it also benefits the volunteer .
At first , I found it as an exhilarating and rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
In fact , I was responsible and I had the determination and the skills , because I learned it from my parents .
It was exhausting ! !
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the possibility of hosting the European football championship in my country .
This report outlines the benefits and the possible objections .
As a matter of fact Budapest , the capital city of Hungary can be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event .
Margit Island is a favourite destination for runners and lovers .
Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location .
Transportation system
Regardless of the mode of transport , fares are very affordable .
The transportation system is effective .
The underground system can ease congestion .
Facilities
Puskás Ferenc stadium has ample seats for the spectators .
2 . ) Airport Hotel is the most adjacent accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport .
This inexpensive hotel has 112 rooms .
3 . ) Le Meridien is set in the city 's fashionable business hub .
The flourishing cultural life will fascinate visitors .
The admission 's tickets to the most of Budapest 's museums are comparatively cheap .
Objections
The main concern is related to petty crime , especially the pickpocketing .
Suggestions
Old historical buildings are in disrepair .
The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people .
In conclusion it would be a good idea and a viable way through sponsorships .
Moreover , this would be advantageous both for hosting city and the tourists .
By that time I had visited six interviews , but nobody was interested in my candidacy .
I decided to go to my parents and spend a few weeks helping them with a renovation of their house .
I opened the envelope and found in it an offer of employment .
At first I did not understand anything and I had decided that it was a mistake .
But then I remembered when I was 15 I 've sent my scientific work to the Patent service .
It turned out that they send my work to a few Instituts and one of them was interested in me .
That day was a start of my scientific career .
They say that the Earth 's population will need to find and colonise two planets as our forests and fresh water supplies will vanish .
Of course , all of this is unrealistic .
It 'll be impossible for people to live on other planets in 50 years ' time .
Technology wo n't have been advanced enough by that time .
But it 's not entirely impossible .
There is a little truth and possibility in it .
I 'm completely sure that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth , although our life styles will have changed a lot .
Many young students who have finished their secondary education wonder whether they should take a year off before they make the most important decision about which university course they find suitable for their future .
Firstly , most teenagers who are against this idea are convinced that the university course they have chosen will be the future career in their lives .
Moreover , they feel they have to make the most of their time to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love .
Conversely , there are many teenagers who need to take their time and see much of what the world has to offer them .
Others , by contrast , choose a country or trace an itinerary to travel to the place of their dreams and set off to live new experiences .
To my mind , gaining experience of any kind and taking a year gap before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people 's perspective to life and will help them become more confident with what they really love .
I 'm not sure if this is true or wrong , because simply I 'm not here to judge or comment on the authenticity of the statement , but rather , I 'm here to make my path through writing .
How can one know they have the guts ? what I believe , and think it 's true , is that braveness , boldness as well as callousness make people write truly what they think , without any lies , without any camouflage and without any kind of burnished layers .
Writers often make their masterpieces shiny and glowing in order to make it more acceptable by people , less shocking to them and less close to the reality from which readers had the intention to escape when they have picked that piece of writing in the first place .
While some people argue that bad human nature is the reason , it is undeniable that social problems and indigence are responsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings .
To begin with , it is true that humans are often born with greed and selfishness .
These crimes may be committed by sensible people who are not able to control themselves at crucial times .
Thus , bad natural personality can be the seed of crime .
On the other hand , I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst for illegality .
It means that a number of law offenders can not sustain their livelihood , and they desperately experience limited options to earn money .
As a result , they are easily drawn by the allure of wealth , which leads to illegal activities such as theft , kidnapping or drug trafficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas .
The proliferation of these crimes undoubtedly has a negative effect on the city 's life .
In addition , the prevalence of social media such as television or the internet is partially to blame .
Also , films and video games containing violent scenes can stimulate audiences to imitate those acts and commit crimes .
This is particularly common among young people who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime , I hold the position that crime occur due to social media and poverty .
In the past people used technology as a tool for making survival an easier endeavor .
Nowadays we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come .
In the modern - day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it turned to a means of communication and entertainment .
Mass communication technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people .
At the same time this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society , is the use of technology destroying face - to - face interaction and communication between people ?
Whenever you 're in a coffee shop , standing at a bus stop or taking the tube you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it made face - to - face interaction and communication between people nonexistent .
This is true in many aspects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people with texting and social networks .
This leads , among other things , to the ability for people to be lonely , as having too many virtual friendships causes the inability to establish meaningful relationships .
The young generations in our society are participating in a massive , unintentional social experiment the results of which are not entirely predictable .
I personally believe that imitation is just the sincerest form of admiration .
Flattering is different , it is easier to recognize .
If someone depends on you and s / he is constantly paying attention to you and being , in a colloquial way , a " brown nose " , you notice and become aware of it quickly .
Just because of their attitude and aptitude , their behaviour … simply in the way they act , we can see their intentions .
Nowadays , in some determinate cases , people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted , they flatter .
And we can see these examples in many situations , when we find inept and incompetent workers .
When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams , I think there are only two ways : influences or flattery ; and to be honest I do n't know what I prefer .
To sum up , I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation , to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be .
The line separating you from the people you work with .
You need boundaries between you and the rest of the world .
If you 're willing to take the chance ... the view from the other side is spectacular .
There 's another way to survive this competition .
I am really interested in martial arts , such as Aikido , Judo and self - defense that I have already practiced .
These kinds of sports have some advantages and disadvantages .
the First advantage of martial arts is to improve self - confidence .
You will get ready to fight with others , regardless their strengths , ages and so on .
When you do a technique successfully on your opponent , you feel more confidence .
Every time , you do a technique you have to show your respect to opponent , and also other ranks , regardless to their age .
Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body ; eyes , hands and legs .
When you do a technique or defense against a technique , you control your body 's movement and coordinate them to work in the same time .
Some people think there are some disadvantages like injury , and getting aggressive .
People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy , and also to respect .
And when you are starting , follow the discipline and find the ideas and thoughts that are hidden behind the movements and techniques .
In the other words , try to understand the philosophy of the sports before learning the techniques .
Last night I had the opportunity to attend a marvelous play based on the book " Alice in Wonderland " which was enthusiastically received by both adults and children .
The original work was written by the mathematical , logical and British writer Lewis Carroll .
The wonderland that is described in the book is created through logic games , and , therefore , it is understandable the success it has achieved in the most varied environments .
The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent adapted to the present time , such as , the White Rabbit , Mad Hatter , the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts .
One of the biggest differences with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters .
The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to let your imagination in the same way that when you read the book .
" Encourage learner autonomy - the teacher wo n't always be there to provide answers " Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish .
This lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to the classmates what activities need to be done .
This time in order to further reduce my TTT I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well .
I hope by handing over the complete control to the class this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negation . techniques
This made every thing seem less cluttered and more manageable .
I highlighted anything that required an action from me on my copy of the clues e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise .
I found that the class challenged the student who had the answers , if they had written down something different .
I found that they challenged each other more than they ever do me .
They used a lot of language that they would be able to use in everyday discussions ( arguments ) outside of the classroom .
The enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off .
I decided to cut an exercise in order to let the students continue their discussions .
In heinz sight giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point ( past modals ) was not the best choice .
Despite having timing issues , I feel that thus far this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT .
It 's a city where you can recreate a part of the European history , thanks to the ancient and magnificent building , and where you can enjoy the last technologies and have fun .
Inside it , we can find the well known sistine chapel , I ca n't tell you how it is , because last year when I went , there was a changeover of pope , and it was closed and I could n't entry .
Furthermore , if you go in summer , you should go to a lively area and be with the interesting and nice people , but like every city , be careful with the rough areas .
Despite the people 's opinions , if you have the opportunity to go , do n't throw it away , and check it for yourself .
FRIENDSHIP TODAY
At some point , all of us have benefited enormously from a real friendship .
Counting on someone capable of understanding your demands , who shares with you the innermost feelings and who is able of discussing possible misunderstandings , is totally rewarding .
Nevertheless , a friendship depends largely on sincerity and empathy .
Curiously , you never know where will you find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe attends to the same sport lessons than you or simply work in the same company .
It is surprising the amount of nice people next to you sometimes , and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you have now new friends .
After we ate the cake , I found my mom looking at me an screaming:"Oh !
When I looked at the mirror , my face was spotted with red spots and it kind of turned purple , when I looked at my hands and my arms , it was all red from my fingers when I was scratching them , and the parts that were n't red , they were spotted like my face .
Anyways , mom gave me a medicine(I do n't know what it is ) , and a cream for my arms and hands because they were turning blue .
And do n't be afraid , I 'm okay , and I decided to check on everything from blue berries .
How is the experience of learning another language ?
However , who is skilled in speaking a foreign language has a huge advantage in a competitive and worldwide society .
I had the opportunity to have different language classes , such as English , French and Spanish .
On the one hand , I have been learning English for so long that my good profeciency have given me the chance to get a position in an international work team .
I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about me .
As a student of these classes , especially , of English ; I realized that , although the classes were important , a systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and , moreover , for maintaining it .
Therefore , the hardest task of learning another language is to keep a high level of motivation to work on it and to pay for it .
Nevertheless , learning another language has many benefits , such as the ability in living and visiting countries with different languages , meeting foreign people , working in an international environment , reading books or websites in other languages , etc .
The RUBBERNECKER novel review by Marian Greco
Bauer 's fourth novel is an originally surprising thriller which includes an astonishing view of Aspergen syndrome from the prospective of Patrick , a trainee medicine student .
With the tender age of 18 and coping with his eccentric social code and all the possible courage , Patrick moves from his mother 's house to a rented flat in Cardiff to pursue his greatest dream , work in the Anatomy Department at Cardiff University .
The writer lets us observe the fear , anxiety and the defenceslessness of Sam , a neurological patient who is just beginning to emerge from its comatose state and has yet to deal with the reality of his new situation , sorting out pieces of memories involving relatives and not quite understanding why a woman he does n't know anything about claims to be his wife .
Patrick performances brilliantly the autopsy of Sam and finds out shocking information which leads the reader to the discovery of tragic and incidental deaths of neurological patients involving all at once doctors , nurses and patient 's relatives .
In this task , Patrick will be helped out by Lexi , the daughter of his autopsy corpse , to throw some light out of the creepy suspicion of medical mistreatment and their darkest consequences .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Everything started with some attacks here and there but no one really knew what was happening , so the attacks were tagged as " animal attacks " .
But when they became more frequent and witnesses described huge , flurry , dark and terrifying creatures with blood - shot eyes , panic grew over the population .
Government authorities told people to stay calm and a curfew was established , but Peter was on the camping holiday with his best friends and only heard this when they met another group of people that , fortunately , had a radio .
They told them everything .
In order to be stronger in number , they befriended those people and helped each other .
I 'm 23 years old and love to cook and I also love to be outdoors and play sports with the kids , I love organizing activities for children and actually playing with them , I 'm always cheerful and in a great mood , I do n't smoke or Drink , I have a good level of english speaking and I 've always been hardworking and energetic
My plan is simple , I want to make the best of this British experience by studying English and possibly by finding a little job .
At the moment I am struggling with the translation of my cv .
I am wondering if you could help me by giving me some tips to write a perfect cv , or at least acceptable .
I have just found a cheap accommodation in a hostel which is very convenient to all the facilities .
Even though I am shy and I like my privacy , I think that during this experience it will be better to have contacts with foreign people to practise my spoken English as much as possible .
The aim of this experience is also having fun and great time with you .
For example , what about going for some walks across the countryside or renting a bike ?
Ok , I have told you everything and I really should finish packing !
I am rather lazy as a person , I ca n't say I really enjoy sports in general but I definitely love walking .
There 's no special advice to give to somebody who wants to start this activity : if you aim doing something good for your health and for your mind , just wear comfortable clothes , put your pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiring place and just go and enjoy any minute of it .
You may want some nice music with you , so an Ipod is a handy solution to collect all your favourite songs and set up the perfect soundtrack to your walking activity .
It 's very cheap as well : except for your jumpsuit and a pair of comfortable trainers , it does n't require any extra cost for technical or sophisticated equipment .
Actually , now I 'm staying in New Zealand , but I can give you some advice about travelling and working in Korea .
I think this is a very good experience to you because you can learn about another culture and people 's way of thinking .
Also , if you want to work more specific place such as electric company , public office and so on , you can apply to internship programme .
If you get the intership , you can work as a real businessman .
Normally , summer is the best season for travelling .
In summer , you can enjoy many activities on the beach and also you can go hiking .
Especially , I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island .
If you want to know more information about Korea , let me know and I do n't mind checking your plan to go Korea .
When I opened , I was handcuffed straight away and I pretended to be surprised .
Nevertheless , the police had found out the buried body .
Fortunately , Michael , who had n't thought that option , left the interrogation room .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Travelling farther down he found his destination , a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog .
His panting turned into a magnificent grin as he looked out the window and saw a black helicopter heading in his direction .
To begin with , I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday o to move themselves around the city or town because they feel free and do n't have to pay attention to the timetable .
But , on the other hand , when they travel abroad , it 's easier to take a train o a plane because you arrive faster and you need n't find a place to park your car and if you want to go somewhere you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground .
In conclusion , from my point of view , if you are in your own town or city , you use your car more often than when you are visiting another country and seeing the sights .
This diagram illustrates the complete process of note - making .
While background color and art work are thoroughly considered , security issues are one thing that we can not over look either .
After this , metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank notes printing , in which stage sheets are used to print ( each containing 50 bank notes ) .
Then comes the most important stage -- inspection .
Sheets in the second groups then get seperated into good ones , which , together with good quality sheets , enter a process of packaging and distribution where seperate notes are cut and finally enter the market , and bad ones , which go to disposal with bad quality sheets , where both groups get securely destroyed .
This leads us to a conclusion that the process of bank notes creation is secure as well as simple .
That day is one of the memories I appreciate the most .
Because I want him to be my daughter's / son 's dad , and to share an apartment with him , so we can buy our first Christmas tree as a couple with a real engagement , and spend every holiday , birthday , day , minute with him by my side .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
" It 's time for us to shine , " His handwritten words come to life in her mind .
She could distinctively hear his low , manly voice in her head .
His deep chuckles still made butterflies in her stomach .
It was not an absolutely pleasant experience .
Disgusting .
The person was holding her wrist , preventing her from wiping any sweat on her face .
Wide eyed , red lips , rosy cheeks , broad - build and a little stubble on his chin , he looked incredible .
This blue eyes , were much darker with insecurity , doubt and mystery .
Alison swallowed her laughter inside her , knowing this was not the appropriate time to joke around .
First of all , let me tell the adavantages .
They are obvious , nevertheless , I feel I should repeat them .
The former does not need any explanation .
I have them because I have paid for them , not for other particular reason .
Last but not least , we could create an association that could be in charge of receiving books at the beginning .
Later , it could support other school initiatives .
In conclusion , we should provide free books to our students .

The streets were calmed and the lights were pleasant . Travelling at night was a pleasure in this town .
He was making preparations to make a huge deal with the other person .
They said in a delightful and evil tone .
They controlled his mind .
She looked on her laptop , where all the information in that man 's mind was displayed
The building was luxurious and covered by the most wonderful structures ever .
They got with the receptionist
The receptionist nooded and conducted both to the main hall .
What was inside was dangerous but fascinating .
It was disturbing as kids were also included .
It was impossible they deleted every bit of information about themselves
Just how a coin has two sides , television too , has its pros and cons .
It offers unlimited entertainment as well as food for thought .
To quote an example , the prime minister of India recently launched a new channel called DD KISAN - the first television channel dedicated to farmers in India .
This would help the farmers to know the latest techniques and trends in agriculture and will also enable them to put across their queries to the concerned specialists in their field .
Off late , debates in news channels are the talk of the town where u get to know what is happening in your country or neighborhood .
Such programs also allows us to participate by giving our feedback .
Gone are the days when tom mindlessly chased jerry .
presently we have many educational cartoons that teach kids how to draw , make crafts and even learn languages .
Hence , I conclude that television entertains as well as educates .
However , I believe that their functionality will change .
Even today processors are in almost every device : dishwashers , vacuum cleaners , television sets , even blenders .
It may sound silly , but I think it actually will make those devices more user friendly and functional .
Even now we can buy TV sets with Internet connection , so development of technology is not a problem .
You come back and dinner is cooked , all your favourite programmes are recorded and ready to watch , Your bath is full of hot water and you can just relax .
Reassuming , while design of houses may look different the most important change will be in technology which will make our life easier .
It has already done but we still ca n't see the end of possibilities .
I have read your advertisement in the local newspaper and I am writing to apply for a job at USA SUMMER CAMPS .
Apart from that , I have been studying English for 10 years and I am sitting for Cambridge First Certificate in English next December .
Firstly I would like to say that I have some experience in looking after children because I have worked at a local summer camp last summer .
As for my personality , I would like to mention that I am a funny person who enjoys telling jokes , making people laugh and even getting dressed as a clown to entertain others .
Furthermore , I do not mind working long hours .
I hope my application will be taken into consideration .
If you require any further information , I am available for an on line interview .
Yours faithfully ,
It 's no secret that there has been a decline in the use of transport such as taxis ever since cars became more affordable and your common Joe became capable of sustaining one , two or more per family , however , does that really mean that the future of public transport like buses is hopeless ?
People are becoming more and more aware of the strain the carbon dioxide emissions of their cars put on the environment , and many municipalities have already outlawed the circulation of certain types of vehicles in given parts of their cities to reduce atmospheric pollution and improve the quality of its air .
Many affordable bus and metropolitan passes and other systems have also been created in order to motivate the citizens to use them , providing a quicker , and sometimes cheaper , alternative to their own transport .
The recent focus on public transport , along with the certain technological improvements and innovations that will follow it , are going to revitalize the public transport sector and hopefully make cities more eco - friendly .
It was n't only the smile , but the way she talked to him , the look in her eyes and her flirty attitude what had filled his stomach with tiny butterflies and , as he was going home , he started to realize the love running through his veins , right to the heart .
As Michael approached the house his feelings dropped down .
He picked up the keys from his pocket and approached carefully , holding his breath .
The problem with this movie is not the story because the book is fantastic and when you read it , you really can feel the emotions to the characters .
Furthermore , the main actors ' performance is not very good because they are not completely inside in their roles .
Although there are a lot of things which could be improved , not everything is bad in this movie !
An example of that it 's the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song of Pablo Alboran , a Spanish singer .
Other good features are the customs and the landscapes which give to the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time
On the one hand , you 've been doing sport since you were seven years old and I understand it 's very important for you .
On the other hand , you love playing piano and , in my opinion , you wo n't be able to keep it up if you give up music classes , as you do n't have any instruments at home .
Besides , I do n't think your parents would buy you a piano , since it would really annoy your neighbours .
However , I see sport as a physical activity , where I constantly challenge myself to achieve better results .
It 's just like a competition when I practise sport .
At least once a month , usually on Sundays , my friends and I hold a competition .
Swimming gives me a huge amount of satisfaction and so much desire to keep on challenging myself .
I am writing to inform you that the package holidays to Madrid you are currently advertising in your newspaper are apparently not what they claimed to be .
I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish , as your readers could be negatively biassed towards your paper only due to such incidents .
Generally , the holiday as a whole was good enough as the most important -in my opinion- aspects , like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation , was very high .
Nevertheless , there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic .
Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling , but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday , which made me and some others feel deceived .
Another point of concern was transportation .
We had several problems , especially with the bus , which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour .
I believe there is plenty of room for improvement since , although the problems were not insuperable , they caused great inconvenience .
Firstly , a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented .
Secondly , advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them .
But the most important issue is the improvement of the general organization .
I assume that the tourist agency can think of better solutions than me , but I hope that my recommendations will be taken seriously .
There are six main characters Ross , Monica , Rachel , Chandler , Phoebe and Joey .
She works in a restaurant as the head chef and she 's dating with a man twenty years older than her .
It also shows you the power of the family and how they should stick together through all the difficulties they face .
Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher 's responsibility .
On one hand , parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child 's first contact .
However , they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people .
Ultimately , teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents .
On the other hand , parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need , for example pay for their children school .
It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home , making the school responsibility to pass good social values .
To sum up , parents should take full responsibility for their children education .
I am writing in regard to the advertisement published by you , to work in summer camps in the USA .
I would like to take part in this experience during the summer , as I will have my summer brake during that period .
During my apprenticeship , I was in charge of organising several activities , so I think I could do well at organising sports and activities .
Cooking has always been one of my favourite hobbies , and for this reason , I also would like to help in the kitchen activities .
I am a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person , and I am also a very responsible person , able to deal with small and medium groups of children , and for this reason I consider myself as suitable for the potition advertised .
I am looking forward to taking part in this project , and enrich my personal curriculum through the participation in this project .
Looking forward to hearing from you , at your earliest convenience .
Restpectfully ,
Everything in this movie , Henri , is so simple and startling , but in the same time is hard to describe .
It tells the story of a widowed shop owner and a mentally handicapped girl .
As time passes by , the relationship has so many ups and downs , but with consistent love and caring it ends with a strong bond that is n't easily broken .
In France , where the film is made , they call the handicapped , " White Butterflies " , which is definitely a better nomenclature than " People With Special Needs " and so many dishonored names .
My sole purpose is to help you enjoy the little things in your lives , appreciate the life and its simplicity with all its hidden fun and sad parts as well .
Unlock the door toward a new life and kick off your journey toward a whole new group of characters .
Check out how ordinary people , just like you and me , live each and every day , share their grief and problems , join them with their happy moments , get involved in their lives and be passionate and compassionate .
The aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course " Good design using DTP " so as to give an overall view of it .
DESCRIPTION
All the participants , which were ten in total , were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught .
Furthermore , the organizers had carefully planned the whole course , including meals and beverages too .
ACHIEVEMENTS
The tutor , Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge , succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way .
To begin with , he focused on design considerations with DPT , explaining what software to use , and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts , layout and balance as well as graphics and logs .
Therefore , he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing .
The highpoint , however , was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension .
Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty .
The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too , who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue .
In addition , in spite of having paid a lot , the participants were not allowed to take any materials away , and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants did n't have any materials to use to revise .
FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
To sum up , the course was generally successful , as the positive feedback received suggests .
In conclusion , we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor .
There are many problems created by doing large - building projects , and it is the government 's responsibility to cope with these problems .
There are some unfavorable influence on people 's lives .
For example , in some areas , people have to wear a musk while having outdoor activities and they might need to purchase water from other towns .
As a result , their lifestyle can be negatively affect and thus they would feel less happy than other people lived in unpolluted areas .
They have to immigrate to another place since their homes are destroyed , and during the immigration most of them would die because of lack of water , high temperature or predators .
Besides , those animals who successfully arrive at proper place to live are likely to suffer from disease , because they did n't exposed to such a new environment before .
Although there are many people and animals are suffer from these problems , i do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them .
Firstly , laws should be set to forbid some projects which cause massive problems to the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary for the government to warn people the serious problems caused by constructing large - scale buildings .
To summarise , large - scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to human and animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these problems
And the other questions : Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
From my point of view , my writing definitely has improved from the beginning of this school year till now .
I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well - structured sentences now , which I could n't do so well at the beginning of this school year .
This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well .
The way I see it is that I learned to use cohesion in a correct way , which makes the paragraphs that I write more clear .
Subsequently , I would like to answer the next two questions .
Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process ?
Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year , I 'd like to improve my English vocabulary .
As I see it , the bigger the vocabulary , the better the writing process .
More words can be add in the article , so there can be a better explanation of the subject .
It 's my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process .
I learned a lot of new words during the presentations , which I used in my free writing .
The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course , always can be used later on in life .
A better future means having good food to eat without worrying , good clothes to wear , a big property , a private means of transportation and many more .
Among them a private means of transportation suggests that there is no future for public transport .
Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me .
Private care per individual is needed .
Whether to go to work or other places travelling in private vehicle is hassle free .
The trend of personal car is increasing rapidly .
It is so much clear that private transport will overshadow the public vehicles .
Unfortunately , many people are damaged , not only physical but mentally and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves their sons in the hell it causes .
They are just the most sensitive and innocent victims of mistreatment .
It is very serious and hard to solve because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and being able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes .
This is so difficult due to the fact that they usually feel stupid , miserable , hopeless and do not feel good about themselves .
Their aggressors make them become insecure and they think that they are alone .
Even , in most cases , they feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to tell their truth .
There is always someone who you can count on in your family , friends or associations , but you must ask for help .
We need to consider both sides of the argument for public transport use prior to reaching a conclusion .
Public transport is used for many reasons and can be convenient for different circumstances .
This form of transport can be used to avoid delays due to traffic conditions and parking restrictions .
It can provide an opportunity for people to complete work during the journey .
Public transport may be the only option for individuals who do not drive or have access to a car .
It is more environmentally friendly because it has the potential to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road .
However , the public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues .
It may be expensive to use for some individuals and crowded during rush hours .
Using the car can be more flexible for some individuals .
A car can be useful for effective performance of many tasks .
It is easier to change routes when circumstances change unexpectedly .
The reasons for use is dependent on the individual and the circumstances .
First of all , in this film you do n't see a gangster Al Pacino , it 's about a retired army 's coonel who suffers from loneliness and depression .
So , overall I strongly recommend it if you like redemption stories , and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life .
The reading discusses the idea of how advance communication technologies give us an advantages of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons of support .
The professor , however , disagrees with points made in the article and explains that this system has its own disadvantages .
First point the professor addresses involves the reading 's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and at the same time it will decrease the time frame of getting the project done .
The professor refutes this point of view by saying that based on his own experience this team work could be not so much beneficial .
Therefore , the working group will do its assumptions and may cause a waste of time .
Moreover , the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do same work differently , so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done .
Another point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause to businesses .
The professor points out that holding virtual meetings between teams in different time frames will be challenging .
Thus , one of the team will have to stay late in order to talk to another group causing inconvenience .
It is not easy to prove that there is a relationship between organizational culture and performance .
For a very long time there has not been scientific evidence that proved the relationship between organizational culture and performance , until studies found a correlation between these subjects .
These four studies are put together in a model named ' Organization Culture Performance Model ' ( OCPM ) .
This model tells us that the culture is determined by actual behavior of individual or groups of employees .
The culture is caused by organizational variables .
The external aspect is : external client orientation .
The internal aspects are : design of organization , communication , HRM - orientation and leadership .
The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : individual- , groups- , and organizational performances .
There is n't a direct relationship between organizational culture and actual performances , but there is a direct relationship between organizational culture and expected performances .
The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employee 's experience .
A short summary of the OCPM- model : there are organizational variables that determine the visible and invisible behavior of employees .
These variables and behavior of employees determine the expected performance and then there is the actual outcome .
More and more people nowadays try to find some ways of relaxation , due to a fast pace of life and stress .
Smoking appeals to hearts of many people of different generations , because it gives a fast relief for a short period of time , that is also quite reasonable .
It 's a fact that tobacco is used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities .
It 's a real issue for the government to understand that if the process of banning smokers starts , the income rate will immediately decrease .
Moreover tobacco contains a vitamin , called PP1 that is beneficial for your health .
It also helps to overcome some stressful situations , even though it 's temporarily , it 's still beneficial for your heart , rather than being constantly stressed .
It 's important to understand that you are responsible for your surroundings and people around you .
So if your habits can be harmful for them you need to understand what 's a cost of it .
For the same reason government needs to control the situation , by using banning strategy if people smoke in one of forbidden ares , like kindergartens , schools , hospitals , etc .
In my opinion , people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own , but as soon as it starts to be a treat for others , they should be stopped immediately .
The purpose of this report is to consider how my town takes care of the environment and to explain what kind of recommendations and improvements you can make if you live in Madrid .
Madrid is a huge city which offers a lot of recycling facilities that take care of the environment :
It 's very easy to recycle things and it 's possible to choose alternative energy sources .
Firstly , people can take the bus or the underground and leave his or her car at home .
Another option is the possibility of having solar panels on the roofs of some buildings in Madrid .
Old clothes , books and toys in good conditions can be passed on to charity shops .
In conclusion , Madrid offers a lot of alternatives to take care of the environment .
Discuss the risks and impacts of climate(weather)-related natural disasters .
Over the past few decades , human activities have changed global climate , hence we are facing higher risks of weather - related disasters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters have struck into the whole society with many negative elements , drawing the attention of citizens toward catastrophes .
This essay will examine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of drought , followed by two main negative impacts in terms of the economic and social problems in agriculture .
It is obvious that global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions .
Moreover , the world 's uncontrollable population results in the demand of cars , industries and farming industries , that have contributed to greenhouse gases .
With the cause of human activities , the temperature of sea surface and the atmosphere have been gradually growing to a new level .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century , with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most of greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades , which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall .
Another phenomenon can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomenon .
Undoubtedly , all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation .
Generally , the increase of temperature has resulted in a surge of hot days , and a drop of cold days .
This will largely causes less of soil water and precipitation .
Additionally , this event is different depending on the areas .
The area as mid - continental will unquestionably become dryer and insufficient precipitation , which is possible to make it more vulnerable to summer droughts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brief , there will be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to extreme weather .
In the economic aspect , drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .
As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture , prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor .
This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain , which can produce directly negative impacts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .
Moreover , it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs : lives are lost , people and animals are forced to move to a new place , resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt , 2012 , p. 148 ) .
Another stricken area is social perspective , which has threatened the majority of the population .
Firstly , drought has caused farming in some of the area , such as Africa where is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency .
Moreover , farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather - related natural disasters , and it has caused an important number of casualties for both mankind as well as animals .
Secondly , farming also has contributed to migration .
When public suffers from natural disasters and they are no solutions , they are forced to leave their home in order to move to a new place , which could affect the next generation that might confront a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought has led to severe social impacts of natural disasters .
In conclusion , catastrophes such as drought have produced immense economic and social impacts .
Not only human beings but also all the organisms are confronting the threat from climate - related natural disasters .
The fact is natural disasters have changed people and animal 's living environment bringing about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise .
Additionally , climate change relates to natural disasters also causes farming which has triggered death and forced people as well as animals leave their home . More seriously , climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters .
Everything seems to strange when you fifteen and you are talking about love .
This past few months have made my life unfathomable , making me unable to grasp the idea of when is the right age to fall in love .
I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older , and I know nothing will come out of it .
Yes , it hurts , but at the end of the day , almost everything in this world , will make you bleed .
It will make you feel vulnerable but that is life .
They will always love you base on your looks then personality .
I am the chairman of the 2012 Metropolitan Medical Conference that is being held in Miami , Florida on July 5 , 2012 , and I would like to invite you to present your research on beta blockers . We would be delighted to listen to you discuss your work , and I hope you will also agree to run a short question - and - answer session after the presentation .
Additionally , Metropolitan Medical would be pleased to cover your travel and lodging expenses while you visit the conference , in addition to providing you with a per diem budget .
If you are young you could walk fast , if you are old or not especially fit , you could start walking at a slow pace and with time improve your performance
I would like to give some advice to the people who want to start walking : Take your time , do not want to walk ten kilometers the first day , try first short walks and every day increase the distance .
And if you do that then , sooner than later , you will become a walking enthusiast
He used to dream him coming in his bedroom , laughing out loud showing off his sharp teeth , threating him with the most horrible punishments .
He remembered one of the awful dreams he used to have as a child .
Suddenly he felt brave and unstoppable .
It is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something , colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that .
Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes , especially for women .
No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well .
In addition , companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes .
For instance , I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons .
Furthermore , colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential .
For example , psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people 's appetite and makes them feel hungry .
That is why the predominant colour in McDonald 's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants .
To some up briefly , I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which influence their choice .
Thus , we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors .
My friendship with Jessie started the first exciting day of kindergarten .
I went downstairs to the playground for the break .
I was walking alone around the noisy and crowded playground , looking for my very first friend , when I saw a quiet girl under a tree .
We played every day together and , in the afternoons , we went to each other 's houses .
I love how Jessie helps me with everything I need , like with guys or family problems .
We love doing sleepovers , watch movies and going on holidays together .
It is generally accepted that television is providing us by far the best and easiest way to stay in touch with the whole world , while relaxing on our sofa , taking some time off from our housework .
This is the innovation that such a worldwide media is bringing to our society .
A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television , not to miss a new cartoon nor a well - known film : they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries , news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of .
It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about present topics and problems , in order to learn something more about the world we are living in .
In view of the above arguments , I would suggest anyone to cut out on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily .
Secondly public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the enviromnent .
Lastly if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops many people will be unemployed , they could not win more money and buy cars for going from one place to another .
In conclusion public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything will be a disaster
Interrupting the momentum by taking a year off is maybe the worst thing you can do .
Without the routine that studying gives you , with all the dealines , the exams , and other stuff that forces you to get things done , and , by consequence , teaches you to be a responsible person , which you would need to be when you get a job , you will simple be wasting one year of your life by taking a break .
One thing that I 've learned in my life is that you never should take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need , due to fatigue or some other physical or pscychological reason , otherwise you will be , I repeat , just wasting time , time that you could be spending in an usefull way , by getting something done , or improving yourself academically , intelectualy or doing whatever you think that can enrich your life .
I 've wasted so much time in my life that even I found it embarrassing .
Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits at high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life .
Regardless of what 's waiting for me at the end , I will never give up walking through those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be .
I do n't need your friendship you bastard !
I hope I do n't get an F by saying this , but it is the truth , and I love being honest . I know , as soon you put your creepy , wicked eyes on my composition I must expect a bad grade .
I bet you love money , especially money obtained by illegal means , do n't you ?
I am writing in reply to your advertisment published in the local newspaper for the vancancy of Junior Chef .
I believe I have the necessary qualifications and experience that you are looking for .
Moreover , I am currently undertaking a Chef Training Course which provides me , not only practical but also theorical knowledge .
Furthermore , I alwyas try to maintain a positive attitude towards my responsibilities and sort out any problem that may occur .
I am available for an interview at any time which might be convenient for you .
Yours Faithfully ,
Having gone through all those tough times ; trials and tribulations and I was alive !
Looking down at the watch on my wrist , I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall over the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament .
The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on as if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal !
Emphatically I reminded myself that I should n't have survived had it not been for God 's help !
The very thought of winning an accolade in front of a jubilant crowd disappeared all together and all I ever wanted was to be home , be safe , and be with my family .
I have got a family of my own , so I am familiar with looking after children and taking care of them . I enjoy fitness - and can easily help organise children sport activities .
I do enjoy communicating with children , I like to play games and learn something new from them !
In the evenings we would arrange different activities , like plays , singing , dancing .
I am also quiet experienced in the kitchen . I am really into healthy nutrition and healthy cooking .
It is important for children to get healthy meals , especially at the age of early teenage years .
She is a great woman hardworking , responsible , kind , friendly , intelligent and an amazing person .
Some people say zoos are traditional family entertainment and good for animals .
Due to the interest in protecting animals , people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) which is an international non - governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation , research and restoration of the environment .
Another positive aspect of zoos is that they help to protect endangered species by offering them a safe place to live .
In addition , zoos help to find mates for endangered species .
Consequently , they are mistreated , hit and live in an inadequate place where they can not behave freely .
Another drawback is that animals sometimes escape from their enclosures , which is dangerous for humans .
this may cause not only the animal death by being run over but also the passengers ' death if the driver tries to stop and lose the control of the car .
Personally , I think it is acceptable to keep animals in zoos , as long as they have enough space and are properly looked after .
We are made of flesh and it can be very difficult to resist the temptation .
They have computers , smartphones , cleaning robots , fast food ...
We have developed technology to make our lives easier .
Nevertheless , we can not allow that technology to put our children in danger .
On the one hand , I am going to sound like my grandfather telling his war tales .
Why do they need a smartphone ?
In summary , I know it is a hard choice . I am talking about multinational companies that try to change our way of life to suit their needs .
The art of writing letters along with painting colorful mandalas were taught by her grandmother .
Algebra and geometry were the most important subjects taught by her grandfather .
She loved watching printer at work producing numerous results of psychology tests , which she had just passed .
She devoted all her free time to experiments on linking the math homework with programming of the music equalizer .
She graduated Kiev International University in 2009 .
Kateryna was frustrated with classic film genre and started looking for possibilities for realization of experimental theoretical ideas on practice .
Dancing requires a lot of things , like cordination , flexibility , and physical condition , just to mention a few .
You do n't even notice how hard your body is working because you really are enjoying yourself , and I think that 's awesome because it just makes everything easier .
However , I would advise people who would like to start dancing to really take it serious , because even though I said it is fun , it really does require commitment and discipline .
Dancing is not as easy as everybody thinks , but it is definitely worth a try .
Recently I have listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people .
This got me thinking , how do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters ?
Adults can influence the behaviour of youngsters in different ways .
Secondly , adults can offer advice to the youngsters .
They have more life experience so they probably know what they are talking about .
Think of celebrities for example .
So when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters , they can influence behaviour in a positive way .
Especially when they have to live under a great lot of rules .
Also , advice is n't always taken positively .
And whether this is taken positively , is completely up to the adults and youngsters themselves .
Frozen shoulder or shoulder stiffness is an extremely limiting and debilitating disease .
The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder .
Although very important and critical , there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it .
1- Most of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint , but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation .
Usually after major operations , having a stroke or bone fracture .
So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness , movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time .
The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol .
Cortisone injections are also helpful , these injections can improve everything ; decrease swelling , stiffness and pain .
- Physiotherapy is not only about exercises , some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform an international organisation how our town takes care of the environment as well as what do people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive .
Nowadays young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity about the pollution cycle .
However , it is estimated that at least 70% of young kids do not take care of their personal rubbish and are the main contributors to a polluted environment .
Besides the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school , they are the most civilized and responsible .
A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education but because of their anxiety to show their kids that they are a great and responsible parents .
Every year we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman 's work every single day .
As far as I am concerned there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you take papers to the floor you will have to pay a fine .
Conclusion
However , everything starts at the level of education that every human being receives .
Unfortunately , there is still a long way to do in terms environment concerns , but some of this solutions suggested by the mayor help us stopping the pollution .
Environmental problems are becoming more and more serious all over the world .
" Air " is one of the necessities to maintain a human being 's life .
However air pollution affects not only people health but also the whole environmental system .
China is a big industrial country so there are a great number of factories and trucks .
Environmental problems that touch us all .
Not only the government should make laws to control the situation but also we should do our best not to create more pollution .
For Example , if you do n't smoke , you wo n't cause air pollution and you wo n't damage your health ; if you use public transportation , walk more or take bicycle as your transportation , you will not only help reduce the pollution bust also improve your health .
While there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention .
It 's also our responsibility to protect it and to do our best to prevent it from being polluted .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Finally , she saw the lights of the approaching car and ran toward the car .
Therefore , it would be incredible expensive to reunite all of them again for another film .
They are credible , especially Kevin Spacey , Charles Palminteri and Gabriel Byrne .
The photography is also good .
The soundtrack is not spectacular .
There is a scene , at the very end , where you can see a transformation .
I think that the best way to recommend this movie to anyone one is to quote from The Usual Suspects : " the best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he did n't exist . "
It would be a great pleasure for me to be part of Think Education , an innovative higher education institution that offers high - quality learning .
I have a MSc in Food Science and PhD in Biochemistry .
Overall , I have nine years of experience in biomedical research and several years of teaching experience .
At the University of Queensland I tutored several subjects , including Biochemistry for Nutrition students .
During my career I have gained extensive experience in academic writing .
My scientific work was published in seven scientific articles .
Moreover , in a position as a Medical Writer I wrote scientific documents for clients in the pharmaceutical industry .
Furthermore , I was a writer and editor for the project Food Info , a platform to inform the general public about food science related topics .
The advertised position is very appealing for me because I have always been fascinated about nutrition and natural therapies .
I would be very motivated to contribute to the development of excellent education material for the Faculty of Health and Wellness of Think Education .
The strengths that I could bring to this position are excellent written communication skills and a keen eye for detail .
I would appreciate the chance to talk with you to discuss the requirements and expectations of the position .
Thank you for your time and consideration and I am looking forward to hearing from you soon .
There is no future for public transportation , is in my opinion a wrong assumption .
The modern times have raised the concern about the environment , climate change and energy .
The public transportation can help fighting greenhouse gas emissions and can help us protect the world from Climate change effects .
In the recent years there has been a great change in consumption habits .
Now days , people can choose the most convenient way of travelling and there is no doubt that using a private car is easy , cheap and fun .
On the other hand , using a private car is totally ignoring the environmental damage and effects .
In developing countries , there is still a low level of awareness about the side effects of using private polluting cars .
But in modern countries , the environmental effects of one 's behavior is becoming important and concerning .
In my opinion it is just a matter of time until all the transportation options will be public and the private cars will be left behind .
People 's life will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
If we do so , we can see the massive difference in our lives from the people living 50 years back .
Although now we have very advanced technology which has made our lives completely different and comfortable than before , in the future it will be much better than this .
We will see things happening then which today seem to be impossible .
The other difference , hopefully , will be in medicine .
We will definitely have better drugs and also less incurable diseases .
However , it is possible that along new inventions and research there might be more harmful viruses also .
All these differences will make people 's lives tranquil .
There are some downsides of an advanced world too , for example , people will be more unhealthy due to the environmental conditions and also less self - reliant because of the technology progress .
It can not escape our minds that at this stage and age , children are exposed to sexual images from a very early age and some people would argue that our society is hyper sexualised , which is a reason why many parents see single sex schools as a means to protect their offspring from having sexual thoughts before they are ready to understand the complexity of sex and sexual relationships .
While the hyper sexualisation of our society may be a reality that many parents would want to protect their children from , it is true to say that children need to adapt and be ready for the society in which they live and for may parents , sending their children to a mixed sex school is just a natural environment , much more similar to the " outside world " in which they would grow to adulthood .
Considering how much time children spend at school , it appears to me that choosing a single sex school will make the child , somehow , segregated and in many cases , reinforce some of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender which , if we take into consideration that these children are going to be the future leaders , educators , lawyers , politicians and so on , I would argue that the more schools reflect our society and the way that we like it to be , the better , not only for the child as a person , but the child as a key in the future of the country and , as an extent , to the world .
Therefore and to sum up , Is my view , that public money is better spent supporting mix sex schools , which reflects the society we live in , as opposed to single sex ' which may reinforce those stereotypes that are mining society .
I absolutely agree with this statement . Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport , it also grants one 's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish .
The car industry could also be considered one of the main driving engines of the Western economy .
Thousands would lose their jobs , both directly in the car factories and indirectly in many other car - related businesses , like car part stores , petrol stations , garages , and so on .
If private transport was fully replaced by public transport , the world 's economic foundations would shake and a global financial crisis of unprecedented impact could occur .
It is true that cars pollute the atmosphere , but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say that even more than private transport , as Diesel motors are particularly dirtier and more inefficient than smaller , petrol driven motors like those of private cars .
All things considered we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear in the short term and in no time everyone will be driving their own clean - energy - driven flying cars to go everywhere .
I am writing to you to apply for a position advertised recently .
Currently I am working as a teacher of English in my city of Dnipropetrovsk .
I am keen on communicating with different groups of children ( mostly aged 9 - 17 ) .
During my career I have organized a lot of fascinating activities to keep my students enthusiastic about learning more .
First of all , I have considerable experience in working with teenagers ( for more than 5 years ) which I find really enjoyable .
And finally , I am kind of person who is responsible , well - organised and optimistic .
It is a great opportunity for me to practise my skills and socialize with children from a foreign country .
Yours faithfully ,
Recently , genetic engineering has become a highly controversial issue around the world .
Many people think that genetic engineering has many drawbacks .
However , others claim that it is vital for societies and next generations .
Genetic engineering is the process of manipulating the genes of an organism .
According to supporters of it , there are many benefits of genetic engineering .
Besides , some genetically modified crops grow more quickly .
Supporters also claim that , it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine .
With genetic engineering , human health has become better in many ways .
For instance , it may be used by scientists to cure some diseases .
In spite of the benefits , there are also certain drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
There are many ethical concerns about human genetic engineering .
It is still unacceptable in most cultures because of their religious beliefs .
Another problem is the genetically modified food products .
Although they look bigger or more attractive , genetically modified food products are unhealthy for people .
In conclusion , it seems the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of human genetic engineering .
Therefore , genetic engineering is important for humanity and the future .
Not only did they share a clear interest in writing about social issues that struck the contemporary life in Britain , but they also had similar ways of structuring their novels .
For example , in Dickens ' " David Copperfield " and Charlotte Brönte 's " Jane Eyre " , the story is told by their respective protagonists who remember their own past experiences .
In both novels the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses ( " David Copperfield " ) and Boarding Schools ( " Jane Eyre " ) .
In the Brönte sisters ' works , we can find some Gothic elements - especially in Emily 's only novel " Wuthering Heights"- and a detachment from the figure of the Victorian dutiful woman .
Michael , my never - ending love story , was walking down the street one night with no particular thoughts in his mind .
The reason ? I told him I found a job in another city and I was considering moving house .
No one could have anticipated what happened next .
I must have seem cruel to him because , despite our daily disagreements , he adored me and was serious about settling down soon .
It was , of course , a ones in a lifetime opportunity , one I grabbed with both hands .
I was responsible for fulfilling all the needs of these famous guests .
The things some of them wanted , unbelievable!Luckily , I had some other students helping me find all the curious things for the famous .
It was , after all , an amazing experience .
Not to say that now I have some good connections in the world of the rich and famous !
Due to the ever - increasing population coupled with the climate change , food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries .
Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield .
It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes , such as pest disease resistance gene .
This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment .
This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safety .
Furthermore , GM food can also improve the production of crops .
Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought .
This could be important for food production , especially in developing countries .
However , some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health .
Actually , thousands of tests on GM food , before bring it into markets , have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals .
In views of this , it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage .
However , because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed , it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food .
An elderly university professor had to give his students the last lesson of his professional life , because he was going to retire .
As soon as the professor entered the classroom , he was surprised to see that it was completely full .
There was very little light in the classroom because it had been a rainy afternoon and a terrible thunderstorm had caused an electrical blackout .
The student did n't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion : he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody .
The purpose of the survey was to discover popular leisure time activities of male and female students .
The survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire given to the male and female students to complete .
The first part of the questionnaire dealt with leisure time activities on holidays .
The second section was concerned with time - out activities .
From the table of data , the most significant items are as follows .
It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays , while 90% of the female students would like to go to the seaside .
The male students would gladly go to historical places , while 57% of the girls who filled in the questionnaire were n't inclined to spend their free time in that way .
In the second section both the girls and the boys interrogated claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera .
The majority of the male and female respondents enjoy going to nightclubs in their spare time .
For example , only 10% percent of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least one time a week .
Unlike the boys the female respondents usually do n't feel like going in for sport at leisure .
In contrast to the male respondents the girls interrogated go to evening classes in their free time .
Like the male respondents the girls interrogated go regularly to the cinema .
For instance , 47% of the female respondents watch films on a big screen every week .
In the third part of the questionnaire was found out that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home more than 2 hours a day .
In contrast to the girls interrogated who almost never play computer games the majority of the male students gamble for hours at leisure .
The female respondents are more fond of reading books that the male ones .
The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours by surfing the Internet .
If any conclusions may be drawn from the data , they are as follows .
The leisure activities of the male and female students have a lot in common .
According to the findings , it is clear that nowadays going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places .
There are therefore a clear need for young people to prefer active and educating leisure time activities to passive ones .
First of all , we would like to thank you for letting us know about your concerns and giving us the opportunity to explain ourselves .
Please accept our dearest apologies ; it was the least of our intentions to offend you with our release letter , which is a standard format authorized by our legal department .
We already passed your comments about the format on to our chief lawyer and hope he can approve the necessary adjustments .
Of course you can share your opinions and experiences about your stay wherever and with whoever you wish .
In addition , we are sorry that your holiday experience was affected by the fire occurred on Saturday October 10th , 2015 .
It was not an easy task to find a new accommodation and relocate over a thousand people .
We do know that the incident might have caused some inconveniences , but the most important thing is that none of our guests or staff was injured .
We hope that our explanations and apologies will make you change your mind and that you give us another chance in the future to provide you with a much more delightful experience .
Given the circumstances we would like to offer one of the following compensations if you decide to travel with us again in the future :
In my opinion many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work , university or school .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train , on your journey you can read or just look through the windows .
You can also enjoy the company of those travellers sharing the same transport .
However , I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedomn , you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way .
Furthermore , you can choose what time you would like to travel and where .
As long as people keep accepting this technology for communication , social media sites will also keep proceeding to the next step and affecting the society .
In terms of the communication society , they will possibly change the way in which people develop relationship with each other , and consequently , they will create two types of culture : communal and agentic .
In the former , people have ability almost equally , and value interpersonal relationship .
In contrast , agentic culture stresses the differences between individuals , along with egotism and inequality ( Zarbatany , Conley , & Pepper as cited in Okazaki , & Taylor , 2013 ) .
These types of culture will oppositely exist in the future as an effect of social media sites .
There is nothing worse than not be able to communicate with people when you 're in a foreign country .
It might be such a frustrating sensation that you could n't want to go back again .
Besides , you 'll understand the native people when you 're going on holiday .
And furthermore , it 'll be reassuring to get by with your basic necessities in another country .
To wrap up the article I 'd strongly recommend that young people to learn at least a new foreign language especially if you 're a student .
Nowadays , famous people like movie stars , politicians , models and other celebrities suffer from lack of privacy .
Paparazzi and journalists are following them everywhere they go .
They are also the reason for many problems , which appear in private lives of some celebrities .
It is known , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact , that they are recognised everywhere , but an interest in one 's private life , when the person does n't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing .
On the other hand , it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives , but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life .
Everything that goes on in the famous person 's life , including births , deaths , illness and divorces is fodder for the tabloids .
If the individual stumbles , whether figuratively or literally , speculation about him will end up on TV , on the Internet or the front page of the tabloids .
But in spite of this , sometimes journalists can be too insistent , trying to get at as much information as possible .
Generally , celebrities deserve to have a private life .
As it seems to me , private information about stars should be published if they approve of it putting the signature .
It would be fairly by celebrities .
I 'm glad to hear that you 've decided to take part in an organisation of this month 's concert .
I 'm writing to tell you about my experience I gained during preparations for the last concert .
You know , I have graduated culinary school and it was a great opportunity to use my skills . I 've made a lot of new friends .
I know it could be a problem for you since you ca n't cook , but organisers need volunteers in many fields : scenography , sounding , VIP - escort .
So my recommendation to you would be to do something similar if you are looking for good experiences and plenty of laughs !
The Internet has many good points : it 's an infinite source of information and it 's a cheaper and faster way to communicate with other people .
However , Facebook , as well as many other social networking sites , has its dark side too .
On the one hand , it 's addictive . Internet addiction represents a serious problem in our age .
It may lead to inefficiency at school - or workplace - or even sleeping disorders .
Stalkers , pedophiles , human traffickers , murderers and other criminals ; these are just a small part of the threats you can come across on Facebook .
In conclusion , I think that we ca n't be safe anywhere anymore - not even online .
It influenced the further development of post - Soviet countries as well geopolitical situation in the whole world .
It has also influenced the international relations not just within post - Soviet area , but also in the entire world , as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked as crash of bipolar structure of international relations .
So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War , fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union , the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass - media but also in the American society .
American press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc .
The"New York Times " made a series of publications dedicated to the coup .
On the August 20 , " New York Times " published the article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .
The American press summing up the era of Gorbachov frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of the Soviet society .
Those attempts were considered as one of Gorbachov 's main merits . "
The plotters have immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin .
Decisive actions of Yeltsin have been supported by most world governments and international communities .
Boris Yeltsin has gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup 's leaders .
The coup , due to lack of organization and support by the military forces , failed three days after .
Leading articles of the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president .
American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status for his defiant stand , also mentioning that the people had knew a little about him .
The article of the New York Post " THE SOVIET CRISIS ; Yeltsin 's Remarks : A ' Reactionary Coup " refers to the night of 18 - 19 August 1991 when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power .
The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which have acquired broad and irreversible character .
Also it shows the disposition of the soviet people towards the changes in the country . "
The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited , and this includes party organs . "
This coup had a big resonance among the American society ; consequently the US mass - media were eager to know the feelings of the US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union .
The US citizen deemed the crisis as a menace for the liberalisation of society ; they assumed it as an actual barrier for the expression of people 's will . "
The press accentuated that many of Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War were harshly reminding that this is still the nuclear age .
The dissolution of the Communist party has also become one of most popular issues among American mass - media .
Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics . "
The Communist Party , which has had control for 74 years , is rapidly dissolving - the Chicago Tribune wrote .
The US mass - media followed the reaction on the crisis inside Communist party closely One of the articles of the Washington post " Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe 's Communists " tells that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev 's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe .
The dissolution of the Communist party was concerned as the one of the features of the Soviet Union collapse .
In the Washington Post the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup has finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people .
As a result , the Soviet Union has been disintegrated along traditional ethnic lines .
The upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of the new states and following referendums on their independence .
The leaders of Russia , Ukraine and Belarus formally announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec 8 , 1991 and agreed to establish a " Commonwealth of Independent States " instead .
On the 25th of December 1991 Gorbachov has officially resigned .
The Washington Post has written down : " a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991 .
Soviet President Gorbachev agreed to the dissolution of all Soviet agencies " .
Soviet époque , which had existed for 74 years , came to its end and this paved the way for establishment of new independent republics .
" What young people are interested in ? "
INTRODUCTION
As requested I interviewed a large number of young people , trying to understand their main interests , especially as regards music , TV programmes and clothes .
Many people aged between fourteen and eighteen said that the most listened music among teenagers is definitely rock music .
Only a few youngsters listen to classical music and love the Opera .
TV PROGRAMMES
The people I interviewed are very keen on reality shows like " Big Brother " and similar but I have to say that many of them are also interested in cooking shows and documentaries .
Only a few of them like to wear fashionable clothes .
CONCLUSION
Some of them are pretty similar to those we had in the past ; others are completely different and very interesting to explore .
A world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable idea ?
What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be ?
Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world , according to Ethnologue .
Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or negotiating within the business market .
Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would , without doubt , have many benefits .
Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone .
However , the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible .
While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics , physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful .
Such a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third - world countries to start companies , trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty .
Moreover , the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere .
In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities .
After all , a couple of professions might become extinct , for example translators , but , therefore , the organisation and execution of this big project would provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost .
The educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership .
However , this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses .
On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible , for instance the aboriginal people .
Anyway , , those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary .
On the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere .
Nevertheless , English was just a suggestion and other languages like Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as well .
Nowadays , more and more people are learning how to drive , as driving one 's own car is , as everyone knows , much more convenient than taking public transport .
Without doubt , having our own car provides us with great convenience .
But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair , and , of course , buying petroleum .
Under this circumstance , some people may rather take public transport to save money for their " dream house " rather than buying a car .
Hong Kong is also famous for its heavy traffic , which implies the problem of traffic congestion .
Besides saving time , taking public transport can also help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases .
Greenhouse gases have already posed grave threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , which raised people 's environmental awareness .
People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of environmental protection and want to contribute to saving our Earth .
Hence , contrary to many people perceive , there should be an increasing demand , i.e. a rosy future , for public transport .
From the reasons mentioned above , it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line .
Technological advancement is , after all , always something that drops us a bombshell , so rapid that we can never predict how far it can go .
There 's not much work you have to do on a normal day , but maybe this will be a special one , because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away .
First , you need to know how to open the establishment .
They have similar skills and productivity , but , honestly , I prefer working with the morning one . I do n't think you 'll have any problem with both groups .
If there is any problem with the cash registrer ( very common , actually ) , you have a phone number under it of a good technician .
Change frequently creates a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in us .
However , it is one of the most motivating challenge in our lives .
They are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences .
For example , a close relationship or a serious illness make us look at the world around us through different eyes , and also they let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings .
Even so , change can be perceived as a disturbing question due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty .
Often , dealing with new situations does not help us to feel comfortable .
Furthermore , we sometimes feel scared to face new experience and then we can lose a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves .
In short , I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality to become better people in any aspect of our lives because it represents a major challenge .
Nowadays , there 's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and saving mathematical equations .
Classes are being held much more interactive than in the previous years , and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life .
First of all , it is essential for young people to learn how to take care of themselves , such as knowing how to cook .
In order to prevent the younger generation of our society of consuming it , we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes .
Not only is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to create healthy meals , but also does it strengthen relationships among classmates , as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes .
Moreover , it is a welcome distraction from the theoretical school routine .
Passing this attitude on to their children , they wo n't be able to save money for emergencies and deal with it reasonably , which is a necessity in order to survive .
To conclude , there are a lot of things worth considering to teach in school .
Both of them are skills which help managing your life later on , finances in particular .
To fly in different continents is nowadays easy but still expensive .
Therefore , Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind : travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible .
He was following an important European summint on environmental issues .
Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives .
He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices .
Access to sevreal public transport services ( such as underground , buses , tram , etc . )
He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels ' suburb .
A few weeks later , Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle - East .
He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome .
Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought .
He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy .
Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars .
Towns are congested by traffic jam , especially during rush hours .
Such experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people 's life and their surrouding .
In particular , an efficient public transport impacts on :
Communications - it eases movements from place to place
Environment - it reduces cars on the roads , therefore air is less polluted
- access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car ; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community , in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel !
Therefore , it all comes down in this writing to expressing feelings about Seville and its surrounding .
In fact , the more I know about its organization and its people , the more I feel at ease in Seville .
In my opinion , Seville was rather disorganized and not very charming and its citizens rather rude .
Consequently , what are the reasons of my change of heart ?
The more I understand it the more I like it .
There are even some smiles and laughs , which is very reassuring for someone who is alone abroad .
For instance , I spent some time last night eating tapas on a small street in a laid - back atmosphere .
I was surrounded by joyful Spaniards who were speaking loudly .
To make matters even better , there was some music played a few meters ahead , which contributed to liven up the spirit of everyone present there .
In addition to this , I really like sharing tapas dishes with people , drinking a good fresh " draft beer " and going for a " tapas crawl " with friends as in Switzerland each one gets its own dish when eating out and only go for a " pub crawl " .
I am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost on the winding narrow cobbled streets as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures .
On account of all this , it is easy to understand why my perception of Seville has significantly changed over time .
As far as I 'm concerned , the city is no longer a museum displaying sumptuous and ostentatious monuments .
WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE !
This year , in Italy , for the first time in more than 200 years , it happened a weird coincidence : the political leader Silvio Berlusconi and the singer Ligabue marked their careers on the same day .
On the one hand , Berlusconi compromised his position when some journalists told the world some wiretappings of his which would compromise his future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue won the award for the best song of the year , bringing his career ever forward .
Unbelievable as it may seem , this is really a bizarre coincidence .
If I had also a year free , I would only prefer travelling not working .
Switzerland is really a great place for travelling . You should plan two different periods to visit sightseeing places , one in summer and the other one in winter .
Famous sightseeing places are really different during winter and summer .
If you decide to ground in Geneva , I suggest you to visit first the north of Switzerland from the west to the east and then the south of Switzerland from the east to the west .
Switzerland is a small country also take your time and spend enough time in each place .
Concerning your inquiry on working in my country , it 's really difficult to get an authorisation to work , especially for periods longer than a week .
Therefore , I suggest you to work during your travelling time .
For instance if you plan to stay more than one week in Zermat in Wallis , think to try to find a place where you could help in a restaurant or a shop .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
There was no anger in her voice , but amusement and something else that Peter could not distinguish .
The silence that followed her words was oppressive .
Travelling by car gives you independence .
Those are great advantages everyone can see .
It could seem to point towards public transport , nevertheless it will push car travelling even further .
There will be no more greenhouse gasses , you can forget about escalating gas prices and , finally , you will not remember air pollution .
Computers and smartphones are becoming more prominent in our lives .
We need to embrace the advances of technology and we will be free of those terrible experiences .
I enjoy watching soap operas on TV and the best one for me is EastEnders .
This TV serial is mainly based on working class people and represents various ethnic minority communities including African and Asian Muslims .
This show is particularly good as it represents how people from different ethnic backgrounds can engage with each other .
It shows that ethnic minority people can integrate with the majority Caucasian people without losing their cultural and traditional values .
In addition , it provides an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to peep into the culture and traditions of British people .
Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters , it also shows the importance of family values . I would definitely recommend this drama serial to other people .
It is important to gain awareness about different societies due to the fact that Britain is becoming such a multicultural society .
However , what is the best means of transportation to see the world for yourself ?
First , to travel by boat is a very relaxing and carefree experience , compared to being confined to a very narrow and limited little space on the seat of a plane .
Second , people on the boats are granted the opportunity to see beautiful ocean lives , while taking a plane does n't provide this luxury to take a look at the birds in the sky for planes are travelling at such a high speed .
Third , when it comes to travel , what really matters is not your destination .
From my perspective , it is the process that is more valuable .
Therefore , I would choose to lengthen the process of travelling , and a comfortable voyage on the sea would certainly become my first choice , since it guarantees a long and pleasant travelling experience .
I work in Café Noir , a well - known restaurant , popular with visitors in the centre of town .
Firstly , I do not understand why this is being implemented so quickly and why there has been no discussion - there is no time for anyone to feel comfortable with the idea .
Secondly , it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars and restaurants - such an idea is completely unworkable .
To support my argument against this proposal I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town .
It was unsuccessful , and the politicians had to reverse their decision .
A non - smoking policy was introduced by some restaurants ; the consequences were terrible : a large number of their customers vanished .
In my opinion , introducing specific non - smoking areas in this type of establishments could be an excellent idea .
I can speak English and of course German - and because my grandparents are from Korea , a little Korean , too .
I am the only grandchild that ca n't speak Korean properly because I grew up in Bavaria and not in NRW , but they taught me to cook .
The good thing is : the rest of the time living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets .
My other big hobby is travelling .
I am writing in response to your advertisement in a magazine .
I am a 23-year - old student in a Sports Science degree , so I am interested in sports .
I have experience in children Summer camps and recently I attended a First Aid course , so I could deal with a difficult situation .
I am a native speaker of Spanish and I have passed the First Certificate exam of Cambridge , so my English level is quite good .
Furthermore , I speak a little French .
I have no problem in being hired for three months because I do not go to the university in Summer .
You will find attached two references written by the two directors of the camps where I have worked .
You could ask them about me and they would answer you immediately .
Yours faithfully ,
It involves many moral virtues , which makes football one of the best activities for teenagers .
This kind of action , when peformed collectively , requires coordenation of efforts and abitity to work together , two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world .
In times of escalators and cars , it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement , velocity and strenght .
Finally , football involves relationships in moments of tension , and this is the natural context for virtues like justice , courage and honesty .
In fact , it can be argued that the human virtues are a by - product of conflicts and fights ; that they are that traces of character that we aknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition , be it for a trophy or for a country .
In a club you will find professional advice and also as many peopole as it is necessary for a match .
I have read your call for marketing professionals on your corporate website .
Having graduated from UCLMD in 2016 as an IT - based marketing communication professional , with a focus on Business English , I could be a great asset to your company .
During my studies I doubled the conversion rate of a London based hotel 's website , and improved the effectiveness of their e - mail campaign by 150% .
I did so by clearly outlining principles , which proved to work with their target audience and can keep using as a guide .
I have been volunteering in various similar projects .
You can find a list of these , with my achievements in my CV .
I have been following your marketing activities , and I have a number of new , creative ways on my agenda , I could improve your brand image as part of your team .
I have a strong belief that being multilingual is essential for working in the financial industry and Mandarin is an important language for working in Asia - Pacific countries .
To further improve my Chinese , I enrolled for the Post - Intermediate Mandarin class during my undergraduate study , in which I achieved a First - Class result .
Beyond my academic disciplines , I have consistently taken up some active roles at university and outside school to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills .
I was trained as a PASS ( Peer Assisted Study Session ) leader for econometrics to provide some academic support to some younger students at my final year of study at Manchester .
I attended trainings and workshops to learn about the skills to be a good facilitator before the start of the academic year .
The regular meetings with my group of students to discuss their questions on econometrics have developed my empathy which is a crucial skill of being a leader .
Besides , I have undertaken an internship at the HSBC Risk in order to gain an insight into the banking industry and learn how to work with my peers in a business environment .
I have gained a better understanding of the role credit risk plays in the full picture of banking operations .
To me , a vacation is a specific trip or journey for recreation or tourism .
At night , I expected to have a romantic French dinner at a posh restaurant .
But no , instead of sitting in a restaurant , my mum took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner .
In the next following days , we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals .
As the day goes on , I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea , go snorkeling or just lie on the beach .
And I would always have my meals at some luxurious restaurants .
There are always the differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation .
When I finished the high school , I started working as accountant in my father 's carpentry .
It took me 12 years to get the courage to quit because it was my family company and I felt really sorry , but I had to grow up and improve my professional skills , so I began to look for a new job .
My father was happy because it was a great opportunity and understood that it was what I 've been dreaming for a long time .
Five years have passed and I 'm still working for this company which has given me a lot and I 've been learning many things about accounting .
In fact I am administrative manager and I feel really proud of myself .
I would love to be the person to organise and do all kinds of activities .
My name is Aly Meeuws , I am 16 years old , I live in The Netherlands at the moment and I am really planning on going to the USA in the future , so this would difinitely be a great experience for me especially for my English and being away from home .
Until next summer I will still be in school but hopefully I will graduate so I can go to college afterwards .
Often after school I babysit my parents friends ' children and I usually really like it ! I am also a very athletic person so I would not mind entertaining the children for a longer period of time and also doing some physical exercises .
Once I cooked a Christmas dinner for me and my whole family and surprisingly everyone enjoyed it which definitely came as a surprised to me !
There has never been a bigger force for change than technology , it changes absolutely everything about the way we live , even the way we talk with each other .
Despite the rise of social media , the idea of community has changed radically , because people are sharing interests everywhere on the planet .
Social Media such as Twitter , Facebook , Youtube and blogs illustrate surely that the definition or repercussion of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are worn and the social relations and associations that expand around them .
This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life , emphasizing the problems which arose with the use of Facebook and Twitter .
Finally it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technoogy .
Social networks websites can be explained as a web usefulness that admit people to create a public or semi - public profile , arrange a list of other contacts which is possible to share connection and look and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system .
Namen and Kinnison ( 2012 ) indicates that " the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include ( 1 ) creaction of an online identity , ( 2 ) establishment of relationships between users , and ( 3 ) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes " .
One of the most popular social networking websites is Facebook .
Another rapidly expanding social networking is Twitter .
These kinds of websites allows people to interact with others precisely by smartphones or computers .
By Twitter , users post opinions or comments narrow to 140 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebook people can share pictures , vídeos and thoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 2012 ) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not especially for socialising but also for academic purposes , like to obtain benefit for their studies or to recover time in discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .
Furthermore , some departments of police in the USA used Facebook to share a vídeo of a felony with the expectancy to identify the suspects and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in return to the publication .
Additionally , a politician from Philadelphia , USA was elected after take advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign .
My most memorable learning experience to date was my marriage .
My ex - husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment .
We discussed about some sexist ideas that I do n't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him , but I was fine with that because That can happen , but due to my profession he could n't be like that for so long because I was in a man 's shoes .
He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point , he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it .
I also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man 's mind , and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not , he is going to help and be an honor man or not , he is going to be a good and caring father or not , he is going to be a responsible human being or not .
A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs .
Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes .
Once upon a time there was a majestuous kingdom in England , surrounded by beautiful rivers , waterfalls and mountains .
Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously until one day , at the welcoming ball in honour of the little princess , a horrendous witch showed up and cursed the little princess named Sophie , who would die at the age of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save her .
As only a gentleman would do , he apologised and introduced himself to the Princess :
Sophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that through the time became in more than just a friendship , they fall in love for each other .
Princess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael , until one day , when she was just about to meet Michael to confess him all the truth about who she really was , a guards discovered her and the King commanded to lock her up in her room .
Michael was disappointed because he thought that Princes Sophie did n't love him anymore .
I believe that saying that there is no future for public transport given that travelling by car is so much more convenient , is premature . We need to consider a lot of factors before we can make a judgement of this kind .
Several announcements over radio and TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save nature .
There are family problems , football madness , romantic obsessions and mental illnesses .
The plot is about a young man ( Bradley Cooper ) who has just been discharged from a psychiatric hospital and has moved to his parents home .
He was accused of mistreating his wife and that is the reason why they had been separated for the last eight months .
She has a turbulent and complicated past .
They meet by chance and started a tortuous relationship as friends .
Interestingly , they find the way to help each other and not surprisingly finally they fall in love .
I personally think that the film transmit an interesting view of the psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problems .
Introduction
It gives information about their tastes in music , TV programmes and clothes .
So , naturally , about half of the teenagers and young adults prefer rock and roll , hard rock and progressive rock to other genres .
They enjoy both local bands ' production and some foreign songs .
About one third of the rest would claim they listen mainly to pop folk , whereas the rest would be interested in R&B , soul and jazz .
Television
Although not many young people like spending their free time watching TV , I believe that some patterns of preference can still be recognized .
Conclusion
This information can help the organizers of next year 's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes .
The house is already equipped with everything you might need and furniture so all you need to do is pack up your things and move !
I would like to express my total dissatisfaction with your latest measures .
Furthermore you will increase the course fee by 15% from next month .
In the future , you do not provide the Japanese course at convenient time .
I would appreciate it if you took these possibilities into consideration .
Yours faithfully
The movie is set in the United States around the 1990 's , so we could say the film is technically modern , though I 'm sure that in some years it will be considered a classic .
So she decides to take him to a child psychologist .
The boy soon becomes friends with the psychologist , and he started noticing plenty of things about this exceptional boy .
I 'm not normally keen on thrillers , but this is definitely a must watch .
The boy 's acting is really something , such a thing that his acting earned him a nomination for the Academy Awards .
We regulary organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film .
Many students gain a great deal from our activities .
For example , with every film seen our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions , particularly as we always have discussions aroud a subject related to the film .
Also our monthly speakers are exellent , for example , last year we invited a well - known actrice , Janet Hewitt , to share some of her experience on Broadway .
Unfortunalety , organising this kind of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough .
The fact that everyone from the community cand participate at our events is helping us to develop a positive relation between the college and the community .
What 's more , shopping is almost always unenjoyable .
Especially , when it comes to go shopping .
Afterwards the crowd of people is ramming me , when I 'm trying to walk .
My eyes instantaneously start to hurt .
I hate them wholeheartedly .
1 . The author compares Easter to a pagan spring festival , because they are associated with happiness .
The way Easter and specifically Good Friday is celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content .
People do n't want to to contemplate Christ 's suffering , but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of Easter celebration , so to Easter Sunday .
According to the author , people " flinch from consideration of Good Friday " due to three taboos connected with this day : self - sacrifice , suffering and death .
The way self - sacrifice is seen has changed enormously - we no longer want to sacrifice ourselves , because it 's unpopular and it is in contradiction with the idea of consumerism .
What is more , we are becoming indifferent to other people 's suffering and that 's why we are n't willing to think about it , even on Good Friday .
Suffering as well as death is pushed away from our real life - we do n't want to experience them but rather watch it on different kinds of TV shows .
In a consumptive lifestyle we want more and more for ourselves , but not for other people , because it will require self - sacrifice .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
It was a hot summer day , everyone was walking to their usual destination ; work , school , buy some groceries , pick up the laundry or their clothes at the cleanners , everyone except Peter .
Peter smiled for a brief moment as he remembered his obsession with Einstein 's Theory of General Relativity , he thought " finally I understand it " .
Nowadays , it is hard for many young people to do physical exercise frequently .
It is a well - known fact that sometimes they prefer watching TV on the sofa or playing computer games comfortably to doing physical activities .
There can be no doubt that technology should be a tool to motivate young people .
It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day , but while they are doing this they are sitting in a comfortable sofa .
It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports like football or basketball .
To sum up , it is important motivating the young people to do physical exercise .
School programmes and technology could be effective methods to achieve this goal .
It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because in this way , they do their favourite sport in a routine way .
Back in the time , when I successfully passed the third grade , my parents decided to let me pick the present that I want as a reward .
I realized that this is what I am looking for , a new additional excitement to add to skating .
I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates , but this time it is aggressive skates .
When I started aggressive skating , I had to learn how to balance my weight using heavy two - wheel inline skates .
Once on a weekend , it was my last year in middle school , I was at the park practicing as usual .
I introduced myself , and as I thought , they were vising from a different city .
The more we get deep into the conversation , the more I want to learn this type of skating .
They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm . I was surprised , I had mixed feeling , and it was indescribable .
In a short time , I became so good , and some of my friends changed from aggressive to slalom skating just by seeing me practicing .
After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks , to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing , and to try to reach the perfection , I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport .
When I stopped looking for enthusiasm , fun , and excitement and started trying to fulfill my heart , brain , and body 's desires by skating , I knew for sure skating is not just a sport or a hobby .
About one year ago , I moved to Philadelphia , United States .
Unlike weather in my country , Philadelphia is always rainy , wet , and sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle , it was impossible to skate in this condition .
A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot , and for me , everything worth trying just to be able to skate again .
Singapore could be the place that you would find everything you are looking for .
If you are looking for any luxury brands and extravaganza shopping experience , this is the right place .
Vivo city in Harbourfront and shopping street on Orchard road are good she you want to buy anything from mid - range to the high - end goods .
Both places are extremely crowded with people on the weekend , unless you enjoy people watching , early bird shopping is highly recommended .
A variety of selections from different brands are available .
Icebreakers
Even if you meet him for the first time , his smile can make you feel comfortable . " My friend replied , " Yes , I may feel comfortable around him .
Advertising is a form of communication that is used to influence and persuade consumers to buy products , services , ideas .
Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation consumer 's behavior in a commercial aspect .
But at the same time advertising has many features in common with art .
Firstly , art is the expression of human creative skills and imagination , typically in a visual form .
And advertising is a combination of sounds , images and words .
To be successful advertising often uses images from popular movies , catchy melodies , unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings .
Often people , who are watching a commercial , do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before .
Therefore , advertising successfully combines other types of art to influence the subconscious and human behavior .
Secondly , art as well as advertising is such a large part of our everyday lives .
Art is something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing to people 's eyes .
Hoardings and billboards , which are a part of the urban landscape , are art .
Visual advertising like painting uses color , value , space and line .
Also it uses balance , contrast , emphasis and proportion .
There are principles of design .
Lastly , advertising like art originated a long time ago .
Commercial advertising can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece .
There were posters for entertainment , small ads for businesses , merchants used town criers , paying for events .
With the development of mass media , television and Internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication .
Now advertising is a big part of modern culture .
Advertising has similarities with the art and often combines other types of art to be more successful .
Advertising is creative combinations of sounds , images and words .
Modern technologies , the development of mass media are allowed advertising to become the greatest art from the 20th century .
Michael got out of bed on the wrong side that day or , at least , that 's what he thought when , on his way to work , he was so concentrated looking down at his mobile phone that he did n't see a woman approaching him and they both collided .
She was around fifty years old and rather unattractive although smartly dressed .
Michael then remembered how he had overslept that morning , how he did n't have time to have breakfast , how he did n't have any clean shirt ready and had to wear the new one that he was keeping for a special occasion and he blamed that woman for it all .
The new human resources manager had arrived and wanted to meet every worker in the company personally .
In this article a teacher refltcts on his experiences of creating plays and using them to help motivate students to develop their English .
It consists of eight part : Introduction ; How to start ; Writing the play ; I want to be Cinderella ; Practise ; The big night ; Reason for doing a play and A few final thoughts .
The first thing you need to start with is a deadline to get everything done by .
Writing the play : first , you may ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters ; second , learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story .
They you should take a decision of choosing roles : start by asking for volunteers ; and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do .
It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate different their skills at the language classroom .
In a world of increasing environmental awareness improved public transport represents the way of the future .
Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles , in my opinion they may choose public transport if it fulfils certain conditions .
These conditions fall into three broad categories : attitudinal , financial and logistical .
From an attitudinal perspective , people must first be convinced of the benefits of public transportation .
An educational or public relations campaign must be launched to sensitize those who might have disregarded this possibility before .
People should be familiarized with the environmental , social and personal benefits for present and future generations .
From a financial perspective , public transportation must be a clear and viable benefit to consumers .
In other words , it must be more affordable than driving to work every day .
For example , if people know that by using bus and subway , they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year , many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way .
From a logistical perspective , public transportation should be convenient for commuters .
City planners and transport officials must ensure that frequent and reliable public transportation is available for each citizen .
For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway , they must know that they will be able to get to various places on time .
Transport vehicles must be well maintained , subway and bus drivers should be customer - oriented and service must be punctual and efficient .
This is an additional important step .
In conclusion , through a multi - pronged approach , it is possible to increase the use of public transportation .
City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilizing these forms of transport themselves and bringing about change through personal example .
Then , more citizens will follow suit and we may all hope to live in a cleaner , less polluted environment .

Yours faithfully ,
You can ride at your own pace and go increasingly far .
It makes you see the road and your environment differently .
Furthermore , it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of a car because cycling does n't produce any pollution .
When you start riding a bicycle , you first need to check if your bike follows the security instructions .
For instance , you need good brakes , lights , a bell and reflective stripes on your wheels or reflectors .
Indeed , some places still need to improve the structures for bikes : sometimes they do n't have a lot of bicycle paths .
But if you learn how to obtrude in the circulation while remaining polite with the others , there is no reason to be afraid .
Unfortunately , I did n't have time to answer .
You wrote that you are interested to know something about the concert I helped organize .
It was a great experience .
during the concert I was responsible for checking tickets .
It was fantastic to take a part in that enterprise .
I met those boys next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the test initiation .
I felt extremely nervous , I was about to commit a crime and my heart was beating uncontrollably , really fast .
" Dear me ! How can you be so cheeky ? " he uttered dismissively taping his feet .
And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of events .
I think that horse races are a fun entertainment if you like one of these three things : animals , betting and fashion .
And if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot , you may run into the Queen and greet her , and at the same time enjoy the fabulous view of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear .
But you can also have a " horrible " day at the races : if you 're not savvy enough to know the differences between the bets , you can end up skint , penniless .
Anyway , if you knew beforehand your odds of winning it would n't be so thrilling .
thanks for the letter which has just arrived . I 've read that you 're writing a term paper on the chances of developing counties to profit from the electronic revolution , are you ?
I think I 've some useful information for you .
The text was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries .
I hope I could help you with this information .
Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .
However , there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium .
First of all , the mobile phone is a great way to " stay connected " all the time . Chatting with your friends , staying informed of the latest news , ordering online , etc - you can do all these things simultaneously , wherever and whenever you want .
This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they do not longer need to be present in an office to get a job done .
Furthermore mobile phones allow last - minute - changes very easily .
No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance , as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way .
Last but not least , the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently .
Finally , the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life .
However , I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsably , according to one 's personal needs .
I recently saw a film called Passengers .
It 's about 2000 people that want to go to a new planet to start a new life and their trip was going to take approximately 120 years .
Before the trip started , the company who decided to make this trip said that everything was perfectly calculated so that it was imposible to have any kind of problem with the spacecraft .
She discovered that she did n't have any problem with the cabin , it was Mark who hacked it .
It was such a hot summer that it was impossible to turn off the ventilator and I was a bored child with a laptop . I had signed in on the social network Tuenti and I liked passing all the time chatting .
I knew it was the beginning of a great friendship .
Louis was convinced that this new project will be an incredible opportunity for him to try new things and study different fields , which he enjoyed , he loved to read about science , inventions , and stay up to date with the news .
But he immediately thought - why not continue doing what I love while I do something new?-
He send an e - mail to the tour company explaining his situation and sudden interest in this project .
The company immediately replied telling him that they were sorry if they did n't reply days earlier , but they could n't since the system crashed and did n't allow them to send electronic mail , just to receive .
They told that it was alright if he was interested in other projects , but he still needed to give the same working performance .
Louis told them that it was related to an instrument to explore new places .
He did trust the company , but not that much for them to know everything he thought .
The company told Louis that they did n't want to bother him , but that they were interested in investing in this kind of projects , because it was related to the purpose of the company : exploring .
But Louis knew that the invention needed to have a great design that implemented portability , that is why he needed to refine his ideas for this project to be used in an immense type of useful ways .
The company told Louis that they wanted to compromise in this project and help Louis .
When he was exploring the bottom of the sea he tried to grab a rock , but just when he touched it scattered into dust , which vanished in the bulk quantity of water around him , that 's when he knew the next important thing that the invention needed to have : resistance .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to outline actions taken by the authorities of Mińsk Mazowiecki in the sphere of preserving the environment .
The local government of Mińsk Mazowiecki has recently implemented new laws which concern rubbish segregation .
It is obligatory for the inhabitants to put their different types of garbage into separate bins .
Although citizens usually obey those rules , in some cases they are completely neglected .
However , people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedient .
As not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment , it is the local government 's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people 's actions .
Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed in small distances since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground .
One of the most challenging issues in modern cities is transportation .
Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes , underground , public transport , and cars .
Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option to transport , there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car , such as reduction of traffic , saving money , and decreasing of pollution .
A bus or an underground wagon can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time .
When referring to cars , we can considerably reduce the number of vehicles on the streets if we use public transport .
If a person constantly uses his / her car , he / she shall need to pay for more petrol .
Equally important , a car requires maintenance and it shall be another expense that the owner has to cover .
Finally , if every person drives his / her own car , pollution shall considerably increase affecting air conditions .
It had four red wooden legs and it looked very comfortable indeed .
I immediately sat down and began to feel relaxed .
It swerved beautifully avoiding a tree and landed on the ground as softly as a butterfly .
As soon as I reached there the chair disappeared and I landed on the floor with a thump !
Today we had a class discussion about taking one year off between leaving school and starting university .
Taking a year off might help people who are uncertain about what to do next to make up their minds , while trying new things and making new experiences that will be useful later on their lives .
It would certainly be counterproductive and a waste of time if the time would be spent doing nothing and just passing the time like it were a long vacation , but if it is used to make new experiences , a year off can change the future of a person .
It can be a great opportunity to travel , meet new cultures and people , or it can be a chance to work to save up money for being able to afford the cost of the university planned on attending .
Personally , I would love to take one year off , and I think I would spend it travelling around Europe .

I am writing in order to apply for the position of a volunteer in a summer camp in the USA as written in the advertisement .
I am currently taking exams for my English degree in the Ukraine National University .
What is more , I am quite good at sports , especially at football , basketball and tennis .
I consider myself to be a cheerful , energetic and hardworking person .
I would be grateful if you could tell me what sports and evening activities I would have to organise .
Please be informed that I am available for an interview at your convenience , so do not hesitate to contact me .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm studying a degree on Biotechnology at IQS , here in Barcelona .
I 'm a very extroverted guy , with experience taking care of children as I 've been working as a skiing trainer for 2 years now , this winter it will be the third .
I know how to treat children and how to make them have fun , something that would help me to organise activities and events for them .
I 'm also very self - confident and independent , as I live alone , what has make me a very good cooker .
With any new course , there are some certain expectations one will have .
At the beginning of this course , as a first year postgraduate student , I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course .
Eight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design .
Before taking part in this course , my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured , durable and financial reliable .
My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks .
By attending the first three lectures , I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products .
I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products .
It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process , improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product .
This is because despite having experience in industrial design , I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage .
Therefore , my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited .
Being placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard , I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome .
The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients .
This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes , client interview task and client feedback ( which is worth 25 points in the total mark ) .
As soon as I met my group , I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members .
However , this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week , whose English is their first language , to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion .
Because in order to deliver a successful industry project , I not only have to make a good product , but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers .
The final consideration is the self - calibration , which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process .
This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance , keep pace with the group and not to be left behind .
To sum up , at the end of week three , my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process , to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation , to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill .
Last but not least , I hope I can learn to work effectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team leader by the end of this course .

In addition the car is one of the means most used not only its quickness but also because the cost of public transport is increasing every year .
In recent years , many regions of the world have faced an issue about water scarcity that may affect their development , especially for those countries undergoing poverty .
Due to the increasing population of the world , countries are likely to need more fresh water to irrigate crops to satisfy their population .
This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable alleviation solutions .
It will examine responses including the recycling water , the development of technology about purifying ocean water and multinational sharing about water resources .
Recycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem .
This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people 's daily life , they just need to be collected to filter waste parts .
Thus , states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level .
Moreover , developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy .
As is well known , about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water , so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need .
Although , governments are likely to face economic stress initially , which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education , infrastructure and medical care , this strategy could affect dwellers ' physical health and promote their living standard .
Sharing different water resources with neighbouring countries can be another strategy which can help to alleviate the problem of water scarcity .
Countries with abundant resources can give assistance to nations with water scarcity .
Despite over shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension , few countries suffered these problems .
In conclusion , water shortage has presented a challenge to individual life and global environment .
This essay has discussed three alleviation strategies with the potential to resolve the problem of water scarcity , including the use of recycled water and ocean water and international aid .
While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially , they might have a positive impact on water shortage in a long term .
You may not have never thought about it but you ///would///could///might/// be able to jump from a plane if you wanted .
If you ask me why I enjoy my favourite sport so much , I would n't hesitateto answer .
First of all , the best thing about skydiving is the excitement and the discharge of adrenalin .
Additionally , you imagine just the moment before the jump .
When you are sitting on the plane next to your instructor , with your legs hunging and your arms crossed … It makes an indescribable impression on you .
I 'm sure you will agree that it can be one of your best experiences if you pay attention to your instructor all the time .
Nowadays we watch the perfection of actors all over the world .
The range of techniques they use to strike the audience is colossal .
Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors , whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting .
It is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another .
But let 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting .
The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / editing work and special effects .
But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors .
Regarding acting techniques , stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors .
And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors , in spite of having the support of audio operators , they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting , resonate moving , communicate emotions and feelings of their model character .
The key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect .
I would say , it does n't matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera , you should use your facial expression , body language , intonation and timber of voice as if you 're acting as your main character , embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation .
In other words , no matter what kind of performance it is , the only thing that matters is using all your abilities to model yourself on your hero , get the feel of their role .
I live in Moscow , the capital of the Russian Federation .
Furthermore people actively use private transport such as cars , motorbikes , scooters and bicycles .
Tourists can encounter with difficulties such as a traffic jam .
There are some disadvantages of banning cars .
In my view the best solution to all problems would be limitation of private transport in the centre but not absolute banning .
Recently I read two articles , they were called ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ( Zimmerman , 2014 ) ' and ' Innovative ' Intervention helps babies at high risk of autism ( Geggel & Writer , 2015 ) ' .
However the first article was more motivating to read , because the author substantiated important suggestions .
All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention .
Firstly , the article ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' shows a new research , in which it 's possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read .
In addition , using this identification may assist parents , educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Most importantly , this early intervention can help many kids with dyslexia to overcome their educational failure .
Secondly , the article ' ' Innovative ' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism ' is based on a video - therapy , which improves the interaction between parents and autism - related babies in a way that would help develop the children 's communication abilities and social engagement .
In my opinion , the findings need to be replicated in larger studies before other people turn to video - based therapy as a potential treatment .
What I can tell from this text is that the research is an innovative idea , but needs more attention to improve their success .
All in all , if you want to read about an effective research with very strong proposals , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - even before children learn to read ' .
Tom has joined a volunteering team at St. Michael 's Hospital and this was his first day .
He was assigned to a task in the rehabilitation center .
He will deal with temporarily disabled people who come for a rehabilitation session every other day .
Tom 's role was to conduct a focus group once per week to explore the people 's experience and perception about their illness and the service given to them at the rehabilitation center .
The ultimate aim is to get a feedback for service - improvement purpose .
He started with a group of six who signed a consent to participate in the focus group .
He then introduced himself and made a clear statement about the objective of the focus group and assured them that their identity will not be revealed .
He started with some jokes so that they would feel at ease and disclose their experiences .
In the afternoon , he analyzed the content and wrote a report with some recommendations for achieving patients ' satisfaction .
We all know the situation , when we are in supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same , but one of it costs much more than the other .
Most people associate brand products automatically with higher quality or better taste , while they think no name products are just cheap and without any quality and a bad taste .
As a result you can say it is not always justified that brand products are more expensive than comparable other ones .
The effect of media on people is clearly noticeable here .
A product which everybody is talking about and which is advertised a lot is automatically considered to be good .
In some cases it may be true that brand products are better than no names , for example technology products , but products like Red Bull or others like that , are definitely not always better .
Here it is said , try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust on advertisements .
We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition , and we were looking forward to our trip for months .
But , unfortunately , we had forgotten to get a passport for our son , so Pedro could n't fly .
First of all , I 'm really happy you accepted my invitation .
You 'll need to take the underground from the airport to the central train station .
The underground it 's in the airport and it 's very easy to reach because you just have to follow the signs .
Otherwise , the place would turn into a mess , especially the crowded places .
Actually , it is time saving because everyone eventually does what he wants without wasting time pushing other people .
Also , that make them do their jobs efficiently .
Being crowded in front of the employee makes people uncomfortable .
First , they would n't have privacy because there would be many people surrounding the one dealing with the employee .
In conclusion , people will do what they want smoothly and politely , if they wait patiently in queues .
I 'm Sara and I 'm a half - italian , half - spanish , seventeen years old girl with a really cheerful , energetic and hardworking personality .
I saw this advertisement on a web site and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English , but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am .
I love children and it would n't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them , actually I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end up with a tired smile , but a very bright smile .
I 've never had any experience of this kind before , but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who 's seven years old with whom I use to play a lot when I do n't have to study .
I 'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings out , so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children .
I speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points over 100 at both KET and PET certification .
Firstly I started a new job , it did not turn out they way I hoped unfortunately .
My colleauges are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them .
Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfuntional .
But the whole experience brought a positive surprise : working at the same school as Nora does is actually pretty nice .
While we might talk about our job a bit too much I do n't think it is uncomfortable to work side by side .
I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network , of these the live roleplay looks promising .
Moving is always upsetting and there is a period of adjustment that is very stressful .
A thing I would miss is the connections I started forging with other people .
So in conclusion I would like to say : the future is unknown .
May I not live in interesting times .
Michael had always been a good boy : responsible , quiet , always on time and always the first of his class .
The summer that year had been exceptionally warm , and Michael had found himself wondering if there were better ways to spend it than preparing for his University entrance test .
The truth was that he had n't rested since his graduation day and he was starting to feel tired , but he also knew that he could n't afford to fail .
Suddenly the doorbell rang , distracting him from his inner struggles , and he heard his Mother opening the door .
He stood up , hesitating for a few seconds , then glanced at his book once again and finally got out of his room and said " Please mom , tell him I ca n't go out , I have to study . "
By a wide definition , teachers are the people who teach you .
I think the best teacher is a person who has professional knowledge and good teaching skills .
In addition , the best teachers , by their teachings , are the people who we most agree with and appreciate .
Many parents may not satisfy all of these conditions .
First of all , for many parents to have professional knowledge or good teaching skills is very difficult .
Compared with professional teachers , they have specific teaching abilities .
However , not all parents have that kind of personality and most of them are confused or use the wrong ways to teach their children .
Parents undoubtedly play an important role in our life .
However , we may not be greatly influenced by their teachings , but by others ' teachings .
Because everyone has their own talents , values , and judgments , we learn more from those with whom we agree and appreciate and get significant influence from them .
Although parents teach a lot of things in our life , because they do n't have professional training and we may not agree with them and learn more from them , I think parents are not the best teachers in our life .
PREPARING THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE
If I could travel back in time , undoubtedly I 'd choose to take part in the French revolution .
The reason for my choice is simple and clear : the French revolution was the turning point in the European modern history and , thanks to its achievements , people in the twenty - first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech , assembly , worship and , the most important one , freedom of thought .
It is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower ( it was built several years after the revolution ) , but I 'm sure it was a gorgeous city as it is nowadays .
I fancy its streets crowded by workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution .
They trust in them , and are willing to fight for the freedom , fraternity and solidarity they proclaim .
I also imagine aristocrats fleeing Paris at their earliest convenience , leaving all their expensive dresses and impressive houses unattended .
They are frightened by the social movement , and prefer to look for a safer shelter in the countryside .
But , if I could be there , I would n't waste my time walking down the streets or laughing at the ridiculous aristocrats .
I 'd try to meet the poor king Louis the sixteenth and his wife , Marie Antoinette .
I would do my best for making their imprisonment less hard and , above all , I 'd try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty .
Because no revolution is worthier than a human life .

Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today .
Otherwise I will be taken off the university register .
You do n't know how ashamed I feel now , not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets ( and I can imagine how difficult it must have been ) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible .
Sorry again for all those circumstances !
I have been proving my abilities by overcoming arduous competitions since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion in persuasion and problem solving .
In 2002 , I was ranked 11th amongst 930 candidates competing for 40 places at the University Federal of Paraiba .
Throughout my undergraduate studies , my professional skills were recognized at the internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State .
At this period , I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court .
At the law office , I supervised the ISO 8003 procedures .
On the other side , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Great Honors in 2007 .
My bachelor thesis , founded in Economic Law , was unanimously awarded by the Jury with the maximum score of 10 .
This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulation of trade , that conduces me to this LLM and the international business transactions domain .
Since my Law school graduation , many achievements encouraged my professional development .
First , upon graduation , I immediately joined a highly recognized firm , performing a double role of legal consultant and sub - manager , when I was only 22 years old .
On the same year , I succeeded the strenuous Brazilian Bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10 .
After almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work within and cross - border contracts .
Therefore , in order to acquire the excellence extent demanded , I specialized in Economic law with a master 's degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five , I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I developed a multidisciplinary research applying the economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly comprehend the theoretical ascertainment for this career , which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences .
Thereby , new regulatory sources are created in response to the globalized legal context .
In conclusion , as an international legal professional , I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross - border transactions , giving the increasingly requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions .
Furthermore , I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in an international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher .
Henceforth , I aim to consolidate my career by mastering the legal responses to the developments shaping international trade today .
The LLM in International Business Regulation , Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome aimed .
Man has evolved over the years , since the invention of the wheel , to space craft expeditions .
Our specie has achieved great things , but despite all the great discoveries , there is still one problem we have not been able to suppress , a problem that has been haunting us since unmemorable times : racism .
In the 19th century , slavery had been eradicated from America , but soon another problem originated and took its place .
The movie " The Color Purple " displays a variety of situations from Afro - American people who suffered because of their skin color , known as racism , which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination from one race to another .
They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all , it was absolutely forbidden , and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs .
Afro - Americans were completely segregated , Caucasians found it impossible to live among them , that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to .
Afro - Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering , and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished .
Moreover , women in the Afro - American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways , men were the undisputed authority in the house .
He decided to go and have dinner at a restaurant which was very near his office .
He walked briskly to the restaurant , and tried to be as happy as he could .
The restaurant was almost full .
He suddenly recognized someone , Molly .
Tom and Molly were classmates at secondary school .
She was calling the waiter , and unexpectedly saw Tom sitting at a table alone .
Public transport is more useful and better than travelling by car .
First of all , our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars .
Although there are many other polluters , such as big industries , people should start with the easiest resolutions .
Although many countries do not offer a good public transport service , once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements .
For instance , Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this .
As more money is being invested in the infrastructure , people tend to use more bikes and public transport .
Unfortunately , not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides .
For example , it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious .
In conclusion , I think that public transport should win this battle .
The aforementioned representative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen prove how easy it can be to remove cars from our lives , and I believe that more cities should follow their examples .
About the task that you ask me to do , unfortunately I do n't have enough knowledge about LIMS yet .
I am just beginning to understand the way things are done here .
I understand that the new programme have some specific requisites related to preservation of analysed samples .
Nevertheless , all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from wet chemistry laboratory and from microbiology laboratory gave to me .
Of course that if you have any suggestions please tell me .
Suppose that we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand of a particular analysis .
Our international supplier wo n't be able to deliver the reagents or other goods on time .
I think it is important to have a local supplier that can help us in particular situations like a stock failure .
International suppliers take , at least a week to deliver an order .
Thank you for this conversation .

I agree with the fact that as soon as your life is not private anymore , famous people have to face journalists with a smile they do not have .
I mean by this that for sure there are some days in which these famous people are in a bit of a mood , they have to visit the doctor , or they have to solve mishaps with lawyers , and they have stuck those journalist following till the door or awaiting them stationed in front of their houses .
In these cases , jounalists themselves should realize that they are taking it too far and that they should respect them a bit more .
The map shows changes that have taken place in the town of Eastminster since 1999 .
During this period , the town has seen extensive growth in residential areas and local amenities , and a modernisation of leisure faclilities .
Parks in the north - east and south - east have been reduced to make way for larger housing estates the one in the north dramatically increasing accommodation in Eastminister .
As well as woodland in the north - west being remodelled into an adventure park , a hotel and golf course have replaced a historic house and gardens in the centre of the town .
south of the river , an industrial area has been constructed next to the existing railway while residential streets have been converted into more modern apartment blocks .
With increasing housing has come a bigger hospital and more shopping facilities the existing shops being built on the site of the old school , with a new school opening on the north bank of the river .
I live in the Netherlands and at our school it 's the same .
as I see it , it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand .
Your experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes .
I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films .
For example , my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things in school saying : this door , that window , this is my teacher , that is a chair .
However , I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming .
Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues .
I do n't see them doing activities , it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it .
For instance , when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4 I feel incompetently .
Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activate pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results .
In other words , how can we convince school board and colleagues that it is better for pupils to learn in an active way ?
Yes , she should accept this proposition .
Everything was looking perfect and it was something she enjoyed ndoing before the accident took place .
She felt butterflies in her stomach .
Thinking about it relieved him , made him feel excited about the unknown , the unexpected , maybe all the questions ever asked , maybe , finally , they would be answered .
This is easy word to understand , but it hides more than defination says .
Behind this word I see my brother , parents and grandparents and feel very warm feelings .
All the people need these things and the best givers are family members because they give unconditionally .
My family members all the time expression their warm feelings with hugs , kisses and beautiful words .
Nowadays , our environment is really affected by the great deal of progress that technology has made in the last century .
Let 's begin by considering the arguments in favour .
Fossil fuels are our most common energy source , even though , they produced a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere .
In addition , they produce nuclear waste which is a major problem for the environment and public health .
All things considered , I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it does n't damage global warming although it is expensive to afford .
If MUx / Px is less than MUy / Py , than it is the consumer 's duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy / Py is less than MUx / Px , than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more , you can consume more , each additional unit yielding additional , marginal utility , so you continually increase the sum of your total utility .
She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption , but theory would indicate that this is a positive , self - perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility , therefore maximizing utility .
The book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming .
Ms. Luhr 's dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility , and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act .
If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self - interested , she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption , but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning .
She must be irrational .

Hans Feurer is a mainstay of fashion photography since the late 1960s .
The peak of his career was in the early 80-s , after the legendary Kenzo Takedo 's advertising campaign .
Feurer 's campaign for Kenzo was one of the most popular and it defined him as a successful photographer .
Hans Feurer was born in Switzerland in 1939 .
After studying art in Switzerland , he worked as a graphic designer , illustrator and artistic director in London .
Traces of his previous career are evident throughout his work in his careful compositions and precise styling .
In 1966 , Hans Feurer travelled to Africa , during which trip he decided to become a photographer .
More than 30 years ago , in the remote deserts of North America , Hans Feurer was given free to photograph Kenzo Takedo 's 1983 advertising campaign .
The career of a Somali - American fashion model Iman also began after this pioneering shooting .
These images became the subject of Feurer 's eponymos book , lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs , illustrating his five - decade long career .
The book includes Feurer 's photographs for the 1974 Pirelli calendar , for Kodak and for fashion magazines such as Vogue Italia , Elle France and Nova .
Obviously the weight is the resistance , which will help the individual to gain strength and mass .
The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk .
Each weightlifter receives three attempts in each , and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall result within a bodyweight category .
Bodyweight categories are different for women and men .
A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful clean and jerk also fails to total , and therefore receives an " incomplete " entry for the competition .
The clean and press was once a competition lift , but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form .
Dickens 's style is full of sentimental realism : he describes reality with a sentimental tone and he mixes comedy and pathos .
Conversely , the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic works , and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and the dark ominous atmosphere .
If their themes are considered , it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of the Victorian society , with a wide range of characters and stories which reveal the conditions of children and the poor ; instead the Brontes ' novels contain the Byronic hero , a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge , as Heatcliff in " Wuthering Heights " or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in " Jane Eyre " .
In contrast with Dickens , the Bronte sisters deal with love and psychologically complex women as protagonists .
PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ENGLISH COURSE
NEW FACILITIES
However , there are some defficiencies that could be fixed .
Firstly , there is a great demand among our students of a computer room with broadband Internet connection .
Secondly , we are in need of a conference room .
Finally , it is also recommended to update the books in the library : most of them are quite old and outdated .
ACCOMMODATION
One surprising outcome from the survey was that students do not feel comfortable enough in the residential building .
There are also numerous complaints in regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen .
CONCLUSION
In case you need further information regarding any of these issues , please contact us and I will be glad to respond you as soon as possible .
I 've read your letter and let me tell you that I 'm really sorry that things are not going well lately , especially because I know how much you enjoy sports and your music classes .
Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend with each of your activities , it could work out and you would n't need to drop any of them .
Organization is the key .
However if you are still very stressed , then you might drop one of them , I certainly do n't know which one you should drop , I think I would drop the music lessons , because sports are good for your physical and mental health , and also help you to be fit and it 's more interesting for me ; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you .
Environmental problems today are more worrisome , if we not do something for our planet , in a few years we will suffer the consequences .
Simple things like recycling garbage , walking short distances instead of using cars , not throwing garbage on the streets or oceans , can mean a considerable change , because if we add the small efforts of each of us , the results are translated into millions of people .
I recommend implementing a campaign called " No more blah blah blah , it 's time to save the world " , we may not have super powers and not be " Superman , Ironman , Captain America , Batman , etc . " and we save the planet from intergalactic threat but unlike them , all together we can save the planet from an even greater threat , its total destruction due to pollution and environmental problems that we ourselves have caused .
Just as we have the courage to provoke , we have to have the courage to do something to fix , let us become that super hero that changed the world and made a change for future generations to have a healthy environment to live .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to suggest ways which will contribute to increasing the number of foreign learners in the school and to make recommendations for future improvements .
Town 's entertainment
Although my town is not an enormous industrial center , people are fascinated by the leisure activities provided here .
Variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients .
They would also enjoy our museums and galleries which can bring them closer to our history and traditions .
New teaching approaches
More students would be attracted when the school government made some changes in the learning system .
I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one - to - one lessons , namely teacher with only one student , as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will be also beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject .
Array of facilities
Dissatisfaction with the school equipment is occasionally expressed by the students .
Therefore , it is needed to provide new facilities in the classrooms .
Computer - based learning would be a great idea of attracting more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities , so that more work will be implemented .
Improvemnts on socialising opportunities
The school government should offer more extra - curricular activities , including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most .
Recommendations
I would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students making their accommodation in the town more pleasant .
I 've seen a couple of advertisements on English courses in our town , but they do n't seem very useful .
However , if you want to have a look at them , they are put up on the supermarket .
However much Roman law , Mosaic law , and rabbinical law impacted lives of Jews living in first - century Israel , many people who followed the religion of Israel lived outside of Palestine and beyond the borders of the Roman Empire .
At the same time , however , anyone professing to be a follower of the God of Israel would have adhered to the Ten Commandments .
The Ten Commandments provide Israel with the moral framework for maintaining it .
The metaphor is the Bible uses to express this relationship is covenant .
While the metaphor comes from the sphere of international law , it is wrong to understand the commandments merely as a summary of Israel 's obligations toward God . . .
Israel obedience to commandments was not a matter of submission to the divine will as much as it was a response to love
I always go to have a pizza in a restaurant near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolitan restaurant , that makes pizza and all the Neapolitan specialties , as all the type of fried .
It uses only fresh ingredients from naples that come there every day .
The place remembers the atmosphere of the little alleyways of Naples , with pictures of the most famous Neapolitan people on the wall .
The owner Patrizio , is really nice and you can often find him out of the restaurant talking to some guest .
I think it could be suitable for my class because it has two halls and one of them is always used for big groups of people , like us , the service is really rapid and in front of the restaurant there 's a beautiful square where we can have a drink while watching the typical Neapolitan evening .
Some experts say that public transportation is a crucial part of the solution to the developed nations ' economic , energy , and environmental challenges , helping to bring a better quality of life .
In increasing numbers , people are using public transportation and local communities are expanding public transport services .
Every segment of society - individuals , families , communities , and businesses - benefits from public transportation .
But , in fact , the car provides much better mobility needs , both in the big cities as on the countryside .
Our daily life is thoroughly planned , from the morning to the night .
We must keep doing our day - to - day concerns at work and at home , and , at the same time , keep holding our social life and entertainment activities .
Modern life orders our days and weeks in a packed schedulle of activities : job , children , housework , fun , free time ...
We have to go fast from one place to another , just to be in time for fulfilling next task or activity .
It 's for that we need to improve our mobility skills and private transport , as a car , allows us to achieve more efficiently our goals .
Public transport has its advantages : we can say that a lower cost , less pollution and more free time and rest for doing anything else during the trip could be public transport 's main positive points .
But , on the other hand , travelling by car gives us more comfort and saves time , and it offers a wider range of choices of departure and routes .
Every day the science and the industry are developing new materials , technologies and clean energy sources .
As industrial and technological development progresses , public transport will lose passengers and the use of private cars will spread anywhere around the world .
Do you suddenly lose confidence when you have to speak to someone ?
In class , answer as many questions as possible , and try to participate in class discussions .
My problem has always been vocabulary .
i find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words , and help me recycle words I know in new contexts .
I hope that you will find my suggestions useful .
This is a very common argument : the true genius stands out so much that can not be misunderstood , so if he is not recognized then he is not a genius .
But this is faulty reasoning : it accept the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that in history geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true , or at least is not demonstrable .
They take for granted that historically geniuses have always been recognized , but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that , in fact , have been recognized .
They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history , and therefore can not be used as an opposite example .
To sum up , because the geniuses that we have decided to recognize as such have been recognized , they argue that all the geniuses are always recognized : pure self - referential nonsense .
For Lombroso exceptional people are independent , away from the banality of life , isolated , impatient , asocial , often considered crazy .
The time in the university is the most important time in our lives because , we learn lot of things and it prepares us for our future career .
Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion of professor and student .Others may disagree .
They prefer classes with lecture and almost no discussion .
In my opinion classes with discussion are better .
First , classes with discussion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because they learn how to interact with their fellow student .
Doubtlessly , such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things .
This will enrich your personality .
For instance , a year back I was in north Texas university in USA , there was a health management and policy class with almost no lecture but with lot of time for open discussions .
In the beginning , I thought this was disadvantage but this was not true .
Consequently , he was able to tell us how the cost of the treatment are less , how doctors are dedicated , and how everybody has access to primary health care .
As you can see , open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help you to understand different nation 's policies .
Second , open discussion in the class help you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker .
It is evident that independent speaking and thinking skills are valuable for your career .
However , this health management and policy class with open discussion was helpful for me insofar as I learned how to speak in front of others .
In order to get good grades we are forced to participate in discussion .
This experience taught me that it is better ti participate in a class with open discussion because it provide you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career .
All in all though some may oppose my opinion , it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lecture are preferable because interaction with other student will broaden your mind and you become a better speaker and thinker .
That is why every university should offer such classes .
with reference to your job announcement I am submitting my application for the vacancy at Green Pepper Cafe .
Your job description sounds to be a good fit for my search since I am well experienced in serving guests and have a good knowledge of various kinds of foods .
My tasks included back office administration and services in the hotel 's restaurant .
Being ranked in the Michelin 's guide , this restaurant provides more than 50 different dishes .
I love to serving customers and to dealing with different and complex situations .
Should you require further information , I will be happy to provide them .
Thank you for your time and consideration .
Well , all your suggestions sound good to me , however , I would probably choose climbing because not only is it an extreme sport but it is also an exciting activity I would like to try .
By the time he arrived at the rivershore , some of his colleagues were already digging the ditch .
Everybody was there : the Smiths , with their three broad - shouldered sons ; the Newtons , who even brought some of their stallions to help us remove the earth and the stones ; and the slim guy who lived in the farm in the northern hills of the valley and whose name nobody knew .
They worked all day long , restlessly , until they were breathless and their hands were bleeding .
He gazed at it , a bit worried about the possibility of more raining during the night , but proud of having put the farm in shelter .
We human beings are highly socialized creature in the world .
Therefore , it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society .
However , considering the complexity of the society , I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents .
First of all , there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills , on which their progeny count .
Nevertheless , the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society .
For example , one of my senior high school 's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other 's family .
As a consequence , they never talk to each other since then .
Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group , especially in school , we will not be skilled before entering the society .
The society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member .
Learning in schools , however , provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers , but also from relationships between peers , and as a result , proves the way for being independent in the future .
Have you ever tried unsuccessfully more than 5 sports in only one month ?
The only disadvantage I could find is that golf is n't such a cheap sport to do , as it requires a lot of expense and also a good mental and psychological health , which is the first thing I recommend to work on if you want to enjoy golf from the beginning .
However , as long as you can afford it and you 're provided with patience and enthusiasm , you should n't miss the opportunity to play this amazing sport .
It slowly rustles and clatters and it 's pulsing waves attract so much that you ca n't stand sitting still much longer and you are ready to throw up everything and run towards it .
However , at the last moment , you understand that the ocean is there , in eternally beloved Spain .
I had been adoring the sea and dreaming about it when I had never seen it before , never heard it before , but definitely felt it not by skin but my heart .
Also I remember sweat perfume of Spaniards ( and Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of old town and mixing with the smell of fried fish that is ready to be served in numerous bars , cafes and restaurants .
I remember children , running about the small squares in fronf of the cathedrals ; elderly people in wheelchairs ...
All these memories are always with me , and to go through them again I do n't even need to close my eyes , everything in my mind heart is too vivid to forget .
A language it is the capital thing to learn because it is the way people communicate and organize their thoughts .
Furthermore , it gives you the chance to enjoy the works done in that language .
That 's an incredible opportunity .
Nevertheless , when you are learning a language , it brings confussion .
On the other hand , the new language needs an additional effort .
There are an incredible amount of things to learn .
In summary , learning a language is something beautiful , useful and entertaining .

But sometimes the pace of change , the direction of change or the consequences of change can make it no good at all .
No change , no life . Nature is life and death , construction and destruction .
To stop the change is impossible That would be against Nature and against ourselves .
The smallest work changes the environment .
Everything that does n't grow is dead , and death is the opposite of life .
Think of the Olympic Champion Nadia Comaneci , artificially stopped in her physical development to preserve her graceful childish body .
Equally cruel , it is , in my opinion , to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing .children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave as femmes fatales in video - clips or magazine covers .
Nature is also change , but in a cycling direction , and in a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies , the rotation of Earth , the alternation of days and nights , the sequence of seasons … , in short , the wheel of life .
We lived in a time of accelerated changes .
Technology allows us to do and learn in one life 's time more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations .
I think we should readjust the rhythm of change in order to be able to reinterpret , in a positive sense , Lampedusa words " everything must change so that everything can stay the same " .
It helps to cope with stressful situations .
But some people can get annoyed by this kind of activity . They may be irritated by loud music in the shopping areas , long queues at the cash desk and crowds of customers everywhere .
Some people can be called shopaholics , as they ca n't live without new clothes and furniture .
I do n't belong to any of these groups , because I am not addicted to shopping , but I do love the process of choosing clothes , shoes and accessories . I hate going shopping with my father as he is always advising stupid stuff .
My name is Alex Yegorov and I am writing to request information about qualification requirements for obtaining a skills assessment in order to submit my Expression of Interest in SkillSelect .
I would appreciate it if you could send me necessary applications forms and associated information relating to the assessment .
It would be appreciated if you could provide assessment procedures , timeframes and charges as well .
I graduated from the University with specialisation in Fiber - optic Transmission Systems .
Would Telecommunications Engineer ( 263311 ) be the right nominated occupation for me ?
Also may I have information on which version of the IELTS should I take , the Academic or the General Version ?
Yours faithfully ,
The European Union is created and meant to be an organization that helps all of its members to develop economically and socially while contributing to the common good of the whole union itself .
All current 27 nations must work both individually and together for the best conditions of immigrants .
There should be a working network for providing suitable jobs and standard of living to those , of course , who are looking to work and contribute to society , and do not simply expect to lay on the back of a more economically developed countries .
Many non - EU citizens live and work in Europe but for this to be successful they have to be able to integrate into their receiving society .
They should be able to enjoy the same rights and responsibilities as EU citizens .
Europe needs bright young people with an urge , with a wish to be productive , to create a better future for themselves and for their children .
Migration brings all the cultural wealth and diversity in Europe and integration is an expression of civic cohesion , contributing to political stability .
" The taste of my blood was completely different from the Sacred Blood " .
In 2015 , after 30 years of service in the Church of the Sacred Heart in Peluzuchampa , north of Bolivia , the priest Inocencio Raudales , 66 years old , realized that the wine drunk at the moment of communion is not the truly blood of Jesus Christ , as he has thought for his whole life .
Inocencio , surprised by this discovery , asked to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood , incredibly , after a needlestick in their fingers , all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted in Holy blood at the church .
At that time , the Order sent to Vatican an urgent message and called the press for making the announcement of the discovery .
At this press conference Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit .
I 'm glad to hear from you again ! I have to say that you should write in your work that the traditional Portuguese food is delicious !
Usually my eating habits are similar to the most Portuguese ; I have my breakfast around 7.30 and 8.00 , I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals .
What is my favourite Portuguese meal ?
As a concecuence , he had no money to pay for a sod , so he was thirsty all morning .
It is one os the most significant places in our capital , Moscow .
Then , this is the spot where all - nation celebrations take place , like civil and military parades or seeing the New Year in !
If you visit my country one day , I will certainly be pleased to show you Red Square and everything I 've told you about .
I was researching some definitions of cultural literacy .
It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what is cultural literacy .
Cultural literacy is the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture .
Cultural literacy is Knowing about and respecting the cultures of others .
In order to be culturally literate , you need to be familiar with all manner of things , from Waterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishmael , " to the Wife of Bath , the Magna Carta , Tutankhamen , the Pythagorean Theorem and 1066 .
To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it , and it 's entirely manageable .
A literate reader knows the object - language 's alphabet , grammar , and a sufficient set of vocabulary ; a culturally literate person knows a given culture 's signs and symbols , including its language , particular dialectic , stories , entertainment , idioms , idiosyncrasies , and so on .
The culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency , while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally - conditioned allusions , references to past events , idiomatic expressions , jokes , names , places , etc .
According to UNESCO literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child mortality , curbing population growth , achieving gender equality and achieve sustainable development , peace and democracy .
My personal opinion cultural literacy is the way to understand , learn and know about other cultures .
Also you can be understood by other cultures .
The age between 13 to 19 is the revolutionary one .
I share this opinion with the revolutionary ones .
As a result , we often communicate and we do not exchange opinions as much as other families do . I do not consider them to be my best friends because I can not speak with them as freely as with my friends .
I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet , both in number of viewers and players .
There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason ; the shot clock .
The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball .
The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled .
A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that 's exactly what sets him apart from the others .
The bottom line is ; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the " shot clock " fundamental to the dynamics of the game .
And for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand ( as it is for most sports in general ) are the values of practice and awareness .
Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations , and the combination of the two is the only way to success , so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you .
Although several causes for this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society , this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people .
One of the reasons for the worsening of the health of young people is the increasing use of cars .
Nowadays , parents take their children everywhere by car , whereas they would have to go everywhere by bike or by foot twenty years ago .
This is a result of the decreasing price of cars due to innovation in the car industry , which enabled more and more people to buy a car ( and use it ) .
However , possibilities to make the youth healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation .
For example , commercials can be used to stimulate youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects .
In conclusion , I feel that not only the ground for the low level of fitness of today 's youth , but also the clue to get youngsters fitter , lies in the modernity .
Good thriller movies have become increasingly rare in the last few years , and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder , if not impossible .
Most of these , in fact , have very predictable plots , are full of cliches and since it 's so easy to figure out how they will end , they are usually very boring .
The story is set in the future , about thirty years from now , when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer , a looper , was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body .
By letting his older self go Joe changes his past , and therefore his future , leading to a series of unexpected events , and to an even more unexpected ending !
My expectations were not very high , but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good , in fact it was not boring at all , and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise .
Time travelling is only a means to the development of the story , and the future society is quite similar to the present one , so even if you are not big science fiction fans , I suggest you give this movie a chance , I am sure you wo n't be disappointed .
In the competitive world that we inhabit , dominating a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success .
We 've reached a point where this training starts at an early age in the form of extracurricular activities , such as music classes , learning languages and playing sports .
The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in their kids as to prepare them for an unpredictable future .
The haste that results from this process does n't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality , regardless that it may compromise their kid 's motivation and self - confidence , all because of their " is talent innate or can it be acquired ? " .
Contemporarily , the most wide - spread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply are n't .
This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in the early infancy , as though this capability could be the celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow as child prodigy .
The adepts of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own believe in their child 's potential to become a known genius .
Little known is what was the role played by music in his life and how was his relationship with it previous to his first deed .
Admittedly , I do n't know it myself .
Any one who challenges the aforementioned common - sense is n't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common , but still popular and not scientific , concurrent idea .
The " 10 000-hours rule " is said to have a scientific base , in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that stablished it .
This amount of time does n't fit normal workers and students ' tight schedules and busy daily lives , therefore being labeled as unpractical and unachievable .
The normal response to this conclusion is , as I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you do n't have this time available , is the loss of motivation .
The main problem of having these two perspectives on talent is that both of them are basically negative .
One asserts that talent is a matter of luck ; the second , of pure time demanding and presumably expensive dedication .
As any other unscientific " truth " that circulates and cause harm to our society , this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised publications on the topic , so that the effective manners of becoming talented in something can be adopted , before the popular believes take our motivation and self - belief away .
This research project will provide us with better understanding and insights into this area through the EM trainees ' narratives and experiences of clinical reasoning development in ED and add to the scientific discourse in clinical reasoning .
As discussed , clinical reasoning is still poorly understood and a variety of ways of articulating and conceptualizing clinical reasoning can provide richer means of understanding what is involved in clinical encounters ( Loftus , 2012 ) .
A narrative approach to explore and investigate clinical reasoning development can provide a vocabulary that encourages us to integrate insights from different frameworks in ways that combine the strengths of each .
Many people do breakfast in the bar with an espresso or a cappuccino and a croissant .
Working people usually have lunch at about 13.00 and they have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffee because the break is short and they have to go back to work and need to be concentrate and do n't get asleep !
Young people do not drink coffee : they prefer to drink Coke while eating junk food , which is cheaper and tastier than pastasciutta .
In northern Italy people eat at about 19 , whereas in southern Italy they eat at about 21 . I get home late and I have no time to cook elaborate meals so I usually cook a steak with vegetables .
I really like the lasagna , made with a flat and long pasta with bechamel , tomatoes and meat and I love the pasta Amatriciana made with spaghetti , fresh tomatoes , bacon and a typical Roman cheese called pecorino .
Another typical dish from the northern Italy ( it comes from the mountains ) is pizzoccheri which is a wheat pasta topped with cabbages , butter and typical cheese .
I 'm talking about Gorgonzola cheese , which tastes really strong and is n't very nice because it has a blue mould inside .
However , eating is for us a tradition that puts the families together and recipes are handed down from generation to generation .
What happened to me is not the reason for my mood but I 'm sure it contributed .
My first night here I was invited to a dinner mainly for scientists who are up here doing a radio show .
I would like to apply for the job you advertised last week because I am quite sure I would be perfectly suitable for the post .
I am an English teacher here in my country , Spain , and I have worked with children aged 5 - 14 for five years now in different educational centres .

Now , in relation to the job tasks I would have to perform , I feel totally capable of doing all of them with enthusiasm and effectiveness .
I am quite good at organising sport events and games .
Students always love the activities I design for them .
Working there would be a great opportunity for me .
I know I would benefit a lot from the experience .

Yours faithfully ,
Although educated people in the past had the same desire to learn as educated people today , those who were considered educated in the past would be considered less educated today .
That 's because there 're many scientific facts have been revealed .
Furthermore , information about these facts have become much more available .
Today , people know more about phenomena that were considered obscure in the past .
Furthermore , it 's easy to know about these valuable discoveries .
In addition , information about anything can be found easily on the Internet .
In the past , graduating from high school was considered an achievement ; today it 's not .
To be considered well educated , people should graduate from a college .
Also , there 're more people who continue their education after graduation from college .
In conclusion , the average level of education in the past is n't enough today to be considered educated .
Going to the UK has been a dream of mine but going to Cornwall , however , might be a little of an escapade during the winter , considering that I 'm only used to the relatively hot Egyptian weather .
I have read that Cornwall is usually flooded in winter , and that the weather might make transportation a pain .
However , I 'm interested & excited about the journey because it will allow me to have a myriad of new experiences .
A historical place of importance in my country .
This is a forest , crossed by the border between France and Switzerland .
As it was full of spruces , it was easy to hide from the German patrols and people from both sides of the border helped Jewish , spies and English , Canadian or American pilots to flee through Switzerland .
A net took place from South of France to Switzerland , espescially to try to save thousands of Jewish children .
People who participated to that " way to freedom " never asked anything in exchange .
They never spoke about it till a few years ago , as they were considered like criminals by their countries as they had broken the law during that time .
But now , they told the whole world about it , some of them are now considered as heroes in Insrael for what they did during these hard times .
Nowadays , public transport is a useful and convenient way of travelling , especially for students , people with low socioeconomic status or for everyone who wants to go to work or school by bus , train or by subway .
Cars are a good way of saving time especially when waiting for public transport , mainly , buses .
But a disadvantage it that cars maintenance and gas is more expensive than paying for public transport .
I also think that there would be fewer people using public transport in the future but some will still be available because it wo n't be possible for everyone to afford to have a car or travelling by plane .
As in all educational processes , assessment of the programme planning must take place .
There are different ideas to be considered as far as assessment is concerned .
The function of evaluation and assessment must not only be the recognition of the results of the learning process itself , but also how this process took place , therefore we will need to use different instruments of assessment .
After the assessment and evaluation we will be able to adjust the necessary pedagogic help to individual students , know up to which point the proposed aims have been achieved and we will be able to judge the programme planning as a whole .
Assessment and evaluation will provide information , as well for the teacher as for the students .
The teacher will understand the student 's difficulties better ; s / he will know the level of assimilation of the different kinds of contents and be able to modify future programme planning .
As far as the students are concerned , they will be able to correct inadequate strategies or behaviour , know the difficulties they encounter in the learning - teaching process and evaluate their proper process .
As to the teacher , we will find out whether the programme planning was adequate or not and if s / he was sufficiently implied in the learning - teaching process .
Thirdly , we have to keep in mind the instruments for assessment and evaluation we are going to use .
For our programme planning , we propose the following instruments or techniques :
Society is continually changing , ever since we create the first civilizations .
However , it has a special importance nowadays , in a world that moves so quickly .
The first thing that comes to mind on this subject is technology .
It has such a quick growth that it 's impossible to predict how much transformation it will suffer .
It should make a lot of tasks easier and more efficient but , apart from that , I do n't expect it to have a deep impact on our lives , considering other aspects that will certainly overcome this one .
As the population grows exponentially , the resouces fail to go along .
As this may cause us to lose traditions and cultural identity , it will definitely bring more opportunities for everyone .
First of all , there are a lot of places to visit here and I would like to take you to , Punta del Este , Piriapolis , Cabo Polonio , La paloma and other beautiful places .
Secondly , You can find a job here in Montevideo or if you like in the countryside .
For people who come from other countries like you , there are a lot of internships and I can assure you that you will find a great job , there are also companies that are hiring people to work for a short period of time in their call centers .
Finally , tell me if you want to go to a particular place or do some activity that you have in mind .
The pupils have been taught English since their very first meeting with the English language in school so they are completely familiar in using English as classroom language .
In this course design we have also chosen activities that we consider suitable to be taught about in English .
The evaluation starts by unfolding the brain storm from day 1 , and then it continues by the pupils applying all their new words and knowledge about America .
Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils'minds about their new knowledge .
The end of the evaluation is that every pupil writes a post - it note that answers the following questions : What have I learned from this course ?
Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time .
Taking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils'motivation into consideration we have decided that they can follow their interests in this course .
This also gives the pupils the possibility of presenting their classmates to new knowledge - and the communicative situation is authentic .
Kyiv is a good destination for the shoppoholics .
For those interested in top fashion brands I would recommend visiting the shops in the main street .
The best manufacturers of clothes , linnen , accessories have their shops there . Jewellery and watch shops can also be found nearby .
Mass market clothes , bags , cosmetics , children toys are represented there .
There are also supermarkets in each shopping mall , where you can buy food and beverages as well as housekeeping items .
If you are interested in local design , vintage clothes and remarkable souvenirs , go to the historical center of the city .
Different shops will offer a wide range of goods and impresse with interesting design ideas and unique style .
The main shopping mall of the city is under reconstruction at the moment , but in one year it will be open for visitors and will surprise them with high tech design and exclusive brands .
And if you try to find a good product for a reasonable price visit the city 's outlet - collections of the previous years are sold there with significant discounts .

I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills .
For example , if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live , they can get a financial support by government .
Homeless people tend to unable to collect information because of lack in means to do it .
We need to let them get information .
The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships .
In the program , one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office .
He tried several jobs but he could communicate well in none of them .
He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations .
He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows .
If more lessons like this are provided and more homeless people get the skills , the problem of homelessness will become less serious .
To conclude , giving information about support that they can receive from the government , and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan .
At the moment , all governments around the world argue about climate change .
Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem , despite others believe deforestation has a higher impact on our world .
So , we can say , with less deforestation there would be less global warming .
The primary outcome is the increasing temperature , and this leads to melting glaciers .
This flooding leads to starvation because of fewer harvest yields and this creates many refugees .
On the other hand deforestation is , as said , another part of global warming due to less carbon dioxide storing trees .
But incinerate a huge part of the rainforest means a destruction of the habitat of wildlife .
Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but also does deforestation .
But in my opinion , you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first .
Even though their couple was of the quarelling type , everyone around them , friends and family agreed on the fact that the pair was as solid as a rock , and despite the ups and downs , love had always won in the end .
He was torturing Cecilia with reproaches .
It took him three days to calm down and put the things in perspective .
Nowadays , experience is more important than academic knowledge to gain a job .
Employers try to find employees that have practical skills rather than formal qualifications .
However , experience is extremely important , I disagree that the academics are not important .
First of all , formal education is essential for employees , it is considered as a fundamental basis of any practical job .
Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution .
In addition , every phenomenon is based on theory .
When employees face any problems or difficulties in work , it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon , without knowing this theory employees ca n't overcome these difficulties , for instance , engineering science seems practical , but each part of engineering science is based on theories .
Thereby , engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career .
Second of all , theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees , as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way .
Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems , beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information .
Moreover , studying in a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees .
To conclude , theoretical knowledge is more important than practical skills .
It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in careers .
It is certainly true that markets can not abandon the formal qualification in future .
Some people are convinced that public transport has no future because the car is so much more convenient .
The use of public transport has a lot of advantages , but on the other hand , some disadvantages can be distinguished .
First what are the advantages of using the bus , or train ?
When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights , by car it is hard to get from on place to the other , because the circulation is dense .
In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable .
The Jirga is a ' traditional system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan as to resolve legal cases and disputes .
The system , which was in practice since the British rule , was modified under the ' Special Provision Ordinance ( Criminal Provisions 11 ) of 1968 ' .
Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases , the Jirga also covers all important aspects of monetary , political , and communal life of tribal society .
However , in its present form , the tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan , law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions .
Strongest allegation on the Jirga system or ' informal justice system ' has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution on variety of its rules and regulations .
This informal system of justice is being practiced in rural areas of Sindh and Baluchistan .
In fact informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally owns its roots to Baloch culture and had been transferred to Sindhi society progressively .
" Historically , the Jirga System dates back to the days of Naseer Khan of Kalat , Baluchistan .
In recent years , many nations are developing their own economy rapidly , and it takes that many areas of farmlands and forests are being cut down to build a better and bigger house and a more convenient transportation system .
However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces .
In my opinion , we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance .
For example , Japan is the world 's third largest economy after the United States and China , its economy is so developed , but food , oil , and other resources are all imported , and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment .
This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor , while the environment is also getting worse and worse .
Secendly , with the increasing of the earth 's population , the area of farmland is also decreasing .
People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving .
So I think that the government must do something in this respect .
The government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development .
I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping 's hybrid rice , or after the food can make people 's great and then vigorously develop the economy .
As part of the same planet , protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government but also the task of each of us .
I am writing to apply for one of the jobs in the summer camp that you advertised on the Internet .
I am in my final year of high school which I will leave with a university entrance qualification in July of this year .
I am looking for a job in the USA to improve my English and to gain more experience working with children as I want to become a primary school teacher .
I have babysat children of different ages for the last 4 years and have found that so far very satisfying .
In addition , I have privately coached 5th and 6th grade pupils in Mathematics , English , German and French for the last 3 years .

Yours faithfully ,
I will never forget this particular day .
We set off at 6 pm and reached our destination an hour later .

It was a rainy afternoon , and I had discovered the letter that ruined my life . I would never be the same again . I was at home looking out of the window , when the phone rang .
Grandparents are the best .
She also has pale complexion and black dark circles under eyes .
Grandma 's wrinkled face can be horrofying at night .
When I go to sleep she is constantly sitting beside me .
Understanding is the most important thing in this world .
We will never stop loving our grandparents !
The Girls used to hang out together , they spent all their free time together and they were absolutely best friends .
When Aria comes home from Iceland , again , the girls get mysterious messages only signed with the letter " A " .
I love the show , because it is completely thrilling and scary .
Nevertheless , being famous has both its benefits and drawbacks .
First of all , celebrities are usually wealthy , so they have an easier life than other people .
On the other hand , lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person 's life as their personal life 's boundaries are constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists .
Owing to this state of constant stress , many of them are bound to have alcoholism problems , drug - addiction and depression .
In conclusion , fame may be nice but it 's not an easy path to walk on .
In this way I 'd had the chance to know different people from all over the world and at the same time I 'd earn some money to visit the city and the castles of England , where many historical battles were fought .
After leaving London I 'd love to do two months of volunteering at a children hospital in York .
Will you help me writing a striking curriculum ?
I 'm meeting two friends of mine in Bristol where we 're renting a little car and we 're travelling without destination !
Almost immediately the house was empty , and music turned off , letting Michael realise that his grandmother 's vase valued in £ 2000 was broken down .
Michael decided to blame the dog for the unfortunate incident and when he told his father what had happened automatically he put the dog up for adoption as it was n't the first time , despite of Michael 's attempts to avoid him doing it .
I would like to apply for the 12-month Internship Programme ( Marketing and Client Relations team ) at ICG as advertised on the Cambridge Careers website .
This position will allow me to gain an insight into the asset management industry .
The reputation for stability and consistency and the global leadership in mezzanine finance are my main reasons for applying to ICG .
I am very interested in working in the financial markets .
Having lived in four different cities ( Brighton , London , Manchester and Cambridge ) in the UK , I have become more flexible to new environment and keen to accept new challenges .
In addition , I believe my international exposure and fluency in English , Mandarin and Cantonese will be an invaluable asset to the company .
Given my strong academic background and my leadership experiences at university , including the completion of Manchester Leadership Programme , I believe I am a strong candidate for this position . I enclose a copy of my CV and hope very much to be invited for interview .
At this point , no one knew that she did the interview and the interviewer told her that the job was hers .

It would be my pleasure to visit the States again and take part in activities I enjoyed doing as a teenager .
And I am confident that I would be a beneficial member of your summer camp team .
But then , every once and a while , one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance , or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision .
This results in common opinions , support when there 's a problem and mutual understanding without many words .
On the other hand , we tend to have higher expectations and less patience when it comes to our loved ones .
One should also bear in mind that sometimes it 's necessary to compromise , especially when it comes to material or financial issues .
Once you accept that your sibling , although similar , is n't the same as you , or that your child has a different view on their future , it 's easier to embrace the differences and be a supportive family member .
Those are my findings and my recommendations .
This innovative center has a lot of first - class facilities for young people .
It has a professional rehearsal studio that local music groups can just rent for pocket money , they can also rent instruments by paying a small refundable deposit .
- The second best place is a private disco for youngsters .
- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall .
They especially like the music store and a magnificent t - shirt store owned by two local designers , there you can design your own item and collect it the following week .
My name is Susanne White and I would like to apply for the position as a camp assistant advertised on the Crash Magazine .
Two years ago , I developed a project called : Our talent for Poetry and Painting , within an association for orientation of children and teenagers .
Apart from my experience in Arts , I also have been doing gymnastics for ten years ; therefore I am a sporty girl .
In addition , I believe I am suitable for this position because I have the ability to speak with people of different nationalities in English and French , and I am enthusiastic about camping .
Enclosed I also send the reference letters written by the director and supervisor of the Talent Proof Association , where I worked with children , in order to support my social skills and crisis management competence .
Yours faithfully ,
The importance of cleanliness around us is not understood till it takes a toll on our health .
An individual must be aware of the result of his act on the environment , be it due to personal or professional act , in order to maintain it in healthy state .
In Clayton , my hometown , people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging the ones who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against the ones who tend to cause harm to it .
The municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town .
Representatives elected by respective communities attend the meeting .
It is then their responsibility to communicate the message to all members of their community .
These meetings are organized according to their planned schedule and the results were surprising .
Earlier , regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not , it was disposed off in the same bin .
Later , people were educated regarding recyclable , non - recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed - off in respective bins .
Development was also happening at the same time which was good for our town , but , lots of trees were also cut down as a result .
People started protesting against them to avoid any further damage to the environment .
Hence , the municipal board decided to invite the developers as well in the meeting that was scheduled in a weeks time .
Taking care of environment is everyone 's duty and it must be performed responsibly .
The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job in educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state .
Everything was dark except for a ray of light that probably started at the end of that way .
When he was ready he took his keys and everything he needed , he locked the door and went to his job .
Further to our phone conversation of last week , I would like first to thank you for giving me this chance to talk to you , and following up on our discussion , please note that we have been approached by the purchasing department at the hospital to give them our maximum discount to secure the deal as a lot of brokers were quoting with a very competitive price which very close to our cost .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter took out his mobile , dialed 112 and told the dispatcher about that whole situation .
The dispatcher told Peter to calm down and check if he had scissors , towels and water in his car .
The dispatcher told him every little thing he had to do .
To begin with , they help us solve really complex mathematical equations .
We made programs that make computers do very interesting things , like graphics .
Furthermore , the major thing that computers made easier for us is , communication .
Humans are social animals , we communicate because communication is in our genes , if we do n't communicate we go insane .
In the other hand , computers have very bad effects on both to us , and the environment .
For example , research has shown that not computers themselves , but the things we use or play on them are addictive , like social networks or games .
Despite the fact that computers decreased the use of paper , they 're still harmful to the environment since they consume tonnes of electricity .
So it is normal that computers have bad effects on us and the environment .
We have also worked together in a kindergarten for some time and this year we started our studies in an institution in order to become primary teachers .
As a result of having shared many experiences together , I have come to know her and her abilities very well .
As a student , she is persistent and hardworking as well as respected by teachers and students because of her sympathy and kindness .
Lucila is the biggest out of six siblings so she is used to babysitting children .
In the past , she had some difficulty keeping her room neat , but , as she has grown up , she has become a far more disciplined and tidy person .
When we worked at the kindergarten she was very patient and caring with the children and also she was willing to help them whenever they had a problem , even if that implied had work for her .
I can confirm that she had a special connection with the kids : she was admired by them , who would spend a great time with her .
Moreover , she has been to a camp in Australia in which she was a coordinator of a group of twenty kids .
As a result of her experience , Lucila has developed an incredible ability to solve any problem that may arise .
Lucila has always wanted to work with children and she is interested in a job that would also help her develop her English skills .
She would undoubtedly do an excellent job and for the reasons I have given I have no hesitation in supporting her application .
Yours faithfully ,
To the Italian education authorities
In this report , I will describe the school system in my country , point out its flaws and conclude giving suggestions about how they could be addressed .
In Italy , students have to decide between grammar schools and technical institutes as their secondary school type .
Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option , because it opens the door to university , while technical institutes are put in a corner .
That is actually a mistake , because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes , who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences .
Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on theory .
In fact , students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life .
Suggestions
What I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes .
Furthermore , schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years , which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would , but it would also attract more people to the school itself .
Conclusion
People should get used to the fact that most companies will also care about your previous work experience , and the idea of gaining that through school would be really appealing .
I am a friendly , happy , hardworking person with a lot of energy .
I have had 5 years ' experience working with children as a language teacher .
I am used to organising sporting events and fun activities for children and teenagers aged between 6 - 19 .
In addition , I have experience working in restaurants during the summer so I am used to all types of kitchen duties including cooking and washing up .
I believe I would be the perfect candidate for this position and I would be happy to attend a Skype interview whenever is convenient for you .
I am sure that it would be a very interesting and challenging position and I would really enjoy the opportunity to work at your camp this summer .
Yours faithfully ,
Nobody can argue with the fact that education is a relevant period in the development of a child .
Learning new languages is very important , but also studying subjects related to computers and technology like computer programming is becoming more and more useful than ancient languages like Greek or Latin .
This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study in particular and an important instrument in life in general .
On one hand , it allows the students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past .
On the other hand , this does not bring too many employment opportunities .
Related to learning computer programming , it guarantees a good living .
It is a known fact that there are very few computer programmers .
Furthermore as technology changes more and more , there will be a greater demand of these skills in the future .
It is evident that technology is in every aspect of our lives .
In conclusion , there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school , but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any school serious programme .
I consider them as my favorite band since 2010 , because I had the chance to get to meet them watching The X Factor 's episode where they auditioned .
' All that echoes ' , by Josh Groban , is the sixth studio album of this American singer and songwriter .
It contains twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song .
That fascinating album surprises not only the variety of subjects but also the strength of instrumental sounds .
The arrangements are simple and effective and the powerful voice plays harmoniously with the rich sound .
False alarm , which is the second track , is totally different and mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments .
Groban sings well - known from the film ' Once " song called ' Falling slowly ' in his own fantastic way but listeners get used to the first version might be disappointed .
Musically satisfying ' Happy in my heartache ' tells the story of tragic love .
Once again , Groban fascinates audiences from all over the world with his mature voice and catchy tunes .
I definitely recommend that album to your collection .
His main task was to collect letters from abroad and to hand them to THE postmen WHO WERE in charge of DELIVERING them to THE addressees .
One day , he took part in a competition intended for the selection of the head of the post office where he was still working .
The LARGE NUMBER OF participants DID VARIOUS EXERCISES , INCLUDING a TRANSLATION into German .
When the exam was finished , he went out the room where the competition had been held .
I noticed that the first malfunction was safety lock which demanded applying of great force .
We discovered that another problem when tried to use the blender .
Finally , four weeks later , I was contacted by your representative .
I am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service have I received .
Yours faithfully ,
Dear Mr Cunningham ,
I am writing to apply for the post of camp monitor which I saw advertised on the university website .
I am very interested in it because I would like to broaden my experience in activities with children .
Regarding my experience , on the one hand , I take part in a soccer club in university , consequently , I have some experience working in a team .
It is true , that water sports are not the most usual there , however , I enjoy practising them every summer on the beach .
Moreover , from my point of view , children need to focus their attention in a constant activity , my sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to maintain their attention .
If you offer me the chance to join your team , you shall not be disappointed .
I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
Those days , travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people .
Government build more roads and more families are able to afford cars .
There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to explain .
On one hand , it is enviornmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars .
Nowadays , buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in urban cities .
On the other hand , buses and subways can accommodate more passengers while a car can only contains 4 to 5 people totally .
Compared with cars , public transport has larger capability of conveying , which saves space and costs less .
Last but not least , fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours .
Thus , it will be more smooth and pleasant for passengers to travel on the road .
In conclusion , public transport is a cost - effective way for people to travel , which also contributes to the sustainable development of society .
" Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed . "
The statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort on fields or subjects that they are not good at , which I can not agree with .
This statement fails to consider the main function of education , which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of escape .
The responsibility of education institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions , not making decisions for students .
Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside , trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning , always being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreating , all these are the main reason why the humankinds can keep improving .
Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education .
If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance to be successful , we 'll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein , who were considered as stupid kids in school but did n't give up trying .
Convincing students to take a more comfortable road by giving up the possible risk is definitely not the proper attitude the educational institution should have .
One may suggest that everyone need to learn to assess the risk before invest , however , teaching students how to assess not assessing for students is the responsibility of educational institutions .
Nevertheless , the ability of identifying limit of oneself can be best learned from experiences .
The responsibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him / her from getting close to the water .
Educational institutions should guide students to have better self - understanding and self - assessing , not persuading them to follow the pre - decided road .
Last but not least , what is the definition of " success " ?
How do the educational institutions judge a student being likely to succeed or not ?
For some people , living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life .
They might not be the top , but they are self - actualized and satisfied , and only in such situation they can provide most to the world , just like Albert Einstein has said , " Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value . "
Considering all the above , I can not agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions .
Contribution
The most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme " Tagesschau " which is airing about three times a day on the channel " Das Erste / ARD " .
It is a news programme based on well researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need .
The main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research which makes it more reliable than other news programmes .
Moreover they try to be interesting for all ages so they post on facebook and twitter as well which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme .
Nevertheless they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and in addition they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need .
In my personal opinion I strongly believe that this TV programme earns its popularity .
The way they present themselves in the media and the well funded research are truly unique in German news programmes .
Although I am rarely watching the show on TV I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring nes so vivid interesting through short video clips , pictures and their choice of words .
If you ever get to watch TV in Germany you should definitely try out this interesting news programme .
Have you got friendly colleagues ?
We 'd get there at about half past eight every day and started cleaning the main room and proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema .
We got to see the new Bond movie and also the blockbuster Spiderman 3 there .
My job was cleaning the cinema , but Fred 's main responsibility was to roll the movies for the clients , so I 'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier , so I could enjoy watching movies with him .
For last ten years Michael had been working in a well - known company in London as an accountant .
He sat on a sofa in front of a television and suddenly he realised the fact that every morning was exactly the same , nothing has changed since such many years ! "
Since Michael was a child he has always dreamt of moving to Australia , where he could practise kitesurfing for all day long , meet open - minded people , chill on a sandy beach and drink a good Australian alcohol .
After 10 minutes a resignation letter was ready to bring it to Michael 's boss .
Without waiting for her answer , he just went into the office , gave to Mike , his boss for 10 years , an envelope with a resignation letter and left .
Michael had cheated on her and he did it consciously .
The words coming up from his mouth like a litany , almost mechanically as he realized that there was no turning back .
The relieve of telling her was instantly replaced by a bitter hollowness .
Glitz , glamour and popularity ; three words which are often linked to the world of football and this sport in no doubt one of the finest that man has created .
The stars playing this game add to the already amassed recognition of the sport .
Weekends would be a drag if match days were not on television .
The 90 minutes is the most enjoyed time of the week though because of the adrenalin rush that is associated with every thing that is done on the pitch .
As a fan supporting a team is just one part of the sport .
Rivalries , arguments on which team is the better team and watching matches in a group just adds to the excitement .
With regard to this sport any advice in my opinion is a good advice and I have just a single advice for a person starting this sport and that advice would be to enjoy everything related to the sport .
Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until go to university , even some of them still need to study them in the university .
A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled in mathematics .
This essay will discuss the differences and similarities for learning a language and learning mathematics .
The ways of learning a language and mathematics are different .
For studying a language , people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read variety of overseas book to increase their reading and writing skills .
Furthermore , people need to have a good memory to remember a large number of words .
In general , studying a language focuses more on a large account of individual effort and little talent .
However , for learning mathematics , students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions . Instead of rote learning , they should remember different types of formulas by practicing in a mass of examples .
To sum up , teachers , skills and talent are more important for learning mathematics .
However , there are some similarities for those two subjects .
Secondly , associability is important for both languages and mathematics .
In conclusion , people need to find a right way which can save much time and energy to study these two subjects .
Shenzhen - China 's largest migrant city and a neighbor of Hong Kong - is a remarkable place that I call home .
Most Shenzhen residents come from different cultural backgrounds and speak various regional dialects .
Meanwhile , we embrace a superordinate Shenzhen identity , which is characterized by a culture of openness , tolerance , and creativity .
Our differences , it seems , do not make a difference .
However , the young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance .
As a child who did not play with " boys ' toys " and identified as gay later , I was often subjected to disdain and hostility from peers and adults .
Ironically , the marginalization comes not only from society at large , but also from within the gay community .
A feminine gay man is considered as lesser than his masculine counterpart , because femininity is regarded as weak , unattractive , and second - class .
This experience of amplified minority stress prompted me to think about intergroup and intragroup interaction early in life .
It has led me to believe that masculinity should not be an indicator of individual worth .
She chose little , cosy restaurant near her house .
As soon as Anna and her friends came into restaurant everything started to go perfect .
She started to dance with double Presley , laugh and appreciate every single minute .
She was embarrassed that she did not recognise him .
But immediately she realize that it was one of her friends ' tricky plan and she started to laugh with them .
Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kinddom in my country .
The Alhambra Palace was the residence of Boabdil , the last Muslim king , who was defeated in 1492 after delivering Granada to the Catholic Monarchs .
Nowadays , this palace is one of the most visited places here in Spain because of its beauty and its impressive courtyards .
You can see the history of the Reconquets in its walls and towers .
Its surroundings are also wonderful , and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra , one of the last Muslim palaces in the word .
I haven't seen you for almost two months but , as you know , on November I had a one of a kind possibility to help at a concert that took place on airport runway and it was simply amazing experience !
An event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal !
The whole process of selling the tickets was fascinating because of the demand for them .
People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to kill their every single ' rival ' .
Security guards had a lot of work to do but thanks to them we stand a chance to deal with other problems , as for example regulating the quality of sound .
I was incredibly overjoyed when the culmination came .
A band was playing , we were enjoying music and it seemed that there will be no more complications .
What you actually think in such an extraordinary moment is that life could n't be more beautiful .
After a few drinks I told him that I 'm currenly looking for a job , nothing big , just a couple of hours during weekends to gather some money for my journey to Netherlands .
It 's literally 10 - 15 hours on Fridays nights and Saturdays , stuff like carrying instruments ( which means hanging out with musicians ) , tyding after ( finding things , like wallets and cellphones ) and generally speaking - helping .
In fact I had to be everywhere with the guy , just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city .
Last time it was for example delivering my drunk boss home ;)
Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I 'll tell you so much more , I have plenty of unbelievable stories !
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
A modern interpretation of Austen 's Classic Love Story
Joe Wright directs this uplifting adaptation , which depicts the five Bennet sisters , who have been brought up to get married .
The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them striving to put everything in a broader perspective .
Surprisingly enough , sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet ( Keira Knightley ) meets single , rich , and proud Mr. Darcy ( Matthew Macfadyen ) .
Keira Knightley , in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet , delivers an outstanding performance .
In fact , the film , well cast from top to bottom , is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a set of beautiful English locations , as in many British productions .
In this adaptation , the screenwriter makes some substantial alterations to the novel .
Therefore dialogues , settings as well as politeness , costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accuracy .
Thus , overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure , several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings , and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story
To conclude , Pride & Prejudice is an amazing adaptation which completely bewitches you with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit .
I am 45 years old man and I have plenty of experience in working with people .
Above all I am interested in films .
Science fiction are my favourite type of films because I like to leave behind normal life nevertheless , I enjoy all kinds of them such as comedies , thrillers , westerns , horror films and even silent films .
I think I am right for the position because I think I can boost the motivation of the people about movies and push them up to share their particular point of view .
As far as the job is concern working on Monday and Wednesday evening would be perfect for me because I am currently unemployed .
Please feel free to ask for further information if you need it .
Yours faithfully ,
Thank you for accepting our invitation to give a talk at our club .
Our club members are thrilled knowing that an international sports star like you is coming to see them .
Many times reading my own poems and articles is a surprising experience . "
So , I have yet to submit myself to some serious criticism ( well , calling my writings literature is a huge joke in itself ... anyway ) ; but yes , I would like to place my written works ( however small and few they may be)for qualitative discussions in front of people who really can identify the good and the ' not - so - good ' writing .
It 's very common to hear people talking about friendship , but are we sure about the real meaning of it ?
Firstly we ought to consider that friendship is not uniquely a human emotion .
Friendship is overall an acto of will .
Friendship is a type of love which is characterized by being incondicional , reciprocal , and ready to forgive each other .
Somebody who listens to you talking about your dreams and wishes , your expectations and your efforts and sacrifices to get them , your plans for the future , and moreover pays special attention on times of crisis .
They feel happy when I am happy , they are sad when I am sad , they enjoy themselves with my success .
They are , definitely , my best friends .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself , while many also place a lot mystic connections with this painting .
The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes on the painting are made visible through it .
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the painting is the woman 's smile .
Many scientific studies have been undertaken to determine the exact nature of the smile and the real reason remains a mystery .
It is believed that every person sees the smile differently because of the changes in the lighting that Leonardo presented .
Some winding paths and a far away bridge is also perceptible in the background .
The painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty .
We use it to communicate with friends , to play games , to watch series , the list is endless .
Unfortunately , it is not perfect .
Luckily , the government intervenes to preserve the safety of the Internet .
What it comes down to is , should the Internet be more tightly controlled by governments ?
Without the interference of the government , criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users .
They could get into our computers and steal our information .
They could use that information to get into our bank accounts and steal our money .
However , if the government were to monitor the citizens actions more closely , it would be considered an invasion of our privacy .
Nobody wants to have their private data to be exposed to the eyes of the government .
The reason why the government even take action is to ensure people are able to enjoy the internet , but a more tightly controlled internet would destroy that purpose .
So they would not appreciate it if there were suddenly restrictions put on them .
To sum things up , the government should not control the internet more tightly .
Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders .
Therefore , what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made .
Those who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes .
Nevertheless , identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities .
This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today .
For instance , parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and , consequently , they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field .
According to this fact , parents often shape their children 's lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps .
As I see it , personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us .
The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case .
I was so surprised to hear you signed up for a new interior design course because it 's such a coincidence that I 'm planning to do something with my bedroom in the near future .
As I 've got some extra money at last , I think It 's high time for me to think how to make it cozy and comfortable .
First , I think about painting the walls in warm colors ( apricot , salmon or warm beige ) . I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list .
I completely rely on your taste as we 've always been on the same wavelength .
The idea of painting it white seems too boring to me and I 'm completely out of my depth with all this new stuff for ceilings in shops , but I 'm sure you 're an expert !
I hope I do n't bother you too much with my redecoration , knowing how busy you are .
CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT
Since the technology has improved in recent years , we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel .
There are so many advantages .
It is the fastest and the most comfortable one .
Of course , for these facilities you have to pay a lot of money and that could be a problem for some people .
It could also be really comfortable but we do n't use it often .
Travelling on a boat for sure is a great adventure .
But there is also an inconvenience - it is also expensive .
In my country trains are n't really fast and there could be problems during the trip but that 's for me makes it more interesting .
Even though any mode of transportation is not bad , for me the train is the best option .
back in 2010 , I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car , a course that took 18 hours driving straight , surely very few people would consider it convenient .
cars are handy and driving can be pleasant , but only when the driver is in good mood , with no traffic jams or craters on the road ( really common situations in Brazil ) .
Since ancient times exist public transport , and it suffered numerous attempts of assassination , in China for example , the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport ( at that age , charriots ) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against mongol 's dictatorship in it ; the situation inverted at early socialist regime when , in 1960 , Mao considered personal cars as instrument of opression and symbol of devilish capitalism .
The convenience has litlle to do with the fate of public transport , countries with high HDI(convenience to be drivers ) , like Germany and England , are those with better public transport system , and they are even boosting it .
Unless some extraordinary mutation happens and change us to some labor - lovers , personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity .
USA SUMMER CAMPS APPLICATION .
I play hockey and basketball , two sports that are simply perfect .
I have been learning English for a while , I am sensitive and positive person , full of energy and willing to have new adventures .
I have experience at taking care of children and it is a task that I really enjoy .
I think I might be a suitable person for the job because I have already work with kids , especially at teaching and having fun .
As I have alrealdy said , I play sports that is why I could be helpful at organizing sports and evening activities .
I learned how to cook when I was eight , so I am pretty much confidente and well prepared .
Yours Faithfully , Alexia .
Above all , it 's a significant step to make a good design , in which background colour , artwork and security are the main considerations .
Then it comes to the preparation of metal plates and that needs skilled machinists .
The most important step is inspection manually .
After that , good quality sheets and bank notes separated from partially damaged sheets will be packaged and distributed .
Introduction :
The aim of this report is to give some information about the range of exciting activities that people can do in our area .
There are lots of places where you can do water sports like scuba diving , windsurfing , surfing , go on a banana bus , kayaking … The Costa Brava is the perfect place to do water sports because there is a lot of wind and good weather .
In winter you can go skiing or snowboarding in the Pirineus .
Conclusion :
To sum up I think that if you want to do exciting sports Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do , but if you do n't want to do sports you can do another activities or go on interesting places .
After all , what I had was so infinitesimal that I could barely taste it . '
It was time to escape , even though his mother would find out who ate it eventually .
Chapter 9 : The KM-3J : The second confrontation
That night the time flew by , but things started to get weird , Marcus was talking with an Australian guy about the proofs that he had found related to dinosaurs , he was interested in them , but Marcus did n't like his point of view about those species , the guy told him they were bad creatures with no feelings , and Marcus thought they were awesome and the most lovely creatures he had never heard about , the guy thought Marcus was crazy , so he flew from the Federal Palace .
Meanwhile , Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies , they were beautiful and flawless , the scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing , and suddenly the ladies vanished , the men started crying .
Jack , was arguing with an officer about Mexico conquest ( the officer did n't understand anything because Jack was drunk ) , and suddenly , the officer took off his costume and a strange mask , and in that moment … Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer , he was Brad !
Jack tried to confront him , but as soon as he tried to do that , he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him , he had a new team , he decided to name them " The KM-3J " , a villains team , their names were Karolina ( she decided to change his name like that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one ) , Melanie , Miley ( they were both twins , the most beautiful ladies of the world ) , Max , who was an expert in the military field , and Brad Rowley J. , nobody had known his last name until that moment : Junior , he was embarrassed about it , he was descendant of a weird woman , however she was her mother .
The bulk of the population from New York was homeless because there has just been a horrible war between New York City and California , however , increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war .
Jack was frightened , but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him , they had used some weapons from The King of the Sky , they got into the room and started shooting while Michael was unleashing Jack from the chair , accidentally , Mark killed Miley while he was shooting , all her body parts were scattered on the floor , he did n't care about and flew with the others .
Occupation and education disturb one another .
I will elaborate points to support my opinion in the further paragraphs .
It all depends on the preference of the individuals .
If they want to bear some hassle and become more productive in their life , they can manage both things side by side .
This not only makes them knowledgeable but increase their potential as well .
Resultantly , they put their children into some labor so that they can earn money for the family .
With firm determination , they can continue their education and work to feed their family as well .
Moreover , some employers select the potential employee from colleges while they are studying and pay for their Masters or Advanced Diplomas because they see their profit in that investment .
Hence , studying and working side by side helps candidates to grow professionally .
In conclusion , working and studying is very much possible .
It just depends on the dedication and determination of the person .
People should do both study and work side by side to make themselves more skilled and capable .
I believe I am a good fit for this task since I had previous experience working in similar jobs .
I demonstrated courteous and professional attitude and achieved a high rating in the customer satisfaction survey .
I am also interested in different kinds of food and different cuisines .
I accept feedback from peers and management and improve my performance .
I am also a quick learner and adapt to different working environments .
Thank you for your time and consideration of my resume and I look forward to speaking with you .
Was it at the invitation to the wedding three weeks ago ?
So many twists and turns - she played her cards well , I never suspected while sitting in the pews next to my wife that when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face that the evening would end at D'el Arte .
No , none of these things would have prepared me for the relief I would feel after waiting 4 hours in the emergency room that her pains were probably only intercostal muscle pains and the test for something more serious were all negative .
I 'm writing as an answer for an advertisement for a job in the USA .
I am fourteen years old and interested in this job and believe I have the qualifications .
I think I would be fit for this job , because I am young , energetic , enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children .
I would be helpful in the kitchen as I used to work part - time in my uncle 's restaurant .
I can also help organise any activity , as I have previously worked in a summer camp in my town with children between the ages of six and ten years old .
In my opinion this job would be a great , helpful experience .
I hope you consider my application and look forward to hearing from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
I have just seen your advertisement for a job in your summer camps .
So , I do n't find difficult to organize competitions or activities for children .
This is the experience which I 've been waiting for for ages !
In my teens , I was fascinated by planes .
But at 360 metres , I was still surrounded by heavy fog .
My mom has a kindergarden and I love helping her out .
Every summer I help my mom 's summer camp , but it 's a summer camp of babies and I would like to work wth older children because I think it 's more challenging . I would love to work at any placeacross th US .
I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs , restaurants etc .
so I was handing leaflets everywhere .
Eventually the concert came off just perfectly !
Lots of people showed up , everybody had fun and the best thing in the musical experience is that you can make friends with famous people and those who you admire and only see on TV .
If you will ever have an opportunity to help by this kind of event , I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart !
It 's a pity that you have to choose between the activities that you love the most , but I guess that life is full of choices .
You have always wanted to be policewoman ( unless you have recently changed your opinion ) so you must be very fit since you need to pass the physical tests , which are very demanding , according to my mother .
So I think you should n't be upset because now it is a difficult period , I know , but it passes and we can get back our life when we go to university .
My cousin , who is studying English Literatura , told me that you have much more freedom when you start university , so do n't worry !
James Dashner 's The Maze Runner , joins The Hunger Games and Divergent as the latest futuristic Young Adult thriller to get its own film franchise .
The Maze Runner manages to feel remarkably fresh .
He can remember his name , Thomas , but that 's all he can remember : everything importanthas been wiped clean .
A group of teenagers , all males , have made a makeshift life for themselves there .
Like Thomas , none of them have any real memories of their previous lives , although there 's a barely spoken , horrific suggestion that the lives they 've come from might have been even worse than the ones they 're living now .
The book ends devastating final twist .
The oldest memory of our relationship is a short skirt and some crocodiles .
The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy . I should be able to describe my view of American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult , a woman , a wife , a mother and simply a human being with various roles in life who has been million times happy and million times unhappy .
No . I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time , but it is impossible to write the truth since I have never seen him alive . I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life , experience and surrounding I live in .
His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences .
I adore his imagination because he is able to kidnap you on a cloud to a never never land .
He is the man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo , love is just a quote and lying is the new truth .
I do n't believe in the friendship between the man and the woman .
If I want to sleep , he stops his own imagination to let me relax and rest .
So he is thoughtful .
However , I am scared a bit of the consequences of this secret adventure .
This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me , not only an interviewer from a daily journal .
He forgets of everything when he plunges into his Neverland .
On the other hand , he is disciplined , because he is able to stop with his imagery at once .
I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue , for example : You are totally uninterested to read between lines ! You never listen to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum .
I was impressed and I find this a good feature of his personality .
He went with the trip from California to Texas and then to Phoenix .
If you like adventurers , well , he is the right man for you .
Kyle is a strong and charismatic individuality and he values his privacy a lot .
But I identify myself with his view of male and female relationship .
Red is matter , brutal and heavy and always the colour which must be fought and vanquished by the other two . "
To : The Chairperson
Subject : Local Environmental Protection
As requested , this is a report concerning the environmental condition within my town .
The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population 's interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area .
Through a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling .
Therefore , in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned .
This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal .
Since exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays , the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport , in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars .
Consequently , there are buses which run at short intervals on various routes , so that people can arrive at their destinations rapidly and conveniently .
Unfortunately , only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community , thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society .
Our local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal , storage , collection and transport of waste material , but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community .
The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat , making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit .
Conclusion
Taking everything into consideration , it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside .
However , as with all issues present within society , a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor .
Red fire ants originated in Brazil .
Fire ants are very aggressive .
They often swarm on their prey swiftly and sting repeatedly to paralyze it .
If we disturb a fire ant nest they would relentlessly sting us , injecting poison into our body .
In infested areas , they injure livestock , pets and wildlife ; damage crops , plants , electrical equipment , and irrigation systems .
We should use pesticide treatments to reduce their numbers .
here will be several inventions in the next years .
Nowadays we ca n't predict the aim of future devices though I guess that they will be mainly related to eradicating current illnesses .
Cancer , for instance , is surely one of the preferences for the companies that invest large amounts of money in R&D.
Moreover , it is a profitable task if they make up new medications to help people suffering from that illness .
Personally , I consider curing cancer the most challenging goal for the next generation of researchers and inventors .
That is the reason why I have been thinking for a long time about a new device to eradicate starvation .
It is not completely developed but I can advance some ideas about its design .
Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding of one person in one day .
Manufacturing costs are not expensive and these pills do not expire .
I consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely end with the most unfair problem of this world .
For that matter Guido creates an imaginariy game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp .
The strength of the movie relies on the goofy , loving , eccentric character played by Begnini , his exceptional comic talent and his ability as director to deal with such delicate topic like Nazism while managing to drive through a thick line bettween comedy and drama .
The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni it 's also a beautiful , delicate plus to this masterpiece .
What strikes me more was that despite the fact that it 's set on the eve of the II world war , the film is n't really about the holocaust but a bittersweet fable about human courage love and hope .
Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful .
Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular play or how to block . I have learned to think about others first , and realized how important working hard is .
It is a learning ground for many to strengthen their personality and character for their lives .
Honestly , I could not agree more , as the website as it is available today is an inconvenient tool providing insufficient informaton .
Besides , adding a schedule to the left section would be an advantage , as our customers would be able to find the option they need in a more convenient way .
Second , the theme is outdated , and developing new design can be a good move to attract more clients .
Minimalistic design is both stylish and user - friendly , as it does not imply any elements requiring website visitors to load heavy modules , and there are no unnecessary banners that distract the user .
Third , implementing several advanced solutions , such as a calculator , a gallery and live chat , could make our page more useful .
As to other aspects of our website , it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements ( which decrease the website value while bringing little profit ) .
All these tasks can be completed within a month , and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website , as it is an important aspect of our work , because it represents the company , and representation is key when attracting clients is concerned .
Before focusing on the topic of technology itself , I would like to mention some aspects related to education .
First of all , Spanish educational laws are in Europe , and probably in the world , the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years .
Secondly , there are two sorts of schools in Spain - public and private- , which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge .
While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly , private schools have some privileges .
Knowing this about the Spanish education system , we can now talk about technology .
I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary .
So , the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach .
Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In fact , using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure .
Teachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated .
Moreover , they should comprise the past information and the new one .
In other words , technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages .
This new technologies also help in the teaching development .
Also , teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations .
In conclusion , as a great teacher said , we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge .
Thus , there must not be a technological revolution but an educational one .
I fear that such a huge move would damage businesses and many workers would lose their jobs .
At present , I am working for Cafe Noir , a well - known restaurant popular with visitors , many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced , they would would not enter into restaurants and instead , they would meet friends at home .
On top that , I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable .
To support my argument , I would like to tell you what happened in my country when such a ban was introduced .
First , it was almost impossible to enforce it .
In the end , the government changed the law , encouraging people to provide non - smoking areas .
This approach strikes me as much more realistic and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late .
We will talk about a technology that might soon disturb the world .
But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything .
The manufacturing process follows three main stages : designing then producing then consuming .
For a quick glimpse , this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object .
This directly affects the producing stage , allowing more efficient production .
More efficient production means cheaper goods , and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods .
Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money .
So , let 's say , you have $ 100,000 now , you would have $ 10,000,000 fifty years from now .
You then could pay your debt , get a new car , buy a new house , invest or retire , or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $ 10,000,000 in your bank account .
Looking at it through a broader scope , country deficits would be solved , hungry people would be fed , and the homeless would get accommodated .
This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production ; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit .
With competition giving him no choice at all , the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium .
Surprisingly , the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce .
This automatic , efficient , quick , precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed , saves waste initially caused by human errors , saves time and produce at better quality too .
In conclusion , this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods , and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world .
I can still recall the day Cathy and I brought Casino to Taipei City Hall , walking him along the department store pavement , and playing with him all day long .
I am interested in applying for the job vacancy in the Cafe you run .
The reason for applying is that I believe I would be a perfect candidate as I have plenty of experience in the food business as well as I am highly interested in working for this well - known company .
I strongly believe I would be the right person for the post as I consider myself as polite , well - mannered , enthusiastic and good at dealing with customers .
Besides , working in popular restaurants enabled me to gain the ability to work as part of a team and under pressure , plus learning about a wide variety of international food and dishes .
Finally , I would like to express my willingness in working for you as this will represent such a great experience for me .
I would be able to attend an interview at any time which is convenient to you .
I am writing this letter because I would really appreciate the opportunity to work as a camp counselor .
Regarding my level of English , I speak fluent English and got an A on the Cambridge First Certificate Exam .
As for my experience with children , I have been a counselor for the last two years in a summer camp .
Furthermore , I have worked as a babysitter for the past year .
I believe I am suitable for the job as I am very enthusiastic and energetic .
I am hardworking as well .
I always try so hard to not to go to new restaurants because I do n't like most of them at first .
It was my brother 's birthday so he said if we could go to a new restaurant called Muerde La Pasta .
The restaurant is in Alcorcon . I have to say that it is a beautiful place , with a lot of beautiful lamps and a lot of space .
It 's a free buffet so you can take everything you want … there are chips , pizza , all types of pasta and then there 's a lot of desserts and there 's no food limit haha .
Honestly , I thought I would n't like the restaurant but I was completely wrong .. I loved it !
You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been to it .
And you can never really say a teacher in the mountain is miserable unless you have experienced being one .
When I knew I would be teaching at the remotest high school in Ozamiz , I said I was so unfortunate , and when I knew I would be spending my days in the mountain , I said my life would be miserable .
Indeed , negative vibes filled my thoughts after having known that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most .
My first paragraph aptly expresses my exact realization .
To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation ; I have never been unfortunate , and misery has never been my colleague .
It has taught me lessons I could n't have learned had I not been here - the lessons that do not only help me improve my teaching profession but also help me become the right person of my ministry .
As to my colleagues , I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who most of the time shares the same line of interest with me .
With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm , we always made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile .
We never settled for any mediocrity .
My personal relationship with my co - teachers is the same as that of a typical Filipino family .
I may have hurt some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance , and they may have hurt me too , but at the end of the day , it 's always camaraderie among us that dominates .
Their needs speak beyond intellectual hunger .
Every day I got to deal with students wearing different faces of life 's resentment .
As a teacher , it took me much of everything I have to come to terms to every pitiful fate of my students .
Hence , the value of UNDERSTANDING the students even beyond what the meaning of such word can express has been dramatically instilled in me .
These stories once heard , can open somebody 's heart to learn to love learners despite everything .
Consequently , I have seen the need to attend to their needs .
I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities , but I know somehow in my one year stay in Gala , I have made a difference to my students ' lives .
My everyday interaction with my students has been my everyday fulfillment .
Eventually , the huge challenge I have had has turned into my inspiration to do better in my job .
My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life , but seeing them enduring was motivating me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on .
The place , my colleagues , and my dear students are enough testimonies that in Gala I have found a home … and a family to love , really for real .
I am writing to you regarding a job advertisement I saw on yesterday 's newspaper looking for an English - speaking person to work at weekends in your cafe .
I am the right person to do the job as I have always been interested in different kinds of food .
I like trying dishes from all over the world and I am keen on cooking experimenting new exotic cuisine .
I am really interested in applying for this job because I am an outgoing person and I am good at dealing with people .
In addition to this , I have broad experience in this field since I worked as a waitress during my last summer holiday .
As a consequence I am prepared to work long hours .
I hope you will take my application into consideration because I have a great sense of responsibility and work very seriously .
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
It is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me , since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certification .
Similarly , I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms to learn English .
As I have said , I have been learning English by the sheer pleasure of it ; but , having come this far , I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition about my level .
Lots of people think , that teenagers are stupid , have a small knowledge about life , do not have enough experience , are annoying , difficult to understand .
I agree that some of young people behave really badly , they smoke , shout on their parents , drink beer , do not improve themselves .
But most of teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or erderly people .
I strongly disagree that they are not experienced .
The young person has to be strong , try to understand the situation .
Tennagers also have to make serious decisions like choosing secondary school , future job , which way they will go in their life , if they want to be in relationship with someone .
Ways to collect and record information for future generations
Finding the best way to collect and store information for the future is not just a problem in our working life but also in our private life .
That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic .
Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion .
One way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio - file .
Additionally , it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator 's mind .
Another interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs .
This is an impressive way to document a change over many years , but on the other hand it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition .
For me personally , the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way because of three reasons : Firstly , I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person but maybe two or three more .
Secondly , I can catch the the narrator'semotions .
Thirdly , I do not have to be concerned about loss of qualitiy of photographs and pictures .
After dinner , we saw an interesting show of Balinese dance and music .
Then the turtle started swimming and disappeared of our sight .
Visiting their own country certainly has its advantages .
Also , you can have the opportunity to discover new places just next to your home .
Actually , they like the idea of visiting an unknown land , where everything is different , from the weather to the habits .
Furthermore , they also like going abroad to visit important and famous cities around the world , like Paris , Madrid , New York .
In conclusion , I think it 's important to know both their own countries and foreign lands .
At that moment I thought that an accident or a similar something had happened to my family but fortunately it was n't so .
A girl was on the other side of the phone and she told me that my sister and her boyfriend were n't with the other passengers .
Unfortunately , Walter can not find the shot , so he has to look for the traveller which is not easy .
He has to travel to remote parts of the world and have some very amazing adventures .
I wo n't tell you any more as it can spoil the story , but the film is definitely worth watching .
In addition , I can say that I 'm charmed by the main character who is developing throughout the whole film .
If you like complicated stories about dreams and how to make them true , this story is definitely for you .
Free of pocket pain & frequented by the locals , there is a dining gem in Nova Gorica .
You will find there a parking area and some ball courts , and on further exploration , just after the courts & walking towards that famous bridge that you can now see much better , a restaurant .
Day , date and season dictate the ever interesting & changing menu at this restaurant .
One of Slovenia 's qualified somnelliers will help you choose from the good wine cellar , so this is the place where I recommend our class can relax , eat , drink well & enjoy the happy atmosphere .
It is called " Les Miserables " and has much to recommend it , including the plot , the cast and , of course , the soundtrack .
The film is set in France in nineteenth century .
Just after the French Revolution .
It is an adaptation from the original book " Les Miserables " by Victor Hugo .
Regarding the soundtrack , I can only say that since I saw the film I can not help singing every song all the time .
Travelling by car is becoming more convenient .
Cars are improving , becoming safer and environment friendlier .
Moreover , people have become more aware of the environment protection .
Thus , more and more people , when buying a new car , also consider its environmental friendliness and the possible impact on the community .
Also , cars get more affordable in many countries .
For example , in India nd China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars , which are also imported .
Once you know for yourself how comfortable it is to have a car , there 's very little chance you will go back to public transport .
However , there might be still room for public transport in future , especially in big cities .
I mean the underground in the first place .
It is very economical in terms of time , distance and people capacity .
Although I do n't quite like watching soap operas , I was started watching this particular show with my family .
The show was based on the journey of a married couple , living in India , who get separated due to some misunderstandings .
The couple have 4 kids and after separation , 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad .
The dad , who is a cardiologist moves to US and starts a new life there .
The father who had vowed to never look back at first ignores her requests , however , upon insistence from his other children and his sister agrees to go back to India .
The rest of the show is based on the interactions between all 4 children and how they work together to unite their family .
It 's a typical Indian soap opera in which love conquers over everything .
Although not very practical , the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and at the same time teaches the importance of women being independent and able to lead life on their own .
Innovative entrepreneurship can be perceived as a special process of creating , testing and implementing of the new products and materials , the new way of resource utilization and the new kind of management in business process to find advanced opportunities for ( non)commercial use .
The first test has shown that I am very motivated and my skills almost fit to the possibility to be an entrepreneur .
However , the attitude that I have is not very appropriate for entrepreneurship .
It is important to underline that the driving factors ( motivation ) determine behaviour of entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting .
In the motivation part I also received high score in need of challenges as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities .
Moreover , it is really important for me to be own boss even though it needs much more responsibilities .
Nevertheless , in the test I received fewer points in " need for achievement / success " than it was required for being an entrepreneur .
The first one was based on profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test .
The above - mentioned situation means that during the assessment were not taken into account other goals that entrepreneur might have .
For instance , it can be the social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or an entrepreneurship as a hobby / lifestyle .
However , the test evaluated as important feedback parents and friends opinion and I do not agree that it might be essential unless they are specialists in that field .
Nevertheless , I might take a reasonable risk in case it can positively influence business .
It is certain that each of us loves to travel , but everyone likes the most comfortable means of transport .
For me , the best way to travel is train , because I think this mode of transportation has the most pros .
If we check the prices of air travel , we can be disappointed as well as of travel by boat .
Fortunately the train tickets are cheaper .
Travelling by train is quite fast , and pleasant , I can safely travel to more places worldwide than people taking a boat or plane transport .
After the summary is to certify that travelling by train is the most advantageous , but the most important reason why I chose journey by train a fact that I have a motion sickness , and I 'm afraid to fly .
At the end of a decade in which technology has made enormous leaps , I am thinking about how much present vision of house will change in the future .
Despite many differences in the human nature , the present houses do not differ so much between themselves .
Furthermore , they have flat or sloping roofs , one or more floors .
Some are situated in the neighbourhood of parks , forests or lakes .
On the other hand , recently , more often many new and more advanced projects are realized by daring architects .
But can you imagine that in the near , unspecified future all homes will be like that ?
Built by using the most modern technology , full of the latest inventions which man can create ?
Of course , for people to live better , but it would be useful to modern houses to be constructed so as to do not damage the environment .
I think quite few scientists still surprise us , and the house of the future will go beyond the limits of our imagination .
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN
There has been major changes regarding the teaching approach in the last few years , but there is still room for improvement .
However , speaking , listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays .
The new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have .
This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners ' skills .
A grammar test shows knowledge about the language , whereas alternative assessment shows learners ' ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation .
There are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take responsibility , motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes .
It is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers , since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods .
In conclusion : The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain .
The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently .
However , a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education - related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years .
The Japanese government made a competition to see which of their citizens was the best trend - setter .
Once the day was over , the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damages done , but it was impossible .
Everyone was happy for some time and true peace between the countries of the world had been achieved , but then the United States enslaved Canada and tried to enslave Japan as well , but they were able to defend themselves .
This movie can be considered a classical thriller , but with several aspects that makes it unique in this gender .
First of all , the historical period is the victorian age in France .
Landscapes are really wonderful .
The buildings , dresses , and habits of population are displayed in full detail .
Secondly , we have and amazing script that can be considered unique .
The story tell us the importance of the perfume in all aspects of our lifes .
We will discover the importance of a unique fragrance and how to mix the ingredients in the right proportions .
This idea will create the atmosphere to tell us a story about crime and passion .
Nevertheless this is not an all audiences movies , because it contains hard scenes not suitable for children .
Few other modern movies are so great in comparison .
The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport .
Apart from that , there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day .
First of all , an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy .
Additionally , if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life , it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars .
Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city .
Thus , it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages .
On the other hand , we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car .
Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon .
It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport .
Generally , bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones , therefore , accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely .
This makes travelling by public transport much safer .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own .
She went downstairs to the cosy bathroom and had a shower .
Anna was a bit stressed , but she was sure , that everything will be alright .
Anna looked incredibly beautiful .
Her mum came to her and hugged her really affectionately . "
My all - time favourite sport is basketball .
I started playing at the age of seven , when my mother encouraged me to join a basketball club .
It was very enjoyable from the onset , and has been a fantastic experience to learn the sport together with other children .
Another key factor was the coach , who knew how to convey the skills and techniques to children .
Moreover , I was fascinated by the feeling of belonging to a team in which each member shares the same goals and values .
One also learns to work hard and disciplined in order to achieve success .
All these points led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I 'm still hooked by it .
If someone would ask me for advice on how to start playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a trial practise and if the person enjoys it , he / she can join the club .
When choosing a club , I believe it 's important that an experienced coach is present who knows how to teach the basics .
Yours faithfully ,
One of my favorite restaurants in Málaga is called Sun and Shine .
It is a different kind of restaurant , because you can find not only the typical Spanish food , also dishes from different parts of the world .
What I like most of this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food , the flavor is fantastic , the food very tasty and carefully cooked .
On the other hand the surroundings are modern , the place is airy and cosy .
The waiters are very welcoming and informative so you feel very comfortable .
All the ingredients are very fresh and of the highest quality .
Finally I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled .
I 'd like to thank you for the lovely experience you offered me .
Unfortunately we did n't get the chance to see each other that night .
I suppose you 'd like to hear about my experience .
I started the evening by welcoming everyone and appointing them their seats .
They were such nice people and really appreciated my help .
All in all a great experience ! You can rely on my help next year !
Thanks again for the lovely experience !
welcome to the historic town of Lancaster!You are now in the vibrating heart of Lancashire .
However , the city centre also offers just as much opportunities for you to go shopping .
Whether you want a fancy bottle of wine , a secondhand wedding dress or an antique clock you will find it in Lancaster .
You are offered the standard big brands like M&S , Next , Waterstones and others , but you can also find little private shops selling all types of goods .
From soldiers who served in the trenches of France to the ceremonial functions in the nation 's Capital .
Nathan Cirillo is remembered as one of those soldiers .
A member of The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada , he was killed at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in October 2014 .
One year later a commemoration of his passing was celebrated .
Unarmed , at attention , and protecting the memory of those who gave the ultimate sacrifice , his last moments and those who came to his assistance , exemplify the true meaning of being Canadian .
I am writing in reply to your advertisement in the European Observer of April 7th for a post at USA Summer Camp .
I am aged 44 , of Austrian nationality , married and hold the Cambridge English Advanced certificate since last summer .
I would welcome an opportunity to work in the USA this summer in order to practise my English .

I am also experienced with children , having looked after my sister 's daughters aged 9 , 11 and 14 for years now .
In the evenings , singing , dancing and torchlight walks are a good alternative to watching TV .
Further , I worked as an au - pair in France and Canada , where I watched over 3 , respectively , 2 children .
I look forward to your reply at your earliest convenience .
In the growing " sharing " economy , online communities are offering peer to peer for almost anything .
One of my favourite is eatwith.com .
Second , you choose a menu and make a reservation .
On the other hand , if you are a professional or an amateur chef , you 'll earn an extra money .
There 's nothing like share a meal with local people , it offers you the possibility to glean from someone who lives in the place .
The wedding of my niece was celebrated in Barcelona last weekend .
When we arrived in Barcelona we went by taxi to the hotel , which my brother had previously booked , and there we met with other relatives : my brother , his wife , my nephews and of course my niece ( the bride ) .
We all went together to have lunch to a nearby restaurant .
The marriage ceremony took place at a wonderful church , there were flowers everywhere , live music , three hundred guests and of course , the bride and the bridegroom , the most beautiful and happy couple I have ever seen as far as I can remember .
The party was held in a large garden near the bridegroom 's fathers ' house .
Taking a break between leaving school and starting college seems unnecessary .
Terrorism is everywhere .
Not many of us are going to risk our lives , especially when we all know we are going to have a fresh start in college .
However , for those who really need to fork out money to pay college loans , it is best for them to take a year off and work part time at a cafe , or somewhere remotely interesting .
What if they forget themselves ?
What if drugs , alcohol , cigarettes took over their lives ?
Look , they are still very young and they are all prone to bad influences through parties without parental control .
There is absolutely no time to waste your youth on drugs and alcohol .
One day in the post , I had an argument with a man who studied in the same university as me , and I challenged him to fight with me : I thought it would solve the problem between us .
After that he told the teacher who was responsible for that class , and called me into her room and asked me questions .
This story tells us that sometimes we can not control ourselves , but we should be alone and think positively or take a deep breath , and these will make us calm down .
I am Brazilian and I started to learn how to write in Portuguese when I was 7 years old .
I think this period when we start to write is magical , because we can access an entire new communication world .
This experience was very important and made me more confident about my English skills .
Back to Brazil , during college I started researching and writing about economics .
I had to write a dissertation and a thesis and , I will not lie , these writing processes were very hard , but I learned a lot about academic writing .
Today , I work as an economics professor at the Federal University of Goias , in Brazil .
Because of my work , I have to write all the time to my students , to my colleagues and to the academic community in general .
I want to discuss the results of my research with everyone that is interested in it , from Brazil or from any other place in the world .
I expect that this course will help me develop my English skills , so that I can write my papers , communicate and discuss my research in more effective way .
In modern world , public transport become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient . Travelling by car also reduces their time of journey and they do n't need to wait for a particular bus .
It may also because as people are getting richer they do n't need to go for a public transport as more comfortable option is always there waiting for them .
Though public transport is more advantageous to the environment , people just want to get their personal needs satisfied .
While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with modernized vehicles , public transport may not seems to be a better choice .
More usage of vehicles may cause serious problems such as depletion of natural resources and environmental issues such as pollution .
Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive , it does not stop people from using cars since convenience matters to them the most and not money .
If it continues , no resource will be spared for the future generation .
On the other hand , the most important advantage of studying abroad would be precisely , the exposure , which would help you understand the language from native speakers ' point of view and be aware of how some expressions or words are actually used .
However , as a disadvantage , we must consider the cost of studying abroad , because it can be rather expensive .
To sum up , the best way of learning English , or rather the best place to do it depends on each person 's means and learning style , but definitely it is possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad .
Moreover , it is the sombrest day in a year , which recalls people the Crucifixion caused by people 's sins .
Accordingly , the author compares the Easter to a pagan spring festival , where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christians 's cheerfulness of the Resurrection .
2 . We flinch from consideration of Good Friday because we do not like thinking of a sad situation .
People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about a death , a suffering and a self - sacrifice .
Today people are not willing to sacrifice themselves for other people .
Everyone is individual and worries about themselves , because it is easier way to live .
4 . The author mentions the origin of the word ' compassion ' , in order to remind people the meaning of that word .
Nevertheless , people make this compassion tided away , because it is too painful for them to stand that .
Not only they run away from uncomfortable situations but they also prefer to see them on screens .
Actually , they choose the Good Life , because they can not cope with their own suffering without cultural understanding .
Maybe it was because I was with my friends and I could find many ways to spend my time with them or it could also be the great environment .
When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms . I was sharing a room with my friend Emily .
Television is one of the most important inventions of the last century since it has had a great impact on societies around the world .
Since Television was first invented , it has influenced different aspects of people 's lives .
Since Television was launched to the market it has acquired other purposes besides entertaining , such as communicating and advertising , that is way the possibility of it having educational purposes has been widely discussed .
Television can certainly educate , it has great potential for doing so because of the way it presents information and the scope of people it can achieve .
Television can educate in several ways , to mention some : by providing and extending information given in certain curses at school , and by providing information that is not even taught at school .
It is very exciting that entertainment and education can be merged for accomplishing the spread of knowledge along the masses in an enjoyable way .
Television can educate through content whose main purpose at first was entertaining .
Television series , contests , movies , and news which do it all the time without us being aware of it .

My favorite sport is Football , but it is not a sport that I like to practise it 's a sport to watch because it 's beautiful , very cool and very exciting to support a team in a championship .
I love it when this event happens , so many incredible games going on , best players of the world , three games per day at the start , and with very good looking players .
I do n't know what exactly happens but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes , everybody gets happier , Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers , people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody 's house .
I love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems , or just show us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects , a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums , with shameful delays in their construction , etc .
You just need a pair of running shoes and clothes appropriate for the weather .
In winter I go to run for half an hour in the afternoons , but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather .
It started a few years ago when I was a little overweight .
After three months , I was running faster and the pain in my heels disappeared .

Her intelligence in young age was a Problem for her teacher Miss Caroline , because never had such a well - educated pupil before .
Instead of celebrating it , she somhow inhibits Scouts learning .
Furthermore Scout often reacts very impulsive , mostly in young age .
She goes after Walter Cunningham after she gets in trouble on his behalf .
Later on Scout begins to understand , not least because of her father and brother , that it is important to think before talking .
On the one hand Scout acts very impulsive and is an obstreperous tomboy but on the other hand she is very clever and more adult than others in her age .
I 'm very glad I can finally do something for you after everything you 've done for me .
So you need information about my country 's eating customs ?
On weekdays , Dutch people take their breakfast , which usually consists of a few sandwiches , somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the weekend , we tend to sleep in and therefore take our breakfast a bit later .
Around 12.00 a.m. , most people have lunch , which also consists of sandwiches and is just as light as breakfast .
Let me also tell you something about traditional Dutch meals .
The most important ones are probably hotchpotches : mashed potatoes and vegetables , often combined with smoked sausage .
In my opinion , some of them are absolutely revolting .
A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty , consists of little thick pancakes , served warm with melted butter and icing sugar .
Those pancakes are called " poffertjes " .
Whole generations are brought up with this dish , yummy as it is .
Is this enough information for your project ?
If you want to know more about Dutch eating habits , just write to me , and I 'll write back , giving you any other information you might need .
My favourite way to travel is most definitely by plane .
First , on a plane , I can get to my destination much faster .
In a few hours time , I can get to some far - away destination .
I definitely do n't recommend it .
Therefore , when it comes to speed and being able to go places , planes are definitely the best type of transportation available .
In today 's intercultural world , one of the best assests people and nations can have is tolerance and a deep appreciation of cultural values different from their own .
No wonder most training includes intercultural communication and cultural awareness courses .
However , it is probably a truism that reading about or watching films about a country are only pale subsitutes to actually going to visit a place and experiencing the differences yourself .
And the longer you stay in a place different from what you are accustomed to , the more opportunities you have to really understand what makes people behave a certain way , what they really like and dislike and how their community works .
No one in the neighborhood had a clue of what was about to happen in the next few hours .
All of a sudden there was a loud voice that echoed through the neighborhood , and one can almost imagine the silence shattering like a glass .
Not knowing where the sound had come from , they were pulling out smartphones from their robes and jamming their fingers on the screen .
Almost all of them were heard shouting in panic " There has been a terrorist attack in our neighborhood " .
He was in disbelief , flabbergasted , never expecting that the person living next door would do something so heinous .
So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula , that does not implicate that he is a terrorist .
Not knowing what would be the intellectual thing to do , the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police .
After briefing the call respondent about every detail that he had known about Rasheed .
Sprinted towards what seemed like flames , only to find Rasheed standing across it , blood protruding from his right hand .
Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed he quietly returned to his house .
Whenever there is a possibility to buy a new item , one should follow it .
Sufficient to say , buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time .
Shopping without purchasing anything tends to be exhausting .
There is also a possibility of buying unnecessary items .
Nonetheless , the value of time is as important as money .
The main reason for this is the fact that free time could be spent in a more sophisticated way .
Obviously , shopping for food is not equivalent to purchasing garments .
The article " Stairways to Heaven : Gothic Architecture , Heavy Metal , and the Aesthetics of Transcendence " is an unparallelled one in terms of the discussion it evokes .
The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for the Gothic architecture , and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article .
In order to explain the nature of the Gothic architecture and its major aspects , the author efficiently employs the musical analogies .
One of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one , as it employs the parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to .
Furthermore , he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music .
For example , the purpose of both is to induce awe and , they both employ the concepts of distortion ( Bork 1 ) .
What is more , these styles usually tend to abandon the classical tendencies , and both rose in a response to a new demand in the culture .
The public transport system is overburdened today .
The trains and buses are crowded , and newer routes and not reflecting the changing demand .
Mass production has made cars more affordable to the middle class in recent years .
Also , the increase in disposable income has given more buying power to consumers .
Further , after you board off the train , you again have to find your way to your destination by either walking or using another mode of transport .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Her cherry red face glistened vigorously in the golden brown sunset like a perfectly baked pastry , as the last of the sun 's rays beamed down over the horizon .
Finally , after a few minutes of walking , Alison approached a tree .
It jumped around ferociously as if everything was just a game and that is when Alison realised things were now so much better than before ...
Winter is one of my favorites because it is so beautiful to see everything covered with a white sheet of snow .
Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer , temperatures are not too cold and not to hot .
You are comfortable wearing a light jacket outside instead of a heavy warm coat .
Relaxing in the pool on a floating lounge chair enjoying cold lemonade is the ultimate experience .
Autumn is also a great season because of all the colorful leaves falling even though they are a hassle to pick up , especially in the pools .
When you drive by the neighborhoods you notice that families are all gathered in some kind of celebration .
My name is Natalia Maciejewska Quiñónez and I am a citizen of Castellón .
Recently , things have been disappearing from our homes .
I would also like you to talk to the police department , because the police have to do their job and make sure we are all safe , not to ignore us and say that everything is fine when everything is wrong .
I conpeted in singing competitions when I was younger and I took acting classes .
When I was taking a walk through the neighbourhood I saw this poster about the musical wicked and they were looking for someone to play the lead .
Of course I took this opportunity and two weeks later I had to do audition .
Many people still consider television only as a way to relax , get entertained and stop thinking about all the problems that might worry them .
It is also important , though , not to underestimate all the educational possibilities that it gives you , as sometimes you can learn more from a documentary than from a school book .
What emerged from the discussion we had in class , is that plenty of students spend their free time watching useless reality or TV shows , procrastinating instead of studying for school .
As it is a very common phenomenon between teenagers , schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new .
A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills , and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable .
Getting distracted is extremely likely , therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel , as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing .
Had I choose whether considering television educational or not , I would definitely say it is .
Nevertheless , we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what is the sources of the information told during a tv show , as they might be misleading .
I 'm sure that you wo n't be disappointed with town I live in because there is a lot to see !
I 'm really into showing you all the interesting places around .
To my mind , you 're probably totally exhausted because of travel and those few first days when you had to get to know new surroundings .
So , as you asked me , I 'll give you proposal of an interesting place to visit where you could take a rest and relax .
There is also quite big concert hall where , if you have luck , you can enjoy some interesting concerts ( in general for free ) .
when I saw your advertisement I instantly thought that I would like to work in one of your summer camps .
My name is Seraina Fennstermacher , I live in Switzerland at the moment , although I grew up in the U.S. I have two children myself , and I always liked working with children .
Since I used to work as a secretarian I feel capable of organizing sports and evening activities , if you choose to let me do so .
After this short description of myself I would just like to say that I have only heard good things about your summer camps from my relatives in the U.S. , so it would be my pleasure to work for you .
Yours faithfully ,
Seraina Fennstermacher
People were counting on this party to increase public expenditure , but pension 's money have stayed the same .
People really need these improvements and you only gave them fake hopes .
One of the most disappointing topics is that you played down the situation we are living and the necessities people has .
We were told this party would speak out against corruption , but now it is your own policy , and promises seem they were a bad joke .
Fortunately , we discovered the real policy this party has and is really coming under fire .
People are noticing your promises are not going to be made and I am sure there will be plenty of people complaining about the lack of true in your promises .
Yours faithfully ,
Line of Duty is a British police drama , created by Jed Mercurio , about the investigations of AC-12 , a controversial Police Anti - Corruption Unit .
A large list of characters appears through the episodes , being the common thread that connects the two seasons the regular ones : Martin Compston ( as DS Steve Arnott ) , Vicky McClure ( as DC Kate Fleming ) and Adrian Dunbar ( as PSupt Ted Hastings ) .
Therefore , the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott , a high - flying counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover - up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken shot by another cop .
He 's one of AC-12 's leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sways his professional judgement .
Fleming plays his partner 's part , an AC-12 's undercover specialist , who prides herself on being the consummate professional , unmoved by emotional considerations .
Both of them share superior , Hastings , who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer ; zealous and suspicious , not being everyone 's cup of tea .
Even though being widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards , he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances .
Their scenes are repeatedly stolen , though , by the real stars of the show , the officers who are under suspicion of corruption : Lennie James ( DCI Tony Gates ) in the first season , and Keeley Hawes ( DI Lindsay Denton ) in the second one .
With calculated precision , the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies , and throws in a few twists and turns that makes your mouth drop -indeed , Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethics principles and nevertheless , he 's adored by his loyal team , has got a nice family and has recently been awarded " Officer of the Year " .
To conclude , those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry ; line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write third and fourth series and if you haven't tried it before , you 've just about got time to catch up .
Were you a UK tourist coming to Switzerland for a short weekend break fifteen years ago you would have found yourself in a situation that no shops would have Sunday opening hours .
But the situation is completely different now !
Now you can shop on Sundays although your shopping spree still will be limited to Zurich railway station and the airport , not to mention some limited choice of simple foods at occasional motorway services .
But it is an improvement to say the least !
Although the size of an average supermarket in Switzerland will still remind you of a medium size village shop , there has been improvement there as well !
We can see now international brands we are used to in the UK .
Not a good experience for ill - hearted !
If you have strong neves , do your window shopping in Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich .
She immediately noticed that the glass was broken , probably shattered in pieces by those boys who invited her to play with them at the mansion .
She was just about to open the door to check the inside when suddenly a scream echoed from the house , the door slammed open and the group started running at full speed chased by four big spiders who just discovered that their home had just been occupied .
Sarah peeked through the door and immediately realized the evil intentions of the group . "
Usuallly he was energetic , full of confidence , ready to party .
She had fought to hard for this life and she would not let their long - standing relationship to be ruined just like that .
He had never worked but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remembered their names .
" Are you having a mistress?",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast .
" That is impossible ! What would our friends say ?
And where I would put my wine collection ? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house "
They definitely had different idea of poverty .
However all people in his neighborhoor feared him because of his past .
In this way , he moved to his new neigborhood where everybody respected him .
Their relationship had been excellent since first time that they had met each other and two months later they decided to become lovers .
Although his life was perfect , he began to feel sick and sad and he remembered his past life when he was a child .
Finally their relationship broke up and Michael fell in his illness deeper than ever .
At that moment everything changed , he reminded his childhood , his recovery and his sane life , then Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
In my opinion public transport is doomed , because travelling by car is much more convenient and at the same time the easiest way to reach any destination you wish to get to .
On the one hand , public transport is slow and uncomfortable .
People have to sit next to other people they do n't know for a long time , in other words , you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers .
Pickpockets are frequent and you might end up being robbed , losing your money , credit cards and personal ID card as well .
On the other hand travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace , even when you travel to a place you do not know so well .
Furthermore , you can choose an alternative road , rather than taking a main road .
This way you will have the chance to have more relaxing journey through the countryside , traffic will not be so intense and aggressive , and finally you can plan the time you want to arrive , using a GPS or other technolology to help you plan your journey .
To sum up , travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town , but when you have to travel outside your specific territorry , nothing is better than a car .
Well on this particular morning , Michael seem to be getting along quite well , he appeared to be energetic and very vibrant that particular morning .
His attention to detail appeared to be trust worthy and correct , and normally his attention to detail is not something that is challenged because of how reliable he is .
Well the days responsibilities in Michael 's mind had been successfully accomplished and he felt really confident about all he had accomplished .
Needless to say Michael could n't have been any more deceived than he had realized , because the unfortunate thing is that when he was doing his walk through on all of his department the inventory that was supposed to be submitted was in fact inaccurate .
I know you are under a lot of pressure because of your final exams and I can really understand how you are feeling right now , buried in a mountain of books and notes , with no free time for other things or just relax .
You should forget fast food like McDonald 's hamburgers !
To answer this question , the first thing to consider is if young people really have sincere values , or on the contrary , if they are only simple copies of a current model of a fake society which imposes unattainable stereotypes on them .
Nevertheless , far from arrogance and vanity , we can still find some young people who have interesting personal values that are used by them to define their lifestyle .
Some values such as solidarity and empathy , that were believed lost , can appear surprisingly in the personality traits of many young people today .
In addition , these personal values joined others such as courage , curiosity , imagination and the sense of adventure , are important aspects to consider and they can become very effective weapons to change the world if they are used suitably .
Considering all this , nowadays it is socially important a development in positive values among young people such as respect and tolerance to create honest adult people .
The 21st century has given a new meaning to the word Friendship .
From what evolved as a comradeship between 2 people based on acquaintance , mutual interest and companionship it has moved forth to relationships where people have not even met one another physically .
Today with technology friends are made at a click of a key be it on social media or mobile devices .
Friendship was nurtured and we took time to do activities with friends and best friends were limited to one or two of the closest associates .
Friendship stood the test of time and grow stronger with disagreements fights and misunderstanding , all being resolved and forgotten in the name of friendship .
Today a minute incident can just tear apart a friendship .
Today friendships are take take take and very few stand the test of time .
Friendship today is friend or friends for each season and reason while friendship of the past has been whatever the situation or time a friend stands through .
I 'm 24 years old , so I belong to the previous generation , when family , school and life in general worked in a different way , from my point of view .
However , this does n't mean that my parents , especially when I was a child , always told me " yes " and made me do whatever I wanted to .
On the contrary , I grow up with many " no " , and I do not always agree with them in different situations .
For nowadays I see around me kids who are pleased in everything by their parents : they buy them whatever they want , and behave as " friends " .
This does n't mean that parents should keep themselves distant from their son ; on the contrary , a son should talk to his family , asking for advice or just to confront each other , because communication is at the base of relationships of every kind .
The miracle is an extraordinarily large resort .
The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club has on the daily life in the hotel .
You can find Kids Club 's Members everywhere in the hotel , except for your room .
The hotel handles privacy very well and I can guess most of the guests will appreciate it .
In conclusion , the Miracle Resort is a very beautiful and appealing place to go .
A more compact building would be more appreciated by most of the people .
So a lot of them go abroad in order to find a good job in better conditions .
Unfortunately , my girlfriend and I need to do it too .
I have finished my degree and my girlfriend is just about to do it .
Our plan is to go to Birmingham with my cousin Daniel who has been living there for 3 years and to stay with him just the time we need until we can find a job and a place to spend there tree months because we must return in October .
As I said before , the main objective is finding a job there , gaining some experience and improving our English level .
I think that it would be quite easy for Montse to find a job but I am quite worried about my opportunities .
If I am lucky I would apply for an interesting job , but I think that I will apply for a normal job such as barman , working on a factory , etc .
If everything goes as expected and we both find a job , we will visit the city of London .
Most of the students at Laura 's new school do not talk to her they are a little bit too cautious about interacting with her .
Frustrated Laura accepted her new life of solitude outside of the secret society of the others .
He thought that this was very brave but he had not enough confidence to tell her that .
" Sense8 " is a new kind of television series that has grasped the attention of millions of viewers from the first episode .
This TV series is presented by Netflix , an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show , anywhere , and in any device .
The first difference when compared to ordinary TV Shows is that all episodes from Season One were released at the same time .
This seems like a small thing but it represents a major change in the way people view TV shows .
The series provides an unorthodox view into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit .
This connection allows them to see through each other eyes , and even control each other movements .
In order to make the series more interesting , the directors decided that each of the eight chosen ones would be in a different country .
This decision made the series extraordinary , with scenes recorded in Seoul , Nairobi , San Francisco , Mumbai , London , Berlin , Mexico and Chicago .
The series provides an amazing window into eight different , and extraordinary worlds , with beautiful landscapes .
To sum up , I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science - fiction , but also to anyone curious about different cultures as " Sense8 " provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters , their surroundings , religion , and traditions .
To be honest , in the questionnaire you send , I could give a positive response to the most of the questions but I do n't consider myself a code expert .
I could n't answer , in particular , the questions about PHP and MySQL .
In JavaScript I have some experience but not in the necessary quality that is required for such a position , I think .
If I have to , I search the web for information and implement it but it requieres time .
Perhaps is there some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity .
I am very interested in multilingual jobs , with German , Spanish , English and Italian , related to marketing , IT web - analytics , Customer service ...
Do n't hesitate to contact me if you have some offer that you think could fit with my background .
I 'm always open to new interesting suggestions .
Why is it that whenever Ina Garten , Ana Olson or Nigella Dawson is on , I tend to stop everything that I 'm doing and just get fixated on the TV ?
It 's so relaxing and very informative , I never get bored .
Cheesecake for me is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to outline some aspects of my experience , such as , with whom I stayed , where I spent the week and what places I visited .
I will also make reference to some suggestions that might help to improve the exchange programme .
Particularities of the exchange
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students exchange programme .
His name is John , and like me he is getting a degree in Phisics Engeneering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center , such as CERNE , convinientely placed a few miles away from his house .
I strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest free loans , available to people wishing to participate in an exchange .
This would allow considerable numbers of talented students to benefit from an opportunity which they would otherwise be unable to take .
Before addressing the question of what is better for young people , I would like to remind that both activities ( spending time on a computer and watching television ) are harmful for children's / teen 's health .
At the other side it 's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television .
With the help of computers young people can meet new friends , find out a lot of information , take part in forums and discussions .
Surfing the Internet needs imagination , logical thinking and knowledge .
Young people are able to choose what they want to watch / read / listen to , and the choice is practically unlimited .
Television ca n't give such an opportunity .
And the idea that , spending time in Internet 's chats young people develop their social skills , is problematic .
But getting used to the Internet 's rules of comunication , they might find it difficult to face up to reality , make friends in the real world .
This restaurant is recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner of this restaurant a few years ago .
This restaurant specializes in southeast Asian cuisine and it is called The Chai .
Personally , what I love about this restaurant is the ambiance .
Besides that , this restaurant is located in the heart of one of the most popular cities in southeast Asia , Kuala Lumpur .
I was blown away by the breathtaking view of the city from my window .
From my experience , I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality not to mention how delicious the food is .
Not only that , I was lost for choices as I flipped the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranges from Thai food , Indonesian food , Chinese food and the list goes on .
The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the ones in the menu .
In my opinion , I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
But if you know how to deal with your nervousity during exam period , you can take the success of passing exams for granted .
Place it in the most visible and strategical point in your room and stick up to it .
Speaking of mental and physical health , you should definitely get enough sleep .
Without a mind and body regeneration , you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest .
The more oxygen you get for your organism , the easier you will be able to concentrate on anything you do .
Communication is one of the biggest problems among today 's teenagers .
The telephone was convenience , something used to help people communicate , to make their lives easier .
Today , the Internet is one of the most effective and efficient ways to communicate .
Telephones changed , technology became smarter and allows people to stay connected everywhere they go .
Although the large number of advantages that Internet and phones give to us , the use of technology affect people 's ability to communicate face to face .
We communicate through our accounts , emails or chats .
The worst thing is that people do n't know how to talk to each other , how to make conversation with new people or even though old friends .
Nowadays communication face to face is something rare and most of the times accident .
I will give you some information that should help you during your stay here .
There are't many guidebooks about my city so I will recommend you a place worth seeing .
The most interesting place is the Park of Tradition , opened last year .
In the centre of the park there is a shaft which is The shaft is beautifully illuminated at night .
There is also a building which can be considered as an interacive museum .
In a very interesting way you can find somehing about the history of Siemianowice and about mines .
What impress me the most is a combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks .
There is also a cafe which serves traditional Silesian cuisine .
During summer park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events .
Basketball- the best sport ever !
I 'm sure you 'll agree with the fact that basketball is a good sport for the body and soul too .
As well as being a great way to stay fit basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player .
That 's why basketball is my favourite sport and it should be yours too !
If you are thinking that you should do some sports , you would really enjoy playing basketball .
Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as a few as two people even if the official games of basketball require 10 people .
I think that you should start practicing this sport because it helps you physically and mentally and it is a good way to socialize .
After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents ' life , not him , Marianne - for life or leaving and start fresh , he has finally chosen the latter , thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment .
But now , every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself , making second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not .
He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he had with Marianne .
He had taken her out to a five - star restaurant , to which she insisted that it was too much , which got Michael to insist that it was okay .
But all awkwardness aside , it ended with a first kiss .
A few weeks later saw the occurrence of their first fight .
Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home , which made Marianne completely furious ; throwing things to the wall , crashing plates from the counter to the ground , the whole nine yards .
A week later , he found that Marianne was cheating on him with a European businessman he did n't have the mind to remember the name of .
It was the unofficial end of the relationship , the decision before the actual talk .
Secondly , many people argue that the society has experienced a great changes in the family life .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Just to make everything worse , on his way to the office , he slipped on the snow and fell on his back .
Peter got there and had to take practically all of his clothes off because the office was like an oven .
You lost your flight and it was a business trip!You're going to get fired ! "
The first episode aired in 1963 and since then Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci - fi TV shows on television .
Actually , last year was its 50th anniversary and to celebrate it a special episode in 3D was broadcast .
It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor , it appeared in the news , in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it .
However , I really liked experiencing that because I had never seen the media in Spain pay so much attention to a TV show .
If we had stayed more time we would have been able to spend more time at the shop but anyway , I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop .
Actually , I 'm one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one , as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role .
Anyway , before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor 's role , the fans had started making suppositions about who could act as him .
Thanks to it I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourites TV shows .
I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention , also I like it because the plot is incredible , something that happened on season one can be connected with some of the last episodes .
I am writing to apply for the job in summer camps which was advertised in the USA newspaper last week .
As I am studying physical education , I have a lot of experiences of looking after children .
Last year a group of little kids came to university and we had to taught them several games and outdoor activities - thanks to this project , I am able to organise entertaining sports and activities .
I would be able to start immediately .
I hope you will consider my application - I can be contacted by email at any time .
Yours faithfully , Julieta .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
She 's been talking to him plaintively to put him to sleep , reading him the same old tatty paperback book with one fairy tale only .
Most if not all of inhabitants of this planet would answer ' yes ' .
Last century provided us countless opportunities to be more mobile .
We , humans , can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical first time in all our history .
There are still borders , both on maps and in minds for us to overcome , but the situation has changed drastically in a century or less .
Of course , most of westerners already were able to imagine the Globe with relative accuracy , but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours .
By ' shades ' I mean not real colors , but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes in touch with .
China and India were almost of the same accessibility for the ordinary carpenter from Edinburgh as they were for his predecessor five centuries ago .
- Nelson Mandela I believe that education is important and it is able to bring about enormous changes to an individual .
That 's why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences for being a teacher in my future pathway .
From these experiences , I discovered that teaching people will never be an effortless job .
As a teacher , I have to be considerate , unbiased , trustworthy and decisive .
I have to try my best to take care of all students and to ensure that the contents are accessible for them .
I have gained a lot from these experiences .
Moreover , I had also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest on 2015 .
Although I was not able to attain any awards in the competition , I gained a lot of public speaking skills from the competition .
These experiences were tremendously memorable to me and it was my honor to take part in these events .
Apart from that , as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communications between people , I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself .
Starting from F3 , I learnt Korean and I attained level 5 in TOPIK ( Test of Proficiency in Korean ) .
Learning languages is indeed difficult and painstaking .
Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me , it can also bring me satisfaction and gratification .
It is my aspiration to devote my time to the study of English and education .
I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages in the university .
It has been my life goal to become an English teacher in order for me to make contributions to our society .
Therefore , I have always been willing to be offered the chance to take and English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal .
I hope that I can be one of the candidates you find suitable for your university .
In the first place , it seems to me that it is really important , both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules .
However , it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone , and proper times to learn .
Of course , we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but , mostly , whenever we need .
Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then , have a bit of distraction when they are not there and , what is more , keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need .
That is why I totally agree with Richardson 's modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondly , I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes , and what is more , with Richardson 's facing this issue .
Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives , so we should incorporate it to our habits .
Of course , when we are talking about children and education , it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages .
For instance , it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms .
However , teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there , and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective , as you say in one of your paragraphs : " The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk " .
As I said , it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents , so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need .
Apart from that , I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom , but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective .
Technology and , mostly , mobile phones are part of children and parents lives , so schools do n't have to ban it , but look for alternatives in order that they do n't make a negative effect in education .
Richardson 's methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more , and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue .
Yours faithfully ,
This report aims to present different advertising strategies for our products according to the type of customers we have .
In addition , I will recommend the best kind of advertising for our needs .
First , to have a successful campaign it is important to know the target market .
After studying our advertising options , it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose .
One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks .
As I mentioned above , advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market .
I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us .
In conclusion , we have different options for this campaign .
If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product I can assure you that we will succeed .
Now things have changed : parents work full time and do not take up a lot of their children who are more and more alone and uncontrolled .
When home is empty , teenagers feel free to spend all the time lying on the couch , playing videogames or watching awful programmes on TV .
At the same time they gorge themselves with every kind of food they find in the refrigerator .
A sedentary life style and a poor diet lead of course to overweight .
This is a common issue : in fact juvenile obesity is increasing with bad consequences such as premature diabetes or a permanent disease .
For those people who want to combine fun and health , a good solution could be the running , which is a free , competitive and complete sport .
In Milan the association Runners from Mars welcomes thousands of runners who compete for charity .
One day dreant that I were a millionaire , I bought a huge detached house surrounded by tall trees in a beautiful city , maybe in a city like Seville .
Downstairs , there would be 5 bedrooms with big beds , 2 bathrooms , one of them with a Jacuzzi , a beautiful kitchen with an American fridge ( one of those that have 2 big doors ) and a table in the center , where I could eat with my family , and a pleasant living room with two or three large sofas .
Upstairs , there would be games room where I could play with my nephews , nieces and my daughter , another bathroom , a little office to work and to study English , and finally a huge room called " the cinema - room " , with several comfortable seats and a giant screen where my friends and I could see our favourite films .
I think I would be a suitable person for the job as I love organising activities for the little ones and spending time with them as well as preparing different types of meals .
Three years ago , I was working as a Spanish teacher in a boarding Australian school .
At the weekends , I carried on a workshop on leisure activities for children in need .
In that place , we worked as part of an incredible team that organised different activities each weekend .
The experience was great and since then I 've always wanted to have the experience of working again in an English speaking country .
Yours faithfully , Andrea .
The human race began from the jungle where he lived amidst the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees and now the journey of human race has come to the same scenario where once again , he is living amidst the fears of wild beasts called ' other humans ' and under the ' illusionary protection ' of stalwart buildings that may either collapse due to an earthquake or a terrorist - attack .
This is the world of globalisation where the entire world is one market .
Every person is marketing himself ; is selling himself ; is presenting himself as a decorated gift - item .
This is why , although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under our feet because of internet , we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge .
With knowledge and information , things become comprehensible but more complex .
The religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world .
It , today , has millions of followers who believe in its philosophy that reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied - up because of the constant pull of the strings of his past lives .
Interestingly , Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements , for they have constructed machines that exhibit the working of brains through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to his worries .
They were simple yet profound , relying on the comprehensible philosophies of forgiveness and karma .
Scientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions , however , ironically , it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology .
Likewise , there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who time and again circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation ( illuminati , for instance ) that runs the world secretly and plots for all the pre - timed wars and terrorist - attacks .
The theorists ascertain that the organisation is part religious and part political ; it rules over the international media , thereby being omnipotent .
Furthermore , they concoct stories and concepts , publicise them while making animated versions all over the internet .
The brilliance of their presentations is so acute that an ordinary man is almost forced to feel enlightened in his ignorance , finally becoming brainwashed .
The same technique is used by politicians , iconoclasts and leaders who pollute the minds of the people through the medium of technology .
They present complex informations so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk , whence he becomes the follower and a voter .
Thus , by all means , today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to allocate and obtain endless information .
Nevertheless , there is a stomach - wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes a common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being - exploited life .
First , it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other .
They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations .
Second , it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus .
In daily life , many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation .
In other words , if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on .
In conclusion , it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure , but also help them become independent young adults .
I am writing in response to your advertisement on the noticeboard in our language school inviting applications for the post of Club organiser .
I am forty years old secondary school teacher of Art and I believe I have qualifications that you may be looking for . I have been teaching students for approximately 15 years .
I enjoy partcipating in debates .
I would describe myself as a good listener and fluent speaker with strong ability to control the discussion .
If you would like to take my appliciation further than I would be pleased to hear from you .
Yours faithfully ,

Entertainment and food
Not only does River Boat Disco has its own experienced DJ , but it also has a buffet which is more then appropriate for this occasion .
Although Milford Comedy Club offers a fun night with four established comedians , the only food available is snacks .
However the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early at 10:30 pm , whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
The pricing for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue , entertainment and food for $ 25 .
Even though the price is $ 5 smaller for comedy club , it is without food and by the end of the night I do not think there would be much difference .
It would be possible to organize a bus , which would be preferable to going separately by car .
However the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi .
Recommendation
" Manjiare Di Roma " - An Italian Restaurant
This Italian restaurant is in Monção and near the school .
It was opened about four years ago by two friends who had previously worked at pizza places .
As you enter the restaurant you are met with the traditional Italian restaurant red towels and a bit of a rustic feel , behind the counter you can see the cooks making the pizzas .
There is a great variety of dishes , from starters to main dishes and desserts , my recommendation is garlic bread as a starter .
This restaurant is very affordable , the prices are extremely reasonable , especially if you 're a student , because there 's a special menu called " student 's menu " where you choose two ingredients for you pizza with or without French fries and a drink for about three euros .
All in all , I think this woould be the best restaurant for our class to go , since it 's close to the school , it has good prices and a friendly ambience .
By finding this solution , they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment .
Not to mention the huge advantage that people are protected from earthquakes because these houses do not have direct contact with the earth .
These cars can go down to their destination and then , go up again until the driver pushes a button .
Lots of the buildings are skyscrapers and the architecture has completely changed .
People are still human beings and act completely normal .
They seem happy with the way they live and embrace the change in everything .
Now let 's return to the present because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future eventually .
I read your advertisement in the Cloud magazine and I consider it an interesting experience .
I 'm an Italian native speaker aged 27 and I 've been studying Sport Science at Milan University .
In 2012 I got the Cambridge first certificate in English and I 've been improving my French to pass the exam .
It 's six months since I started teaching gymnastic in a primary school near Milan and I discovered that children are more competitive and honest than adults and I appreciate this .
I am also aware that they are reckless , so I recently attended a First Aid course , which has given me the confidence to deal with emergency situations .
I always try to motivate them with some educational play and I make them understand how important it is the group .
For references , you can contact the Principal of the School , who will be happy to supply you any information .
Taking a gap - year before starting a university is a lifetime opportunity for lots of people .
You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on university camp .
After you finish studying , you will have to immediately start working unless you want to live with your parents for the rest of your life .
It could also be potentially your last chance to spend so much time with your high school friends .
You will definitely part your ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime .
You only live once and wasting such a great possability is unthinkable .
Over the last decades , the spread of technology in our daily life has marked the beginning of a new era .
Computers , mobile phones , the Internet have undoubtedly changed our way of thinking and behaving .
But can we safely regard this technological advance as a proper achievement of modern times ?
Certainly , computers and similar devices give us the priceless opportunity to make our lives simpler .
However , the main drawback of such advance is that we now rely more on computers than on our capacities .
We are slowly but inesorably loosing readiness to solve problems , unless we can surf the Internet , so that even a single day without technology would turn out to be a nightmare .
We consult Tripadvisor , we die for positive ratings and we increasingly forget to care about simple things .
In my view , we should all riconsider the role that computers have gained in our lives .
Technology is not reality and should never replace it .
It was the last year I was attending the high school and final exams were approaching faster than I thought .
The only thing I knew was the date of the exams was becoming more threatening as time went by .
Then when finally it was my turn I seated in front of the teachers and , slowly , I introduced my speech .
After this event I can cope with everything !
As it was said before , the brief time of observation does not allow obtaining that much information about how CLIL is really implemented in a particular educational context , even so the data collected and the following conversation with the teacher , contributed to obtain an interesting picture about how Arts and Crafts is considered and carried out under CLIL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher , but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language , the artistic .
How to provide student with more real and relevant input , in the daily routine of an art class , seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers , who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language .
Despite the difficulties that CLIL teachers have to overcome , the truth is that the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way special .
What surprised me more positively was the level of peer support , the cooperation and the comradeship .
It is interesting to see how the students resort each other looking for help in a natural way , without the intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects , but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about CLIL atmosphere .
I am writing to express my interest to the bar staff opening you have posted on our school 's noticeboard .
First of all , I strongly believe that I would be the most suitable applicant because of my long experience in bar servicing .
I know what involves in a late night customer service and how to deal with a loud environment .
In addition , my knowledge acquired by managing a bar and a certification in hygeinic food handling will guerantee the clean environment of your bar .
At last , I would like to emphasise my professionalism towards alcohol service .
I am a bartender who has awarded three times in international bar - show contests .
Certainly , I can offer professional bar shows and tricks to make your bar more attractive to the customers .
The time allocations you have suggested on the job advertisement also suit my schedule perfectly .
Yours faithfully ,
Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work : studying grammar rules , learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book .
Firstly , the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue : implicitly .
This method has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to speak , and so it is arguably more natural .
Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated , confusing metalanguage .
Secondly , the classroom method is the one with which most students ( especially if they are older ) are familiar .
This method also has its benefits , not least logistically speaking , since many students do n't have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad .
Furthermore , some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules , which make them aware of the mistakes they are making .
While both methods clearly have their advantages , I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning .
Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language , while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self - correction and self - study .
I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English .
Now we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler .
The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine ; it has three main sections : the feed section , the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e .
In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel ( i.e. the pellet ) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air .
Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet .
The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove , the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house , so it 's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan ( the pourpose of a fan and a pump it 's the same : move fluid from a point A to a pont B , but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water ( they have a different density : water has 1000 times the density of air ) .
Like in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber ( according to the control system ) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water .
My home town , an international city , attracts millions of tourists from all over the world every year .
Knowing a clean and tidy city is no less appealing to the tourists than beautiful scenery and bargain shopping , both the authority and the citizens understand the need to keep our city clean in order to keep the tourists coming , therefore they are serious in protecting the environment .
To keep the city clean and tidy , people adopt an environmentally friendly attitude in daily life : they refuse littering , if they can not find a rubbish bin around , they keep rubbish in small plastic bag ; at home , they separate the recyclable items from the rubbish before they get rid of the rubbish .
They follow the government 's advice to set the air conditioner temperature at 25 degrees of Celsius .
The government plays a crucial role in taking care of the environment .
It educates the citizens to cultivate their sense of protecting the city 's environment .
We are lucky to live in a city where both the authority and the people have a strong sense of environmental protection .
Firstly , it is a way to get out of the routine , occasionally .
It helps to release the endorphins and anxiety levels in my body .
For example , it contributes to my cardiovascular system .
If any one you would like to start practicing this dynamic and amazing sport , I would tell you to try it as soon as possible .
So , give it a shot and you will realize it is one of the most amazing activities you can ever do .
We 'd had a lovely meal in one of the most charming restaurants in Rome .
We did n't understand a thing because the car keys were just in front of us .
So we rushed out the restaurant on suspicion of theft .
As soon as the man explained everything to us we realised that we had mistaken car keys in the restaurant because both of them were exactly alike .
People seem to be living quiet comfortable lives nowadays .
We have reached an age of high technology .
Humans will most likely continue to improve this technology and make their lives better for the future .
The men would only do the paperwork themselves .
However , not everything about the life in the next 50 years will be positive .
Eventually , it might become so much of a precious resource that it will be used as the international currency instead of dollars .
We will have to find an alternative drinking source ...
There might appear a few situations , when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache .
Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley . Crowd in every corner , awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another , because these shops are organised in the way , which forces you to see everything , in order to find what you really need .
That and the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encouraging .
Shopping with your husband , boyfriend , father or any representative of the male kind , also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever .
I believe they are genetically programmed to take away all your ' joie de vivre ' .
The constant grumbling , regular checking the time , this anxious and adrift facial expression - how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping ? !
And believe me there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them , it always looks this way .
In conclusion , shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity , not only to expand contents of your wardrobe , but also , to relax and spend a great time .
You just have to avoid supermarkets , buy clothes in advance - so there will not appear the situation , when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet , and of course of the male company , better choose the female companion .
I saw your advertisement and would like to apply to work in the USA in one of your Summer camps .
Since then I have attended a course for the preparation of the CAE exam , and spent two weeks in Ireland during the Summer working as a babysitter , so I have had experience working with children .
I love facing new challenges and am available to work long hours if required .
I also consider myself to have great organisational skills .
This can be noted in the fact that I was head of entertainment in my High School for two years .
During these two years I was responsible for the organisation and booking of bands .
But before I could leave school I remembered that I had left my trainers in the changing room , just after football session .
-"Michie!Wait for me ! "
Oh no , not again ... That stupid girl was completely in love with me , since last year she thinks that I like her , but she 's wrong .
She 's an impossible woman .
-"Thank you for the information . Bye "- I said , knowing what I was n't going to do tomorrow .
for the position you recently advertised regarding Summer Camps in the USA . I also have
plenty of experience with teaching younger children .
This experience involved tutoring children from the ages of 5 to 16 in various aspects of English and Maths
as a Surf Instructor during the summer holidays in my home town of Zarautz .
skills in sports and also a fun loving attitude towards organising activities .
I have many references from employers and the parents of the children I teach .
I love dancing and I do ballet , which requires a lot of discipline .
I think that this is not a usual sport , but it has the same advantages : it burn calories , improve circulation , is good for the bones and muscles ... Therefore is a really beautiful way to exercise and help you to improve flexibility .
I would really like to participate as a co worker in this summer camp .
My mother told me that I can gain great experiences .
By looking after children between the ages of 8 and 12 , I can experience new skills that will be useful in my future with my future kids .
I am very energetic , cheerful and hardworking , which are the traits you are looking for !
On the other hand , I think serving within this area is the best opportunity for trying new abilities .
I am also a great organizer ; therefore , I can be such a great help with the evening and sports activities .
I hope you understand my point of view .
Over the course of history , life has constantly changed .
From the early nomad tribes , to the first human settlements , then to villages and cities to the formation of civilization , man has never stood still for too long .
Key discoveries have changed the course of history .
First , the fire , then agriculture , irrigation , and nowadays with technology .
The more knowledge we accumulate , the faster progress will come .
Mankind went from a rural based society to a modern skyscraper - filled civilization in just a century .
The discovery of electricity has increased our productivity greatly .
With the advance of electronic products , information has become even easier to spread .
Then with TVs , information started to spread faster and faster until our contenporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands .
In the next 50 years , who know what we will be able to accomplish .
Education and technology are deeply related , to a certain extent in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years .
Although there are many differences among these two , similarities can be found as well .
The main similarity between face - to - face learning and online learning is that they both provide valuable learning skills to students .
Currently , exist all types of courses via the Internet , at any academic or vocational level .
Adding to this , both learning options require time and dedication from students ; otherwise , knowledge will not be properly delivered .
On the other hand , differences between face - to - face learning and virtual learning are numerous .
Firstly , online learning conveys flexibility in its shedule .
Studentd can attend courses when they decide , but always respecting due dates .
Another difference between face - to - face learning and online learning may be that face - to - face learning allows students to develop human - relationships , whereas online learning is quite impossible on this to happen .
During face - to - face learning students have a teacher - student relationship , as well as a peer - to - peer relationship , allowing them to develop inter - personaal skills and coexistence .
When doing a fece - to - face course besides having an attendance schedule , people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given .
Consequentlu , both learning options have their positive and negative aspects .
Assessing these similarities and differences each student has the option to choose the option which better suits in his lifestyle .
Peschiera Borromeo , a little town near Milan , has an agricultural reality and there are many possibilities to walk around and to train yourself in a running parcour .
Unfortunately there is a lot of traffic , so the best place to avoid it is a little artificial lake called Idroscalo where people can run along the 7 kilometres perimeter or cycling open air while looking at the swans .
In this area you can find many facilities such as two swimming pools , a tennis and a volleyball court .
People can also try canoeing at the local school or the water skiing with a mechanical device that drags you on the water .
The speaker discusses the article , saying that taxes stand against free trade and in favor of protectionism .
In his opinion the concept of protectionism in the world of global economy is not effective .
There is a good example involving developing countries , which economies have been successful due to being the most opened to free trade , and countries with a low economic growth , that closed themselves off to international trade .
Although in the lecture it is admitted that international competition can cause problems to local businesses , mentioned in the article , he claims that it is worth competing with global corporations , because this way survived local companies may get stronger than ever .
They can hire local people , give them well - paid jobs , and those people may learn how global corporations work , which is a good thing for local economies .
And finally , the article states that free trade does not always lead to peaceful relationship between nations , but the lecturer draws attention to European common market set up after World War II .
He emphasizes that free trade between powerful European nations makes a war between them almost impossible .
To test the research 's hypothesis , self - administrated questionnaires were used on a total of 400 customers .
The target population included telecommunication service users who subscribed a loyalty program .
The choice of telecommunication industry in this framework is related to the vital role of loyalty and retention in this service setting .
Many experts have emphasized the market maturity and the number and variety of competitive choices among service providers .
A total of 309 complete and exploitable questionnaires were collected , with a response rate of 77% .
This sample size allows us to perform multiple data analysis ( multivariate and SEM ) .
An appropriate sample size should be ten times the number of items used in the questionnaire ( Sorbom et Joreskog , 1982 ) .
In this research , the sample size seems to be appropriate for SEM ( 309 > 27 items multiplied by 10 ) .
Games are played primarily for entertainment or enjoyment , but may also serve as exercise .
I like this game because it is exciting and challenging .
It is a ball game played on a rectangular grass field with a goal at each end .
The objective of the game is to score by maneuvering the ball into the opposing goal .
Football is played at a professional level all over the world , and millions of people regularly go to football stadium to follow their favorite team , whilst millions more avidly watch the game on television .
In many parts of the world football evokes great passions and plays an important role in the life of individual fans , local communities , and even nations ; it is therefore often claimed to be the most popular sport in the world .
I learnt teambuilding , discipline as well as teamwork through playing football .
There are many worldwide international competition of football .
One of the major international competitions in football is the World Cup organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association .
Over 190 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals .
The finals tournament , which is held every four years , now involves 32 national teams competing .
The star I admired most in football is Edson Arantes do Nascimento , nicknamed Pelé , is a former Brazilian football player and thought by many to be the finest player of all time .
Often considered the complete attacking player , he was completely two - footed , a prolific finisher , exceptional at dribbling and passing , and was a remarkably good tackler for a forward .
Since his full retirement he has served as an ambassador for the sport .
I wish to become a professional football player .
In my mind , holidays are essentially about being comfortable , staying in your element and simply enjoying your time off and not about creating uncomfortable situations if that might be the outcome of trying new things .
As stress and challenging work triggers exhaustion in many such as myself , I prefer curling up with a good book and enjoying a nice cup of coffee on holidays rather than generating any level of discomfort .
On the contrary to the subject I disagree having to try new and challenging things on holidays due to the fact that I take much more pleasure reading novels which make me feel all the rush of an outside activity all the while keeping me safe and comfortable .
Their acting is on spot and the costumes and magnificent .
She 's such a beautiful woman and plays the role beautifully .
The other actors are also really talented and bring to life many of the historical figures that Turkey had in that time .
I strongly recommend this amazing series to people who want to take a glimpse into the history of a fascinating country and experience different feelings together with the main characters .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to comment on the way people , and especially children , learn languages in my country , what foreign languages they learn and where they learn them and to recommend changes in the language - learning system .
With Germany and Austria being our neighbours and thus business partners to many Czech companies , German is the second most popular foreign language spoken , followed by Russian , French , Italian and Spanish .
Students at some schools also have a possibility of exchange programmes but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event .
Recommended changes
I would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish , Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach at schools instead of giving private lessons .
I saw your advertisement for language courses in London and I am writing to find out more about the courses you offer .
Could you please send me more information and details of prices ?
I would particularly like to know how many students attend the school , and how many students there are in a class .
I would be interested in having more details of the social and sports
Are the activities included in the price of the course ?
Could you tell me about the cost of accommodation too ?
As a consequence , they become slim and they do n't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life
On the other hand , teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones , video games and television which make them being more sedentary .
Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended , whereas going outside and run or ride a bicycle would be a better option .
Snacks , fast food , fried food and sweets are part of young people 's life as they can find them everywhere : in the shops on the street , at parties and in shopping malls .
In conclusion , young people should behave differently towards their health and fitness .
The statement is rather too categorical , because to say that there is no future is going too far .
Sometimes the reasons for doing so are not to do with convenience but , rather more to do with economic issues or matters of conscience .
It is easy , fast and , we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance -shorter rather than longer .
Raising people 's awareness of pollution and how we must have a more sustainable existence is what makes us look for other less selfish and handy options .
Publis transport is always going to be slower , less flexible and much less convenient but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet .
In conclusion , public transport will always have a future if local governments have policies to promote it .
It is never the attractive option , but it is the one which shows more solidarity .
Government jobs carry with them serious responsibilities .
It is therefore no surprise that a person 's age and experience come under scrutiny when positions in government need to be filled .
Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience , while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability , namely whomever is most able to carry out the job .
This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion .
On the one hand , many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions , and the implications of this opinion are clear .
Those operating at senior levels within a country 's military , for example , require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life .
Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country 's military , they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience , and this could have catastrophic results .
Thus , is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions .
For one , younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government .
For example , young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s , a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear .
In addition to fresh ideas , it should be remembered that to get a government job , one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process .
If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person , it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment .
It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people .
Although the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument , it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs .
Thus , a person 's age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs .
Promotional Objective :
One of the promotional objectives is to increase the awareness of Trivago in Hong Kong .
In order to achieve its objectives , Trivago invested more money in the promotion in 2014 .
For example , it promoted their search engine by the television commercial and Youtube advertisement .
The Youtube advertisement means the viewers have to be enforced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video in Youtube .
Since most of the people watch the television not just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s ) in Youtube , they will be enforced to watch its advertisement more than one times .
Trivago has a very simple and rememberable tagline which is ' Hotels ?
Therefore , Trivago use the advisement to increase its market share in Hong Kong .
Trivago is trying to represent that it is the most convenient hotel search engine in the market .
The last but not the least , Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms .
Almost all the advertisements are encouraging audience to download its mobile application .
If there are more people download its mobile application , it means more people to know its brand and use its service .
Current advertising strategy
We found one of the Television advertisements which is currently undertaking in Hong Kong .
The advertisement is about 16 seconds .
There is a narrator introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates " how to use its mobile application to search for a worthiest hotel . "
We will analyze its strategies from different perspectives below .
Television Commercial
In general , television is the most popular media in Hong Kong .
Advertising by television is an effective way to communicate the service to the general public .
Since that television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time , more potential customers will be exposed to its service .
If the advertisement is designed well , people will remember it .
Moreover , television has the advantage of being able to utilize sight , sound and motion .
Combining a catchy theme tune and a well - designed visual advertisement can increase the chances of viewers remembering the brand .
As designers are not limited to using only sound or still images , they can create advertisements that are appealing visually and audibly .
Background Music
Music helps stimulates sense and focus attention toward the advertisement .
The background music in the advertising is relaxed and excite .
It helps audience to better recall the advertisement and stored it in long - term memory .
It can also increase the retention of visual information .
Demonstration
The television advertisement shows the service being using .
It demonstrates all the steps from searching the hotel , choosing selection criteria and comparing the price to different hotels .
Through the demonstration , Trivago can show to the audience how easy to use its mobile application to find a worthiest hotel .
It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly to know what its service is .
On the other hand , as a mobile application , some people probably feel confused about how it operates .
Therefore , with the visual effect , demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application .
Informative
The television commercial presents information to the audience in a straight - forward manner .
The narrator directly indicates the functions of the mobile application .
For example , he says the application can instantly compare the rates to over 150 websites .
For those who are high interested in hotel searching service , they may notice to such informative advertisement .
In the television commercial , Trivago uses cognitive message strategy .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition .
This strategy shows its profession and reliability for its target customers .
At the same time , it increases the confidence of the customers for choosing its services .
As Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago , it needs to enhance its popularity in there .
It needs to utilities some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services toward its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives .
On the other hand , Trivago also applies conative strategy in the advertisement .
In the television commercial , the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application in their mobile phone .
It encourages customer to purchase its services and truly make use of it .
Moreover , " Means - End Chain " is adapted in the television advertisement .
Trivago can achieve the personal value for customers through the advertisement .
Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasure journey with lower prices and the freedom of choosing their favorite accommodation .
The advertisement can show that they are wisdom by using Trivogo service to plan an economically trip .
Trivago use this way to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage since the value of its services is increased .
Nevertheless , Trivago designs a tagline in the television commercial .
Trivago '' , can introduce the key idea of the television commercial .
Besides , it can also improve the consistency of advertising platforms .
As the tagline is catchy , if the tagline is continuously applied on the other advertisements , it will not be easy to stray from the main idea .
Other communication tools
Trivago does not choose radio to be their media as it is antiquated .
Attention of the radio commercial is low .
Also , radio advertisements only contain verbal effect .
Without the visual effect , it becomes less attractive .
Even through people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago , they probably do not know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal vocabulary .
Therefore , the product awareness driven by radio advertisement is not enough .
Likewise , Trivago is an online service so Newspaper advertisement may not appropriate for it .
Lastly , hire spokesperson consequent high cost in promotion .
And there is a risk of hiring a spokesperson as he may not bring an expected return for the company .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the focus of audience maybe shifts from the product to the spokesperson .
Therefore , television commercial is likely the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong .
Jacob was absolutely furious when he saw what was going on outside his window .
Not even a month before he had paid a fortune to get his place refurbished and painted .
How many times would he have to face this irreverence ?
While he was standing on the pavement tears of resentment covered his face .
I think I had watched almost all the football matches in history especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season .
90% of our conversation includes football and we can talk all day about it for sure .
First , whether played individually or in teams , it 's great fun and demands a lot of effort .
It has helped me to stay focused and improve my concentration , too .
As well as that , tennis gives me the opportunity to stay fit and meet new people .
Since it 's not very easy at the beginning , if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and train at least twice a week .
Do you know " The Flying Dutchman " ? I consider him as the Dutch Superman of 2013 , since he has won some important sports competitions .
" The Flying Dutchman " , also known as Epke Zonderland , is a gymnast from Groningen who was the first man worldwide to do an incredibly difficult exercise on the parallel bars .
By performing this exercise perfectly , he became the World Champion this year ( and he also won the gold medal at the Olympics of 2012 ) .
For this achievement , I admire him quite a lot .
To summarise , my hero of 2013 is Epke Zonderland , because of his achievements in the gym .
My villain of this year is Clown Bassie , since I think his behaviour is unacceptable !
Clearly , travel in your own car is much more comfortable than on public transport .
In my opinion , this is dissapointing for a number of reasons .
Also , it is an excellent way of saving the environment .
Furthermore , we also save time : as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park , which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park , or wasting money in expensive carparks .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody 's life , we should use it every day to save the Earth , money , and time .
If you 're looking for a great film to watch on a rainy day , I totally recommend Alice in Wonderland .
Directed by Tim Burton , the story is a retelling of fantasy novel Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young Alice Troubled by a strange recurring dream , the loss of her beloved father , an unwanted marriage proposal , and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives .
Unsure of what to does , she chase a rabbit in a blue waistcoat , and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole From which she emerges in a forest , where she is greeted by many strange creatures .
The film features Mia Wasikowska as Alice .
The cinematography is fantastic , with wonder digital landscapes .
But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design , they really managed to create something amazing with the appearance of characters .
If you enjoy a classic book , but with more action and a little bit twisted ; watch Alice in Wonderland .
I totally recommend it , you will not be disappointed .
Firstly , I should say that life nowadays is unthinkable without science .
In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine , astronomy , computers , and history .
People today are interested in learning about the surrounding world , about new civilizations and distant planets .
Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of .
By using computers nowadays it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for .
They climb the highest mountains , dive in the depths of oceans , and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science .
The present belief is that scientific approach will solve all the problems and do away with all difficulties .
That is why science is so significant nowadays .
On the other hand , the greatness of science goes together with its disadvantages .
The obsession to know everything has led some of us to make dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives .
With its help we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil .
At some time or another , each and every young person must provide themselves with the necessary skills . « What can I do for my life ? » .
After all a successful career is best measured in how satisfying you find it , and it 's easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting .
they nearly always reply with their occupation .
Through our work we find an identity , we can find status , intellectual stimulation as well as wealth which enables us to buy comfort .
Our working identities can change over time , our identity and behaviours as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader .
Our ability to develop our identity is critical to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles , we need to shed our old identity and add new elements .
So people say ' I do n't do numbers ' , ' I do n't do detail ' ' I do n't do preparation ' , they believe it and make it true . '
I ca n't do sales ' becomes a self fulfilling prophecy .
We can change our beliefs , actions and thus our identity through experimentation , practice and conscious self discipline .
In an age where career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ' a new you ' by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world in order to develop and expand your career options .
While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor , demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds .
Firstly , demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are estimated .
Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money , they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated .
However , even with these arguments , demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well .
With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated .
And above that , without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings .
After all , the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings , or at least a few of them , because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations .
Any form of public transport like a bus or a train is too much of an inconvenience especially in a large city such as London .
Imagine going to work on a rainy day : you have one hand on your umbrella and the other clutching your bag , the wind is blowing mist on your face and a puddle of water is sprinkling tiny dots of wet dirt in your stilleto while you are making your way to a bus station .
Definitely not a good way to start your day .
Indeed , the method by which a person go from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day .
Transportation is very important in our daily life and in this modern world we live in , the very least that we expect from almost anything is inconvenience .
This is why , most of us , prefer to travel with our own car rather than by a public transport ; not only that it keeps us within our private sphere , it also keeps us dry travelling on a rainy day .
Yes , we are willing to spend more in the name of convenience . We 'd rather pay a hefty price for gas than be inconvenienced in a public transport .
Next year I will be starting the Psychology bachelor programme at the University of Groningen , and I would like to earn some money beforehand .
So when I came across this advertisement yesterday , I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job .
Those children are too old for babysitters now , but I love children and would really like working with them again .
I believe myself to be a proficient cook , as I 've always cooked for my family in the weekends .
When I was almost three years old , my parents moved to Indonesia because of their work circumstances .
There I went to Surabaya International School , where I learnt English .
I like photography too , although I haven't been doing that for a long time .
I 'm interested in philosophy as well ; I enjoy writing essays about psychological or philosophical subjects , so every now and then I write an essay in my free time .
Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue because it is very difficult to give a clear - cut answer and so , it makes the process of discussion very exciting .
There may be a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing .
My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent .
On the one hand , I personally think that the desire to become famous is a great driving force that stimulates people and brings a lot of benefits to others in its wake .
It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be demonstrated by such sportsmen .
Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation of their clubs and countries as well .
What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that somebody 's desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on others .
It means that other people feel challenged and do n't want to fall behind and look underdogs .
On the other hand almost equal number of people may maintain a contrasting point of view .
They give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless .
Such people tried to achieve their goal irrespective of the means .
I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns .
The desire of some country 's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and conflicts between countries .
Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities .
So , all in all , we can not answer this question as " yes " or " no " because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view .
She could n't believe that he was capable of doing such a horrendous thing .
It was a strange atmosphere in the house and a chill went down her spine .
She went down to the kitchen and proceeded with preparations , but she could n't get rid of that weird feeling . ' Something is up . I can feel it ' , so she picked up the phone and decided to call Michael again .
" Hi . Where are you ? she asked , apprehension rising slowly . "
What are we going to do about Susan ? " said the unfamiliar woman .
" I do n't know."said the familiar male voice . "
You need to understand this . I 'll pay alimony and help you with the kid , but I can not lose Susan " .
Full of rage and disappointment she opened the door and saw the woman sitting in Michael 's lap .
When she got home she packed some of her belongings and drove to her best friend 's house .
After two hours , she could hear Michael 's voice coming from downstairs .
She heard heavy footprints on the stairs and buried her head deeper in the pillow .
Don't!"she said and threw the pillow at his face .
Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated , aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual , physically , mentally or emotionally .
Bullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person .
It can be classified into four types :
Relational ( destroying peer acceptance and friendships )
Cyber - bullying ( using electronic means to harm others )
Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems .
Bullying can cause loneliness , depression , anxiety , lead to low self - esteem and illnesses .
In conclusion , I would like to say that self harm , low self esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools . We need to stop this .
Now to boycott bullying form our school i request all of you to take an oath that , I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying . I will treat others with respect and kindness .
I will have to compassion to not be a bully and the courage to not to be a bystander .
It is my responsibility to help others being bullied and to report bullying .
She was a machinist , and was currently working on some secret work he could n't understand .
I would like to apply for the job as a music and dance teaching assistant at your summer school as advertised in your advertisement .
I am twenty - year - old student in my second year at National University of Culture of Ukraine .
Here I am studying dance and choreography .
Also , I can play several music instruments , such as : violin , guitar , drums and tambourine .
Furthermore , I love children very much , the reason can be such fact that I have three younger brothers and one younger sister , so I am the older one .
However , I have no experience working with children , apart from helping my parents with brothers and sister .
But in dance area I have a lot of achievements , such as victories in different competitions and festivals .
And of course , as required , I can speak English quite well and have a certificate that shows it .
My first memories of food are from my early years , as I looked at my grandmother cooking typical Spanish dishes such as paella or tortilla .
When I was in school I used to go to my granparents ' home to have lunch because my parents were at work , I fondly remember my gandma 's great cooking skills that she still owns to this day .
A few years afterwards , right when I started high school and hit my teenager years , I began eating bigger amounts of unhealthy food from American fast food restaurants that I used to go to with my friends some days right after class and during the weekends .
By the time my high school years were done , and right when I attended university , I developed certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish , unavoidibly combined with less fast food due to the usual diners with friends .
Wonderful inventions such as the train , bus and airplane have allowed us the freedom to travel and explore this great planet for a lower price .
Industrialization gave us the ability to mass produce public transit vehicles so that everyone could be free to move .
Travelling by car may be more convenient on an individual basis but pollution is a danger we have to face .
If all of used cars , the levels of pollution would be incredibly high .
Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport , especially trains as they use electricity and are less pollutant than other means of transport .
Traffic is a really big problem in cities nowadays and only the use of public transport can make a significant difference in the quality of life in our cities .
If those who run public transportation systems hope to make them greener in the future , they 'll have to come with solutions that are both energy efficient and effective .
In conclusion , I think that public transport has an important role to play if we want to preserve the quality of life in our cities .
I believe that my background is suitable for this position .
My first degree gave me a good track record in physiology and anatomy , and the experience , as a biological sciences ' student and as a research fellow , allowed me to build a scientific thinking .
Furthermore , I have improved my skills in molecular , biochemical , bioinformatics and microscopic techniques , and I also would like to point up my high motivation to develop expertise in stem cells and pharmaceutical research .
In addition , I am committed to science and I am a dedicated , team - oriented person , who is able to work independently .
I am interested in the English Course in which I can learn at my own pace .
In addition to that , I am graduated in Computer Science and there is a lot of information available in this language .
So , I need to have a good vocabulary to understand the materials I find on the Internet .
Finally , I have interest in technology , environment and science .
Yours faithfully ,
The city authorities have a very strict policy regarding waste disposal .
All citizens are involved in the process by organizing their waste in the corresponding bins and by making good use of the waste calendar .
Every house in the village has three containers :
The cost of the waste disposal service depends only on the volume of non - reciclable waste produced .
Eventually , the citizen becomes part of a very meticulous recycling process by looking up to the cost .
On the other hand , the city provides a punctual public transport system , very convenient .
Trams are available 24 hours and tram stops are evenly distributed ; it takes no more than 8 minutes walking from one stop to the next one .
Jack lived with his mommy , he had no job , and when she had told him to be independent , he only lasted one month before going on poverty .
He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law on banning new types of food , this had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes .
One day before this new law was established , a crazy scientist created a new waffle , " the great , furry waffle .
There was a bit of conflict in his plan , the new waffle was in Texas , and he lived in Washington .
He saw on his mommy 's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle , he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips .
Once he got to the laboratory where the pancake was made , he told the mad scientist that he wanted to eat his waffle .
It was a combination of bacon , meat , and cheese with a little bit of butter .
Have you ever stopped to think that exist some standards in the society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously ?
These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly ( Bob Greene , How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In fact , since the beginning , the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them , allowing life to be more harmonious .
For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture , the Brazilian culture .
When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech ( 1995 ) , he was talking about the African American Communication , but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time .
First , Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time , without they have clear reasons .
It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog ; moreover , unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking .
Surprisingly , on the other hand , a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule , and can be interpreted as an offense .
In Brazilian culture , if during a conversation a person speaks too low , the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking .
In both the extremes of a speech , loud and low , there is a violation of the values of a good communication .
Therefore , when you are in a conversation , it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns .
As vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians , personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily .
When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know , this space is your personal territory .
And , it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person .
In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space , yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S.
Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States , they are no tolerant with strangers invading it .
Soon , even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil , both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable , called personal space .
Although Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others , people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others .
As a result , some people can make misinterpretations .
For example , in some cultures , Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact , and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy .
Differently , foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact .
In general , this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog .
According to article " Nonverbal Communication : Speaking without Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazil , the eye contact is primordial , being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to .
The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids ; it is hard to get exclusively the kid 's attention , but the parents insistently repeat , " look at me when I am talking to you " .
Therefore , this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others ' opinion .
In Brazil , the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication .
Also , the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country , and in Brazil are considered small , but everyone there appreciates this cultural value .
Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values .
Because of these varieties of values and rules , usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations .
Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts .
He remembered that he still had n't studied for his chemestry test .
According to Ferguson et all ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrate ( NO3- ) supplementation , via its reduction to nitrite ( NO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Bond , Morton and Braakhuis ( 2012 ) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the exercise .
Nevertheless , a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers .
Surprisingly , the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise .
Thus , the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life .
In conclusion , the results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer performance .
It is unquestionable that some research found significant improvements .
In this present study , however , the rowing time of the participants was not shorter than times without supplementation .
Importantly , it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either .
It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production .
Nevertheless , the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly .
Finally , it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels , consequently reducing the blood pressure .
By this action , beetroot juice may effectively protect the cardiovascular system during exercising .
Despite the present findings , it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation .
By this action , athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life .
I read your article about technology and education in the newspaper yesterday and I am writing this letter because I strongly disagree with your personal opinion about teachers and education .
To begin with , I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge .
Of course , I make use of computer and projector during my teaching daily , because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children .
After all , my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated .
The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide .
Without teachers ' guidance , self- studying may bring some problems to children , such as possible misunderstanding .
Networking educational contents are not safe at all .
So , the teacher is a necessary part of the educational process .
Nowadays , young people graduate from universities , who come up with new and innovative ideas about educational process and so the tradition will be updated next years .
To be more precise , new educational methods promotes the students ' teamwork .
In other words , students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematic problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject .
Furthermore , when it 's necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves .
In this kind of education , teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own .
Furthermore , it makes children more sociable .
In contrast , interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial , because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people .
This is bad , because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems .
To sum up , I am not against interactive learning and the use of technology .
My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the education process .
I think that it is efficient when there is a combination of traditional education and interactive learning .
This is a good option especially during the summer time .
While doing these activities , teenagers will easily make new friends and develop new skills .
This sports centre provides a huge variety of physical activities .
One of these is athleticism . "
Campo de Marte " is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athleticism professionally .
Besides , you have the chance to take part in international competitions if you stand out .
This experience would teach you how to work with different kind of people .
Thank you so much for this opportunity , I am very grateful for everything .
Most of the content produced on the internet ( 50% ) is in English and last but not least although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time , we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities .
About the accommodation , we talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English speaking families because of what a great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills .
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am certain that we will cherish every second of every minute there .
I was actually about to email you about the activities that are to be planned .
Regarding the students preferences , they all love the outdoors , like parks and rivers and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge .
Concerning this amazing trip I only have two questions left starting with the weather , considering your experience with the changes happening this time of the year and the second and last about what type of clothes you recommended which is of great importance primarily for our female students .
On the positive side , travelling by car is more relaxed because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you .
Going by train for example , you need to get to the next train station and afterwards from the destination train station to your target .
Often enough you have to rely on other services such as busses or taxis to reach your destination .
On the other hand , using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas , electricity and other materials is a lot lower per head .
Furthermore you have the chance to take a nap , do some work or watch TV while you are being transported .
Moreover you can be lucky to avoid big traffic jams especially if you are taking the train .
Avoiding traffic jams , construction sites , accidents and other obstacles you may being affected by may result in a lower amount of time spent travelling .
As a conclusion you can say public transport will have its use even in the future . While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time , the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary .
It is popularly believed that the golden era of public transportation will be ended soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cabs and vans .
Public transportation modes like trains and buses have been immensely helpful to the general public throughout the past couple of decades .
On the other hand , travelling by car is getting for popular than it ever was with development of science and technology .
People who are based on rural and remote areas are always prefer to use public transportation according to the researchers from Columbia University .
However , in some countries , public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly , this is one of the main reasons which had led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation .
Not only people in countries where it has poor public transportation but also the most developed countries , there is a high tendency of using cars instead of depending on public transportation .
Public transportation , on the other hand , consumes a lot of time to travel from one distance to another .
Use of high power efficiency and linear high power amplifier ( HPAs ) are growing .
Power efficiency and linearity are important factors in many applications such as cellular communication , wireless communication .
Higher power efficiency and linearity cause decrease power consumption , increase lifetime and reduction of interference channels .
Class - E power amplifier satisfies those goals with linearity techniques .
Class - E power amplifier PAs work as a switch and can obtain theoretically 100% power efficiency . Class - E power amplifier ( PA ) was introduced by Sokal in 1975 .
These PAs work as a switch and can obtain 100% Drain Efficiency theoretically .
However in practice there are some limitations such as , switch on - resistance and various power losses that prevent achieving 100% Drain Efficiency .
Secret agents have often been chosen as the main character of stories and films , such as James Bond 's ones , which managed to be really successful .
But what exactly makes spy stories so fascinating ?
There could be a lot of reasons , like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret ; but in real life , what kind of person does a secret agent have to be ?
For instance , the ability to bear both physical and psychological stress is not something you can easily learn .
A secret agent works undercover , so his most important quality is possessing great skill in lying .
So , although the life of secret agents may seem fascinating and exciting , it is also difficult and risky and not so simple as the one shown in films .
