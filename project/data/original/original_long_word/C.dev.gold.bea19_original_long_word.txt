Yesterday I was in Green Pepper Cafe for a meal with colleagues and I have seen the advertisement for a job at weekends in your cafe .
I am very interested in this work and believe that my employment background is appropriate for it .
So I have experience in service , costumer care and working long hours .
I Know how to prepare different kinds of food : sandwiches , fish and fries , hamburgers , Italian pasta , etc
I have total availability at weekends and also in summer .
Please , find attached a copy of my CV , which expands on my experience and achievements .
I am looking forward to talking with you about the possibility of working in this position .
I am available to do an interview when it is convenient for you .
Thank you for your time and consideration .
The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
Nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
And also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
Speaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
What about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
Public transport is absolutely better .
So , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
From my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
In my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
Though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
All in all , the experience was beneficial .
And that definitely was not the right thing to do .
I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .
I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .
I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp councellor .
I am also an accomplished sportswoman - I am a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard .
I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suitability for this post in an interview .
Yours faithfully ,
I 'm seventeen years old and I 'm an electonics ' student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I 've decided to continue my studies at university .
These days I started studyng English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
School is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
The big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it 's very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puerquitour : A great experience to your mouth .
We discovered our fascination with food and ' The Puerquitour ' was born .
Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .
Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .
Due to Puerquitour is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .
It means that they have different taste of tortillas -vanilla , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , and walnut , among others- and salsas -tamarind , guava , mango , guacamole , etc .
That day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes .
Third day was one of my favourite , the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
Totally recommended !
Mar Azul Resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour .
Seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are breaded shrimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .
Fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? â€¦ El asadero Hidalguense .
Almost a week in the Puerquitour .
Because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub .
Ice cream in Tepoznieves .
Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer .
The last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
Do n't forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip .
Beside this , Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
Also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents .
Nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
Actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
Apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omniscient power .
However , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
Beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - natured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
Also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
In fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
" My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up " by hand . "
Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand . "
Moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
Regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
Notwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .
The events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .
The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
The thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
Consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
If the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .
It was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of " her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant " .
Even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding , her biological mother .
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n't want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
One of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L'Albero Pizzeria , located in the Huelin neighbourhood .
As you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .
The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .
So far I have never been disappointed .
To start , you must try the Rose Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
Besides the great atmosphere and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficient .
The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .
Also the prices are incredibly cheap , it 's around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you wo n't be disappointed .
It offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .
The Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
The Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
On the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
It is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
Firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
Secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
The importance of working hard to achieve goalÑ‹ and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
This is a good example for youngsters to follow .
From another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .
This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
Secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .
In conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
On balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .
They are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .
Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
Their realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .
The graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .
Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
From the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
Only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same the level of 52 grams per person per week .
Both lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .
Chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .
Overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .
Dear Mr. Merrifield :
Recently he has visited Moscow and while we 've been having conversation I 've mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on postdoc position abroad .
And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology Alexis told me to try and contact you .
Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills .
Not to mention the participation in pioneering study .
My own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in actin cytoskeleton that take place during neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells .
Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells .
Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin - binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells .
On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I 'm going to report on the FEBS - EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september .
Also I 'm preparing materials for the next publication .
Yours respectfully ,
P.S. There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lugo city .
There are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
In Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
This festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .
It is celebrated in June .
During this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .
I recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .
You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus .
Lugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . "
City X " has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a due term until 1st July .
Despite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .
The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .
The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .
In accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
City X " incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
The program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
Another important one is the " Let 's make it green " , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .
A later crucial activity are the " Green Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
A municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
It is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
Another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
However , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .
But I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
We live in a time when everything changes quickly .
A technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .
We 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .
We 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
Imagining the future , I see everything different .
The avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .
In our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .
They will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
Everything will be artificial and uncozy .
To make sure you get the position successfully , here are some useful advice and information you might want to know .
At the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Here're some tips on how to do it .
Businesslike suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion .
Interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .
You 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .
Since you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
He started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .
Plus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .
He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .
In his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
Since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
Additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .
Moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
Yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .
Yet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .
Then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .
After that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
For instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .
Instead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarenes , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .
The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
Last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
According to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .
Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of shale gas .
We can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .
Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
According to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
The Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas
There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .
Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
The Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
Last but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
In my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
For the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
It 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .
I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .
Moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
If you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
That will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
In the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
In sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
Firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .
However , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
It ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .
If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .
Lima is the only South American city which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacific Ocean .
Lima has a multicultural tradition , then in it coincide a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups like mestizos , European Peruvians which are the second largest group and the minority in Lima includes Aymara and Quechua and Afro - Peruvians .
Lima is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences such as the stay of Pre - Hispanic legacy with architectural monuments , called " Huacas " .
It is a city that keeps its history through an amazing architecture like balconies , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catacombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through their costumes as well as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting and colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to wet your family and neighbor ; their typical dance called " La Marinera " ; also they keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la ProcesiÃ³n del SeÃ±or de los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary and wonderful example about their symbols , like Mazamorra Morada , el Pisco Sour ( wine ) , el Ceviche , los Picarones , etc .
Lima is a beautiful city of contrast , where you can find a diversity of historical , modern and business places .
Archaeological sites , beaches , valleys , natural reserves and the exquisite cuisine give Peru 's capital an authentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .
Definitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming city to spend your perfect holidays .
Last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savings account for you .
Below you can find a few suggestions of mine .
Additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
Unfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain .
And all banking operations must be done by phone .
The second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .

I 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the chosen person to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga 's concert .
It must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service .
It 's been my dream since childhood and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
I have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
The temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .
My brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
Nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
Skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
After six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .
The subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .
I 've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 've selected above .
Academically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bachelor 's degree .
I also have an indubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , Head Boy ( senior prefect boy ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
Undertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I have acquired at high school .
After I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czech universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
Also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !
Right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
In conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .
It is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
They seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
Dog 's personality is one of their best qualities .
It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
These hairy four - legged animals are also very protective .
So if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .
In conclusion , dogs make really great pets .
Not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
It 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at " Zoe Kak adventure " , one of the most well - known centres in our country .
Although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
Rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
Furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
One of the last activities offered by the centre was diving .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
But I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .

Aware parents disappointed with educational systems and institutionalized education try to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .
Although homeschooling may seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , " a paved road " , it
Homeschooling should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
accept homeschooling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
The situation in Spain can be assessed as " legal vacuum " in light of our constitutional right to free
education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
Educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
Homeschooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
Homeschooled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardize test and the recognition of prestigious universities .
Now though , before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks :
the lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
As far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational
However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as " the
Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
Obviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
In areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
Environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
Built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .
Moreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficiency .
Urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .
Maybe it 's building castles in the air , but houseboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
Although people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , cosy bed and a nice cup of tea .
What I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditional team spirit .
Triathlon : A famous sport throughout the world
It seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport .
Clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
Despite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets , many more are just as interesting and profitable .
Therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated .
Not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .
In conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

Set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .
When the dragon Chrysophylax comes and devastates everything , he is sent twice against him , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
At the end of the story , Giles becomes an independent king .
I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another universe , making me forget every day 's life .
Secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .
I am writing this letter to apply for the position in USA Summer Camp that I saw advertised in our local newspaper .

Yours faithfully
In my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
When visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
Travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
For example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
This can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .
For all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .
I am mostly also interested to pursue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as photonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .
I also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .
After my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barisal .
Especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
In some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
But what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
Well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
Simply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .
After work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
Is travelling by car more convenient ?
We ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .
Facing the murder directly makes the horror penetrates into our hearts .
The author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .
First , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
Then comes to the sound , the heartbeats .
Every time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .
In the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
The second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .
At the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
Finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .
The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , the madman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass."What 's that ? " , Max said aloud .
Afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
When the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life."What an amazing day ! " , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
The question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably not , but they are many people in show - busines or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
Generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .
If you decide to became famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .
Most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
Real problem starts when journalists injures not the celebrity , but its friends or family .
Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .
And when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
Summarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
And I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
As a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go .
Last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called " Las Ficheras " .
It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and funny environment .
In my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .
We faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .
For my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at " Las Ficheras " before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service .
" Pistola y CorazÃ³n Taqueria " was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
We chose " tacos " of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
After paying the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confirming that great places still exists .
Furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions !
The course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n't enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :/
Back home , everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by now , should n't I??- .
I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
He decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I 'm guessing , as I do n't know anything as yet :/ ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of your native language skills once again : here " not meeting his expectations " , could be substituted by another expression .
What I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , measure up , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
The place we were visiting was very beautiful , and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankle , we would have gone for a short hike .
I have sent a lot of CVs , and have gone to 3 interviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two academies ) .
I haven't find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out , I was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
Do remind me again , thou , if you see that I 'm forgetting , okay ?
Global warming and its consequences in 2015
Referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
The World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
Then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El NiÃ±o climate phenomenon .
Stephen Belcher , director of the Met Office 's Hadley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due to its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
Furthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .
Facing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .
Despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .
Although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
Fifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed .
The organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .
Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
To be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .
World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
The site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .
Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
Another advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
The Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .
Moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
Cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
It also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
It gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed cricket religiously and have watched almost every match India played .
Apart from his cricketing skills I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
I will also advise reading more about cricket on cricinfo.com .
It has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games .
Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .
But I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .
This movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things .
It is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
However , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this " something " is almost everything .
Unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards " progress " , whatever that word means .
And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
But I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .
But let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .
The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .
As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .
But let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .
Could you ask your parents ' permission ?
In this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
In addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
There are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
The Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st august to the 15th ?
The doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
Outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
I was taken aback , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .
It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .
They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .
Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .
Their architecture is unique and beautiful .
Today , most of them are hosting cafÃ©s , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .
It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
During the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .
During the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .
Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .
Apart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .
Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .
My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
One year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .
And there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
Adolescence .
Adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .
Everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
Another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .
As I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
It 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
Love : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
It 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
It is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
Adolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
In the municipality of ArtÃ  you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .
Sa ColÃ²nia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village .
In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .
You will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .
Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
On the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
On the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .
On the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called " Talaiot " .
The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .
From that seashore you can see all the AlcÃºdia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .
Introduction .
This report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
Furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
Conclusions .
The facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
Furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
When we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .
As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .
Travalling by car is also much more convenient .
Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
Students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
In conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .
The chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
Otherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called " destination countries " because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
In conlcusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
