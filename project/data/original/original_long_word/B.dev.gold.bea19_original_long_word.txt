I haven't written you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
What about you?What 's new in Brazil?As you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
My work consisted of making press advertising , providing all ticket , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V.I.P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
When the concert finished , we went to cloakroom to get signatures from musicians .
I felt like a star!Crowded of people were waiting in front of the cloakroom for the signatures , but only me and my sweety girlfriend got them .
People were so envious ... I liked it!It was fantastic experience .
Next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . You will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
The advertising is everysite .
In spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
A lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
There can be people tired of so much advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
The TV is the most accesible way of communication and people can see the messagen on this way .
In one add there are , for example , the publicist 's work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service 's life ...
To sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
Yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
During summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very regenerating and they make you forget about all the warmness of summer .
Furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this make you feel relaxed .
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I 'm very interested in the position of childminder you are advertising .
I 'm eighteen years old and I 'm doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment , that 's why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n't mind hard work and I learn quickly .
Also I 've just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I 'm suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
Yours faithfully ,
He finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
It was really importatnt for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
He got closer to her and told her everything .
He followed and apoligized her .
Even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
The sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
Practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can gives a lot of satisfactions !
Your efforts will be prized by succeeding , and you can obtain it with practice .
·Introduction
This report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castelldefels .
·Activities to kill time
As our town is well - known for our magnificul beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Canal of Castelldefels , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beah or canoening and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Canal .
These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
However , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
In Castelldefels , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free zumba masterclass , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
As I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·Recommendation
So , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
If you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castelldefels !
You have to take a bus because it is more economical than take a taxi .
I am Engineer of Execution in Mines , entitled in the " Instituto Profesional Virginio Gómez " .
I am particularly interested and I am competent to apply for the post of Chief of operations at the new underground project Chiquicamata .
In first place , my qualities and professional skills seem to suit the requirements of your Company .
On the other hand , I have the theoretical knowledge to use new the technologies this great project requires .
I am also able to lead the operations of the project responsibly and through a team work to achieve the objective and to continue with the prestige that your company has .
My work experience is very outstanding due to I had the privilege of belonging to the " Minera El Teniente " as shift manager , Chief of operations at " Minera Andina " and at the evaluation department of CODELCO projects .
I really appreciate your time and consideration .
It would be a pleasure to discuss personally why I am qualified for this position .
Firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
On the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
Today globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
On balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .
Yours faithfully ,

After that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
As for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .
In conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
Eventhough it seems to be easy to make them , but every steps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .
Everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happinness of people .
A concerned population
While youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
Local authorities helped this initiative creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
People now is worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is called .
I 'm writing you about the staff recruitment for the " New Cloud Generation " project .
For your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .
However it 's possible that we do n't find enough people with that profile so , we could accept people with one year of experience .

You probably wo n't believe me but I met all members of Dżem band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they 're very nice men . Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their authographs on the newest record . I did n't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
I suppose we 'll see each other soon and I 'll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
In addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the next course it will take place next year .
First , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
Working collaboratively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject even English .
This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
In my opinion , Babel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
In addition , I think that the settings are very reallistic and the actors had a great performance .
It reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine Port - Said University .
My hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
Last two years , I worked in many places such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
In my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .
I have seen your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
Although I am a young girl , I think I am a quialified person for the post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after chilren from 3 to twelve yeras old . I consired myself quite patient and fun that in my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .

I would be really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
Although privately oned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
Most people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution .
I would say that most probably private care are not " sustainables " in the long term , and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport .
The population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
Students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
For example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
Last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
For instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
In a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
My father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me their unconditional support .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
The flight was approximatly five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
They were incredible amazing and beautiful .
My aunt gave me a lot of presents because she say they do not see me frecuently and many other part of my family .
In conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and soecially eat a lot delicious food .
Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .
Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
Sharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs
In spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
Although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
The powerful of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
An example of that is the marriage of homosexual where some state admit this marriage , others do n't .
Also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still control on the main decisions .
this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .
also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
In conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .
In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor .
People say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal .
This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .
In conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
However , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
Communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .
Secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
Knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
For instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
However , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
In fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
Because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment " ( pp .
Potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have .
For example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
However , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
In conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
Also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
In contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
Possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
Photography classes for everyone
Introduction
Teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .
Photographs are included in all of those sites .
Also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .
This practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
However , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .
Recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids ) .
This increase is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
Also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of especial skills , techniques and knowledge .
The summertime was first introduced in England in 1908 .
What if you do n't have none of those requierments ?
It 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
You have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
It would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
As far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental care .
In spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to deal with .
The environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids too ancient people .
The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume .
If people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
From my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
In Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
There are many ecological islands .
Nevertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most of the blame .
The most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
Moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
The benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
The Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
All historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .
Furthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .
But I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
When most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
It quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every year .
Moreover navy wars were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .
It is ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .
In my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .
That 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
In this fast moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
Travelling through car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
There are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
Firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .
Variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .
Using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
Similarly travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages .
Everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
To sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages .
There is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
They occupy too many seats , inclouding priority seats .
Furthermore , most of them are students .
They do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
Somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .
Moreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !
In my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
Television is an important part of modern culture .
We depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
Firstly it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
Television can teach kids important values and life lessons .
Educational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .
News , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
Documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
Cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
But television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
In addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .
Television also takes away from family time .
This is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction
I also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortages , personal loans , contability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .
In many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always work with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .
I 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view together finding ways to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
But , probably , this situation is only period of development of transport .
We are told about a lot of innovations in this spheare .
For instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .
Not all people like the idea of Googlemobile .
Some people think , it might take away their independence .
First , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
Second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrenational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
From newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
Many scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .
Humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
High - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
All the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
The higher temperature enhance , the worst the living quality is .
Everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
The terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied heart .
The undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .
I would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistance which I saw advertised .
For the last two years I have joined the swimming group at the University .
I managed to succeeded in many competitions in the country and abroad .
I believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , considering the swimming skills I have .
The job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained and what is more It would provide me new knowledge .
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you should require further information .
I am available to attend an interview at your convenience .
Yours faithfully ,
In our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring from life conditions .
In addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
In this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .
For example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
On the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces about life .
For instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
Besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
In conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
However , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
Furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
Statistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
Another disadvantage is the weather .
In my point of view , Cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
When the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
First , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
As we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .
In other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
Correspondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .
Last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
For a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
People can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .
Though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
Therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
On the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word without the language barrier .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
It seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .
I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .
I hope you considerate me for the job , rodrigo
We ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether .
We had mouth- watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
After having tea , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's garden .
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . '
I had butterflies in my stomach.'Yes , I am fine , ' Winnie replied .
It is because our friendship is more rugged .
What an unfoggetable day !
Inside will be full of conveniences .
Relaxation 's , learning 's , kitchen 's zones and so on .
Television will be cordless , as this way as at present Internet .
Everything depends on the number of people .
Well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer 's efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , backstroke and breast stroke .
Swimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght , it is also the best sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
If you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
I got a lot of experience from them .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time .
For example they know everything about each helper 's jobs but on the same time they just concern own subjects .
I want explain to you some interesting part from my experience .
Technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
Regarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always possitive impact on outdoor advertisement .
From black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imaginable spot .
From buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
The recent developments in mobile technology allows advertisers to offer personalized publicity to each of us .
I''m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in Mallorca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses i will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of Mallorca , or an add from tripadvisor with Mallorca in it .
Advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic side .
But , technology is hre for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
I 'd like to have a big detached house in sububs of Artem or Vladivostok .
So that I could live more freely and independently .
Together we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
Though I am a beginner of it , I think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
Do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
In this report we will see some characteristics of today 's television .
In our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flourished .
All tv tried to get several licences to distribute their shows .
Internet TV is increasing
You just follow a suggestion made bay someone .
It is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world .
Nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
I am a 20-year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
With several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the word .
I am interested in to join your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
For ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to orientate myself in the wilderness .
Furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
It will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cambridge University where I 'll study English for 5 months .
There you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
But if I were you I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
Finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
In my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
Actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somowhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for mains course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
On the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
In conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we had spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
They are incredibily delicious .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways :
As they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
Some of them think that books are more interesting than them film versions .
That 's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
Furthermore , books develops imagination of reader .
Also many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects .
Just like her ... ''Mum I love this doll!Could you bye it for me ? '' she said .
Oh!The girl had so many special moments with her doll!!They looked so adorable together!They were like twins !
She was eighteen years old , she had to be indepedent .
She went there and thera was the doll with a knife in her hand.''Bell , why you do n't play with me anymore?Are you boring of me?Just because I have only one eye?But you removed me the other one .
Just because I do n't have one if my gloves?But you did it again!''she screamed .
The girl had a knife in her kneck and on the wall there was a sentence,''Why did you leave me that way ? ''
Tennis is an individual sport .
It is combination of a physical power , a technique and a mental power .
As the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
Either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
My name is Andrea Cocci , I 'm sixteen , and I saw the advertisement of the weekend work in your cafe , and I 'm interested to work with you .
I ' m the perfect choice for this work , in fact , I 'm interested in different kinds of food because I am Italian , and for us food is everything .
In Italy , I attend school for waiter and cook , and sometimes I cook lasagna , pasta , pizza and many other specialties of my country , and I was assumed in many famous restaurant .
However , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
From my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .
But if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
At first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to intergrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
Its name is " The English oven " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
The decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .
The food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
The've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
They 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
This restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
The restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
During whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
In my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographing .
It seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assess celebrites through the prism of journalistic documentary .
It has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .
However , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
In addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
Secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
If you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
Take an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest configurations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long period .
Last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connected .
Today , we have all the information at finger - tips .
Meeting new people or selling your products , you do nt need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
On the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .
Terrorist activities causing havoc in public live .
Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .
If these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
We need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English . I 've got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought " That 's for me , I 'm the right person for this kind of job ! " .
I 'm motivated , flexible and openminded person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
When I worked as educator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor acitivities .
I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
If you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
Personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
Concerning video - games , I agree with scientits that they thought its help children 's brain to develop , but is important controller them because there are a lot violent games .
In my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
It is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or google information and also connect whit other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
Finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
Nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
Friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their views about it .
The Guardian is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
You could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Travels , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
On the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
For example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
Overall , The Guardian is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
Nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and economy very highly developed .
In my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
Sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life .It seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
They believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
Personally for me , I like books very much .when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
In conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep abreast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
He thought it 's easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
He tried to understand what 's going on with him .
This woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
He knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
She could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
He stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .
In conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
The purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
In the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
As a result , our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .
The local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
That 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
In fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
And that is the negative point , these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n't important information .
I think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish were does the explosion hit .
We made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
What benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
Now days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
Is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
This composition will explain the two different opinions .
Firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
Also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
On the website of The Scottish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...
Indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
As a result , the economy has been increasing .
From this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Do you agree or disagree " Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .
Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .
To further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
For example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
In that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .
The other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
Due to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .
I ended getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
Although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
my name is Bianca Padovesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .
I consider I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English which is very important to communicate .
Furthermore , I am very creative and it is a good aspect of myself , as I can invent new and entertaining games for the kids to have a great time .
I like making puzzles or games which imply running , jumping which are important for the kids development .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .
We needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .
We got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
In my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .
Near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
If you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .
Like all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
There is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
As far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
Unfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .
But on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
So , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
The film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
However , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .
He took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
The film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .
Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .
Every body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .
Especially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .
Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
Cannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .
Legalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .
Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity .
Also this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .
The real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
Finally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
My school is really easy to find , go straight ahead onto Aljameah street then turn right beside the farce of KAU university , after getting down from the bridge you 'll find the school on your right .
On the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria , what is like a little safari , or Doñana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
If I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
The most important thing for Bart is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always misbehaving .
In the Simpson family all the characters are very funny .
A lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
Everything suggested that I wo n't get out of the house for quite a while .
At first , I had observed the letter cautiously , but then I noticed my uncle 's name in it .
Exultation seized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : " What will I do with this amount of money ? "
they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
So called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
All the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n't bother about the order of the municipality .
