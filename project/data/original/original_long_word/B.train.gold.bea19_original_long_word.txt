I would like to make a reservation for the next month , from 24th may till 28th ( 4 nights , Double room ) but I have doubts about booking policy .
I mean , after reading the terms and deposit policy , I understand I must pay the first night at the booking time and the rest of the stay it would be paid upon arrival to the front desk .
Plus , in case I cancelled the reservation 48 hrs before arrival it would charged the 5% of the full stay .
I understand this part , but in case I have to cancel the reservation , how should I do it ?
My favourite sport is swimming because it is the one I have been practising for a long time ago since I was a kid .
I like other sports such as football and volleyball too .
To conclude , I think this is a really good sport to start with when we are a little child to gain experience and year after year becoming better and improving .
First one is individual sports and in this kind you practice your game alone and you are the only player on your team .
A lthough some people prefer individuIal games , but I prefer team games .
Because it teach as the meaning of cooperation and leadership .
I found football interesting because it teach us a lot of morals such as cooperation and onest .
I think it is the most interesting sport
Famous people definitely deserved to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
In our world lives many personalities , more or less known , such a film - stars , music - stars and so on , but why they ca n't have normal lives ?
Actually I have to admit , that , film stars , politicians and other famous people have to count on fame .

I would be very grateful if you would consider my application .
Everything 's ok .
The concert was just flubbergasted .
It really was amazing , I think , it was a breakthrough in my perception of music .
The good thing about it was the fact , that the band(actually I even do n't remember it 's name)was playing with so much passion , that no one probably even think about leaving the place .
First of all , Balkan music turned out to be one of the most irresistible kinds I have ever heard .
Mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music , probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music .

When we arrived there , last summer in July , the owners welcame us with a magnificent basket of fresh fruits in the room and a variety of drinks in the fridge all included in the room 's fee .
I would recommend this hotel to anyone because there you will completely relax and really it will seem to you I you were in heaven !
It still gives me great fun within incredible company of my friends and it keeps me fit as well .
I definitely recommend this sport to everyone who wants to keep fit , have fun amongst their friends , and live happy life .

I would show you the restaurant where is my favorite choice .
If you have interest in my idea , I would help you to find one immediately .
We knew we had a competition and that it was a really hard one .
The other team was profesional , they had won many competitions , they were really good but Tom and I knew that we could won .
Our competition was on Monday , we had one day left .
I told tom I wanted to talk about our achievements before we went home .
He also thanked me and told me that if it was n't for me he would n't even think about playing tennis in a professional way .
I am a University student .

The first one is basically based on a true story of the main character , a financial broker , who is acted by the famous Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio and on how he become rich by breaking the rules and speculating on the stock exchange market .
Walter Mitty instead deals with the fantastic story of the main character , an archivist , whose life will been changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors .
Far from the noisy and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street , Walter Mitty offers to the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character 's life and adventures , through which he will discover his true self and will restart a new life .
Although presenting a more vivacious plot , The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does .
I must say that The secret dream of Walter Mitty is a well - constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who would spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie .
My name is Rebeca Costa and I am writing this letter about the advertisement for job in the USA Sumer Camps .

Yours faithfully
It is undoubtedly true that in today 's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles .
It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport .
It can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways .
People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car .
This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination .
Secondly , public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity .
People therefore find cars more affordable for them .
Moreover , many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car .
In conclusion , i would say that due to recent advancements in society , there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership .
It 's true that sometimes paparazzi cross the line and invade their private properties which I find awful .
That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who does n't , but fame is not the same as being remembered .
We can see that people get famous when they die , so , journalists are basic to create a negative or positive point of view of that person .
" Nowadays , older people are disadvantaged because they lack the ability to use technology confidently . " Do you agree or disagree ?
In our word it 's impossible to live without using technology .
But this is an anachronism .
It 's impossible to stop the science .
The question is whether the older people are disadvantage in using technology in confidential way .
There are not doubts : young people use technology much more easily than old people .
By the way , in my opinion , if someone , for example explain well and calm the use of new technology to an old man or woman , at the end , also these people are in conditions to use it .
New technology consists , for instance , in smart phone , tablet , pc .
There are some old people who are interested to know how work technology , but others who are not interested at all .
For these last one , it 's not necessary to use technology , because they can continue to live without using it .
To conclude , if it 's true that not all people use technology confidently , who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results could be lower than their expectations .
Dear Sir/ Madame ( director the film department )
As requested by a local tourist office , this is a report regarding shopping facilitiesin my town and shops that will appeal to tourists with different interests .
Regarding the actual shopping , it has more than 30 shops with a variety of things , from fashionable clothes to delicious food and even squaint books .
Moreover , it is a source of entertainment starting with children to elders .
Called in a malicious way , there are 6 floors for jewerly , clothes , accessorises , gadgets , books etc .
In addition to that , cheap is the best word describing the costs .
To sum up , it would seem that Downtown is a preferable place , with better value for money .
Although using your own car is betten for moving around the city , public transport has shown to be a good way for travelling lost distances with a low cost and , depending on its quality , also low budget .
There is not probably a bright future for public transport if it does n't develop as it should in the world we are living today ; that is , if enterprises continue with their current already old - fashioned business model , for sure they will lose customers , and so , benefits and weight in the transportation world .
In conclusion , this kind of transport will have to enhance if the companies in charge want citizens to use their buses , trains and other public vehicles in the future .
Those improvements may include lowering the price , reducing the times or offering new destinations and more resources .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to share the experience of different students who had been working abroad during the summer .
In order to do so , I conducted interviews with 30 university students .
Conclusion
Even if there are some disadvantages , most students agreed that this is an amazing experience not to be missed .
All in all , I suggest encouraging students to find a job abroad during the summer .
there are few things which I am very keen and passionate of , in the whole world .
I have been practicing swimming pool since I was six years old , now I am twenty one . this should not let you stay without a clue of how much I care about my hobby .
This is not just a sport but an extraordinary thing I do in the ordinary life , in the everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depressed , frustrating , sick of the passing fancies or fake friends , there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it : this is , of course , swimming .
So I let myself drop in the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged , all the problems , sadness and heaviness of life suddenly disappear , and that 's the most amazing emotion i could ever try .
I advise the parents to let the children begin swimming as soon as they can , provided they are interested in it .
First of all the environment is contaminated and these substances get to us by water , air , food ... also the clothes .
We ca n't avoid electromagnetic waves around , although we were living in the country or far from the industries .
If you want to live with health , you must understand it and try to choose between the few real options you have in your hands .
The main advice it would be to have a balanced diet : a lot of fruits and vegetables , few fats , to drink more water , etc .
Your health needs calm , friendship , happiness ... You must keep in contact with your friends and to spend time with yourself ( do not forget your hobbies and learn new things ) and your familiy .
It is known that Internet makes things easier than ever and can be used for everything .
One of the advantages of the Internet is that we can meet new people around the world and make friends without talking face to face .
In my opinion I must express the facilities given by the Internet .
When you have finished your studies and you have gotten a job where every day you do the same activities , the brain does n't work hard and you might have some problems like forget words , dates , information that you had learned a few years ago because your memory wo n't work in the same way .
I wish to apply for the post of worker in an USA summer camp that was advertised in the newspaper this Monday .
This occupation is of great interest to me as it reflects my determination in life and requires my education , skills and experience .
With majors in linguistics ( to be more precise , the English and Chinese languages ) , I have recently garnered second higher education in psychology .
Two years ago I worked as an interpreter and an organizer of Waterski World Championship in Moscow .
In addition , as I was determined to build my career as a teacher since my very childhood and , moreover , I definetely have a way with children of any age , after graduation I gained experience at University and local school .
In terms of my personality , I am very hardworking , enthusiastic to wide range of activities , open and friendly .
My opinion is rooted in my experience so I really enjoy interacting with people , especially children , and to tell you the truth I like cooking and experience new things in general .
I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this posistion .
My enclosed resume outlines my experience in greater detail .
I welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you .
A wise man in the past said once , " If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climer , the strength of a shot putter , the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer . "

This place does n't appear in History books , however it symbolises better than others a change in our country .
This building is situated in Barcelona , although it 's only a short walk from the magnificent Gaudi 's artwork it is n't as famous as them .
When the Civil War ended , the country was completely destroyed and people had nothing to eat .
Particularly in Barcelona , the trouble was that they could fish on the sea but there was n't an aproppiate place to keep it so they could n't eat one or two days later .
That situation must have been terrible for the population but fortunately , there is always a possible solution .
Neighbours helped them to make the building and after a few months , they began to use it .
This is a great example of how Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without government 's help .
However , the structure has been kept in order to visitors can enjoy this popular architecture 's jewel .
He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle was n't really a battle it was a revolution , were the fish where the citizens .
Which meant some of fish were damaged thanks to the revolution , which also meant that while they were reproducing , the genes of the baby were changed .
And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish , they will taste different or simply change its form .
If there were a revolution in the city , obviously the fish would try to escape .
The homeless man had another dream where there was a pest around the forest that was contaminating all types of food .
When he woke up from his dream kind of having a skeptic attitude , but he was diminishing it .
Nowadays , it is more and more popular to take a year off between school and university .
It has many advantages and disadvantages as well .
They do n't know which university and field of studying choose .
You have enough time to try to use your capabilities and at the same time discover your own calling .
The year off gives the apportunities to get a job .
In the beginning it would be a simply and without high wages job but you would get some experience .
You can get to know other countires and new individuals .
You start your study later comparatively with your friends .
It is also a point that when you do n't execute what you wanted to during a gap year , you are in the same place when you were graduating school .
Last year I attended an art course , which taught me how to make interesting things only with my hands and fantasy .
I have a certificate for high achievement in areas of painting and designing things of clay .
Among my colleagues and friends , I have a reputation to be mature , responsible and easy - going person .
I believe that this will give me the chance to consider my application and got the job .
Yours faithfully ,
Nowadays , television is very important in our lives because there are a lot of benefits and advantages of watching TV .
There are lots of interesting programs suitable for people of every age .
In my opinion TV is useful because we can learn many interesting things and also reduce stress watching TV .
We can choose entertainment programs which are full of fun .
Everyone can choose something suitable for themselves .
Driving instructor picked me at the gas station and from there we went to a parking lot near AMC and practised parallel parking and k - turn .
The instructor dropped me back to the gas station and from there I took a bus to Princeton and from there I transferred to another bus to my home .

To study 1 unit per week was difficult for us , because of translation .
We were faced with the real problem of lack of time for translating , especially closer to the end when our translators have worked with very large texts .
It makes the studying more effective and comfortable for us .
We 're also waiting for information about you fee , order of payments and other terms of working .
So , definitely , if you want to try this beautiful experience , I sincerely recommend it to you .
- I 'm absolutely sure that you need n't drink coffee every morning .
Try to not to eat a very substantial meal in evening and in the morning
Yes , I believe that television entertains and also educates .
Watching history channel gives us great information about the history of earth .
Watching national geographical or discovery channels takes us into a world of animals where we get to see numerous wild animals and their characteristics which are really interesting .
Daily watching news on television enlightens us on what 's happening around the world .
There are also many disadvantages of television .
There are plenty of entertainment programs which just consume our time with no other benefits .
It 's really depressing to see kids being engrossed in soap operas or some useless reality shows or cartoons .
Entertainments are a must , everyone should take time off from their busy or hectic schedule .
If everyone uses television wisely , it can do more good than bad .
Estimated USA SUMMER CAMPS department of human resources ,

the only idea of working in the kitchens it really excites me , because I would like to provide my experience cooking , I started it as an obligation because my parents where always working but finally I liked it , and now I do all sorts of deserts and meals .
I know this is going to be your first visit to Russia and it 's really great ! I 'll give you information about two ways of getting to my place without significant expenses .

Mr. Green , I 'm really keen to know who is the professional film director .

Since many European tourists attempt to have their holidays on the beach enjoying the sun shine and also discover the historical remanings from the past , Antalya ( Turkey ) is the best city to work .

Cyberschool have been attempting to present their new project called cyberschool .
Cyberschool is when students receive
Electronics are bad for our eye .
Some individuals might even become computer addicts due to the time they spend on their PC .
Penultimate , there has been a sudden rise in obesity because of this new project .
Travelling to school at least includes 1 meter of walking , nevertheless staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and health .
Finally , I personally disagree with cyberschol .
Cyberschol are n't interested in health and safety issues !
Now that they are back home , Paulina found out that her mom was in town , so by instinct she decided to go and visit her , as well his brother that has been evading her because she taunted him by being in love with his best friend , they are n't together anymore , but that was such a devastating thing .
Genuinely she knew , that begging him was n't enough , so by going to their old house as a surprise would be at least would give her the chance to confront instead of making a chaos about it , despite this insignificant fraud she knew her mom would be really happy to see her daughter .
There are only limited numbers of government buses on the road and their frequency are not good so they get overcrowded .
People board these buses out of compulsion as they have to reach office on time .
On the other hand , metro service is a good medium of transportation , it goes over the road so you do n't get traffic .
The only flaw of metro service is its unavailability in remote areas .
So even if you travel through metro , you have to take a bus or auto to reach your destination unless it is located near a metro station .
People who are rich prefer to travel by their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience .
In public transport many people do n't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey , it is very exhausting especially in a long journey .
While in a private vehicle you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey .
Many crimes such as pickpocketing , eve teasing , violence , etc take place in public transport .
It has been an easy target of terrorists to plant bombs , so if you are traveling through a bus , you accept the risk .
Recent graduate vs. experienced worker
One of our seniors workers will retire in a month and therefore As I 'm in charge of the Human Resources department has to start the search of a new employee .
It is a commonly held view that an experienced worker will facilitate the search of .
However , I would like to review another options such hiring a recent graduate from a renowned university .
Any experienced worker would bring a sense of calm , steadiness , wisdom , commitment and experience of course .
He will contribute with his life experience , and he will request for better working conditions as salary , family times , and health insurance .
However , a recent graduate will be avid to accumulate knowledge and fearless of trying a different approach .
In my opinion , recent graduates are ambitious , without prejudices and most of them are not family people as of yet .
In conclusion , I would say that a recent graduate would be a great asset for our company as they accomplished our targets .
What disadvantages does it have ?
Firstly , it is true that they have similar relationships that we could have many years ago .
The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch , such as emails and messages , instead of writing letters , which took much time to arrive .
While it is true that social networks help shy people to make new friends , it is also true that young people write their messages with abbreviations .
After doing this regularly , they tend to have problems at school because they start to write incorrectly .
They also publish their conversations on the internet .
But when do this , they expose a lot of details about themselves , details that everyone can see , especially strange people .
In conclusion , I think that social networks can constitute a big problem , especially for people who are not aware of what dangerous there are on the internet .
I am glad to hear that you are interested in visiting Brazil next summer .
It is a little village where you can experience a different culture , find local handicrafts , eat good food and enjoy beautiful beaches .
Near " Taipus " , you could visit " Barra Grande " , where you can see the sunset at " Ponta do Mutá " and eat seafood overlooking the bay .
Television currently occupies a very important role in entertainment , however , one of the problems that society has faced since television became popular is that it is a distractor in education .
There are educational programs and channels which transmit good documentaries , but most people prefer other types of programs , such as cartoons , soap operas and soccer matches .
In addition , many of the educational programs are not transmitted by broadcast television and people without cable system , have no access to these .
So the TV could become a useful tool in the educational process if more effort is put into this , from the television programming to the preference of society-
It is argued that whether the government or teachers have the right to determine what subjects should be taught in schools .
In my opinion , although there are some advantages if teachers were responsible for this task , I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission .
There are two main advantages of teachers deciding what subjects taught in schools .
If the decision is made by central authorities , the most obvious advantage is that the estimation for students ' grades could be standardized in the whole country .
For example , a fair grade judging system is essential in an Joint College Entrance Examination .
Although some drawbacks may exist when this task determined by the central authorities , a committee comprising experts in different disciplines can minimize these drawbacks .
In conclusion , while there are advantages and disadvantages for both central authorities and teachers leading this task , I prefer the government to do so .
On the one hand , friends is like a family because you live together a lot of experiences and adventures .
They are essentials to share secrets or any thing .
In conclusion , so family and friends are very necessaris in your life .
Both texts contribute different approaches to music industry .
Accordingly , the first one considers if the activity has been affected by file sharing whereas the second analyses the live performance success in the present technological era .
The first text asserts that file sharing benefits new artists and offers listeners a wide choice of styles , despite the fact it is believed that file sharing is detrimental for the music industry .
Additionally , the writer suggests that it has some potential which can be used by CD industry .
The second text assesses the attraction of concerts despite the present high quality of recorded music , and suggests that the reasons to succeed may be the communal experience and its offer of different songs and performances that make the live performance an unforgettable experience .
Regarding file sharing , in my view , music industry should adapt to new technologies and habits of users .
On the other hand , personally speaking , I 've always felt amazed by the attraction of concerts over large audiences , thereby in my opinion , the second text offers a good reasons to explain this phenomenon .
The first place you could visit is FEXPOCRUZ , you will be astounded with the gorgeous girls and the fascinating business you can get it .
If you want sightseeing in downtown and enjoy the nightlife , I know a funny place where we can dance and drink a lot .
If you need more information about this city , let me know .
That 's the one of the possibilities which and I can do in winter when I want to be out . Instead of a walk or snowboarding .
And more , I have an opportunity to meet new people .
On the other hand , I can have a cold and temperature or something like that .
Casar de Cáceres is located in the north of Cáceres , you can see a lot of amazing things in this spectacular villa .

You can smell and taste the gastronomic delight that offer , such as the stunning Torta del Casar with denomination of origin .
Many drivers regard travelling by car as a future means to travel which helps people save much time .
However , others believe that public transport is better due to the fact that public transport is environmentally friendly .
It is a known fact that travelling by cars is less green than by public transport .
In the present - day society , sustanable development is of paramount important as our environment is being destroyed on a fast pace .
Using public transport helps save up resources such as fuel and electricity .
If ones insist on travelling by cars , they are , in fact , producing greenhouse gases which are given out by their cars .
It is surely not envirnmentally friendly .
To preserve our environment , taking public transport is a must and a global trend in the future .
All in all , public transport should be an indispensable part of our future plan because we have to protect our beautiful environment . Travelling by cars , although much more convenient , is never a clever choice for the betterment of our future society with the severe environmental issues .
If everyone start using car for traveling ; the road wo n't be enough to everyone as there are seven billion people in the world ; and even for environment it is better to use as less as possible .
On top of that , fuel consumption would be too high as we have limited availability of fuel resources .
The government and public body should start thinking about it and to save the society public transport is the best .
Certain age people wo n't be able to drive a car so that they definitely need the public transport .
I can understand the use of public transport is decreasing now a day , but there is still future for it .
Everyone should think about it which is really vital for the society ; and specially the international body should do something about it to motivate people to use public transport as much as possible .
So in summary to save the environment , to make the road accessible to everyone public transport should have been used and we all should try to educate people about the importance of public transport .
They live in a little town in the Massachusetts .
He asked Jessica to come with her , but she did n't agree because before marrying him she would try to see if their love could hold out against everything , also the distance .
She was disappointed and try to explain her thought to him , but he did n't want to understand her reasons .
Then , I would make the next recommendation .
Nevertheless , the sport store is a little expensive .
However , these three ones are the most visited by tourists , so they will not disappoint you .
They argue that a large number of people prefers travelling in private transport , because it is more comfortable and convenient .
Travelling by car can give you a certain status quo and make you feel more independent , besides the comfort and convenience .
Firstly , travelling by bus or in other public transport,(as underground ) , help us to decrease the emissions of gas , which causes pollution and global warming .
And the last , ( but not the least ) , public transport is muche safe than the private , because it transports much more people , and so , there is more cauttion .
Detoxification , a method people often use to lose weight , has not been proved by the science .
People think that it is a common and effective way , but I believe once there is no scientific evidence , it should not be brought to the weight loss process .
In fact , some people just understand an aspect of this method , that is to say , they have applied wrong method .
However , the way has brought some unexpected results due to their wrong concept .
In fact , some deaths have been caused by bringing detoxification to weight loss process , because they follow the majority without carefully considering .
Generally speaking , the method has not been demonstrated by the scientists , so it is better to avoid it in order not to get some unexpected consequences .
Film stars and politicans are interesting for people because of their talents and special abilities .
Of course , people want to know some facts of personal life of famous people , but often star dont'n like when journalists try to get in their life .
On the one hand , famous people try to hide thier life from journalists .
In the everyday life , the internet has became one of the most important things and it is becoming more and more influental .
In the second part , with the internet we can follow the news and current affairs very quickly and we do not have to wait for the news on the television , and we do not have to buy newspapers .
In conclusion , the internet have pros and cons , but it can be very useful and fun to use .
Gnadenthal is a very small , consisting of almost only one single drivable road village , which is not famous for its size , though .
What is really special about this little village is the Christian brotherhood , living there more than 1000 years .
That probably is the reason why the local circumstances are still similar to the ones of the Middle Ages , exclusive of some infrastructural improvements that made deceases like plaque redundant .
The few houses themselves are set around a very old , Romanesque church , which is bordered by a traditional farmyard for growing sheep and cows .
Nearby , fields with growing vegetables can be visited , which never has been altered by any modern machine but only by the power of hand and cattle .
Gnadenthal is exceptionally suitable for people who want to take some time off their hard and stressful daily life in order to find calmness and to think about themselves in a way of their character .
Since there is no chance for any distractions because of the missing digital infrastructure , any guest will experience a four - day visit the same as a four - week journey in the usual western world .
This enables him to get used to the traditional way of life of a monk .
By conserving this place , the opportunity to gather a great amount of psychological enrichment is conserved , too .
Hi bro , Whats up by there?.I'm going to recommend you to give up from sport , as I told you too many times , sport its bad for health , it makes you to be all day with legs or arms broken or something like this , and the music is improving and stimulating your brain and intelligence .
But also I told you that if you are so good in sports you might get a grant for your studies which will get worth it so I do n't know , in my opinion I would continue with the music if you are good at cause is better for your brain but also sports can relax you and make you disconnect so if I were you I would think about it and compare which of both of them you like more or makes you feel better or relax more or just makes you laughed or have a good time .
So , I enjoy running alone or with friends , because this sport have a lot of possibilies , more than I believed when I started to run after finishing High School .
Therefore , we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths than pavement .
Later , I have had more roommates , colleagues and partners even who practised this sport , which is among the most fashionable ones at this moment .
But , for the beginners , I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence , and practising with company because running may be bored , tired , dangerous , even , but if you get a strong spirit and will power , you 'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses .
I enjoyed it and got achievability from it .
Through the train of Karate , I understand myself really .
Since most of these public transport amendments have been remedial rather than something planned foreseeing future problems , they have only been of limited help and , therefore , they have only worked for some time .
This has resulted in only the very in - need people using public transport , and the vast majority of people still use their personal automovile , with the incovemiences and safety being an excuse .
Indeed , using public transport is not only unsafe and uncomfortable , but also unhealthy .
So , little by little , and as economic conditions of people improves , public transport will eventually disappear .
In the past , I tried to play basketball , tennis , ping pong and so on , but the outcome made me depressed and less confedent .
Especially in New Zealand , there are some beautiful islands and you can get to them by ferry easily .
If you are interested in trekking , you should buy water - proof clothes just in case .
In some place , you will find difficulty in finding it .
Let 's start trekking as soon as possible , otherwise you will miss opportunity to see fabulous scenery .
During the last decades , the number of cars used in big cities has increased steadily . Proportionally , air pollution and deaths associated to traffic accidents have also augmented .
One way to reduce those negative consequences is to foster the use of public transport .
It moves more people per liter of oil used and contaminates a small fraction of what it would had been if every passenger had traveled using an individual car .
However , public transport lacks some advantages only found when using our own car .
First point , which I would like to menchioned about is cost .
Cars are n't cheep and if you think that is easier to move form one place to another when you have a car , you have got a point but there is a lot of considerations which you should occur like : gas , insurance or parking cost .
That could be frustrating especialy when you have long road and you need to spend long hours driving .
Finaly , the word conviniend for everyone means something dirrerent .
Being there has some advantages and disadvantages .
I can start with saying something about advantages : we are not just classmates but we are friends .
But there are some disadvantages like stairs because we are at the second floor . We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many strairs to reach our classroom and that 's so annoying sometimes .
Furthermore , travelling by car is a very comfortable way of transport .
As you may be concerned , cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages .
In addition , cars have been increasing the world carbon emission and that causes the ' Ozone Layer ' to thin down .
To sum up , cars have advantages but , on the other hand , they can also create problems .
In my opinion , cars are one of the best and most useful inventions .
Unfortunately we should be careful with the way we use them .
You 've chosen the best country for attending university .
Travelling could be a good way to improve your lenguage and to know better Italy .
You should absolutely visit Rome and Florence !
These are both amazing because are full of history ; in the first one you can still see Romans'monuments instead Florence offers lots of Medieval churches .
Meaybe you 'd choose to attend univeristy in one of these cities !
Italy offers lots of work opportunity during summertime .
Adam was twelve years old , a clever boy in his school , always gets the top marks and participate in most activities , known for all the teachers and students .
He also participated in the school football team and won the state club .
Despite all previous things Adam was alone , has no friends in school or in abbeywood street in Queensland where he lived in Australia and Adam was very annoyed about that and what make it worth a boy called Johnny who had insulted him and Adam did n't want to have a fight with him .
He realized Adam 's marks are getting low and he involved in some troubles in school and began to investigate him .
In matter of fact Mr Michael should have provided some advice for Adam when his marks got low but he didn't , and the consequences were very bad so , Michael closed the door and know at that moment he had made a mistake .
I know this is not easy but there is an ecological and cheap transport : the bicycle .
For short distance it is a good way to do exercise and to avoid contaminating .
But let me tell you that I was confused in the best way , not because it was rather wacky but because happenend unexpected .
The plot revolves around an FBI squad who face , in a game of cat and mouse , a team compounded of the best four illusionists .
They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances , sharing out the stolen money with their audiences .
If I have to stand out any weakness I will say that is a bit predictable .
As it is a movie related to magic tricks when a sequence is played and it seems simple and easily understanable you know that , indeed , it is not .
On the other hand , if you are looking for a film that is extremely gripping and can keep you guessing , it 's definitely the right choice for you .
Exam stress leads to many bad consequences towards High School Students .
These consequences vary , one example would be that students may get lower grades on their exams , or even fail them .
They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness , since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam .
As a result , many High School Students may not concentrate during classes , or whilst studying since they have many things on going through their heads ( since they 've been studying a lot ) .
Based on all the problems listed ( and many more ) , we must find solutions that will help both students and professors to deal with exam stress .
The study guide does n't need to necessarily be a long and complex one ( since those may cause them stress too ) ; they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises .
Then I decided to study engineering and becoming one the best engineers ever .
Long after that due such I was a natural talent about engeneering , I began to write books and essays about everything realted with my job .
People looking for comfortable easy life .
We are all looking for that without great difficulty or effort and one way to achieve this goal is to study abroad .
Many students today like to study abroad to get high level of life to get their life job and experience a new way of life .
Studying abroad can enhance employment opportunities .
companies are looking for well educated people with a good experience to hire and students more likely to fit their choices .
With your certificate you can easily fine a job .
Universities are also a rich place for big opportunity to get there if you have studied abroad .
You can work at a university as a lecturer and get a high salary .
Students who go to study in another country experience a variety of life .
Try new food in completely different places .
Learn how to do everything by themselves and become independent .
To sum up , studying abroad is a great chance to get a great job as you have higher education with much more experiences .
Moreover , you can learn many things and expand your knowledge , have friends from different backgrounds .
Do you remember our arrangement ?
Furthermore , on Tuesday and on Friday we wo n't have class and we will be able to go running and cycling .
Besides I 've a big surprise , apart from remembering our agreement , my father is taking up hiking with his friends and he has offered us to join in .
Nevertheless , what about having lunch on Saturday and speak it quietly ?
I 'm writing in response to the announcement in International Sports Monthly .
I would like to say that my favourite sport is birdwatching .
To begin with I am interested in birdwatching because from when I was young and I want to be a biologist when I grow up .
Birdwathcing really relax me and bring me closer to the nature .
Furthermore I enjoy being able to recognise the different species of birds .
If someone wants to start birdwatching , I think he should be interested in birdwatching first .
This means that if he does n't like it , he will definitely give up immediately .
Then he should buy a pair of binoculars or a telescope .
To sum up I believe birdwatching is a really exciting sport but you must like it to start it .
Sports or hobbies could be great options like new activities in order to plan in my college , however I believe there are others which could be provided for us and it would be interesting to take part in .
In addition , it could be interesting although you do n't have to do physical actitivy , because of your capacity to redaction a speech , support an idea , have a connected speech will be got better in this kind of activity .
I think that the allure of this activity is you can meet a lot of people and share with them that experiences .
In conclusion , making a speech contributes on our social relasionships and it allows us to define our personality .
I am glad to understood that everything is OK about you .
I am very grateful that you will help me with searching some information about colleges in England .
Actually , I am interested in science , especially area between chemistry and physics .
Also , it will be interesting for me tuition , which refers to biology and influence in different kind of chemical compounds over the human body .
You know that I had learnt biotechnology at school in Bulgaria .
Customer satisfaction is much great when he gets service which has value or quality much greater than he expected .
If service meets only the expectation and does not provide anything more than it , means customer satisfaction is there but customer would not feel great .
If service is not meeting expectation of the customer or its quality just below expected , it causes customer dissatisfaction .
This will result in consequences such as negative feedback .
In this context it can be concluded that 78% of the respondents are satisfied with both the customer services of builders and results of Vasthu .
Rest of the respondents have positive feedback .
The factors which hinders other respondents from giving very positive feedback may be either dissatisfaction caused by customer service or failure of meeting results of vasthu to their expectations .
It is one of my favourite free time activities .
Personally I , watch a comedy movie almost every evening .
I respond to the article " White House calls for ' genuine choice ' in Hong Kong elections after petition attracts 200,000 signatures " on SCMP .
In fact , china will not be moved by this , and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong , China and the US .
It is better not to interfere the internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China 's politic conditions .
The US is supporting this illegal activity indirectly .
The US always keep " rule by law " as their catchphrase , but Occupying Central is betraying the Hong Kong law .
According to Wiki encyclopedia , FBI called the occupier as " terrorist " and decided to suppress the dispute as settling terrorist attack .
So the US has no qualification to criticize China .
Apart from this , the president election in the US is full of unfairness .
I do not know if there is filter for president candidates , I just know that the ballots are counted in states .
After Hong Kong gets " real democracy " , the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent .
The US always target on dividing China into many small , weak countries , then it can break up a competitor of itself .
Let us see counties that the US introduced " democracy " to it .
Egypt , Iraq , Libya , Syria , there were chaos for " democracy " everywhere , and the next , might be Hong Kong .
I am afraid that Occupying Central would lead to chaos that similar to Tunisian Revolution .
The signature collection of the White House now ended .
Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts both are considered crucial for students education .
Some people think that knowing fact is more easily and practicable .
Nevertheless , others consider learning ideas and concept is the best way to confront many academic and real - life problems .
In my view , l completely agree with the idea that it is important to students to learn idea and concept than learn facts .
However , ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues .
From this experience , I learn that I do not just remember facts , but try my best to understand ideas and concept .
Consequently , you can reach high academic levels .
However , learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks . .
When , students catch the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply .
It was massive materials on a specific issue , but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points .
Not only do student learn more in their studying , but also they help students understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways .
He is so brilliant , he speaks three languages , plays several instruments , and the most important of all , he is a man of remarkable principles .
When he was younger , he worked to the government but he had to quit because of the corruption .
He always wanted to have his own business , he used to say , if you work for somebody you are part of the problem , but if you hire people to work for you , you are part of the solution , so if you want to be successful , be your own boss .
When I try to create in dreams , the home of the future the first thing , which I have in mind is new technology . in my opinion , homes in the future have to be different , this is connected with our society and development .
In general houses could have open space , a lot of windows and light everywhere .
In my opinion , inside they will be looks still in the same way , maybe more technology connected with new inventions .
One of the most impressive solution will be swimming pool in the sky , near area .
They will be more comfortable and useful for our community .
We find a very cosy and traditional houses , the market was very populary , with a lot of people walking around , and the people were very nice to us .
The next place was a restaurant near the beach .
Near the restaurant we saw a very strange thing .
When we saw me in front of him , he immediately invited me to dinner with him .
Because I never heard beautiful words like that about me , I accepted the invitation without thinking .
When the night comes I went to the restaurant that he invited me to go .
Since then we have been in touch and by now we are dating . I think this is extraordinary .
But one day , my sport teacher gave me the opportunity to became a basketball player with nine years old .
Since that day , basketball became as my favourite sport .
You would like to become a basketball player too ?
A player could win a game , but only a team could win championships " .
If you remember that , and understand it , you will become a great basketball player .
All of us are surrounded of plastic , plastic is needed in our everyday life for a lot of things .
However I also think that it 's important to be concient with the environmental concernts , so some ideas like this could be good to reduce the rubbish .
So we can use the plastic in a responsible way but we have to know that we should n't follow this idea until the extreme because we need plastic .
I watched till they DRAG him away , and then everything got quiet again as it there was nobody , so I 'm sure the cops will ENFORCE the guy who did this .
A couple 's coming slow on Frankstown with a girl by the hand , had to be the boy 's baby sister .
Could they hear my old mind working to guide them , lead them and TREND them and get up out this damn wheelchair and take them by the hand .
But , unfortunately , were not in the future .
The other benefit of living abroad is an incredible personal experiences .
Therefore , this experience opens you up to different ways of viewing the world which may alter the rest of your life .In addition , it gives your children a much better understanding of other culture when they attend international schools .
Congratulations !
Near the mountain ( about 20 kilometres ) you can find beaches , but I recommend the beaches on the South , Andalusia .
There are many kilometres of coast and there are a lot of sites and parties to enjoy all the time .
Travelling in Spain is easy .
Not differently of much of the world sports lovers , I 'm sick about Football !
Not just a really competitive game ; Football is a full mix of art , creativity , dedication , hard work and team cooperation .
When a very skilled player finds himself in a hostile work environment ( with talented but selfish players who are n't committed to their " team play " ) he tends to lose performance and lack good results in matches .
Supporters of traditional clubs can be very passionate .
Usually , when facing tough opponents or decisive matches , they turn the stadium in a really large party in order to intimidate the adversaries ; coloring the benches with flags and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaics to express their delight .
If someone asks me what is the most important thing to start practicing ( or even following ) this terrific sport , I 'd say it 's the passion in wearing your club 's jersey and the respect towards your adversaries ' .
For years of wars and difficult situations the history was creating people 's beliefs and convintions .
I think religion means a lot for people- especially polish people .
I want to describe a story of the Monastery of Częstochowa .
Its a city in Poland strongly connected with a dramatichistory of our country .
The icon , depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child , known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was imported from Russia in 1384.And since then a lot of pilgrims has been visiting that picture .
Polish people had to defend Częstochowa and rescue their countryBut the polish resistance was smaller and smaller .
Immediately the fighters of Sweden began to stop attacking a hill .
He promised that the Madonna of Częstochowa will always be a polish queen .
I think it is a perfect example of an important historical place in my country .
I think everybody who lives in Poland must go to Częstochowa .
On one hand we have the people who lives on their sport , on the other hand there are ones who do any sport , indifferently , because it is just a way to lose weight or a way to spend their free time .
Unfortunately , I have not a favourite sport , although I 'd like to .
It is likely you would have got more self - confidence if you had worked harder during a course .
So , for the unlucky ones like me , my suggestion is If you did not fall in love with any sport , you should try a course ! You will surely feel better and more relaxed after that .
Tarragona is an interesting and beautiful place for spending your time .
It is an important city and there are a lot of attractions .
Restaurants and clubs
You should go to the restaurants located in the harbour of Tarragona .
All of them are based on the typical Mediterranean cuisine .
Mirabel , Aquamar and Siroco are the trendy restaurants .
They are very comfortable and cosy and a good price .
AT night has a special atmosphere .
Watching the Mediterranean sea .
Conclusions and recommendatios
Tarragona and surroundings are a good place to visit and to know their culture .
First , Parents are a great source of experience which can be helpful in teaching .
Secondly , they have a close relationship with their children , which results by feelings and emotions .
As mentioned earlier , Experience is a prerequisite for every teacher .
It does n't matter that they have failed or gained success on those events , the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events .
In this point of view , children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences .
I myself , have faced with so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents .
Once I was 18 years old , I had to make an important decision about my university major .
So I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities .
I was hoping that , my decision was the right one , but it was n't actually . I had chosen electronic but my parents told me to have some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronic .
I did their recommendations and I totally changed my idea .
So by considering different ideas and opinions , finally I chose computer engineering as my university major .
So , Parents ' experiences can make them strong teachers for their children .
They have a strong familiarity about favorites , skills , talents and all other valuable information related to their children .
Regarding this information , they can teach their children and help them to make reasonable decisions .
So I came to my parents and asked their help , they presented the best recommendations for making the decision , then I could make the best friends that I can easily go along with .
I am really satisfied by my parents as my indisputable teachers .
All in all , parents are a great source of experience , which can help them to be good teachers .
Also they have so many close relationships with their children , which makes them a trustworthy characters as teachers .
When the weather is good I often go out with my friend for a walk in the countryside or do shopping .
At least I enioy to take care on my garden , where there are many flowerbeds with a lot of kinds of flowers .
Actually I do n't like very much the computer games , because in my opinion they are so boring!I also think these games get a sort of dependency , like the alcohol or the drugs , so they can be very dangerous !
For example I use my computer to prepare exercises for my students or to look for funny and useful laboratory 's experiences of chemistry .
This is a documentary about the science .
I like watching it because in this programme I can get a lot of information .
For example I can know about the Big Bang , the origin of the universe , it 's fascinating !
In this programme I can have information about the last scientific discovery and the
technological development .
In my opinion it is one of the most interesting programme about the science on TV .

At school , children had been tauhgt about how to do an apropiated use of the electric energy .
there are many people that offered themselves as volunteers to clean the city , and had been very helpful to make the city cleaner and more attractive .
" Seven " is a story about a psychopathic serial killer , who kills on behalf morality and ethics .
In particular , the killer kills seven people each one corresponding to those - that according to the Christian religion , are the seven deadly sins .
All the murders show characteristics reflecting a specific deadly sin .
That provides , especially to one of the two detectives who are investigating about the crimes , a trace to follow in their investigation .
In the movies are some references to the Dante 's " Divina Commedia " Italian poem as well as to the Bible .
The film is excellent because of both a very exciting and engaging plot , and great interpretation of the main characters - the serial killer and the two detectives .
Many times when I was on shopping , I was unhappy or disappointed for different reasons .
Unfortunately , we realize at home , that our wallet is empty .
When it comes to bargain sale , on such period people start to behave like animals and rarely think reasonable .
Nevertheless , some people treat shopping too seriously and as a result become addicted to it .
I 'd like to present my application because I think I 'm the right person that you are looking for the job described in your advertisement .
There , over the last two years , I 've been a Leader of a group which was involved in the organisation of Courses for young students with learning problems .
I was in the school swimming team and I 've got the first - aid certificate .
Each years , in the summer holiday I 've worked in the " Summer camp " organised in our neighboorhood both helping in the kitchens and organising sports and various activities for children between 6 and 13 years hold .
In the wonderful world of cooking that we live where we have a lot of products and chefs so good , I would want to visit an Italian restaurant because I love cheese and I think that Italy is the best place where you can eat a different types of cheese in the world .
The perfect atmosphere for me is a modern build that it has different rooms with different styles : modern , classic , gotic , etc .
When I eat in a restaurant I hate two things : people smoking and the high level of voice of the people .
Whereas , I love two things too : a friendly waitress with her traditional black clothes and a light on my table that make the night more romantic if you dinner with your couple or more relaxed if you dinner with your friend .
I think that an Italian restaurant is a great place for my class because there they can choose between different fantastic dishes for example : pasta , pizza , seafood or pork .
I enjoyed the time off from the University .
My time off from the University is significant to my personal development .
learning can also take place outside the University campus .
As such , we develop through interacting with their environment .
While on holidays from the University .
I was able to inspire some members of my family to send their children to University .
I told my friends and family members the importance of University Education to our community .
I visited many interesting places i.e. nature reserve , historical places , zoo , rivers etc .
Also during this period , I was involved in a local community project to build community hospital . while on this project , I interact and shared ideas with other professionals on the project .
While on the time off from the University .
I took a part - time employment with the local housing company .
This part - time job gives me the learning opportunity to develop my skills and understand the practical aspect of my career .
This practical experience gave me the opportunity to understand the importance of supervision .
I earn some money to pay my University fee and rent for three months . I also received a very good reference from the firm which was passed on to the University .
They would like to offer me another opportunity for work placement on my final year at the University .
My parents are both English native speakers but to learn more about the culture I studied languages at the university and now I 'm graduated in English and French so this job is also an opportunity for me to improve my English in another state and not only with my parents and family .
In Italy I worked as a babysitter for a couple of months , I took care of 3 kids : 1 child is 7 years old and the others 2 children are both 11 years old and back then I had to cook for them lunch and dinner .
At the university I was part of the football team and we won the championship against one of the most athletic football team in our country .
I think I 'm an energetic person , that likes all the types of sports and activities but the most important thing is that I love kids and playing with them makes me really happy .
The convenience of travelling by cars benefits the majorities of us in a modern society .
Car manufactures desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of a car .
By making it more modern , powerful and economic , they have successfully attracted more customers than ever .
As result , the rapid increasing of cars on the road brought negative consequences .
Firstly , vehicle 's emissions can cause detrimental effects on the environment in many ways .
Secondly , vehicles contain many different fluids , including motor oil , antifreeze , gasoline , air - conditioning refrigerants , and brake , transmission , hydraulic and windshield - wiper fluids .
In most cases , these fluids are toxic to humans and animals , and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed incorrectly .
In addition , traffic congestion has become another worsen problem .
The traffic Jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days .
It is considered to be one of the longest traffic jams by some media .
On the other hand , modern public transport has been improved progressively in the past decade .
Its comfortable , efficient and economic features have been attracting more young professional .
In 2013 , the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides , averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2 ] Shanghai Metro system are 14 metro lines and 329 stations , with an operating route length of 334 miles , with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013 .
In addition to the convenience of public transport , the fare is much cheaper compare of driving a car .
Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport pass as a benefit .
The public transport in my city is very convenient .
Even though our subway system is still developing , the main line that pass through downtown , several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourist , students and professionals 's prior choice for commute .
There are some park and ride stations allowed car drivers to connect with the subway , It is very convenient and encouraged more people to drive less .
Eco - friendly awareness has positively affected young generations .
I think it could be a good idea to try the restaurant " The old clock " .
The restaurant is charming and fascinating , located in the old town 's center .
It 's an ancient brewery which keeps a particular atmosphere .
The menu in not really wide - this is good in my opinion , because I 'm quite suspicious of the restaurants offering too many dishes ... The restaurant serves fresh food only , depending on the season 's products .
There is also a good choice of food for vegetarians , so Mike and Ann will have not a problem to eat .
Last but not least , the price is good , especially compared with the quality of food and service .
I was lying on the couch with a mystery novel in my hands!. It had all been just a nightmare!.
All over the world , the number of overweight people is growing .
Obesity is one of the most important challenges of the current society due to the fact that people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly .
This essay will look at the some of the key causes and effects of overweight among people .
Having looked at both causes and effects of overweight among people , it is recommended that people take care of eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a health lifestyle for their own benefit .
I liked this shopping centre because it has a lot of women 's shops inside , the facilities are quite atracctive and very up - to - day , the green zones are wide and it is supplied with a lot of wooden benches .
Peter looked at his watch and knew he had to do something immediately .
The sky was cloudy , the temperature was below zero , the wind made him not being able to walk and it 's now when he realized why was her sister celebrating her wedding on these dates .
For me , these are the most incredible sports that anyone can perform .
The ideal is to start practicing this sport as children , because the oldest you are is more difficult to overcome fear , but it is never too late to learn to swim .
This sport combines the movement of arms and legs with breathing , as coordination between these parties is crucial .
Among the advantages of swimming we can highlight the following :
Improving the respiratory system .
5 . Relax not only the body but also the mind , so that the stress decreases considerably .
If you want to know more and learn to practice this sport , we recommend attending a specialized school , there are many good and not so expensive , where you can count with the support of a qualified instructor who will give you the confidence to start .
As per our discussion earlier on the Service Guide Sales communication , I would like to ask you if you already have started to prepare the background and sales communication materials for having these service guide and how to use them .

I propose to have a meeting to discuss the process / timeline and align our communications to the marketing and sales community .

About the weather forecast for next month , I 'm afraid to tell you that the temperature might fall down .
There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Driving your own car gives you more freedom in travelling and increases your sense of independence .
However , a car is not always more economical to run because for example , you have to pay road taxes , insurance , and motor tests .
Not to mention the combustible .
The main reason of this , is that cars use diesel or petrol , whereas trains use electricity .
From 17th to 20th March me and my schoolmates , and also the 2 M , went to a trip to Sicily .

Besides , my car is considerably powerful than other means of transport .
I want to see tropical animals , birds and meet with local population .
Travelling by car is muc more convenient , as many people say , but public transport is much better for the environment .
Many people use public transport every day and I think this is good for our communication , because we can talk to other people .
It is also good for our environment because there is just one bus for 80 people .
Public transport will increase in the future , because every year there are more trainstations , and more streets .
Only by looking in the eyes of the stone - cold danger can he evade the disappearance himself .
My favourite sport is swimming . I like it because it makes me feel free , independent and happy .
It is an individual but also team activity .
In my opinion it is one of the healthiest sport there are beacuse you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breath .
I do not practice swimming in competitions but almost since I was 3 years old .
I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates .
If he was afraid of the water it is not recommended to practice this sport , or be able to break down his fear would be a great goal .
It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you .
If we talk about my favourite sport , basketball will be .

From my point of view , friendship is based on the honesty .

This company has the intention of setting up some training courses for staff so I came up with the idea of having a course that concentrates on company morale .
I strongly believe in the idea of having a comfortable office environment , because when you like what you are doing and also where you doing it , you will do it the best you can .
I recommend that everyone at this department take the course , that way we could have the perception of all the employees and focus in what we need to improve and canalize it into profits .
This courses will last about a week and I suggest we only take from two to three hours per day so it does n't become tedious and we can keep everyone interested .
In conclusion this will get everyone feel part of the company and have everyone 's opinions .

Travelling has an important role in our everyday life , we need to get to work , school , want to meet our friends .
On the one hand it is more convenient to have a car .
Owning vechicle is very comfortable and gives you independence .
It enable you to go everywhere you want no matter when .
You can also stop caring about how much you taking to work and on trips , being able to hide all those things inside of your trunk while it is impossible in any other means of transport ,
Moreover , travelling by trains , trams or buses produces less exhaust fumes and as a result saves ozone layer .
To sum up , travelling using public transport is more beneficial for both environment and travellers .
I am convinced , that in spite of comfortable cars , public transport will be constantly developing .
Stem cells are undifferentiated biological cells that can differentiate into specialized cells and divide to produce more stem cells .
They can also treat or prevent a disease or condition , and are used by the scientists in researches , and by the doctors .
There are a lot of people in this world that are ill and need stem cells in their healing process , so parents that had an abroted foetus should let the scientists and the doctors use the stem cells in their research , and help other people .
Science nowadays developed a lot , and gave the population a lot of possibilities like storing the stem cells and using them to heal the future health problems anyone could have .

In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable , especially for men .
Sometimes , your shopping turn out to be unsuccessful and you are desperate because you wasted money .
If we look around us , we can see a lot of facilities .
For this reason , we are always involved in the project of improving the facilities for life , and one of the most important aspects of the project is the home .
Nowadays , we have a lot of electronic devices such as microwaves , remote contols for tv , electronic devices for cooking , personal computers , and so on and so forth .
Each one make the everyday life a bit more easy , but a real progress on home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind .
An inner electronic system would compose the whole house ; it would include small devices of wave reception connected , in every side of house , to a gum headband whose function would be to identify the neuronal stimuli and to convert them on radiowaves .
This system would also be connected to the Internet in a ' dual output port remote of information ' .
Having explained it , I am completely sure that this outline of my ' house of future ' will astonish and marvel everyone who read my sublime project .

Travelling by car is much more convenient than using public transport for various obvious reasons .
But , considering the increase in private vehicles in our crowdly populated world , it is recommended by geologists and eco - scientists that we use public transportation .
By this way , we not only contribute to saving our eco - system , we also contribute to increasing the national revenue .
Our interaction with human beings have pathetically reduced .
Exchanging greetings , expressing emotions , updating work status , gaming , studying and more have become activities we do using mobile phones .
Cars are mostly used by people travelling for long distances in shorter time .
Inside cities and for shorter distances , nothing can be more comfortable and safe than public transport .
Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely , but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with our people .
For centuries the population of the world has been dreamt of commuting anywhere comfortably by car .
It was thinking about this major problem that , the governments from around the world has launched the greatest and ambitious plan .
To start with cars are going to be made by using the high technology at lower cost , therefore affordable to all .
City development is already under construction .
New motorways , streets , parking are not longer sit on the council 's offices , waiting to be signed , they are reality transforming the world landscape .
Could we ever think of such dream coming true ? All this is beyond my imagination and understanding , whereas the use of new technologies could be used to give the world a much better healthy environment and less egocentric .
I am very interested in to start a pet - care franchise because I like pets and I think all these services would be very helpful for a lot of people in my country too .
Can you tell me more about the possibilities of taking out a Petpals franchise in my country .
I would like to know with how many initial investment I have to calculate ?
In your article you write from a education center with assistance for new franchisees .
In the future our lives will be much more difficult because we 'll struggle for everything alone .
Everyone will get help from the machines or technological items .
Technology will be our best friends .
Despite this our appearance will change .Our fashion will be more technique .
What about the relationship ?
Well , I do n't think that we will build a close relationship with anyone and building a family will be even worse .
The family might exist on paper but not in real because each member in the family will be busy and they will just send some masseges from the high technology phones they 'll have at that time .
I know , it sounds boring and pessimistic but if we wo n't change our minds imediately , the future is going to be like that , for sure .
From an overall perspective it is notable a higher amount of illiterate women in all the regions compared with men , who are in some cases the half part of the total of women in each region .
Developed countries , Latin America and East Asia are the three regions that depict a low percentage of illiterate people , expresed below 20% , whereas Sub - Saharan Africa , Arab States and South Asia are above 30% of people who do not know read and write .
Developed countries figures are the lowest , being almost at 1% , whilst South Asia numbers rose extremely , reaching almost a 60% in the case of female gender and overtaking the 30% in the male gender .
As we can see , an unequal percentage are shown depending on the area where the people come from .
Buenos Aires is a city made for tourists , visitors can do so many activities in a small radio of the city , dance Tango , eat traditional meet or visit a beautiful library are some of them .
Furthermore there are many places where tourist can buy many things , such as a typical mate or a picture from the obelisco porteño .
But if visitors want something more than a typical souvenir , they can visit canteens or a bar where are set tango shows and take they own pictures or even buy a CD with the traditional music from Buenos Aires .
Even if you want just go shopping for clothes , there are so many places where you can go , Palermo is known as a little New York for the disigners and well know marks , and technology is set on Recoleta .
So , Buenos Aires , also know as the Paris from America , gives all visitors the opportunity for meeting Argentinian tradition in only one city that involves the history and the culture of the country .
Pontevedra in its way to become a green town .
Pontevedra has been one of the most polluted towns from Galicia for many years .
We started to appreciate the advantages of walking .
At the beginning , this was a much controversial decision .
Finally , he has championed moving Celulosas factory to a safer place .
Pontevedra is going greener .
Nevertheless , our passion is still strong .
In many countries , it 's consider that the relatives are the close family and the only people with an individual can be just the way he is .
This point of view is based on , for example , that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members , like your cousins and they know everything about you .
In conclusion , from my point of view , it 's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family , like envy , refuse or hate .
But , family not always guarantees these functions neither friends .
It is a lovely place not far from our school , and I think it 's interesting in his natural habitat .
During this year she had explained the harbor world , in particular the world of Miramare , and I describe the same things under the geography aspects .
I was just a bit worried because in this class there are 28 students , but they are very respectful and clever .
Every students were interested in the information and they asked a lot of explanations .
In this day the students had the oppportunity to hear very interesting things , but not as they were in a class during a traditional frontal lesson .
They had improved their knowledge making experience in the field .
In recent years , whether using internet is beneficial or not has never failed to attract people 's attention .
While many people believe that internet brings a vast amount of problems such as reduction of interaction between people and some bad information resources ; in contrast , I have a strong position that internet brings manyfold benefit than drawbacks .
People should first recognize that searching information these days is much more convenient than in the past .
We must come to library to pay a lot of time finding information we need on the shelves the earlier time .
On the other hand , we can assess the information with only a click button nowadays .
Clearly , the assessment become much more efficiently with computer and internet .
Yet , perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using internet is that the vast amount of information contended in it .
All the information in the world can emerge immediately after a click .
Admittedly , some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough , it still offers us many other useful sources .
Simultaneously , some sources contended pornography and violent information which make many people afraid of using internet to search information .
Nevertheless , it remains a good way to reserve and supply information which hoped to have more flows in the future .
I think , one of the important historical places in Japan is the Kiyomizu temple in Kyoto .
It has five stairs and one of the tallest historical building in Kyoto .

In the last ten years , Brazil has created a wide range of governamental programmes .
Educational and medical assistance , as well as infraestructure improvements are some of the recent advancement .
One of the best examples in education has been a scholarship programme called Science Without Borders .
It offers students a unique opportunity to study abroad aquiring an international standard qualification .
In addition to this , it provides them with access to the newest research developments .
As a consequence of this investment , the state is contributing to the improvement in the career of Brazilian professionals .
On the other hand a problem could stem from the lack of incentives to the nationwide educational institutions .

PEOPLE LIVES WILL CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN THE NEXT 50 YEARS .
This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages that we will find the next 50 years .
It will consider some relevant items which will be completely changed in the future , as well as arguing and explaining the pros and cons of everything .
Furthermore , environment will suffer the terrible effects of current lifestyle .
Consequently , protected clothes , which will be made with materials and NASA technology , will be worn by future population .
In fact , the development of different vaccines would be possible to get over a great deal of diseases .
It started when I was 12 or 13 years old , his music meant everything to me .
I really hope this " hiatus " , this is how they called their break , they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends , managers or the media around them .
Famous people live completely in a different way than unpopular people .
It is believed they are extraordinary , perfectly beautiful and incredible happy like we see their in magazines and TV .
Unfortunately , truly it is n't so amazing like it seems to be .
There are a lot of disadvantages of being a star , of witch normal people do n't realised for example not having a private life .
There are a lot of various viewpoints and I would like to consider them .
Almost every their mystery come out and they are still judged , criticised or joked .
Journalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance ath the cost of them .
Being all the time in a centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming .
That is why a lot of big name suffer from depression or even try take their life .
On the other side , there is a price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this .
People can not have everything and live like they want .
They ought to apprecciate what they have and stop complaining aboout their life , because there is plenty of people , who dream to be them .
They have not got expensive cars , detached houses , they ca n't afford travelling and their only entertainment is watching TV .
However , nobody has everything they dreamed ; it is normal , that always in our lives something would be annoy us .
Famous people have to notice , how much they have , apprecciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life , because it is not such a disaster like they often think .
Day by day , the power of consumption increases more and more and one of the areas you can realize this is in the traffic .
People who have facilities to buy or finance something and looking for convenience , have a great desire to buy a car .
The bad quality of public transportation and the lack of options like underground and train , helps people choose to use a car .
These things makes we think if the public transport has a future , after all to do all the things you need in your routine like to go to work , to go shopping or just to go out with the family , is more comfortable by car than by bus .
Cars nowadays have technology that allow both drivers and passengers to have a better travel while listening to a music or use the internet without having to spend hours standing during the journey .
The government needs to invest in better conditions of the public transport , with more options to the transportation of citizens , in order to make it easier to go from a place to another , and hardest the decision to choose between car or bus .
Everything has two sides and the choice of transportation is not an exception .
Firstly , travelling by train , metro or bus can lead to the reduction of gasoline consumption .
As a result , they offer low fee and play an important role in the environment protection .
It was reported that for one hundred kilometers running , each car was consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline , and released a certain proportion of air polutted .
Meanwhile , with the same amount of energy , bus carried fifties of people , and even up to as high as hundreds of people with the massed transportation .
Secondly , it could not be denied that travelling by car is convenient , however people who agreed with the idea point out that high quality and modern public transport such as Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable .
can also satisfy passengers who could not travel by plane and require to take long haut jouneys .
There are some places in developing countries , for example in remote or highland areas , people have not seen a car for many years , they have no choice except old buses to travel .
In conclusion , public transportation is still the first choice of people in the future .
There are some similarities ; however , differences in the educational system cause differences in the attitudes to education .
University education is valuable in Australia , just like in Russia .
In general most of employers prefer applicants which achieved an academic degree .
The most important argument was that travelling by car is much more convenient .
The fact that you can travel anywhere at any time is undeniable .
If you want to buy some vegetables for your dinner you will have to wait until the next train arrives at your station .
He started his career when he was sixteen years old through kart competitions .
After only three years he passed on Benetton formula one team and two years after he won his first driver championship .
In 2000 he won his third driver championship with Ferrari and also won it consecutively for three years .
Then Ferrari with Michael decided for a new collaboration , so the greatest become a test driver tried to improve the car out of the racers .
Like every German , since he was a young driver , dreamed being a driver championship with the national car .
To summarize he arranged a meeting with the head of Ferrari and the media press because he would like to announce his defenitively
retirement .
This unfortunately was only an excuse he was only pretending to retired as he already signed a contract to drive Mercedes .
At the end of the conference Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
These persons usually give arguments such as that the public transport is never in time , or that is difficult to get your destination using it and without having to take 3 different routes or even that public transport is not as suitable for a made up short notice trip as can be a car in property .
In my opinion these arguments depend on how efficiently designed is the public transport system , having in count number of routes , timetables , cost of the tickets and facilities for users who use it frequently .
It 's quite well known the benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community : an important reduction of contaminant gases , a hight decrease of acoustic contamination as well as , as consequence of having less cars circulating by our streets , an increase of pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking , running or cycling .
All these benefits surely will contribute to a better future for all the habitants so let 's give a chance to the public transport .
The city began to take care of the environment only in the last ten years when the studies created technologies for not produce pollution .

Therefore , the risks of the extinction to the Giant Pandas are real .
I am on the point of finishing my Engineer 's degree in Mining Engineering , specialization in Energy , at Vigo University .
I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing the First Certificate Exam , planned for July and June , respectively .
I would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level , and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these targets .
Thus , the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of realizing an internship in your company .
In this programme , the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor .
The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence cost , so the company is not required to pay him a salary .
Furthermore , as the programme is endorsed by European Union , the trainee disposes of accident and liabiliy insurance .
As for the duration , the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months , being 3 months the period covered by the subsistence grant .
I will be completely available to do the internship from next September on .
I hope you will consider my application , and look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully ,
Now Italy has quite problem with the occupation , it 's very difficult to find a job and the most people find a job in supermarkets .
I live in Valpolicella , a famous land for the wine , and I had already worked in a four stars hotel for high school .
IT was a good experience , the hotel has every comfort you can imagine : a reastaurant , a S.P.A. , a gym , indoor and outdoor swimmingpool , a beauty center and a church .
The personal were n't so much helpful , but someone luckily gave me some advice , especially the porter Artan .
Valpolicella has many location that worth to see : first of all Lake Garda , a lake with the famous phallic shape which divides three different regions ( Veneto , Trentino and Lombardy ) .
Orlando Duque , the Colombian diver , is the champion of high - jumps of the FINA World Cup 2014 , stated that since 2007 he is thinking about retirement even though he feels with force and desire to go to the World cup of 2017 in Guadalajara , México .
" I am thinking about retirement since 2007 . I have been lucky because I injured , I got better " , said Duque during the press conference of the World Series that this year will end up in Mexico on 17th and 18th October , after the competition of Bilbao ( Spain ) .
" I was 40 years three weeks ago , I feel motivated to train , while I have the motivation I can continue ; now I have no an exact date ( … ) I just have set 2017 in Guadalajara " , said Duque , who was the first sportsman who won a world championship of falls from height .
" Jumps have been my life , I have spent all my life in the jumps and it motivate me to do it , I want to continue " , explained Duque when he pointed out that he still has several screws in his right ankle and he is still lacking recover completely .
The Natural Well Ik Kil , which is located three kilometers away from the archeological zone of Chichén Itza , will be the final one of the Jumps season , 2014 and in that season Duque and the Mexican Jonathan Paredes will face each other in order to be between the top five spots of the season .
" The plan is to win this competition because I always compete to win .
In the male test , the high - jumpers are thrown out into the water from a height of 27 meters in height , whereas in the female competition the launch pad is placed 20 meters away .
One may ask why among all those possible activities , this one was chosen .
This is my favorite sport for it improves health in some many ways and boost the resistance and quality of life .
The first times may be hard , in that they require a preparation a sedentary person does not have .
After the first trials , however , improvements are shortly noticed and the results come quickly : better breathing , uninterrupted and quiet sleep , and an unmistakable sense of well - being .
Despite being a common and easy to do activity , running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well .
Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce the uncomfortability and keep one 's feet in a nice temperature .
Notwithstanding , a formidable pair of shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period .
This way , there will be less trouble when practising the exercise .
Everybody can do , it is practical and simple , and the goals can be set in accord with the person 's needs and restrictions .
I always considered football as a piece of art .
Players must be considered as a paintor working in a piece of art .
Only results will be recognized at the end .
There expectations will be considered unuseful .
Everything after a successful result will be a plus .
So if someone ever is woundering start practising this sport , they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win .
I would recommend them always remember that , so if things do n't result as they expected , they wo n't feel disappointed .
We are people and all of us must have private life including celebrities .
There is a great number of politicians and film stars who are followed by paparazz who are trying to know more about their private life .
I agree that film stars and famous politicians must have their free time because they are working for people everyday .
It is quiet hard to have a rest when journalists are trying to know some exciting things about your private life .
On the other hand famous politicians and film stars have chosen such life .
It is a part of their everyday life , they are used to be on public and they are used to say something about themselves on cameras , so all the people will know about their life .
There are some moments when celebrities need some time to be with their families and friends and journalists must not touch such moments .
In the modern world , the company which has excellent stuff is more competitive , and these employees are usually motivated .
It is clear that staff would spend more time on their tasks if they were motivated by their boss , while unmotivated employees are more likely to spend less effort in their jobs .
Generally speaking , there are two basic methods of employee motivation : rewards involving money and non - financial rewards .
Many leaders believe that money is the best , however , from my own perspective , the non - financial rewards are the best approach to motivate employees and I will prove my opinion in this essay .
I had never been very frightened until one day that something strange happened .
My sister claimed that in her trip , she had seen completely astounded buildings , but while she was talking , we heard a very loud scream .
Outside was getting very cold and the sky was dark , so we could n't see anything but nevertheless we continue walking through the trees when suddenly we saw a very big shadow in front of us .
Ana and I decided to go outside to look for Michael , when we went out , he was in front of the house , doing strange sounds , when he saw us , smile to us in a malevolent way , then made us to back inside .
My favorite sport is basketball .
One reason why I love this particular sport is because it 's based on cooperation .
For example , if you play basketball and the ball is passed regularly then your team is more likely to win because passes cause confusion and exhaustion to the opponent team .
On the other hand if he chooses to play professionally then he must try hard .
Regular exercising is potentionall so that he / she can build up strength and endurance
One of my favourite restaurants is one located in a delightful town called Ubeda .
The restaurant has a characteristic decoration indeed because you seem to be inside a train .
However , the most impressive thing is the game of flavours that explode inside your mouth .
The connection between quality and price is plenty balanced .
I know from personal experience that it is worth tasting the gourmet sampling menu .
I really think it is suitable for the class because each one of us could know in advance how would pay to eat there and besides this could taste the main courses of this restaurant .
Without shadow of doubt I am absolutely sure this could be the best option for our class .
I 'm not a great fun of films based od fiction , unrealistic facts and events .
And that 's obvious because it 's the first serious production of this young , prospective director , whose ' Flushed " became a worldwide hit .
An enormous amount of additional attractions for viewer provided me with unforgettable feelings .
Everything came us a surprise and you did n't expect that this or that action is just taking place .
The movie requires from us to be strongly concentrated on what is going on and I find it to be one of mostly conceiving factors for those who still have some objections .
The director gives a choice to broaden our mind and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe imaginable ending of the gripping story .
RECOMMENDATONS
Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers , under no cicumstances can we miss it !
The profile of millions of recent graduate and professional people in Spain is a young person , well prepared and without work who are thinking of going abroad as a good chance to get a job .
To work abroad can offer you a good opportunity , maybe it would never happens in your own country , instead .
Furthermore , as well known , salaries are higher in other European countries than in Spain , so your life conditions may increase the same as your career ladder .
On the other hand , going abroad without your family might be a really bad experience , because you may thoroughly miss them , maybe because you are not able to visit them as much as you can due to living far away from home .
The weather may be a disadvantage , as well .
For example , if you go to work to England you can see off the bright and sunny Spanish days and say a big welcome to the frightful English weather and depression .
To sum up , the disadvantages of going abroad are higher than the advantages , but every cloud has a silver lining .
Maybe , many people who have studied did it to get a job opportunity in their own country , but life is life .
I have got one sister , she is 15 years old and her name is Tina , she is also going in Fribergaskolan .

Three words that describe me best is perhaps , animal lover , happy and a perfectionist ?
I like food , especially Italian food , It is my favorite food to eat .
My favorite restaurant is " La Piazza " in Djurholm and it is of course Italian , I have actually been in Italy twice , in Rome and Florence and in a small town named Lucignano in the countryside .
When we were there last summer , I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called Hoopoe .
Some of the books I like is named only way is up and steal the show and is written by Emmy Abrahamson , I think she is a very well author , another author I like is John Boyne who has written the terrible thing that happened to Barnaby brocket .
I love to design presentations and edit things at the computer but also in real life like my room , clip - art and more .
Parkour is a discipline in which its main proporse is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B , in any kind of environment , the safest and faster way without causing no harm to your body .
One of the faundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method created by Georges Hébert .
Basicaly , the method is based in develop the main foundations of moviment of the human body , they are : swim , run , walk , jump , quadruped moviment , climb , lift things , balance and defend yourself .
He had a great background in gymnastics and , sice he was a teenage , he used to do a lot of exercises .
The roots of Parkour was developed by him and he taught some of Parkour thechniques to the fireman which he used to work with .
His son , David Belle , was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too .
David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment and then the actual Parkour was born .
Some people say that David criated Parkour but , in fact , his father develop all the idea of the discipline .
David adapted it to the urban environment and created new moves .
Parkour is n't just a physical discipline , there is also the philosofical part . Altruism , " be strong to be useful " ( it is actually a frase Natural Method ) , develop your body and mind so that in a dangerous situation you will be able to save yourself and other people and so on .
There are less people who use the public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than in public transport .
For lot of people , travel by your own car is more comfortable than travel by public transport like bus or metro , because you do not depend on a schedule , that it is very common when you take public transport .
Conversely , when you travel by your own car , you save a lot of time during the journey .
However , public transport has also advantages .
On the other , travelling by metro or bus pollute less than going by car .
The reason is that when you use the car , you normally go on your own and when you travel by metro or car lot of people are travelling at the same time as you .
The consequence of this is that in the near future the public transport will disappear .
The company ensures the quality of water from production to distribution .
The product will be registered with Ministry of Helath and SriLanka standerds Association and adhere their rules and regulatiuon for production , storing and distribution .
We will not compromise the quality of the production process or the product for any cost .
The company will ensure that , the low negative environmental impact due to the production process .
The direct supplies to offices , households and hotels also will be given good price with the delivery service .
We will rent water dispensers with a maintenance services to required customers in future to attract more customers .
During the last century , our way of life has changed completely , even in villages .
To resolve this trouble , my village has created a plan to teach its population how important it is to take care of the environment and how to do it .
For this reason , we have new containers to separate all rubbish : we have to throw away bottles , cans and cartons into the yellow ; paper and cardboard go to the blue and there is another one for glass .
At the school , children are learning how to spend less water or electricity at home .
I hope these simple actions can be used for other people because the environment needs that we work together for a better world .
How interesting !
Anyway , he built a skyscraper , which is called 21 .
But that 's not the most interesting thing !
It 's an unforgettable experience .
It may not be your cup of tea , but I think it 's the most interesting and beautiful place in our town . I 'm looking forward to see you !
When visiting Copenhagen during summer time there is a huge variety of shops and restaurants that will give you a sense of the Copenhagen lifestyle .
Afterwards , take the bridge over the lakes and enjoy a full day of shopping .
When you are tired of shopping take the bus to the West Side of Copenhagen where there is a vast choice of restaurants , everything from Italian to Chinese to Danish cuisine .
If you like an evening stroll or a night out , walk through Istedgade for a glimpse of the old Copenhagen and the nightlife is offers .
In the following paragraphs I 'll tell you what they told me .
The first question we discussed was : ' Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufactures ? '
An argument some called was:'In case we remove this whole industry , then there would be an humangous group of peoole unemployed , and that would be a problem . '
Next question we talked about the following question:'Does it have too much effect on models ? ' They did n't have to think about their opinion , they all directly said ' Yes ' .
In their opinion young people , also themselves , were very busy with fashion and clothes .
Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kind of clothing , just because they thought they would have more friends then .
The next question was:'Does it make society materialistic and competitive ?
I asked them the question:'If you liked a piece of clothing but your friends did n't , would you then have bought it ? '
I totally do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transportation because of car existences .
General public are using the public transportation more than before .
students who are not allowed to drive still using the public transportation and they will always do .
Moreover , the traffics on areas such as down town enforced people to use the public transportation as train , since the trains are faster .
Insurances are so expensive in north America , most of householder are not using the car because of insurance , and also because of adding cost as fixing the cars , changing car oils and etc .
Furthermore , Government are enhancing the public transportation by services they are providing with lower cost . the fair for raid in public transportation are more less than the cost of driving the car at the same distance .
Finally , none will argue that the benefit of using cars over public transportation , but that does not excluded the public transportation .
how are you ? I hope that everything is all right .
Although I was watching it from backstage , the atmosphere was the same as I 'd have been watching it in front of the stage together with other fans .
There is a lot of work during the concert preparation .
We had to check if everything is correct : sound , light , special effects .
Besides , we have to watch if the band have everything that they need : something to eat and to drink , I was responsible for it .
It was an unforgettable experience . I will never forget it .
The opportunity to meet your idols in real was the most exciting .
I will tell you everything when we meet !
Attachment we return you back text of the doctoral thesis of , directed by Dr. , requesting you to fill out the detailed report of evaluation , also enclosed .
We explicitly point out that this report is compulsory to proceed with the necessary arrangements for the deposit of the thesis .
I did not do everything I wanted because I was forced by my parents to go to Boquete .
But once one of her friends told me that before the kiss , everything was to be ok .
Belarus is not a popular tourist destination nowadays but a lot of people would be surprised to find real medieval atmosphere in Grodno , a western city of the country .
Two ancient castles remind us of the times of kings and nobility , quiet pedestrian streets show us the life as it could be in the 1800s .
Grodno is situated on the crossroads of great trading ways that 's why one could hear Polish , Jewish , German , Lithuanian there .
Its multiethnic population was the reason to organise and held the Festival of national cultures every two years .
It 's worth visiting because traditions of the ancient Belarusian , Tatar , Russian , Jewish shown alive make us feel history itself .
City of different religions , different nationalities and " talking stones " is waiting for you .
REPORT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY TOWN
The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve or Zoo makes it very attractive to tourist visitors .
A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities .
ATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES
There are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics .
These include facilities like ample vehicle parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge , elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls in the case of carrying very heavy loads of purchases and relaxation spots like Cinemas and gaming centers for kids .
In addition , most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people ; as this is a statutory requirement to building a shopping mall .
SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS
It products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors .
Another shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market .
This is where you would find several shops that sell most African traditional artifact .
CONCLUSION
I hope from the explanations , I have been able to convince you with respect to my opinion about the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities that abounds as you take your time in considering visiting them .
In developed countries , four wheels gain high appreciation in everyday transportation .
In capital cities of Europe one can easily notice how many people prefer their own means instead of the pushing crowd of public transportation .
It is however well known after a plethora of scientific publications that cars harm the environment dramatically .
On the other hand , modern citizens like to be part of green revolution and carbon footprint has an effect in everyday decision making .
Many organizations and public authorities encourage workers to use public means of transport to and from the job place in order to minimize greenhouse gases emissions and save natural resources .
As a result , before private transportation reaches its pick for 21st century , it is more probably green mobility overlaps it and dominates in people choice .
There is great future for public transport , same for bicycling and on foot travelling instead of cars and other polluting machines .
Do n't be afraid not to recognise me because I haven't changed a lot in two years , but for your confidence I will be with a bright orange suitcase .
I would like to visit Big Ben Tower and many other places that you will propose , but I do n't really want to see common tourist sights , so if you could show me something that not everyone can find , I would appreciate that .
I am doubtless it is an easy task : here you can visit many entertaining facilities , where you can find technology or culture , for example , and there are also many places to eat , dance , etc .
The great view it provides is incredible .
The Times Square is a good site for buying too , although the excessive quantity of advertisement is a little bit annoying .
Finally , the Metropolitan Museum of Art is a good place for people who like history , antropology and viewing a lot of types of arts .
Remarkably , teenagers like eating this and it is where you can find one of the best .
If you need more information , please tell me .
I utterly agree with the statement : travelling by car is much more convenient , because you can go wherever you want without waiting for a bus or train at a bus stop or station .
I think that travelling by car is also more inner and comfortable because you only travel with people you know .
Talking about money probably car is more convenient , even if you have to pay for fuel , highway and everything that is necessary to the maintenance of the car .
As a result , if you use public transport , you have to pay an expensive subscription and different tickets .
So people prefer travelling with their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way .
Eventually we should use public transport to reduce pollution , but they have to be more checked and repaired .
I agree with the statement , fmous people deserve to have a private life without life jouralists following them all the time .
Usually journalists also following them all the time .
Sometimes happens , that journalists write some silly gosspis about famous people , which are not true .
It may be a danger for family of a celebrity , politician , famous person , because of them some could broke up .
They want to be rich and famous and they know , that journalist will be follow them .
In my opinion , the television has an important role in the society because it can influence in people 's life .
I mean people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language with different programs that television offers or just put subtitles to make it simple .
It 's important to know what it 's happening in the world because it can enrich your knowledge culturally , politically , etc .
Besides you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if many severe situations are being occurred in your country .
Children learn a lot of things with cartoons , it can help them to improve the speaking and to know new vocabulary .
The television is one of the most important media .
So , for that reason I think television can entertain and also educate .
I 'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if it 's sad or the break of someone 's on its free time .
I always believe I can become an engineer and computer technician to invent more things since I was small .
After I receive more and more information about some successful engineer and inventor such as Steve Jobs , I realize that no matter who you are and how smart you are , you can not live without a healthy body .
Consequently , I believe physical development is the necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful for providing me opportunities of extra - curricular activities .
Therefore , to maintain my body healthy and my interest , I keep on joining the School Aquathon since I was secondary one . I participated the same events each year .
Besides it gave me a motion to train harder and never have a thinking of giving up that I need to keep my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body .
I learnt setting a proper goal as it is a significant factor to success .
I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after take part in School Aquathon and saw others got improved but not just me .
School work and examinations gave me huge pressure so I found a way to strike a balance that I learnt playing windsurfing .
In my eyes , windsurfing is special and indispensable to me .
Under the recommendation of my instructor , I joined the Joint school windsurfing competition .
On that day I found something wrong with my position on the result board . I was shocked and decided protest for the wrongdoings of the race committee .
To know more information having a green lifestyle , I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013 .
Also , I learnt communication skills with friends .
One of the purpose of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle , so I got a better physical development .
To have more different experience , I have joined the " Dialogue in the dark " experiential exhibition .
In the total dark environment , I experience the feeling of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their livings .
After undergo this experience , I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future .
I get a greater passions in engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life .
Also I have learnt the communication skills with others and be considerate .
Under the colorful school life , I undergo different type of experience and I finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician .
I think it is not a good engineer who only got skills of engineering .
Therefore I reckon my experience can trained me to be admitted as a suitable candidate of engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal .
People differ from each other and everyone have various professions .
Being a politician or a filmstar has something in common : those people are famous .
And , as a draback of being acelebrity , they are followed by papparazzi almost everywhere .
I think that journalists should remember about the private life of famous people which is deserved to stay in secret for other people .
There are a lot of cases known when journalists would make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists .
Besides , being foollowed by unknown people ought to be quite a scary experience .
Some people would say that it 's necessary for usual people to know how the politician lives so they could know if he should be trusted .
my listening is goood and I can understand .
I do lots of grammatical mistake when I am speaking and writing .
I like to read books and travelling to different countries and knowing there culture .
I have two kids they go to school , I would like to join English course in the morning from 10 am to 2 pm of anyweekdays . I want to start the course as soon as possible .
After some time the bus stopped for 5 min and Michael bought two chocolates , chips and a soft drink and offered her a chocolate .
This is how they start their conversation and while exchanging conversation , they felt as if they know each other for a long time ... they got attracted towards each other and in the midst of that they kissed each other and even exchanged phone numbers .
Their bus was about to reach their destination next morning so Michael offered her to drop at home and the girl agreed with a smile .
I am writing with regard to an advertisement that appeared in the local newspaper recently .
This advertisement requeste a group of young people to work in summer camps all over the USA .
First of all , my name is Lorena and I have twenty - three years old and I am from Spain and I would like to job in your summer camp because I can improve my English level and earn money ; my English level is so good due to all this year I have been in English academy to learn the language and now I am going to take another certificate ; and just like that I will be able to communicate with children .
Secondly , last year I stayed in a beach summer camp and there were children aged 6 - 13 , besides my partner and I prepared water activities when the weather was good , against ; when the weather was bad we prepared puzzles games , adventure games , etc .
The advertisement talks about work in the kitchens ; our summer camp was little because it was in a small town so we had to cook children food and I could do it without problems .
Yours faithfully .
Honestly , as eight years old boy who knows Christianity close to nothing , his knowledge of Christianity was lower than a 3 year - old child .
Anxiousness got the better of him as he prepare himself to enter the sanctuary .
WHATTTT I MISSPELLED MICHAEL!!Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
Public transport means travelling around the world and cities by using trains , buses , taxi , airplanes etc .
First of all , travelling by cars is more expensive than travelling by public transport ; cars should pay for gas , insurance , repairing , environmnet fees etc ; travelling by public transport is more ecological and cheaper .
In conclusion , public transport will not be affected by using private cars .
Suddenly two people dressed as astronauts were leaving the park and advertised to the young boys to go to their house and wait until these unfortunately event was over .
While they were walking back home they heard a journalist commenting what incident have happened to the park .
The only thing they could clearly heard was : - But this can only be caused by the contamination , although these windy day hasn't helped .
Jackson stopped walking and get distracted by a beautiful dog , Michael continued on his way unaware Jackson was n't following him .
Almost arriving at home and mulling over the thoughts take his own conclusions to what could might have happened .
What I think it 's stupid is that most people use to hide their faces from behind the screen and no one wants to appreciate a sunny day anymore !
What I disagree about this video is because he is generalizing too much .
I think it is cool to have a social network , and there is nothing wrong to let kids enjoy the technology that became part of our generation .
However , they must be controlled and especially by their parents .
The thing nowadays is , if you disconnect from all of the things we have , people make fun of you and say that you are old or just do n't know how to deal with the modern world .
I 've experienced this , so that 's why I am saying .
The internet has caused me depression once , I felt really alone and I used to be someone who I was n't in the real life , but I learned how to deal with it .
Sportswear , elegant clothes and of course accessories .
In the summer time , Milan offers a variety of facilities and services , especially for young people .
Visiting the centre of the city is really fascinating : Piazza del Duomo is one of the most suggestive squares in Italy with the particularity of the white marble facade of the Dome and his multitude of pinnacles .
The surroundings are dedicated to the fashion : you can find the most important shops for whom Milan is known in the whole world .
The Sforzesco Castle is another suggestive historic monument and the green Sempione park is one of the best place where people can practise sport or can attend a yoga class in the middle of the wildlife .
Finally people can experiment the Milanese nightlife in the area of the Navigli , which are really crowded from 19 till late .
Here you can experience the typical Milanese aperitif , during which you can have a cocktail while eating whatever you want and you can get to know many young people .
The police announced checkout is the murder motivation .
Suddenly he hears a weak voice whispering ; do not try to stop the shadow , let it kill the criminals or you 'll die .
He checks everywhere but ca n't find anyone .
He goes inside it and discovers a half decayed body that was compatible with Mendez identities .
He understands that the shadow was ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez 's murderer .
Alison read the note , smiled , and immediately put on her coat .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in Pamplona , and to outline some recommending shops that might appeal tourists with different interests .
Shopping Facilities
In addition , several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located on the centre with easy access and cheap rates .
Although most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of " Bulls Running on the street " , many become passionite about the cuisine of Navarra . As a result , a few shops such as " LA VINOTECA " and " DELICIUS " have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food .
Recommendations for tourists
I would strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter about their interest , should visit the special shops aforementioned .
In my opinion , celebrities should remember that if they want to be famous they , probably , will be chased by paparazzi .
On the other hand , they are still normal peolple , who have families , partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes , without cameras , media , newspapers , flashes and spotlights .
Probably , they want to go on holidays without recognise by other people , without giving autographs and taking photos .
And celebrities well know that they have to be controversial cause that is the best way to achieve their lovely famous .
So big names try to go somewhere without guards , without make ups to show themselves to cause some juicy gossip about them to gain famous in the easiest way .
To sum up , famous is ambivalent and people who want to be famous should realize it before become a star .
I found the advertisement on you website and I 'm sure that I 'm the person you are looking for .
Although I 'm Italian native speaking , I 've been studying English for seven years ; furthermore last summer I spent two months in Philadelphia so I can communicate quite well in your language .
I 'm really cheerful and hardworking , and I have good marks at sport .
Thank you for considering my application .
Yours faithfully ,
I absolutely agree with the statement .
I understand , they are rich , their lives might seem interesting , even more interesting than ours , but they are not so different , they are not better than us , ordinary people .
Many of journalist or photographers think when they write some gossip about politicians or when they take some " curios " photos , it 's ok .
It must be really stressed when you ca n't come anywhere without journalists following you .
And also it must be really uncomfortable for friends or family who go with you .
Of course some of famous people might like this feeling that they are so likely and favourite and they , who do n't like it they have a posibility to protect their privacy better or more or pretend that journalist following them do n't exist .
My town is a very good town for taking care of the environment .
Our town is full of green plants everywhere : in the school playground , between the roads and many other places .
Plastic substances should be reused .
People with dogs will be sentenced and will suffer heavy consequences .
City X helps reforestation in many countries and places such as Brazil , Java , Sumatra , Peru , Guyana , French Guyana , Surinam , Bolivia , Uruguay , Paraguay , Colombia , Venezuela , Equador , Chile , Indonesia , Bali , Malaysia , Singapore , India , and many more .
New technologies are changing the way of thinking private cars in a new much more save and ecological way .
On the one hand , public transport is well known by their large amount of benefices like less pollution and more economical aspects .
Moreover , large crowded cities using underground or bus are usually a good way to avoid traffic jams , saving time and stress of sad drivers during commutations .
For that reason , fomenting the use of public transport has been the main concern of most of modern governments .
On the other hand , huge technological improvements in car features like self - driving , electrical engines , solar power and others , have created a new perspective of conceiving the way we interact with cars .
Usually , cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving . Resulting as a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time we are driving .
However , that is really close to change by Google 's Self - Drive Car which is a new technology able to drive our car to any destination without humane intervention .
Furthermore , the car could be empty and go anywhere we command .
That exiting news open a new world of possibilities for the use of cars .
In addition , many other improvements like electric engines from Tesla are getting new benefices to this new concept of Intelligent - Cars .
To summarise , cars are going to be so independent , ecological , cheep and intelligent that we will never take a public transport again .
I have a brother named Markus who wants to be a professional tennis player when he gets older , he is 17 years old .
Seems simple but looks beautiful , sometimes the simplicity is the most perfect accessorise .
Nowadays people care more about themeselves and making good things for some of them is wrong !
I 'm sad when I see a nursing house but you know , there , people will never talk whether they do bad or good and in the end of the day , they will not care only about themselves and their insecurity .
I am really happy you write to me for some advice and I am very honourated that you want to spend some time in my country .
It is very beautiful because it is structured like a mountain ( and so you can start from the last floor and then you go down visiting other floors ) .
In that wonderful city you must visit the statue of Jesus Christ called " il Cristo velato " made by marble and then you must visit the centre of the city , full of fantastic features that make this city really particular like Spaccanapoli , Hidden Napoli , S.Gennaro 's treasure , S.Severio Church and so on .
I think you could work as an entretainer in some tourist villages roun the country .
In that way you colud improve your way to make a relationship with people and also it could be a great help for your theatrical experience .
I know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your hability , so I think that you could do some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts .
Nowadays , people have different viewpoints about whether the most principle concern of choosing an occupation is salary .
Personally , I disagree with that the money is the most important consideration for deciding a job , because there are several factors equally important .
I believe that other considerations are as important as money .
Firstly , the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned .
Working in a company which is built up with good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily obtain the fulfillment and keep passion in job for a long time .
We would believe that this job is worth contributing to for life .
Secondly , the co - worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job .
Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring workers the senses of belonging and enjoyment from working , hence the working quality may arise greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessary for people 's daily lives , satisfying their basic demand .
For example , the expenditure of food , drinks and commodities need the support from the steady income .
Furthermore , we may need much more money to have some activities , such as worldwide travel or outdoor camping for days .
In addition , in the life - long consideration , health - care would be increasingly important with people getting older , hence enough amount of money as a stable income could not be disregard .
In conclusion , while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people 's choice of profession , I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors .
There are various reasons why I am absolutely fascinated by this martial art .
Behind every single movement you will find gracefulness and power .
Once entering a class , you are able to fully concentrate on the sport .
There are certain procedures in the beginning of a class which encourages you to empty your mind and be ready for class .
Especially in our hectic world it is very important to find to yourself and just listen to your body .
As a martial artist you start to get a great fitness and your balance will improve a lot as well as your flexibility .
Many characteristics will increase immensely such as confidence , self - defense or responsibility .
However to see any improvements you should attend regularly and at least twice a week .
I 'm writing to apply for one of yours advertisement publised in the local newspaper last week .
I 'm 31 years old , and I have had the priviledge of working as a teacher all my live , so I am an experienced person capable of taking care children .
Due to my experience as a teacher I am sure that I could have any difficulty in organising sports and inventing a wide range of activities in order to entertain children .
As well as , take part in activities about cookering .
I would be grateful if you would send me more information of this work and you can get in touch with my on 671234567 .
Yours faithfully
Personally , I think the best month to come to Italy is April as the weather is temperate .
Thanks a lot for your invitation and if I was n't so busy , I would travel around with you .
I wish I could express my dissatisfaction with the facilities .
Besides , the phone did not work properly , it was imposible the use of it to call the receptionist .
There were six of us from a school , and we all agree the stay was unpleasant .
I regret to inform you that if you do not offer my apologies and a compensation for all the disturbance caused to me I would go to the main authority .
Yours faithfully ,
I go by cycle to " Fribergaskolan " every day together with my friends Tekla , Julia and Bianca .
My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called : " New Peeking " it 's an Asian buffé and they make the best food .
I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost everyone of them in my old school ( called Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my other big hobbies is photographing .
They had to sew my finger but in the end everything went fine .
In camden every block counts with three or four containers to recycle paper , plastic , glass and old clothes .
The council recollects , once a week , door to door paper and organic waste .
What is more , people are encouraged to collect rain water to use in these activities .
Public transport was made accessible by reducing the fares and making it free for students .
Nowadays there are a lot of information about healthy , in order to have good food habits , sleep the amounght of hours recommended by specialist doctors , etc .
For these reasons I consider that could be a good option doing any sport that you like or you may be interested in .
I think that in particular , spinning is a hard sport activity because when you was approximately 1 hour over your bike you 'll probably feel taired .
If you want to lose weight this type of sport is perfect because it belong into the aerobic exercises to burn the calories that we get eating fast food whereas it is suitable to people that only just doing exercise to entertainment .
Furthermore from the first time that I was in the gym I have known nice and friendly sportsman who try to give me advice not only how improve my techniques but how avoid injury .
Although it is kind of hard for young people who finished school finally , to understand that it 's definitely not finish yet , education do n't stops from then on and it is one of the most important things to continue going to school .
On the the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't really have the opportunity to choose , if they want to go or not .
Try to motivate people for education , studying and school is a very hard thing if they all know all those Imaginations are not going to happen anyway , whereas people in Switzerland have to choose very early in which direction they want to go and what their possibilities look like .
Therefore , education should be reachable for everyone , in my opinion , as long as possible , but only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
Only if all of that is guaranteed the motivation will rise .
For the most of men shopping is so boring and exhausting , but for the women it can be the best way to make better their mood , because they are so happy when they buy many clothes on sale , cheaper than in regular price .
In the big shopping centre your pocket can be stolen by pickpocket and you can lost a lot of money .
Personally I really like shopping , because I am interested in fashion and I like look good .
Nowadays the technology and the society have changed in different ways and most people have more free time than years before .
In contrast , the technology have been becoming more useful and it could do works that we had to do some years ago and having more free time could be better for us .
I 've been searching for a lot of stuff we could visit once I got there , for example Piccadilly Circus .
At a glance it seems very original and particular , is n't it ?
I think it would be fascinating go sightseeing around there and I could find some souvenir for my family .
If you manage to organize it beforehand I 'll have the time to prepare all soccer stuff ( boots etc . ) .
Shortly I 'll give you some other information .
My colleagues are brain - damaged .
But instead I am writing abour stupid decorations , illnesses and other boring stuff .
Sometimes it 's hard to believe that everything will be OK .
Friendship is one of the most valuable sentiments for people , especially for people who are in school days .
When it comes to the best way for students to make friends , some support that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable , however , from where I am stand , joining a sports team is the undoubtedly the best choice .
Training in the same sports team , the students can not only release them from whole day 's pressure , but also can build up good relationships with others through the communication and exercise .
For example , the champions of Olympic Games , China 's famous synchronized diving athletes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia , the two girls enjoy a really good friendship .
Additionally , cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team .
Here , students learn how to work together , how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork , how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self , and even how to negotiate or discuss with others , as well as how to be patient and rational .
Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students , I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent .
However , if students participate in community activities , for example , doing volunteer job in the town 's library , they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is full of working .
Is everything ok with your family ?
She has a wonderful body , but in her face you can see the perfection .
My country 's media this year celebrated a doctor who works in Afghanistan .
He left his job in a safe and comfortable Italian hospital to move in a country that lives a civil war .
We have so many interesting places to visit , but if I must limit to only one I chose the centre of the city .
It is renovating , but you can see many beautiful buildings .
Besides btilliant actors they have incredible decor and it 's perfectly situated , that is very near to the bus stop .
It is really interesting place and I think you 'll appreciate this .
Yours faithfully ,
Some people go shopping to feel better for themselves .
I personally love to do shopping and spend my money for new clothes .

I am writing this letter to apply for the post of the staff advertised in the Tuoitre newspaper of 13 March .
Since graduating from University of Eduaction majoring business English , I have been working for a food joint stock company on a contract basis .
I have particularly interested in dealing with various types of foods and meeting new people .
I would welcome the chance to work as a part of your cafe where I will make a small contribution while developing my English skills further .
Meeting new people and setting up new social relationships are also the temting point attracting me .
In addition , your cafe is conveniently located near my home which takes about 10 mintues to go on foot and i have 2 days off a week that gives me opportunity to challenge a new job .
Your faithfully ,
Last week , my friends and I were selected from the class to go on a fascinating trip to a contemporary and magnificent museum .
At this mind - blowing place , we looked and gazed at the phenomenally awe - inspiring and unbelievable fossils of ancient dinosaur bones up to 100 meters high !
I luxuriate the manufacture of the spellbinding models and the gift we get to pick in the dinosaur shop .
I enjoyed this unforgettable experience to the meseum , and hope you can take your time out to go one day !
My favorite thing to do is play sims 3 and sims 4 and listening to music , my favorite music type is rock and of course my favorite band is Green Day and of course then my favorite song is stray hearts(Green Day ) .
Inside the " Monumento a La Bandera " you can see historical objects about the history of Argentina , in the underground it 's the hall of honor of American Flags .
If you want to enter to the hall of honor or enter to the monument it 's free but if you want to go up to the viewpoint , unless you are younger 5 , you must pay an entrance fee of 10 $ argentines .
Since I was a child , my favourite characters are being the cruellest one .
Obviously because in every story , book or movie , despite heroes are weaker than bad characters , they always win !
For example , in Terminator 's movies villain was always stronger and more equipped than hero , but at the end of the movie the righteous wins the battle .
In recent years , social media sites have developed and interpenetrated our society as the essentials rapidly .
There are enormous numbers of users all over the world , and social media sites such as Twitter , Facebook and YouTube are utilized for acquiring some information , contributing ideas , sharing photographs and communicating between individuals , individuals and organization or between organizations .
While social media sites change our society more convenient and more comfortable as compared with the past , they simultaneously accompany some issues .
There are two advantages and a disadvantage of the current social consequences , and I mention conceivable effects of social media site in the future .
Usually children go to kindergarten up to 5 years old , and after that they start preschool .
However , Bulgarian government was thinking change the law so all children have to start at 6 years old .
I think I ca n't compare education of children in school or tertiary education between Bulgarian and Australia , because I still do n't have children and I am not studding in university in Australia .
The town has 100.000 inhabitants .
After a day of shopping , you can go at one of the many restaurants Kortrijk has .
Many green zones have been implemented .
Unfortunately , our holiday did not live up to the claims made by you .
We had a number of problems ; the first one is concerning the number of beds : You offered space to sleep for six persons so we excepted six bed , but we only had five .
So , two of us had to share one bed , which is hardly acceptable
The other problems is about the offered excursions : You promised a number of attractions , but two ( the walk up to the mountain as well as the visit of a historic castle ) were not available .
Unfortunately , we also had problems with nutrition : In your brochure it was told that we will have a number of restaurants around , but in fact there was only one which was , in addition to that , really expensive .
This is in our honest opinion not acceptable , because in the brochure you talked about more than one restaurant .
It requires a rich imagination to try to put a view of the future , first of all the means of transport will change , depend mainly on the solar energy or the nuclear energy , a flying public transport bus will be a fast ride to work , you will need to supply your car with spinache after they invent a spinache - using car .
Also the food will change in the future , capsules of your favourite foods will be available at the future in the mobile supermarkets , these capsules turn into your lunch as soon as you put a small amount of water on it .
I think today 's television is still a good value , because there is more choice than ever before .
You can see whatever you want , whenever you want!There 's always something to watch for everybody .
Of course I think that we should n't watch too much television .
I think that 's the only negatieve point from today 's television , because maybe there 's too much choice !
They just ca n't stop watching television , because there 's just so much what they like to watch .
In that way , we can enjoy all that new technology from today , and all the enjoyable tv - programms !
It was taken on the embankment of Khabarovsk .
On the background you can see the river Amur .
On the left you can see people on an observation area .
I was very excited because it was my first visit to Khabarovsk in the summer .
By the way , in that day Everybodys were celebrating the Day of the City .
Afterwards we went for a walk .
When we were schoolgerls we used to spend all our free time together .
I am writing in response to your advertisement in SUMMER CAMPS USA to work in different situations .

I also have a certificate of lifeguard .
I have experience with children between aged 10 and 12 , I have worked in the South school Centre for two years .
I do not have experience to work in the kitchens , but a like cooking , I am living alone I do housework myself and meals .
Yours faithfully .
This year is the last one before going to university .
On one hand , it is true that leaving school means passing from the basis to your future profession .
After sixteen years of continues work , it is the perfect moment to take a rest and enjoy your life by travelling .
However it could be a great time to work and earn some money for paying university or simply for saving it .
On the other hand , maybe if we have a break until university the routine of working and studing every day could break .
So when univerity starts , people will become busy , the routine will not be the same , and as a consecuences the marks will be lower .
to conclude , I think after school we need apply for university in order to continue working in what we like .
The year off should be taken after university studies
As the number of traffic accident has increased dramatically over the year , finding the best solutions has putted the government under pressure to whether implementing stricter penalties or using alternative regulations .
Personally , road safety can not be ensured with either former or later methods .
Instead , it should be a combination of various actions .
As a matter of fact , severe punishments can partly decrease the rate of offences .
Nobody wants to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison , so fear of punishment might be effective and prevent people to make the offence a second time .
Moreover , one 's penalty also can be considered as a mirror that people can look at and avoid doing the same things .
Its penalties , depends on the severity , could include fines , licence suspension , community services or imprisonment .
Consequently , those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only , therefore , minimize the amount of accidents .
Authorities should enact more safety policy on road and ensure by improving the quality of traffic facilities .
In many developing countries , government rarely attach special important to both the quality and quantity of the traffic system , especially in rural areas .
Furthermore , vehicle collisions are rising greatly due to number of unclear road signs .
Traffic education is also an compulsory measure , especially to young generations as they cover majority of offences .
People should be educated carefully about all the safety regulations and laws when they get driving licence , the more they know the rules , the less risks are taken on road .
In general , betterment of reducing traffic accidents is important .
Therefore , it should be considered carefully on how to combine both severe penalties and many other regulations .
Public transportation once used to be a convenient and inexpensive way to transport oneself in the city .
However , the increasing number of car ownership has been taken place of public transportation , providing more convenience to get around places to places .
Traveling by cars gives flexibility in our schedule .
Such convenience of cars can enables us to use our time efficiently .
However , cars can not take place of public transportations just for that convenience .
Maintaining cars is cost associative .
In addition , cars require regular maintenance such as oil change and checking tire pressures .
Mechanical problems can often be a costly problems .
Unlike public transportation , one has to be responsible for his or her tool of transportation , and it could be expensive sometimes .
On the other hand , the public transportation is inexpensive .
In other perspective , cars require to drive .
For example , people who have disabilities and certain diseases are not able to drive .
For those people , public transportation can be an optimal choice of transportation .
In conclusion , cars are convenient , however , it is not for everyone use .
Therefore , the public transportation has its own means of existence , and there is a future for public transportation .
Our congregation has carried educational family camps with the support of NNNs Integration programme for 8 years .
We have a hugeexperience in organising seminars and camps for families with disabled children .
For many of children participating in this camp is the only opportunity to spend time with the coevals and to feel fully - fledged members of the society .
Words fail to express emotions that all participants experience .
Health improvements of some children can be considered a miracle .
Reduction in financial support from foreign charity foundations leads to make our camp not possible to happen this year .
Our budget is fixed for only 75 people , it is almost twice a number of participants last year .
We do n't know and we do n't want to know how to refuse a participation in the camp to children in this situation !
The greater amount of money has already been collected thanks to the trustee board of " NNN " community , but we still need additional $ 13000 .
We are asking you not to stay indifferent to disabled children and to provide feasible help .
The idea that newspapers will diminish by time due to people 's perspective toward surfing the internet for the worldwide news does not necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted .
One of the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of the society deals with newspapers as a daily routine .
To the best of my knowledge , it is a way of behaving more than a way coping with the latest technologies .
To begin , the reason for decreasing the popularity of news papers is that most people , recently , rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world .
On the other hand , newspapers are presented in a definite place , with limited time in addition they are daily payable .
While some may claim that credibility is the main reliable aspect of publishing .
It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectful reputation are the ones which could be accepted by thousands of people .
In this respect , newspapers seem to be more credible than numerous websites that make up fake stories much more than publishing real news .
Furthermore , reading habits have their own taste , specifically for those elderly people .
They enjoy turning the pages and reading the headlines using their eyeglasses .
That marvelous tasteful generation ca n't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences upon the modern society .
In light of the forgoing discussion , it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect toward globalisation even in daily news worldwide .
However , the newspapers still have their lead in that perspective .
It can be suggested that combination of both arenas will positively influence the ways of delivering news .
However , I accepted her plan and I met her at " Wonderland Café " .
It has almost everything that you need in a cafe , comfortable chairs and sofas , beatiful features and a really good - taste coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think in .
Althoug the most important thing is that there were not only friendy staff but they look like if they were having tea in Wonderland , with Alice and the White Rabbit .
I strongly recommend this café if you want to enjoy an excellent coffee with a careful decoration and brilliant performances in which you can participate while having a drink .
This sport is not so hard , give me the opportunity to do an activity that is not too expensive and could be done outdoors and not in a closed sportshall .
When I came back from my job , in the afternoon , I wear something comfortable , take my bike and go away over the street alone with my thoughts and no one could disturb me .
The visit is a movie in which two grandparents get to know his grandchildren for the first time .
They have never met his grandparents because her mom had a fight long time with them even before they both where born , that it caused not to know more about each other .
The girl is making a film for a school project about the journey about knowing his grandparents .
because sometimes they start acting really weird and after 9:30 pm weird things happen to them , then both kids understand that his grandparents are hiding a really big secret .
Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores , you can always find something unique .
Second , it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together .
However , most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive .
In conclusion , I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting .
The changes on television are evident , it could be because the society are changing too .
On television we can see what people consume .
If tv 's programmes are a lot of rubbiss , is because some people prefer those .
Maybe , there are a lot of repeats of old programmes , but some of them are still watched for a long number of people .
And sometimes , programmes are so aggressive and gives people bad messages .
On the other hand , there is some channels , which show documentaries and programmes about specific subjects like science , math or history .
I think there are good tv 's programmes , but people do n't give them the value that they should have .
There are a lot of old programmes , but it is n't a problem .
The television has still something important to show .
I am writing to congratulate on the excellent Dumplings Festival which I attended in Cracovie last November .
I spend a great time with my friends , but I have a few comments concering the organisation .
I was far from impressed by all dumplings which housewives prepared .
However , there are a couple of small sugestions .
First of all , the vanue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find .
I saw a parents with children but kids did not have many attractions .
Once again please accept my compliments on a job well done I hope you find my suggestions helpful and I look forward toa n even more successful event next year .
These days , the use of technology is increasing , especially robots .
According to Russell and Norwing robots are especial machines that have intelligence to executed activities on their own or by command ( as cited in Chijindu & Inyiama , 2012 ) .
They represent an innovation that has changed the world in distinct ways and have implanted in different areas of society ; for example in security , health , army forces , education , industries and agriculture .
Consequently , positive and negative social impacts can be observed by the population .
More accurate surgeries , emotional bond and increase of communication are examples of positive consequences .
Negative impacts such as the human dependence on robots for doing basic activities and pollution of environment can be cited .
This essay will describe the positives and negatives social consequences of the robots , and possible implications in the future .
Each day , the environment suffers different problems caused by the global warming and human are the unique guilty of this issue .
We need to analyze and investigate the main problems to find solutions which may get better our world .
As we know , in all cities a lot of cars are used every day unnecessarily .
Probably , if we used up public transport like bus instead of private , we would reduce the greenhouse effect because of the CO2 produced .
I think we must be down to earth and creative to cut down our daily trash 's production .
To sum up , it 's necessary to solve the environmental problems to keep safe our planet , so we had better start resolving closer issues .
In pantanal the weather ir hot and wet , and we can drive into the river deeper in the wood and see the wild animals like the alligators .
There , you will see beaultiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice wine factories .
Here , you 'll find most of kinds of temporary job , like in restaurants , bars , etc .
Chinese , Spanish and Portuguese no one of those languagues are so popular as English is .
Over 1 billion people around the world speak English as a second language because of that it is considered the universal language .
Nowadays , it is an obligation to get a better job .
I will discuss the importance of English as a second language in Brazil .
Brazillians need learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education .
Learn English as a foregein language will make a huge impact in brazillians ' professional life to get a better position .
To conclude , Brazil has deficiency of English speakers .
The brazillian educational system should be aware to develop more students ' language skills .
Learn English as a second language will help brazillians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers .
It is a rich , graceful and delightful language to learn .
To the national championships in swimming , she was preparing since last summer .
Especially since the previous national competitions when she suffered a shoulder injury and could not start .
Anna won first prize , regained confidence .
These people sometimes think of their sons or daughters as innocent angels who spend a lot of their time with inexperienced teachers with no qualifications .
Teaching could be a stimulating working environment for students and teachers if it involved a rewarding career and the improvement of teaching skills .
In this case , teaching would n't be monotonous and with no opportunities or prospects .
I am writing to ask you if your school could organize an individual course in English for me .
My pronunciation is not always correct , as a result I have some problems with listening . I know English economic terminology very well but my everyday English is rather poor .
I enjoy visiting museums , travelling in my free time .
I prefer learning on a one - to - one basis , because it is more comfortable for me .
I actually love outdoor activities , I have been practicing rock climbing for nine years now , and start with motocross since 2010 also i consider myself very nice with children and teenagers . when I was a child my father and I used to go camping almost every two weekends , till four years ago , because he is no longer be able to stay out of the city , but he taught me all that i need to know to suvive outthere , so , I really know how to do things in the woods .
Also I am chef , so I can assure you that I will be helpful in the kitchen , I have been cooking for a large amount of people for 7 years in a really big restaurant .
It is said that no future for public transportation . I think it when I was young , but it is changed while I am getting older .
There are a lot of benefits by developing public transportation .
First , it is more convenient .
Most developed countries developed the public transportation system to low the impact of growing population .
Shared cost let the huge expense on developing and building the public system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally .
Public transportation is proved less energy consumption .
I still think the public transportation system will be growing on in such a crowded era .
How long haven't you use public transportation ? do you agree that there is no future for public transport ?
I personally think so , the reasons are as below :
Also travelling , of course , that 's a big part of the function of the car !
The very well developed highways , roads , city streets provide a good foundation for the cars , look at the North America , the highways were developed anywhere , it 's really your own lose if you do n't drive a car , drive on them(highways )
Second , Human start to learn driving at the age of 16 , and they can master the driving skills very quickly ( within a month or two ) , soon they can drive to wherever they want to go , and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it .
so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore ?
Third , The public transportation sucks , when you think about it , you can picture the crowded subways , dirty buses , and the difficulty / hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind .
The wasted time also should weight in , whether it is waiting for the trains , or waiting for the delayed buses , not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car .
And driving your own car can be very convenient too , it can right come to your own garage .
All in all , Public transport is not as fast as a car can be ; it 's not as convenient as a car can provide , so it 's future is in doubt .
Thirdly , I lived two years without feeling safe and comfortable .
If I could change places for 24 hours with a famous person , I would like to be Paula Echevarria
I start telling something about Paula Echevarria , she is a very pretty and famous actress , she also writes in a fashion blong , she is 34 years old and she is married with David Bustamente who is a popular and hadmesome singer in Spain , they have a daughTer , her name is Daniela and they are like a perfect family .
I have chosen Paula because she is popular , famous , rich and she has the perfect husband but above all I choose her because she is friendly , intelligent and she is always smiling .
Therefore she has everything good aobut being a celebrity but the most important is that she is a great person .
Let me conclude by saying that I would like to be Paula for one day because Not only is she a good professional but also a wonderful role model to be followed by everyone .
I would like to talk about my hobby of breeding birds , this hobby is very pleasant to me and also for many people , especially when you have different kind of singing birds like canary or finches … .
This hobby give me pleasure and good sense of nature , especially when I wake up with the sound of the singing birds in my house .
At present , I have three kinds of birds , one of them is yellow canary , the second one is finch , and the third one is combination of two kinds of birds , Each bird has his own special voice .
By increasing the veriety of cars with new technolgy , people 's demand hasnt ' stop .
As technology enhanced the life system in any way possible , people become more dependent and ca n't avoid it beacuse of many different attractions that these cars have .
Furthure more , there are advantages travelling by a car , like seeing the scenery and also the costs is less in compare to plane .
On the other hand , by increasing the population we should revise the regulation with the fast pace of technology .

Furtheremore during my studies at University I have worked in 2 projects based on sports activities for children aged 7 - 13 , organising them .
This job would give me the opportunity to pactise my skills and get more experience with children as well .
Studying English abroad is the better alternative , but it have advantages and disadvantages .
On the other hand , living abroad you 'll need to speak English all the time and you 'll have the opportunity to learn English in a short time , and in a not boring way .
So probably , if you have the opportunity to stay abroad several months , you should do it , to learn English and live a different experience .

There are two main characters .
Arthur went to London to an appointment for a job interview .
The company requested him to go back three days later , so he was looking for a hotel that someone had recomemded him .
He was delighted with her and fell in love immediately .
He Forgot his engagement and went to live with Blanche .
I chose this story because even though this novel was written in the early twentieth century , the underlying theme , is still current today .
And also I would like to highlight that reflects the importance of every decision we make and how it can change our future .
" Atacama 33 " is a recent American movie that tells the real story of a group of miners that keep trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months .
The film is well - developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that miners had to go through .
The characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involve with the real accident .
It is universaly known that shopping is not always enjoyable .
Even though shopping can make bad affect on our health especially we can feel tired or exhausted in the end of hard day .
People declare that shopping can make our mood better what in consequence will make as fun .
In conclusion I would like to say that there are different views about shopping and it 's not surprise because we are all different .
On the positive side , the use of internet helps us to find easily and quickly a lot of information that talk about all the topics .
On the negative side , the use of Internet can be a waste of time in our lives ; this happens because although search is faster , we can distract looking at other things on account of the attractive of the Internet .
To sum up , the Internet is a good and efficient instrument if we know the correct use of it .
But to learn new cultures we must know their languages , especially if we want to travel .
Due to globalization there are more and more multinational companies that require employees who can speak at least fluent English but if a candidate knows more languages he can have more career chances and achieve top level positions .
In my opinion it is very important to speak several languages not only for above reasons but also to train brain , to have the opportunity to find a job abroad and , why not ?
Unfortunately it is very difficult to learn foreign languages when we are adult so it is extremely important to teach and to study them since kindergarten age .
The doorbell rang insistetly , It was Saturday , in the earlier morning and I still was in bed .
First I asked " ¿ Who is ringing so early?¿What 's happen?Suddenly , a family voice shouted me throughout the door .
You do n't think opening the door at your little brother¡Oh brother!I shouted and I ran to open de door .
What amazing surprise!I was very emocional and was about to cry .
In answer to your question about the use of internet beyoung people of our age , I think it is very helpful to get information easier and quiker .
Although , it plays a freat role in removing the borders on nations , in a matter of seconds we can now communicate with people around the world , whether for important business matters or just talking to a friend .
Nowadays , the Internet is very useful , it has many ways of helping people such us with their homework , using Google , or entertainment websites like Youtube , emails websits such as Hotmail , and the number one social network site , Facebook .
Evidently , we can not imagine how much time we spend online , because we are the whold day connecting , in our houses , moviel phones and computers at work .
I think it is a bohemian trip too because the train use to be one of the most appreciated means of transport in the literacy .
The boat is a very beautiful way to travel , but I 'm sure when I travel by boat in the future , I 'll feel anxiety because I 'll be surrounded by water .
In conclusion , my main problem is the concern about how safe is the means of transport that I take , so , the train let me to be more relaxed than other ways to travel .
Volleyball is a complete sport where you can exercise all your muscles .
A feature of the volleyball is that the players have to rotate their positions while they are getting points .
In fact , I enjoy playing volleyball because it is a fun sport which you can practise with a lot of people , eleven people concretely .
I suggest at the new players of volleyball that they have to start step to step .
Put comfortable clothes and suitable shoes .
Nowadays they have to work through a lot of issues while they are in their adolescence , they begin to have lack of self - esteem , depression , social pressure , and all this can cause a lot of problems .
They have to realice that if they continue eating that way and not doing any exercise they are more likely to have differents diseases .
I went to a workshop about the light controlled synthesizer .
On the way there everyone who participated in the workshop stopped to buy some snacks .
When we reached the workshop the kids and I were told to put on protective glasses and given booklets with the instructions .
We were instructed to make a badge that flashed different coloured light by using solder to attach the led and battery hatch to the badge .
Then we had to follow the instructions in the booklet to make the synthesizer .
At first I was quite confused but then one of the instructors came and helped me out .
Each synthesizer emitted a loud noise .
When the light sensor is in the shade , the synthesizer emitts a lower pitch , and when the sensor is exposed to light the synthesizer 's pitch raises .
I worked as an Advocate ( Solicitor ) for a period more than four years and from those jobs I gained lots of experiences about minute taking , dealing with clients , arranging meetings and handling cases .
I am a proficient user of Microsoft office packages .
I worked voluntarily for some cases about Juvenile justice like ( speedy disposal of cases , abuse of their rights while they were under custody , custodial death etc . )
I worked on a project about how education the fundamental rights for children under 14 years of age is denied in some community .
I my second placement I had to perform lots of administrative work including typing .
I had to work as a liase with clients as well as the company officials ( since Shriram Law Consultants is a part of Shriram Group of Companies ) .
The article and the lecture are about the attitude towards taking medical experiments on animals .
The author claims that the main aim of the scientists is to reduce human suffering even if it demands research conducted on animals .
The lecturer opposes this idea , as , in her point of view , medical experiments on animals are not to be taken .
Firstly , the author informs us about impossibility to discover new types of drugs .
Secondly , the author suggests that it is impossible to replace experiments on animals with anything else .
The lecturer disagrees with that point of view , because it is possible to introduce computer substitution or do research on tissues .
The lecturer argues that as a biologist she used to see animals suffering without appropriate amount of anesthesia .
The article states that the most efficient substituer of internal - combustion engines will be fuel - cell engines , because of their several advantages , while the lecture refutes this point by stating hydrogen does not have so many advantages .
First of all , the reading passage says that internal - combustion engine relies on petroleum , which will be depleted soon , but hydrogen will not deplete easily .
The professor contends this point by explaining that hydrogen is , in fact , not easily found .
She adds that it is not directly usable , because hydrogen should be obtained in pure liquid state , which technologically is very hard to be kept under -200 degrees celsius .
The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem , because it requires to be purified in order to be used .
She explains that in the process of purefication , a big amount of coal and oil is burned , which pollutes factories rather than the environment .
Finally , the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economic , because it requires only half of the energy of internal - combustion powered cars .
She explains platinum is very hard to find and without this metal it is impossible to produce hydrogen .
An Unexpected Success
I am a fairly calm person and I am interested in reading every kind of books therefore I have a quiet life .
Last Spring , however , something happened which surprised everybody , especially me .
My little sister wanted to learn to play the piano so she joined a music school which organised a concert performance at the end of the course .
Unfortunately , she could no longer play .
I was absolutely terrify as I had to show .
I am going to play definitely the piano for a long time .

The aim of this report is to assess the most interesting shops for tourists and make some suggestions .
Shopping facilities :
In general , shops are condensed in a specific zone so that tourists can find what they are interested in very easily .
Suggestions :
In general , tourists think shops should be opened during middayas they are foreigners and like to buy things after watching sights around the city .
Conclusion and recommendations :
I 'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience .
As you know , Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation , it 's a very fast , energetic city with lots of things to do and to see .
You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school .
In addition , few years ago the Big Theater was restored and had gained it 's original appearance .
There is no necessity to describe all sightseeing in Moscow , you easily can find it in the Internet , I just want to say that I 'm sure , you 'll like it a lot .
It 's a range of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history .
Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia .
You will understand that people here and there are very different and styles of their lives are dissimilar .
I could n't wait to listen to my favorite song until they played it , it was the best experience ever , I wish you could be there to see that .
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORT IN NAPLES AND I HOPE THEY'LL BE USEFUL .
I THINK THAT THE EASIEST METHOD OF TRANSPORT FOR YOU IS THE UNDERGROUND ; NEAR THE TRAIN IN GARIBALDI SQUARE THERE IS THE UNDERGROUND THAT YOU HAVE TO CATCH AND YOU HAVE TO GET OFF IN CHIAIANO STATION . I'LL BE AT CHAIANO STATION SO WE WILL TAKE A WALK UNTIL MY HOME .
Some people claim that universities and colleges should not spend a great deal of money on sports and social activities , as their budgets should prioritize classes and libraries .
However , as educational institutions , universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help them develop academically and socially .
The student had a great deal of assighment and projects , so he spent more time to access the libabry , becoming more ambition to study books and using a computer to search latest information .
Sometimes he felt tired to do papers , going the gym to play basketball .
Therefore , not only did he get high score in the reports that absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at the libabry , but reduce the study stress and maintain healthy in the gym .
I had a similar experience .
when I studied in the university , I sit in the classes hour by hour in a day .
University , I also have a lot of assighments , so I like to go to libabry to study where is more quietly , spacious and internet accessible .
That 's why I like to go to school in terms of good facilities and widespread information to facilitate me to be a successful person .
Sports and social activities can greatly improve my efficiency .
For these reasons , I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social movements to prepare students for their future development .
Academic education will always be at the heart of a university .
In universities , sports and social activities should by no means take the place of a focus on academic study .
I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academics as well as sports and social activities .
It is a great life stage but at the same time is difficult , sometimes teenagers have problems with their families , with themselves , as a result they do n't know whah to choose .
Many times when people leave high school and they go to University , they realised after several months that the career they had chosen it is not for them .
You can work , travel , going to an exchange study , rest and do something that you are interested .
When students enter University after they have taken a year off fewer people leave the career after several months because they know themselves better .
I 'm interesting in doing a course in your school .
I have an intermediate level and I 'd like to speak English better because my pronunciation is n't very well .
My grammar and writing are good but as I 've said early my pronunciation is awful .
I 'm available to start the course immediately and I want both an eight - week intensive course and an one - month summer course in August , when I 'll be on holiday and besides I 'd like to learning in small groups because the teacher can focus on his pupils better .
Twenty years ago , no one would think of the inventions of Ipad or smarthphone and how they could change our lives , but today , these items have become the necessities of our daily lives ; nowadays , many people just got into the habit of carrying their smartphones no matter where they go .
Advent of science , whether it is in the scientific research or in the designs of consumer products , has changed our lives and will definitely keep changing our lives in the future .
Ipad , smartphone , genetic food engineering , all of them have one thing in common -they changed our lives dramatically .
Take genetic engineering as an example , on the one hand , it helps farmers to produce more corps and meats , on the other , it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways in producing more corps and poultry in the future , resulting in an unprecedent increase in human population , which brings pollution to the environment .
To cope with the problems of over - population and pollution , people need to dramatically change their lives in the next 50 years : they may , among other things , face tight birth control and environmental protection measures imposed by the government .
It is sad to say that the future generations have no choice but have to adapt to the changes in order to survive .
As a result , I could be very helpful in oranising sports and activities but I could also provide assistance in other places including kitchen .
Furthermore , I am cheerful , energetic , and I am doing well with kids .
I watched the film one month ago and it has really impressive and engrossing effects .
The film tells about a movie shooting and adventures of filming team which is in Bolivia .
They come across with some problems while they are shooting the film and this supply quite a few strong highlights .
The both of them are imperialism and poverty .
Actually , they want to describe the history of discovery and conquest by a critical perspective but while shooting the film , appear some protests against the privatization of water and the team fall into a chaos and then film starting to give some social , politic messages .
The crucial point is transformations and exprerienced contradictions of the characters .
In our imperialist and capitalist World , we need more films or arthistic influences which mention the problems about our life and realities .
I do n't think that there is no future for public transport and I agree that travelling by car is much more convenient .
If the government provide good transport infrastructure like modern and comfort buses , traffic free Metro lines then people would rather to use public transport than travelling by car .
Government should promote the good mode of transport in order to reduce carbon emission and people would be encouraging to go green .
Many times because of huge traffic congestion on road we waste our time . while using public transport like Metro save our times .
Department stores are found in all big cities .
There you can find almost everything you want .
CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE
There are such an interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would have never expected or unsurprisingly , missinformation .
We now that making social contacts can be sometimes a problem for a wide range of people , who sometimes find it a lonely and dauting experience .
In my experience , being under the screen of a personal computer will you be able to show and exchange ideas or opinions easily as if you have to do in front of someone else .
However , both readers and writers not only do it as an altruistic and philantropic way but to get fame and popularity at the same time . Blogs and websites could give them the chance to became famous if they really appeal to a large amount of people and they will abe also available to earn money thanks to the publicity .
Consequently , we should never blind trust in everything we see or read on the Internet .
To give an example , I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series , characters , new seasons and when they will be ready to watch them again .
If they give us reliable information or not , it usually depends on the source .
You must n't take everything into account .
To clarify what the situation is , it is truth that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites but the fact is writing or reading in a blog could give to people a practical way to communicate and share preferencies , beliefs or thoughts , however , more or less reliable .
Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .
There was a lot of blood and was then when Peter looked at his whach and knew that he had to do something immediately .
I 'm writing to you in connection with your volunteer project , whose
description I have found at the http://http://europa.eu / youth/. I would like to know are you
accepting applications at the moment .
Your project is very compelling for me .
take part in it . I could help you with teaching math together with computer programming
in engaging and interesting way . I 'm passionate about math and programming .
Currently I am working as a python programmer .
Programming language is great choice for teaching kids to program .
Programming is fun and math concept absorbs much easier through it .
I have bachelor degree in mathematics ( I 'm a math teacher ) and master 's degree in computer science .
Please let me know if you are looking for volunteer and if you are considering
applicants from Russia .
I will be happy to send you my CV and motivation letter .
I have a sending organisation " Centre for Youth Studies - Higher School of Economics "
( accreditation number 2014-XT-16 )
I often try to play with the children interesting games , I think the games are a funny way to teach interesting things both children and older people , that is why I invent new methods to introduce the science in the children 's lives .
The favorite game for my brothers is called " coca boom " , with this game I showed them what is the chemistry , we cough a " Coke " and " Mentos " sweets then I put the " Mentos " into the " Coke " and I taught what happens when you mixed two substances .
I would be happy if you considered me in the case there are vacancies .
I play basketball on my free time and hanging out with my friend from my old school .
My favorite book is the hungergames .
I like that book so much because it is pretty realistisk and it can happen in real world sometime .
Everything is made of blocks and you can build and play with friends .
But I played basketball and my tennis at the same time , so I chose basketball , because I think it 's fun .
Besides seeing touristic or historical places , and attending open air activities people also want to see museums of the city they visited .
Because museums offer so many interesting and different things differ from other places in the visiting city .
First of all , people visit museums to learn history of the visiting city . We know that museums generally established to expose special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to expose modern belongings .
These old things in the museum give us unique information about the history of the city and its social life .
For example , when you go to Metropolitan museum of art in New York city , you can see lots of historical monuments and items belong to American history and also other countries ' history .
Many items in museums has cultural value beside historical value .
For instance art museums include art collections such as paintings from many different artists .
Beside historic and cultural characters , some museums also can be source of fun including attractive activities .
In sum , museums are attractive places for tourist to discover about the city they visited .
By visiting museums we can learn interseting details about the history and culture of that society .
In addition to having lots of information we also can have fun to see interesting things in the museums such as huge dinasours . You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you travel .
Today plenty of ecology organisations are trying to raise people 's awareness of the environment defilement .
It is often necessary to have a car when living in a small city or village without public transport , and it is understandable .
But while living in a big city , where there are lots of bus stops , tram stops or metro stations is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck at a block while rush hours .
As the ecology organisations says , it is better for the environment , and as we decided , it is better for us to save our precious time .
Increasingly people prefer to use public transport rather than to drive a car for these reasons .
The importance of internet on our lives
The last decades there has been an massive change been in our lives , this is caused by the development of internet .
This had been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on the social life .
The internet allows you to search for information in massive online libraries for research and writing essays .
There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find publications of researchers around the world .
The internet is getting important for our study because of the availability of information sources .
The internet has a lot of consequences on our lives .
Also it gives the possibility to get in contact with family and friends .
In my life there are too many sports i like to but there is one in particular that i love so much .
when i was born i saw my father watching every day football 's programmes but i did n't understand what it was .
However , overtime i begun to understand how to play and i liked it much more than the past .
He wins two national championships and also an important european competition .
On the other hand , my advice that i give to someone who start this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsability and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona .
Is it the best for the pollution and environment ?
But , I think that in other cases we take the car without any reason , it 's only a bad habit and maybe we could be changed it to improve our health ( going on foot or taking the bike for example ) and also we will help to the environment and the pollution .
For example , I 'm a commuter and also I need my car to pick up my daughter from the school in the afternoons . I live in a bustling city , I do n't like the traffic then when I get away from the hustle and bustle of the city I usually go to my village .
In my opinion tennis is the best sport because I 'm an individualist , so I prefer individually sport , because in these kind of game everything depends from you .
I hope this sport will have more importance in Italy in the future .
I am writing to you to raise an important issue concerning school library .
I look forward to understanding and I hope we will reach a consensus .
Together with an unofficial Student council create a petition which is to raise the issue among teaching council .
Our priority is good preparation for secondary school certificate .
Moreover pupils demand is the possibility to borrow books .
It is the most important matter , because most of us is not able to buy highly educational books .
Our request boils down to the fundamental role of education .
It is broadening the horizons of our knowledge .
Besides issues that have been already mentioned there is also undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library , it would be more representative .
Given the rationality of the above arguments , we , pupils , expect a positive consideration to our request .
Respectfully yours ,
Our live has changed a lot from the last century due to the technological improvements and society changes .
First of all , as we said before the people 's lives have changed due two important elements which are the technological improvements and society changes .
The first one it is very obvious because every day the researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new invents and improve the old ones .
For instance , one hundred years ago was impossible to see a woman working and carrying on economically the whole family alone or studying a degree in the university , things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society .
In addition , there are other conditions and facts that has helped to change the people 's lives such as political decisions , global wars and global economical problems , etc .
I am writing to You in connection with Your request for information on an interesting building or place to visit in Katowice .
The most interesting is the art gallery Oko Miasta , which is located in the city centrr .
It is a very distinctive place because of its magnitude , its outsite look and its atmosphere .
It is a good place for everyone who wants to get some Polish literature .
Furthermore , in the biulding of the art gallery there is a club Oko .
Not only it is the popular place among young Polish citizens , but also it is very extraodrinary : people can walk the red carpet and drink the most famous drinks .
I recommended it because it is the best place for young people .
While he was lost in the action , a strange and unexpected sound came from his sister 's bedroom .
My sister should definitely close her windows , I am going out of this house , I should leave this cat here and let it ruin her things " .
Destination : Disney .
Do you imagine travelling to the United States ?
Have you ever gone to a place designated only for having fun ?
Disney is the dream of a lot of people in the world , many of them have said that it is a magic and awesome experience .
Firstly , Disney is not a common destination like beaches or mountains , it is a place that requireds a different means of transport since it is in a long distance .
The vacatios starts when the plane takes off and nerves and happiness blend creating an experience you will never forget .
When the plane arrives at the airport of Miami you can appreciate the beautiful viwe that thid place offers .
Secondly , The entrance of Disney is incredible and colorful , it also has the main characters in it .
Each of one has a different topic and amazing coasters perfect to adolecents .
To conclude , Disney has so many facilities that it is impossible to get bord , you can relax in your hotel and have an unforgettable moment in the roller coasters
Indeed , it is true that travelling by car is much more convenient .
We have to therefore choose the other alternatives .
This technology will be improved furthermore in the future .
Besides that , if I had to choose a type of film I would say , the comedian and the action ones are the most appealing to me if they have a real dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one .
Honestly , they lasted for 3 hours but the most impressive of all this is that they were able to create a single world between me and the screen for all that time .
They really caught my attention , they had all the characteristics that I consider the basic ones in a film , not couting with the astonishing actors that made an impressive performance .
All I expect in a film is the way they establish connections between the actors and the audience , in a way that allows them to play with the characters like if they were puppets and to create a coherent and attractive film .
I am writing this letter regarding the announcement in the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
I understand that you required for peoples have good English , energetic , cheerful and hardworking , who that are able to look after children among 8 and 12 , help organise sports and evening activities as work in the kitchen .
I have previous experience working with " ADRENALINE SUMMER CAMPS " coaching children how to play football for a football championship within the summer camps also organized other activities such climbing , running , competitions , expedition and other movement .
During the time I spent coaching , organizing and helping in the kitchen , I learn that the most important thing is to keep a positive attitude and always motivate them in every step of the way .
Y truly enjoy working with children to help them learn and improve their already acquired skills , especially in sports .
Hence the reason I am very interested in this opportunity to coach sports to children during this summer .
Yours faithfully
I think everybody knows the importance of having a person , who is always there .
For me , a good person to speak about everything especially about my problems .
Although we have many different views of the life we understand each other and are best friends .
Many people around the world follow passionately international sports events .
That could be a great way to stop international tensions , although crisis and wars still exist .
Sports in general are followed by a huge percentage of the population .
I 'm keen on individual discipline .
Probably us , as human race necessitate of this kind of things .
I 'd prefer that people express their good behavior independently of international sports events .
I 've been interested in play an instrument since I was a child .
Latent fingermarks are commonly found at the scene of crime .
They are key corner in forensic investigation .
Persistence and uniqueness are the characteristics of the fingerprint .
Latent form of fingermark is invisible to human eye , hence need some methods for visualization and development of latent fingermarks .
Divergent approaches are used on routine basis for development of latent fingermarks .
Powders by adhering physically to the fingermark residue developed the latent , chemical reagents undergo reactions with the organic and inorganic parts of the fingermarks developing the latent , small particle reagent developed latent fingermarks by adhesion to sebaceous content of the fingermarks , ninhydrin reacting to amino acid of the fingermark and developed the latent marks , single and multi - metal deposition methods works on the principle of deposition and resulting in the negative development of latent marks .
New methods are continually added in the literature and shows the importance of fingerprints in criminal investigation system .
one can easily deduce information of culprits with partial form of latent fingermark .
What is more , if you want to get rid of depression or stress - go to the gym .
According to the scientific research mental health is closely connected to the physical one .
As for me , I am keen on basketball as it is my personal way to unwind and work out .
I am into it because it is quite catchy and spectaculous .
Moreover , it is considered to be one of the most active and popular kinds of sport all around the world .
To sum up , I believe that if you want to be mentally and physically fit - try to do some sport and exercise . Also do not worry if you are not so good at it , just keep doing it and enjoy yourself .
These are defined as plant - derived substances and occur naturally with no or minimal manufacturing processes that manage and remedy various health conditions effectively ( Bent , 2008 ; Tachjian ; Maria and Jahangir , 2010 ) .
Although , herbal medicines have significantly performed well in the treatment and management of illness , people have increasingly consumed these products via self - directed therapy .
This essay will discuss that there is considerable evidence for the possible detrimental influence on public health due to the increasing use of self - prescribed herbal medicines and that a health crisis is likely if no action is taken by health organisations .
The most recent thriller I 've seen is " The Miserables " .
However , I 'm not referring to the musical nor the intermediate version ; the oldest version is the referenced one .
It is a movie that has presents a lot of richness in characters and historical facts .
You are able to analyse human emotions and rationalise moral situations , so it is a movie that provides a lot of factors .
I found it very exciting because it shows a pre - revolutionary era when Jean Valjean is sent to work as a slave for stealing a small piece of bread .
After he ends his sentence , he has to solve many moral situations that prove who he really is .
What really makes the difference is if you choose to help others or not .
I think people who read the book ( written by Victor Hugo ) , who are interested in this historical incident , or who merely want to analyse human relationships must see the movie .
Meanwhile , wild animals which take forests and wetlands as their habitas will lose their homes and find it difficult to survive in jungles of concrete . Endangered animals will be harder to be found after the destruction of their homelands .
To reduce above problems , it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before construction of builings and transport and try their best to decrese the side effects .
They should provide economic support to those who once lived in such destroyed lands and help them improve professional skills to look for good jobs .
Although there will be many bad influences of large - scale building on people and animals , the countries would develop better if governments could take efforts to solve above problems .
Personally for me shopping is very pleasant , but sometimes it can be a little tiring .
First of all , if we are in shops , we can buy everything we want .
Anyway , it 's also some disadvantages of shopping .
He had very good talent but no one understood his creative mind .
Everyone considered him as a crazy and boring guy obsessioned by his passion ; except Kate , his only best friend , who encouraged him every time he wanted to let his dream down .
At that time Kate was working in an international advertising office .
They wanted something that could be traditional and revolutional at the same time , something that could give a new vision of the reality and Kate started to bring some information about many artist .
One night she was working at her home ; she was in difficulty because no one satisfy her clients .
She started to be a little bit nervous , she was n't able to find any solution when , suddeny , she remembered that Michael 's art had the features requested by her clients .
She immediately took the phone and called Michael and she started to explain her project .
Michael was very excited because he finally had the possibility to introduce his view of art throut his pictures .
After lots of meeting and conferences with the representation of China , Japan , Usa and Oceany Michael began to be the man who he dreamed since he was a child .
Everything was going good except his behaviour with his friend Kate .
On day the two guys had a terrible discussion .
Kate was really angry and she oredered to him to leave her room immediately .
Introduction
The purpose of this report is to propose the best places for visiting and to show the wide range of existing facilities which can be used by young people who are going to make a trip to my area .
Whenever I hear about famous actor or singer complaining on photographers following them , I ca n't get a smile off my face .
What 's a description of a famous person ?
Despite the fact I said that famous people need to be well known , I think that ca n't be applied on politicians .
The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie stars , but they should make their descisions transparent for most of the population tho .
It is their work to make descisions that ensure the benefit of the people in their country , but we do n't need to know nothing else about them , after they come home to spend some time with their families .

It is my pleasure to write a recommendation letter for mr .
I have known Kadeer since 2012 , when he joined the faculty of Computers and Information , Fayoum University as an undergraduate student .
He attended my labs on " structured programming " course during the first year .
We frequently discussed various hard problems in the scope of the course , and I was impressed by his analytical abilities .
He showed up a distinct and intellectual level among other students .
Also during this course , he had to work in a team and deliver a project as a requirement for the course .
He contributed excellent and innovative ideas during this project and he showed himself that he is an excellent team player .
Kadeer as one of the most excellent and outstanding personalities among his colleagues .
I believe that Mr. Kadeer will perform very well and I strongly recommend him for " Google Student Ambassador MENA Program " .
Assistance Lecturer at CS Dep . ,
Computers and Information Faculty ,
Fayoum University , Fayoum , Egypt .

He was very naughty and was not much interested in his studies .
He was a very big menace and the villagers hated him because of his mischievious behavior .
People gathered around his house hearing him screaming out loud and within no time the fire force also arrived at the destination .
He was even made to apologize to all his neighboring villagers .
this film was about the previous roberry which had been accomplished by Vin 's gangs leads to the hatred of a criminal stared by Jason Statham .
the chasing of Jason Vs Vin was so exciting furthermore the walkthrough is designed where Vin vs Jason interrupted by another party .
The end of the story when Diesel get cornered by Jason , spontaneously Dwayne came and fired jason with a machine gun .
The next scene was demolishing of the whole building as well as exploding of jason 's copter .
Vin 's family lived happily ever after because the enemy was eradicated and the rest were got jailed .
The film was the last movie stared by Paul Walker as in the film production process he passed away due to car accident .
This film 's Soundtrack , ' See You Again ' , was composed by Wiz Khalifa and dedicated to Paul .
This film will catch everyone 's attention because the scenarios , the action scenes , and drama beyond paul 's death are harmonized rigorously .
I know how much you like both activities so just I suppose you are having a hard time .
I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson you promised me you never give up!. You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you reached it .
You 've kept working on it for almost your entire life now and although you have not become a professional one you have never given up .
When I first introduced you to it you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements .
Proof that not only you are very determined but that piano was meant to be .
I 'd suggest we take some days off together and head for any particular place he would like to go to .
Then once we get on the car I 'd let the music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words .
At that point I would let his talking go without stopping him from interruption .
Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive .
I really enjoy volleyball and horse riding , although my favourite is swimming .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , especially in the Summer because in the water you can get fresh .
Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling , but public transportation is the most effective way to bring people from a place to another .
In fact , travelling by car is not convenient when people have their own cars for their family or themselves .
The main advantage of public transportation is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively low cost .
For example , a bus can take more than 40 passengers one time at a low cost .
The second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution for a city .
In conclusion , public transportation would still pay an important role of transportation in a city unless the environmental vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well for accommodating a huge number of cars .
Personally , people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons .
By doing so , you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential .
For example , when I was 17 , I was about starting my first day of class in the university .
I started to feel bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that did n't have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering , and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Laws , and so on .
I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation .
That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do - such as taking complementary courses - without rejecting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful later in the life .
Second , if you avoid doing things only because those do n't like you , you 'll miss opportunities .
As you can see , my friend lost the opportunity because he did n't like what he was requested to do .
Some people think that computers are the most important invention over the last century , while others think that are a lot of inventions over the history that are more important than the computer .
Personally , I think the computer brings many changes in the world , and is for that I think it is the most important invention .
Some people say that the computer change the way people see the world , and this change the way in which humans perceive everything that happens around the world or only in their social life .
For other part , other people only use the computer to have communication with someone , have entertainment with some movies , which can be from anywhere , or simply have some fun online with your friends that live abroad or are busy all the time .
In contrast , some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity , and although they accept that is an important invention and changes the world , they prefer to say that exist inventions more important than the computer that nowadays we still use .
Personally I prefer different movies .
Therefore I feel more peaceful when I view something funny , adventurous and undemanding .
Thank you for your reply , it was so useful , but I still have some doubts and I will be really glad if you could give me this necessary information .
First of all , I want to know what water sports do you offer , because our group of students would be probably interested in doing something related to water , for instance , surf , diving or sailing , due to the fact that they are used to being constantly in contact with the sea ( we live in Barcelona ) and , therefore , they develop a real passion for it .
In addition , I would also like to ask you about the type of equipment you can lend to do this kind of activities and sports I have just mentioned .
As you said , the safety of the students is our maximum concern , we must be completely sure that you will take care of them , chiefly because most of the students are still young and we have a strong commitment to their parents .
However , I do n't think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city , what is more if you take in a count the economic aspects .
Since my view , to use the public transport in this case have two important advantages : the first one you do n't have to care about parking ; the second one you can move in a relaxed way reading a book , listening to music or talking with other passengers .
Nevertheless , having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays , not only because the petrol price is continuously raising but also you have to pay high taxes for the car .
In short , although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than do it by public transport , it is not probably than in the near future they disappear .
As i recognized there are severeal way to improve because we are trying invent a lot of thing every day .
Using new vehicles , travelling can be more comfortable and easier .Everyone in this world would have a better life .I am really happy when I simply see a new bus with air conditioner or anything which can make travling enjoyable .
Most of the people are frustrated or nervous because they have to use public transport .
Artifitual Intelligent is one of the best way , we can switch drivers to these vehicles .
In conclusion we have a lot of things how o improve .
Help theme and enjoy your travelling .
In fact , probably it was n't a significant thing for most people but it was it for her .
Hello I 'm Mathieu Sanabria and I 'm here to deny and explain everything about the case of my sextape , I went to a party with my football team - mates and we were having a whale of time then some girls arrived and I started to talk with one of them , I like her and she likes me so we went to my room to have privacy and I do n't know how but some guys get into my room and started to record my with the girl and I did n't noted then many days after I received a call from a guy that tell me that he have a very explicit video of me doing things with a girl and that if I do n't give him some money he will put that video on the Internet .
He asked to me how much money should I wanted from Mathieu?Then I asked him how much do you need?He said about one hundred thousand euros and after that I said " you can get it".With hindsight , I was wrong because it was illegal .
The British band announced that the album was coming with news , a new singer , Bruce Dickison , joined the group and made the fans completely astonished by his nice - sounding voice .
The infrastructure build for controlling and maintaining the environment ecosystem friendly is worst in other words government and people do not care about the environment rather they spoiling the environment drastically .
The government always says the statement they are doing their best to improve environment but nothing as done perhaps they corrupting people money in terms of various projects that controls the pollution of the city .
The government is not only one to blamed but also people who leaving here , who never cares of their environment .
Although many factories and people is polluting the environment drastically but some people and organization is protecting the environment but most often these people are discriminated from society .
But they do n't care about this and continue with there work , often these people tend to demonstrate the effect of the pollution on people and future generation and made some people to change the way look the city but often some most people do n't care about what they trying to say and sometimes these people are scold .
So far people do n't understand the consequence of the pollution but with in decade they will then the suffer and understand the consequence of pollution in their life for sure .
I have seen your advertisement and I am more than delighted to take part in a summer camp as an assistant .
I think I have some experience with young children as I have to take care of my own brothers every day .
And in order to help them defend themselves I can also teach them some techniques about self - defense .
As the only Brazilian president from unprivileged background , Lula has made history after running for four times for President .
Since he took up the office in 2002 Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil , taking out more than fourty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty .
During Lula 's era , from 2002 to 2010 , Brazil experienced an economic boom as never before and became a world 's economic power .
Democracy also had fundamental changes on that period .
To curb corruption new laws were created , instituions were re - structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society .
Minority groups received more attention to protect their rights and investments in education , health and well being increased .
Curiously , Lula is the only Brazilian president without a university degree .
For the poorest Brazilians Lula and his history is to be proud of .
For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula , a poor migrant from northern Brazil , overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own , priviliged , university educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems .
I am writing to apply for a job in the USA I saw recently in your advertisement in a local newspaper from my city .
Further to our recent telephone conversation , I have worked as a babysitter with children aged 5 - 10 for five years .
Furthermore , I have worked in some important companies when I finished my degree in Journalism five years ago .
By the way , I had experience in the organization of sport and evening activities because at the university I did a course of Public Relations .
If you want to see my reports I can send you whenever you want or if you prefer to ask my teachers about me I can send you their phone numbers in case you want references from my job .
My teachers have said to me that if you want can write a letter about my experience .
Yours faithfully ,
Most people like to drive cars instead of using public transportation .
Students go to school or university by cars as well .
The government had to start a major public transportation projects in order to solve the problem .
Underground metro in Riyadh is one of those projects .
It 's fast , easy , comfortable and safe way .
Buses are much more convenient for driving kids to schools .
transport workers by public transportation or by buses is more convenient for big companies .
Public transport or travelling by car ?
I think travelling by car is a very comfortable way .
Yout do n't have to think about Bus timetables and gates .
You must know the timetables and at which gate the train will leave .
I think it 's right , that travelling by car will be more popular .
It is really good , it is better than the previous novel FSOGrey , i really mean it , It is not porn , BE GROWN UP PLEASE , when you do nt want to read the " sex parts " just turn over the next every single page till it ends , that s all , i hve done like that to finish that novel , This novel is just to tell us the passionate love story between a sucessful business man , chairmen man with stricly unhappy childhood , and only refers to his birth mother as " the crack whore " which related to the his recently behaviour - BDSM and the girl was seemed very bored of rountine life , innocent , did nt know anything about life , Apparently , THEY were so diffirent from each other but somehow , some magic connecting them to be a very lovely couple .
The two maps depict the main changes which take place in Shipsmouth between the year 1995 and 2010 .
Overall , it can be seen that the city has became more modern , with more transport and entertainment facilities .
One striking change is that a new station has been built , to connect the north of the city with the city centre and the road has been pedestrianized .
Another interesting redevelopment is that factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre , and in the same way was for Church which was pulled down to take place for a pub .
The urban areas were demolished , to make way for skyscrapers .
One must recognize the field and the strengths , as well as the weaknesses , of his opponent to make a point .
Thus it is a game with a combination of brain and physical skills .
For people starting to do this sport , one can try to train individually .
Information about the basic theory and technique on tennis can be gathered in internet / books .
Learning to do juggling will also be beneficial .
Many coaches advise their pupils to practise it for a better coordination of hand and eye .
But most importanly , one should enjoy all of this with fun .
I exactly do n't understand why people want to learn about private life of politicians and film stars .
Unfortunately , a lot of people are interested in others .
These happenings are not strange .
Because all the people have got predicaments .
But public wants to see famous politicians and stars in every situation .
For example they want to see well - known people with her boyfriend / his girlfriend or want to see them in causal attire or want to see famous women without make - up .
On the other hand , should be considered this opinion : Some of big names are important for someone who has them like an ideal .
However , being able to protect against an invasion of privacy is a fundamental human right of stars .
The government should give to superstars the right to protection of personal relationships and activities .
Ultimately , crowd - pleasing people also have got any civic rights just like everyone else .
It is more convenient as you can travel straightly to the place you want to go .
First of all , public transport provide the experience of the journey .
They give you the experience of flying in the sky or floating on the sea .
That is the experience can not given by car .
Third , public transport is good for the environment .
The newspaper " Times " publishes an intercepted letter written by the Spanish Ambassador Dupuy de Lowe that will make him resign due to what he wrote about the USA .
Next to the blow - up of the North American steamer Maine , the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures that it could n't be done from the outside , but from the inside .
On the other hand , the USA commission brings their results to the Parliament without previously notify their results to Spain and with the opposite conclusion of the Spanish commission .
However , the Spanish government does not agree with the USA 's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with an international arbitrage .
Later , the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba , but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans .
Mackinley ask for the arbitration of the Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain reclaims North Americans to get out of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict .
The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba .
Later , the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to military intervene in Cuba if necessary .
The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date .
In this Memorandum , the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of the president Mackinley .
Also , this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict , which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blow - up of the steamer Maine , the latter being remarked concerning the USA rejected the Spanish proposition to carry out the arbitrage together .
The 21st of April EEUU denies the Spanish sovereignty over Cuba , the 23rd of April Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and the 25th USA declares the war to Spain .
Since that day , the diplomatic relations between both nations will be suspended .
So it is not just a fundamental element of being a good person but also effects on your society .
But the problem is I do really care about my friends , so I always say " Yes " to my friends , because I do n't want to disappoint them .
That way you wo n't have lots of pressure , and you can be an honourable person .
I 'm glad you have graduated the school and that you have plans to go to the university .
It 's good for you to take a year brake before continuing with your studies .
I 'm going to make you a very nice ittinerary and hopefully we 'll also find something for you to work .
Then we can go visit the Fortress in Sighisoara which is the only fortress in Europe to be actually inhabited .
he says I shop too much but the fact is he does n't want to spend money , he stopped buying me flowers and chocolates and he stopped being romantic
anyway I still love him and still have the hope that this is just a temporary period in our life and he will be back to the man I loved once especially that we have the most amazing reason to live for its our beautiful son our angel and amazing love of our life .
Despite some people would suggest that such service has no future because people are more rely on car as it is convenient , it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has its future .
Firstly , the society today are more concerned about environmentally friendly .
This is a worth seeing be concerned because air pollution has negative impact on our health and the ecosystems .
For example , if a bus can carry 100 passengers , at least 25 cars can be reduced on road , solved the problem of traffic jam .
In addition , scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles , so they become less harmful to the environment .
In conclusion , I believe that public transport should have future .
Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco - friendly , and there are still many people rely on public transport .
Everyone deserves to have a private life , even celebrities and stars , who is a life and soul of the party during their working hours .
We all need a shelter , where we can hide from daily difficulties .
This is the only way to maintain mental health and not to fall into depression .
We can say for sure that stars and celebrities are also people .
What is more , celebrities as ordinary people need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationship with others .
They are not able to buy real relationships such as friendship and love .
They can gain fame and admiration thanks to their skills but their stage personality is more like a powerful creation .
Sometimes in everyday life they are not even interesting in terms of character and appearance .
That is why a private life is so important , especially for stars assessed all the time by society .
They showed me everything I should do .
I had to carry some musical instruments and install a software .
Then I helped with organization and selling tickets .
I love to help people and the best was I meet members of band and have the autographs !
I believe that knowing more languages is always better . that way people have a lot more culture and are more knowledgeable .
In conclusion learning languages may be very handy but can also be a killing time activity .
I saw your advertisement looking for a kids monitor , and I think I could be the best person to fill that position .
I have worked at schools in Spain and I have first hand knowledge about organising sports and activities .
We could learn new activities from each other .
Nevertheless , I realize this is not the ideal reference .
See my curriculum vitae , enclosed , for more details .
I would love to answer any question you could ask through this email , qq@gmail.com , and this mobile phone number , 666666666 . I would be delighted to attend an interview whenever you see fit .
Yours faithfully ,
They can barelly breathing with all those photographers around them .
Thay can really damage the reputation of someone .
For example , when fan follow the cab , she or he could be hurt , because the traffic is really unpredicable or when there is a huge mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
My opinion is , that the famous people deserve a quiet time , when they are with their partners or with family , but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym .
Years ago , we used to get through with other people ringing up or texting messages by our mobile phone and as time goes by , nowadays we also can communicate by social networks such as twitter , facebook , whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news , social issues by twitter instead of newspapers , for instance , it 's usually to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings news by his smartphone , an image so far from years back .
We also can have more knowledge about current issues by Facebook pages which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes such as political discussions , strikes , economy ... As far I concerned , nowadays population know more about what 's going on in the world than in previous years .
One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countries where their Government ban to have access Internet to citizens , in other words , they want to mislead about reality avoiding population could claim bu this nets or up in arms against their system .
On the other hand , we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends by facebook , uploading photos at any time , taking a coffee , watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere .
So , this means we are getting less intimity and becoming more gossiping at the same time , as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites .
You can follow to your favourite celebrities and have a direct interaction but this also has negative consequences such as some followers critise to them
Michael Xander is the famous team captain of Onix University , one of the most prestigious school in the Philippines .
He has everything : the looks , the brains and the charm but he has never felt contented .
Everything has been easy for him , he used to get what he wanted .
She was starstrucked .
This guy actually ask her out and she 's not that stupid not to know his intentions .
She just challenged him .
Since then , everything went so perfect between the two of them .
Celine realised that Michael is not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael 's reputation .
Tears automatically falls down her face .
Everything Michael did for her was just for a bet .
He just loves that girl that he would protect her from everything .
His eyes looked automatically on how Celine looked today .
Celine came in and kissed him aggressively .
Everything felt amazing and beautiful .
I knew everything .
Everything was just a bet right ? ' Celine said .
Everything that happened to us was too good to be true .
In the presentday community shopping is one of the most important part of life .
The very first reason for my disagreement is that I do not have enough money to purchase everything which I would like to buy .
Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and furthermore it gives me a big amount of sadness .
The next thing about unpleasant shopping are enormous lines .
The last , but not least reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a lot to a store in which I can buy everything I want .
Of course I might go to a few different shops , but without driving license travelling is tough task .
Architects , builders , painters and sculptors were brought from Europe by ship as well as all the material construction that were necessary for its building .
It is a sophisticated construction , full of details , everywhere around the theater , from the floor to the ceiling , everything carefully fashioned according to that period .
The place set out important concerts , presentations and international festivals until nowadays .
During the rubber age there was no urban life around the build , which is completely different from today of course since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater , that have the same age of the theater and is surrounded by art galleries , pubs , offices , houses , restaurants , where groups of friends , tourists and families are used to go to appreciate the breeze in the end of a warm day and during the night .
In big cities there 's a similar Sport called Basketball and this one is more for Boys .
Every monday we meet us in the sportshall of Mandach .
You can find more informations also in the Internet .
However , the lecturer points out the problems in all his assertions .
In contrast , the professor argues that they were impossibly weapons because they show no damage .
Nevertheless , the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible .
Last but not least importantly , the author asserts that the stone balls might serve a social purpose .
Science is developing very quickly and nowadays scientists are discovering new things .
I think people will not go out of their homes to buy goods and foods or clothes , because professional robots will be invented and they will do anything that you want , and they will obey your orders .
However , this can cause a problem for human and some people will face to the threat of compulsory redundancies .
I assume that another problem will be robots , because little by little they will capture the world and they will become human 's enemy , and that would be one of possibilities in the future .
In conclusion , I would say that developing is not very good for human , and little by little the world will be demolished by human errors .

In today 's world people use public transport in every aspect of travelling .
Nevertheless , travelling by car can be posing a real treath to public transport because it is much more comfortable .
Firstly , having a car makes travelling much easier .
Car gives comfort because you can personalise your space and your ride .
However , public transport is not threatened by car .
First of all , too many cars make towns crowded and create traffic jam , which is counterproductive .
Secondly , one car is making as much pollution as one bus which transports many more people .
It talks about an ordinary young woman who has everything she needs in life .
This book is very exciting because there is a lot of things that are happening and it 's not monotonous at all .
Recently , I have seen an advertisement about a job .
I have taken courses in the last 2 months in an organization that prepares activities for children aged between one to 15 .
This organization taught us how to deal with children , and how to make their lives happier and more joyful .
In addition we were also taught how to organize sports and activities for them in a way they will enjoy .
I believe that I am suitable for this job as I have huge experience about what is required . I would be on top of the world if you allow me to be one of the team .
Everything happened that summer I spent in Egypt .
My mother had found a new job in some ancient ruins , right in the middle of the desert . I should mention that she was an important archaeologist , known all over the world , and she had to travel to every corner on Earth .
I used to spend my whole holidays at my grandparents ' country house , surrounded by green fields , forest and rivers , but when I turned eighteen my mother thought I was old enough to take a plane on my own and stay with her for a month .
On the other hand , the taxi did n't even have air conditioning , so I spent the two hours of the journey trying to fan myself with a magazine I borrowed from the driver .
I reached the hotel well in the afternoon , nevertheless , the air was still oppressive and hot like at midday .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give some tips for tourist who come to the city . I will provide you with some pieces of advice about shopping clthes in the city as long as some recommendations .
In the city there are many fashion shops where you can get the most trendy clothes . You must be aware that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if you are a shopaholic , it will woth it .
Linda is a modern shop where you can find the latest fashion in Milano and luxury complements from the most known companies .
If the idea of a street marke does not seduced you , I recommend you visiting a is a little shop in Saint Peter street , The Old Bag , where you can buy bags and other complements such as umbrellas , gloves and scarfs .
Recommendations
I suggest a quick visit to every shop and make comparations in price and quality
This is a short report which will include my recommendation about the most interesting places in my town for them to enjoy .
In the " Culture Centre " your young visitors will be able to join daily cultural activities , such as theater , cinema and drawing classes , whereas in the " Sports Centre " they will have an opportunity to join many sports activities , such as bowling , swimming , athletics and karate classes .
Additionally , since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months , I suggest that they should subscribe to a Polish language course .
It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish language at least on a basic level .
The course would be three times a week only , and fully paid by the Polish government .
In short , a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience for your students .
Every year , in my house , we play the same role : my mother and my sister prepare different plates for Christmas dinner , and I am highly probably the responsible for carrying those plates from the kitchen to the dining room , because the rest of the family is lost in their conversations trying to save the world .
It was an unforgettable moment , I was looking at her slightly excited because she was eating alone without help and fast , which was and still is unusual coming from her .
If there were more buses or trains at any time ( also in the night ) , it could be convenient using them and letting the car in the garage .
Unfortunately it 's not possible because of the costs that the Economic System would be compelled to support .
So people often prefer using the car and paying for oil instead of the bus ticket but having more advantages : not to be constricted to wait for the buses and not to have to take a taxi in the night when they come back from the disco , for example ..
It 's a cheap service and it 's very appreciated from people who needs car not every day but only for a little time .
The Internship , a film of Shawn Levy with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn .
In the beginning , one of them , looks for a job asking to the boyfriend sister , but fortunately his friend convince him to find another work .
They send their curriculum .
Of course they are much more older than the other candidates , and when the staff control their curriculum only one member confirm their candidature .
Despite everything they could take part to the competition .
The google agency arranges a lot of people , and declares that only one group will have the possibility to win .
Of course when the groups arrange themselves , the two old men remain alone and they are forced to create a group with the discards .
Of course , on paper , this group haven't chances , but the events will demonstrate something of different .
This film is interested because it drafts work problems but not only for this ; it also transmits some important values like , the importance of the solidarity , the group cohesion and the importance not to lose the fait in dreams even if the situation is withstands .
Of course there are also negative observations about this film : for example there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story : they are n't interesting and they during so much time .
In addition some situations of the film are taken from the high school movie .
In conclusion this film is plain and a little discounted but in the same time light and funny film to watch during the summer with some friends .
It may help you to choose what to study at university as I know you haven't decided your mind yet .
If you do n't like this idea , there is an excellent website which offers a lot of jobs and maybe you find something interesting .
The rest of celebrities are artists or good workers .
It has to be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to asking or to taking photos .
If something changes in your life will be a notice in television , and people will invent rumours about you .
There are celebrities that sell their life in television and then do not want to journalists chase them .
There are other famous people who not appear in television and they are chased by reporters .
This is the result that something new has occurred and they want to collect information .
It is impossible to take a private life if you are a celebrity , because people who love you want to know about your privacy .
To summarize , if you expose yourself to television you will not have a private life .
I would like to apply for the job of instructor in the USA Summer Camp as advertised in the newspaper .
Last winter I had been working as a coach in my basketball team with kids about ten years old .
I have formation in basketball and Physical Educations .
Moreover I am very active and hardworking as you request .
Also I feel that I can be a positive incorporation in the Summer Camps .
House , which in we will be life in the future , would be full of complicated to use computers and robots .
Remarkable will be of course robots , which will help us in every day responsibilities , for instance in cooking delicious dishes , cleaning every thing in the house or even in washing and ironing clothes .
To be perfectly honest , ever human - being is dreaming of the home of the Future and ever dream is an individual , but in the future , our dreams will come true ?
Whether you want to visit some interesting place or building , you should go to our zoo , which is near Zlín in Lešná .
In the chateau is an exhibition of snakes and spiders .
It 's a beautiful place for every generations in nature and you can spend there all day .
If you were hungery , there are some restaurants a fast foods .
It is argued that famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
To illustrate my point of view I want to give some examples .
First of all being on the covers of rags help them make their more attractive for directors .
The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable , because popularity give possibility to earn more money .
Honestly , I do not like Nature Programmes so much because they are so boring !
I personally like Sports Programmes and Comedy Shows , because I love sports and also enjoy having a good laugh .
My favourite tv shows are " Hablemos de Football " , " Sports Center " , " Fox Sport " and " The Simpsons " , all these except " The Simpsons " are about sports , mainly football , basketball and rugby .
And as a sports lover I am glad to be informed about the latest matches of the international leagues like the " NBA " , " Premium League " and also the " National League " because of my deep love of sports .
I watch some football matches repetitions and Comedy Shows .

I enjoyed the past summer holiday , it is entertaining and I usually travel around Hong Kong with my family during weekends .
I usually wake up at around nine O Clock in the morning and spend the day by reading newspapers , books , and also digitalize some video tapes .
I enjoy reading newspapers so I can get updates on the latest development of incidents and news .
Furthermore , it can also improve my language skills .
I usually watch television programs from Discovery Network at night .
Besides , I find those talking about building massive structures and science interesting and I learnt some knowledge from those programs .
To get prepared to the things to be taught in grade 9 , I also flipped through some textbooks , including Integrated Science , Geography , etc .
And I find the knowledge to be taught in some subjects interesting , while some are n't .
As I am a member of the Robotics Team , I went to school for 3 days during the summer holiday to prepare for a competition on fourth of October .
Despite the hard work , I enjoyed the process of preparing the competition a lot .
We are looking for better conditions everywhere .
First of all is a traffic jam , if you stick in a traffic jam in a big bus you will waste much time then you expected on the road . Bisedes a public transport are overloaded at rush hours .Another downside is that most of buses are old and dirty .
That 's why people choose travelling by car because it ' is more convenient and fast .
Green And Clean Environment
Introduction
The aim of this report is to explain the way our Community have decided to preserve the nature of our town and which other activities could be useful in order to achieve this purpose .
On the one hand , if you belong to a School you can participate giving information to the children about the cathastrophic image our village would have if we do not reduce the pollution in the minimum range .
On the other hand , everyone has the opportunity to clean the streets where they spend most of the time .
Nobody has to be worried about the vacuum or the broom because it is provided by the Government .
In case you do not have time to help with that kind of activities there is a rule you must follow .
Recommendations
My recommendation is to invest in a good cleaning machine , consequently we will not have to spend hours cleaning the streets .
A high number of tourists visits Cáceres searching for culture , heritage and typical food from Extremadura .
For that reason , this town has a lot of facilities to cover that demand and to offer a good time inside .
The most attractive resource in Cáceres is its heritage .
One of the most particular things of this region is the food and Cáceres is the head city of gastronomy in Europe .
" Atrio " is the most important restaurant of the city and it has been recognised with two stars of the most famous guide for restaurant from Spain .
Anyway , " Atrio " is not just a fine food restaurant , but it is a five - stars hotel in the middle of the old town .
Pintores street is the commercial place of the city and it has a great selection of shops and restaurants with typical food from Spain .
Garlic is a plant , member of the lily family , with an odor and a taste characteristic .
It is known by Human history at least since 3000 B.C. In many cultures , garlic is associated with superstitions , providing bad or good lucky .
The slaves , who constructed pyramids , were fed with garlic , because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger , so they could work harder .
At the present time , modern Science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption in human health .
Experiments made with garlic and some types of bacteria , revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria .
Thereby , the bactericidal effect of the garlic , probably can explain some ancients ' beliefs that this plant can help in some illness treatments .
Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic in blood system .
It was demonstrated that garlic has a compound that can make the blood " thinner " .
Therefore , include garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health as some cultures believed .
How many of us today are really into helping the environment .
Is it worth all the time , energy and money in convincing people to be responsible to their environment ?
I recently joined a campaign program in Manila , Philippines dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources .
I was very enthusiastic in all the activities not until after that one event .
I found out that the leaders of this organization are not realizing the beliefs and principles they are imparting to the public .
They are not a good representation of their ideals .
I backed off and decided to just continue to do my personal contribution in helping mother earth .
Maybe we can not convince the whole world participate in helping the environment right away , but it can begin with ourselves .
I am now living an environment - friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago .
This just did n't save me from too much gasoline expenses , but it also made me physically fit .
Forthly , I am only buying organic products for consumption and keeping a small spice garden at my backyard .
And finally , I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing inorder to help our environment .
All in all , I think that helping our environment does n't have to be big time . We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable nor irrevocable .
That is a small start , but will eventually reap a huge outcome .
To begin with I would like to tell you that I am really interested in the course because I think it would provide me some professional advantages have in my career as a school teacher .
Learning languages is increasingly important in the teaching sector so I want to improve it .
I reckon my weak points are speaking and listening skills nevertheless I would be also interested in working over writing and grammar points .
Although I am in my late forties I am still very active so I like practising sports , music and going to the cinema as well .
Michael is an American guy , living in and studying in the Netherlands at the Leiden University .
He lives in the Netherlands for about a year .
One day he went out with couples of friends , they went to a night club called " Miami beach".They were dancing and having fun and then he saw a beautiful girl and she could n't take her eyes of him , so he decided to go and talk to her .
Without a second thought i decided to follow the directions on the puzzling map .
The directions took me along a path towards a cave and i went into it .
I had been wellprepared and i carried a lantern .
I am writing in connection with your stay in Cracow .
I know you 're looking for interesting place to visit so I want to offer you place where you can rest , have a lot of fun and spend great time with your group .
I want to recommend the amusement park , one of the most interesting place to visit here .
On the face of it it sounds childishly but I think it 's a good way to spend free time even for adults .
This is a huge amusement park with many attraction for young people looking for excitement .
Yours faithfully ,
First and formast , the bank notes should be designed and the design includes background colour , artwork and securityissues .
Going forward , it should be the preparation of metal plates .
In this step , skilled machinists is required .
dispatched .
The difference is the good part will be kept while the bad part will be destroyed .
So , I 've tried to translate your French on Google translator and I 've could n't understand what you mean about my English and Google translator . I 'm used to write English and I have an intermediate level .
I use Google translator to find an equivalent word to a Spanish word sometimes .
It is n't easy at all , they 're too different languages , and I prefer to use the software " Grammarly spellchecker " to get some help .
There is a new and stunning basketball players generation .
He 's improving his game in a spectacular way .
It is n't only that he 's a very good player ( He is :D ) but also , thanks to his style of play , his assists , and points has served as a lever to his team that has improved dramatically .
He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old .
His current team is preparing him physically in the gym , his physical form has improved a lot and now is faster , stronger and he 's still 23 years old .
Watching him play is a delight , especially his assists and juggling games while he looks at the opposite direction .
The " Di roma reataurant " is a restaurant situated in the heart of a small village " Monção " is very popular , between teenagers and adults who love to eat pizza or any other fast food .
As you enter the place you are welcomed by a magnificent setting , a lot of paintings of the city .
The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
The restaurant also caters for all tastes by providing a large selection of the best wines of the region , who are very popular around the country .
I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours .
For this reason I highly recommend going to Di Roma restaurant .
Firstly , it is very good for the environment because it reduces a lot of carbon dioxide gasses which if everybody took the car instead of taking public transport would pollute the atmosphere
Secondly , travelling in public transport makes much easier to travel at rush hours or on those moments in which you should not take the car
Finally , it is a good way of travelling because it is safer than travelling in a car or in a motorbike and also in the way that you are much relaxed than in a car and it saves time too .
To conclude public transport is good for the environment , it makes much easier and cheaper to travel , and it , in some way , saves lives .
It 's some kilometers outside of it .
It 's a big country and does n't have many inhibitants .
But they also where the ones that first discovered Greenland , North America and Asia .
The most people in Sweden are christians .
The nature in Sweden can be very cold , especially in the northern parts of Sweden .
Most people go to highschool and unversity .
He 's one of the best football players in the world and is really popular both in Sweden and in other countries , especially in Europe .
After the handover in 1997 , it becomes a special administrative region of China .
From 1980 's , it is developed as an international financial centre and so many global investors have set up their headquarters in there .
For the education , every developed country is concerning with the issue .
Hong Kong government has invested lots of capital to develop a better education system for building a knowledge - based society and the better future .
As mentioned , Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China , those systems and laws are different from Mainland China .
Residents in Hong Kong are enjoying highly - freedom in religion , speech , organizational , activities , going abroad during the life .
Owing to those separated characteristics , actually , Hong Kong can be described as a colourful and brilliant city .
Going places is of paramount importance for people , and going quickly even more ; that 's why I think public transport is not the most efficient way to go places .
The use of public transport takes more time than using the car , which can be considered as a waste of time .
All this makes using the car much convenient due to the fact that not only do you leave when you want , but also straight away from the very door of your own house .
When you go by car you may control your timing , stop at will and if you go with someone else , it may be cheaper : provided the cost of the journey will be the same , no matter how many passengers you take with you ; while on public transport you should pay a ticket for every single rider .
Anyway , to tell you the truth I 'd rather take a train , for instance , it means travelling in a relaxing way , not running risks of accidents , having the chance to read or play " travelling " chess , meeting new people , as in a stage coach but moving faster
I am writing in response to your advertisement , which appears in this month 's edition of EnglishAcademy magazine .

As well as I have also work under pressure and meet deadlines without any problem because I am used to be resourceful and manage time efficiently .
In terms of my suitability for reception and administrative roles , I am organized , amiable and helpful .
In addition , I have excellent customer service skills and am highly efficient with the use of computers in a wide variety of applications .

I would genuinely welcome the opportunity of an offer to work for your language school .
Please do not hesitate to contact me for any further information or to arrange a personal meeting .
Yours faithfully
I do n't know what I have to say but the only thing that I know is that my English pronunciation is not very good .
I want to improve my English pronunciation skills so I can be able to understand native speakers .
I have an American girlfriend and she is very fluent in English because it is her mother language .
I want is to be fluent so she can understand what I want to tell her .
Now I decided to improve my writing skills because once it became improved I would be very happy and I think that my ideas ' expression will be good .

Thank you for sending me the correct form of my writing and I am really appreciate that very much .
He completed his studies six years ago but since then he was unable to find a proper employment in his Country .
Therefore , he decided to migrate looking for better job opportunities .
After a complex and difficult journey , Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coasts in 2011.Helped by a Senegalese community , he has eventually found a job as a fruit seller in a local market .
Despite his high qualified studies in education , Mohamed had to carry on a job in a completely different field .
The phenomenon of immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last decades .
However , nowadays even in the rich Western Europe , many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find an employment .
This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other Countries .
Such a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools , which has failed to adapt to the changes brought in the society by globalization .
Therefore , once graduated , qualified youths find themselves to face both the economic crisis and a hostile job market .
I believe that Governments from different Countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and , therefore , contribute to worsen the impact of the economic crisis .
I go cycling and running regularly so I think I could define myself a sportswoman .
I am a passionate reader in particular of thrillers and French poetry .
Therefore I think this experience of three months can offer me a unique chance of growing as a person and better understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent .
I think this experience is the challenge that I need in order to become more mature and responsible .
Therefore I would be more than willing to share this experience with another student .
As the 6th of September there is going to be the university entry test for Medicine , I will have to flight back to Italy for a couple days .
Last year I did some graphic designs for the website of a society called SHIPinSPACE .
In addition , last year I participated in a stage at the ASL of Rivoli .
I am going to repeat the experience in March at the local hospital .
Because , when we decided to go for a shopping and have an idea what we want to buy and it appears that we ca n't find what we want , we are disappointed and frustrated .
Sometimes , shopping - particularly for women - is the best way to ameliorate the mood .
Unfortunately , shopping also can bring displeasure .
Because everybody drive their cars and motorcycles on road that the traffic jam will not only be the serious problem to the government but also be the safe problem to citizens .
Therefore , the government need to make a good traffic policy to ensure citizen 's safety and welfare of have privilege of driving on road .
In a result , I think if traveling only by car is not a wise choice for earth although it is convenient .
But we need to think that there is a better way to protect the earth and human 's environment such as riding bicycle or waiting for environmental - friendly car being invented .
The lifestyle of the people has changed completely in the past 20 years .
Even though there are more and more cars on the roads , I do not think this tendency will completely reduce the demand for public transportation for the following reasons :
There are many people who have experienced a carcrash , or just simply afraid of driving , so they prefer to use public transport system .
Not to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers ' life and it is less about convenience even if travelling by car means you do n't need to adjust to other passengers .
I 'm from Ecuador a country surrounded by a great number of natural resources .
We are an underdeveloped country , like other countries says a " third world country " , but I 'm happy about that .
We see what they really are , the underdeveloped countries that they are .
Recently my country is starting to develop their resources , our renewable energy as wind , solar , hydropower , geothermal energy .
Starting to develop our nation , it is eventually starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment .
Traditional energies are focus on give to big cities all the resources .
Also it is a big opportunity to help them .
They need resources to improve their live condition until my country could has the possibility to give them a better live opportunities .
It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is big cities , without looking and help the surroundings .
Nowadays my country have started to build a great number of hydroelectric , wind parks and we also starting to think on geothermal energy .
But I think one thing that it is necessary before implementing this type of energies .
All of that require further studies have been done and with that , we could know the feasibility of the projects and the size of them .
Implementation takes time and money , but if the project does not work all of that could be spent in vain .
Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then build large constructions to extract them .
Sustainability is about found the better way to interact with the environment .
It is like to make friendship with nature and knows that what it needs of us and show what we need of it .
Trying to take care of it , extracting only the necessary and trying to cause the least possible damage .
Starting to interest in alternative energy and try to see forms to use in your native country is the first step .
The implementation of projects not need to be only for spending money .
In a good way implementation of projects helps to improve citizens lifes .
All those little steps help to our nation to build a developed country , friendly with the environment .
It makes mandatory for the inter - city buses , commercial vehicles and other heavy vehicles to use Compressed Natural Gas ( CNG)instead of diesel .
It encourages people to plant more trees and cutting of them have been made a punishable offence .
Burning of leaves and other waste products have also been made punishable offences .
A large number of huge capacity waste treatment plants have been established to keep the city clean and green .
Recently , for the protection of environment , the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehicles of more than 15 years .
Gradually , people of the city are getting cautious with respect to the environment and they are trying best of them to keep it clean and safe .
People are inculcating the habit to dispose garbage at a defined space .
They are conserving rain water using rain water harvesting process .
They are trying to reduce dependency on private vehicles and switching on public transport mode .
Installation of solar heater , solar lights , use solar cell watches and driving electric cars are in vogue in the city .
There are four main characteres the owner 's hotel a moody man and his bossy wife , and the workers a pleasant maid and a Spanish waiter who does n't speak English .
In every chapter new clients go to this hotel and have a lot of crazy , funny and sarcastic situations , between workers , owners and customers .
Particulary when the owner gives orders at the waiter , this situations became hilarious .
As the technology develops rather rapidly , it 's a world - wide phenomenon now for us to find that large - scale buildings and transport networks are to be built for the sake of human 's economy , which means vast areas of farmland , forest and wetland are on the way of being ruined .
Fitst of all , the environment that belongs to both man and wild lives is going to lose balance in the ecosystem .
It indicates that more kinds of species are endagered for they are unable to adapt themselves to the remaining lands .
Vegetables and other food planting on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of human may not be meet one day .
Moreover , with the decreasing number of trees and many other plants , carbon dioxide can not be coped with by those natural machines , which will melt the remaining ice in the world .
As far as I 'm concerned , it 's critical for governments to take mesures to reduce the problems .
Firstly , relevant laws and principles should be put up to forbid extravagent expansion in the natural system .
In addition , supervision of the protecting steps need to be undertanken by the government .
What 's more , the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually , no matter in campus or in the public places .
Anyway , to key to protect our living environment from being destroyed is to do it by we indivisuals step by step .
I 'm looking for à language centre which prepare students to take a Cambridge exams especially the F.C.E. On reading the newspaper , I 've heard about your classes and your method seems efficient .
I am interested in applying in one to one class in order to study the most efficient I can .
Will you give me more information about it as soon as possible in order to book in quickly .
yours faithfully ,
Anyway , the man was wearing an orange costume , he was surprisingly tall and slim and he was completely bald except for a long black ponytail coming out from the head .
UNFORGETTABLE FRIEND
She was quiet , but interesting at the same time .
We are different , but I think that that is a curious thing about friendship .
8 years later she has become my best friend , my lost sister , my complement .
She was hard to find , but impossible to forget .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He forgot he had a doctor 's appointment and he was running late .
He finishes getting ready for his appointment .
How could he forgot the time of his appointment ?
He still needs to find an ATM to withdrawl some money to pay for his appointment .
On the other hand , public transport is inconvenient .
Pickpockets can have a field day with all the commotion of rush hour .
Furthermore , there are certain forms of transportation , such as trains , that do not travel to the suburbs , so people either have to walk long distances to reach the nearest stop or be dependent on one form of public transport to catch another which can be a great source of stress if there is ever a delay .
There are many dogs who are loyal and trustworthy than many people in the earth .
For illustration , My friend has a dog , one day when they were in his farm .
For that reason I appreciate my pets as if they are one of my friends .
Secondly , reason for my propensity of treating pets as a family member , is that they have souls .
Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered as human friends .
Many people can talk with their pets as if they understand them .
One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pets as they are their psychiatrist .
After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness .
I would argue that treating our pets as our friends is an indication of humanity .
They can take care of us and love us in a very interesting way .
I am writing to you with the reference to your advertisement which I saw in the " Daily News " .
I am sixteen years of age , pursuing a degree of Intermediate at Imperial College , assiduous to work .
I would love to arrange fun activities for children .
I have gained some experience of working with children while baby - sitting of my cousins the previous year .
I would feel relieved if you would let me know about the commencement of the program as I can travel in this month and the salary offered per week .
Please do not resist contacting me if any further information is required .
Yours faithfully ,
My work was very interesting and exciting .
Unfortunately , my scholarship was ending and I was thinking about backing home .
I hung up the phone and I go out to celebrate the moment with my colleagues .
Unforturnately , the process only gone on twelve hours .
Our goal was increasing the storage capacity in several days .
We built a pilot plant to test our investigations in the laboratory .
The public administration helped us when we showed our solutions .
We are going to build an industrial plant to achieve our dream : storing renewable energies without using toxic materials and mining commodities from the Earth .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
However , Peter decided to reject Tommy 's invitation , and continue to do his homework .
He was frustrated .
Maybe the day itself would n't be extraordinary , but , for sure , she will remember it all her life .
The day before all the clothes which were inside the luggage had been classified on the bed : trousers , spring t - shirts , nightdresses and so on .
She was doing all the routine activities automatically , thinking in her next journey .
She was brave and intelligent , so she was going to start a new life with new opportunities in a different and fairer country .
They think that big - name has marvellous life with no problems , no duties , or worries .
But people should realized , that there are many advantages and disadvantages of being celebrities .
As far as I 'm concerned , there are more disadvantages .
They ca n't go to the cinema , or theatre , or just go for a walk without being recognised .
No matter where famous person goes , he must realized , that next day he will be on first page newspepers with lots of rumours .
Celebrities do n't have an easy life .
Beacuse , what is proper in living when journalist following every step the famous person takes ?
In my opinion journalist and other people should accepted and respected it and sometimes they should just let go .
Nevertheless , celebrities decided on that kind of life .
So , I think , that they must have known about the consequences and just live as they like .
I have seen the advertisement of the vacancy in your cafe in the local newspaper and would like to apply for this position .
I am 22-years old part - time student of the local University .
I have had two previous places of employment .
First was in the bar , owned by my uncle , and the second - in a local restaurant named " Dragon " ( Chinese cuisine ) .
I am an accurate , punctual and trustworthy person .
My employers have never complained of my services .
I resigned from my last employment because the restaurant had been closed for a long refurbishment .
I am also ready to work longer shifts on Wednesdays , and on Fridays and Saturdays can work extra time .
If you need any references , I can request them from the University Student Center and from my last employer . I am ready to start my work next week .
My mobile number is 0789999999 .
Colosseum is the most famous and biggest building of the Ancient Rome and it is also the biggest amphitheater in the World .
The name of this construction is related to two reasons : one reason is related at the dimensions of the building , the second reason is because near there is a bronze statue .
And it was inaugurated in 80 a .
The name Colosseum spread only in the Middle Ages , in Ancient times it was used for gladiators shows and for other public shows .
The Colosse was often restored because it was often in difficult situations .
Finally I can say that the Colosseum it 's a fantastic construction as for beauty as for importance and if a tourist came in Italy for the first time he should see the Colosseum
I wish to express my dissastifaction with this course .
We felt hot and he had not any refeshment facilities .
Never have I seen such a lack of organization .
When we complained to the course teacher , we were told that things do not depend on him .
Yours faithfully ,
My perfect hotel would be near to the beach , in the Mediterranean coast , because in this area there are many tourists .
The hotel would have many services and facilities like a good reception , spa , wifi conection and pay TV in the rooms , a great chef who did the dishes of the mediterranean cuisine , a swimming pool , a bar in the beach and a boat for trips around the mediterranean sea .
This is the hotel of my dreams , but the most important is that the people were happy in their accommodation , if they are happy they will return next year .
The peformance turned out to be pleasing , with a lot of witty jokes .
The acting was surprisingly emotional , but a bit wooden .
After the show I was introdused to one of the actors , who was my friend 's cousin .
His answer astonished me ; he did not want to become a professional actor .
Moreover , he found being famous extremely irritating .
I , like most people , took for granted that celebrities not only seek fame , but also benefit from it .
They experience gracious living , enjoy glitzy parties and admire their photos in glossy magazines .
Paparazzoes make public their day - to - day routine , hobbies and passions .
When it turns out that all who we got used to idolise are just people with their shortcomings , we become disappointed .
We watch mercilessly how celebrities topple from their thrones and even find pleasure in that .
Why do n't we want to give people entertaning us a chance to be themselves and to have a really private life ?
I love MASTERCHEF .
It 's one of the best tv cooking programme that I have ever seen and I absolutely agree with you when you say that this programme promotes the individual and collective work .
I have a friend who went to MASTERCHEF and he taught to the amateur cooks how to make bread .
He told me that it was an exciting experience .
I think that you give us a lot of information about the programme , and your opinion about it is very interesting .
They are more beautiful and popular than he , all girls are in love with their and all boys would pay to participate in their parties , including Michael and their friends , who were always excluded .
In the end , the party turned out a success , for Michael was the beginning of his popularity .
But the house was destroyed and the neighborhood furred for the confusion caused during the night had called the police that without his knowledge waiting outside the house Micheal to take him to the police station .
After everything that had happened Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake
I 've just finished my teacher degree and I have experience in schools , could you send me any webpage where I can find more information about how to apply for a job in the UK ?
I think that it could be a great opportunity to improve my English skills and learn lots of things about the UK culture .
I would like to save some money , and at the end of my UK experience , spend my time travelling around your country .
Is it interesting ?
Could you tell me the most important attractions around your city ?
Send me some tourist information if you have .
In a family , responsibilities increase with age . I have some , not a lot .
Nowadays Environmental issues have become a great concern for scientist as the problem is growing .
What can people do every day to help the environment ?
Water and electricity are wasted day after day , while a little change in people 's habits can make a difference .
okay , let us back to the decoration ,
She always believed in such premonition .
She quickly packed her hand bag and ran out for a bus to university .
Many people choose to go travelling to relax .
Going travelling , people may scheduled various destination and time .
According to the above reasons , car travelling will be the best choice .
Unlike public transportation , there is no limit in your way , no fixed timetable by car travelling .
Car travelling makes people feel free during the journey .
Most of the time , pet is not allowed to be in a public transportation , which not a good thing for a pet owner .
Above all , car travelling is not only convenient but also free in your journey which leads public transportation into a fading future .
The conception of beauty has changed since people started thinking they need to be thin to become pretty .
She has always looked for perfection .
Sandrine always skips it because she thinks it is unnecessary if she wants to be thin .
I had never felt so nervous when about six months ago I decided finally to join the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) exam .
Because I had decided to take my exam in June , it was absolutely necessary to join an English preparation course as soon as possible .
So , I had started to learn English very frequently and pretty hard .
Very soon I had recognized that the process of learning was not easy as I fought .
But I am really lucky person . I had found a good teacher who supported me all the time . I also had some colleagues who had the same aims as mine .
We had been meeting for learning frequently .
We had organized some additional exercises , such as English movies night , a one day trip to London , and a book discussion about English writers and poets .
Because we did n't live in any English native country , we had tried as much as possible to create an English speaking environment .
Today it is a big day for me and my colleagues .
I want to be an expert in such areas as drilling , exploitation and development of oilfield , that is why I want to get a master degree abroad , or PhD at my university .
I think I have sufficient background , my GPA is good enough .
Beyond that throughout my university education , I have been a participant of scientific conferences and I took pains to practically assimilate everything I had learnt during my study .
For example , I have successfully completed « Offshore Drilling » course of « Total » Professors Association and I mean to broaden my outlook in the future .
The main attraction here is absulotely the beach .
I hope everything is great back in Sweden , see you soon !
There 's going to be a competitions for a month , whit excellent prizes .
The magazine also has a letters page and they pay $ 25 for the most interesting letter or email .

what young people are interested in today .
First of all , our generation youth people are more

With reference to your recent ad about weekend cafe work , I am interested to apply .
I enjoy cooking and interested in different kinds of food , especially Asian cuisine .
I had expenience in cooking food and reception for parties / functions as I was a member of the School Parent Association of my kid 's school .
As a member , during many occasions such as Christmas Party and School Open Day , I had opportunities to learn different kinds of food from other members as well as providing reception duties .
I really enjoyed answering parents ' enquires and introducing our school to them .
These are invalunable and relevant experience to the job I applied for .
Whether movies and TV programs made in our own country are more interesting than movies and programs made in other countries has been widely discussed .
To begin with , foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating .
Although the plots full of turns , they still very reasonable , and not make their audience felt that the plots are very strange .
For example , the first one 3 dimensional movie , Avatar , the movie maker spend a lot of energy and time on developing the novel movie genre .
It eventually made very good impression on its audience , and the most important for a commercial movie , it really did very well at the box office .
Additionally , people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies .
Furthermore , foreign TV are more international and educational .
What 's more , the National Geographic and Discovery also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I ca n't learn from native programs .
However , I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture , or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain , they could get more reflection as recreating .
Plus , watching foreign programs also could attain the goal of those people-- relaxation .
In sum , although there are some dissenting views , one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs .
With an intense passion in fashion , I aspire to become a professional product merchandiser in the apparel industry and initiate myown branding business with my older sister and her husband .
Both of whom have more than five years of experience in marketing planning and own a large number of fabric sources .
Therefore , I plan to maximize my previous experience with knowledge of psychology , skill of product development design to pursue graduate studies , and build up my ability in the Master of Fine Arts program in Fashion merchandising at Academy of Art University .
It is said that the main objective of telelevision is entrentein people and make their free time happier .
However , television should n't be used only for this purpose for different reasons .
On the one hand , most people have , at least , one television in their homes , so it is very accessible to everyone .
For this reason , instead of entertaining , television should contain educative programmes .
They are used to manage different technologies as television or computer .
I think that children ca n't be supervised for their parents all the time because they have to work and make home tasks .
For this reason is important for them having a good educative programme on television .
I ' am not saying that television has to educate our children , but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things as numbers or letters .
Television is very important to give language skills to children .
When I was young I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things as geography or maths and it helped me a lot .
Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation issue to talk with friends .
In particular every week you can find " Il panino più " , a special roll created by the fancy of the cook .
Of course I prefer to go to this pub with my family or with my friends , especially if I have to celebrate something , for example birthdays , anniversaries or something else .
I remember , when one of my daughters celebrated her eighteenth birthday , the pub 's owner put the number eighteen , made by cheese on the roll , with a little candle .
They have many different cakes : profiterol , meringata , tiramisù and so on .
Especially with their mothers , girlfriends or wives .
But also women think that shopping can be an unpleasant experience .
Particularly when we talk about everyday running from shop to shop to buy lettuce , meat or a tooth paste .
It can be really frustriting .
But when we think about going to the shopping centre with our friends it can be fun . We do n't even have to have money , because we can just go and do windowshopping .
Without spending money , we can get inspired by new collections or people that we see in the city .
I can understand people who say that shopping is boring .
Especially when we go from shop to shop but we ca n't find anything interesting .
Generally , shopping can be seen as enjoyable experience or just a usual need in order to survive .
A most famous person from my country is Mr. John Stefferson , who worsks in a department store and always planning how to make people life more comfortable and better .
I had absolutely no idea .
She was surprisingly open to thought that I could try it at least .
I were absolutely excited .
UNEXPECTED VISIT
How dare she could come to my door!There was no words to express my feelings ...
Suddenly , he 'd cut the connection between us .
It was an angagement ring !
The congratulations words below the picture was explaining everything : He've got married to someone else !
" He 's died . " she said as if she was whispering .
Now , after all those long years have gone by with full of pain , disappointments , missing and regrets ; all I have was the memories which saved by him into a little wooden box .
I 've never got the reason made him leave me although all his love for me , unfortunately ...
People argue that today 's television is a load of rubbish , the quality of many programs is absolutely questionable and in many cases the language is vulgar .
Reasons why television has inherited this reputation are several .
Then , the large number of entertainment programs broadcasted discourage those who want more cultural or factual programs , as they have been drastically reduced .
It seems a result of the fact that , after a long day , people prefer to unwind in front of the television , watching " entertainment programs " rather then news or what 's up in the World .
Moreover , on television there are a lot of advertising constantly interrupting the broadcast , and of course this fact is very unpleasant .
Despite all these facts , it is without doubt that television has changed our lives .
There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before to condemn it .
For example , the wider choose of programs from all over the World , allow us to discover new cultures , new languages and new societies without travelling , and this enhance our knowledge .
In addition to that , the cost of the television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema , the theatre or Opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone .
Also , it is very important to remember that we have always the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when .
To sum - up , I think television is a very good value for money , the point is being able to choose what we want to watch .
Firstly , there are two kinds of famous people : those who want to have a private life and who do n't want everybody knowing each aspect of their lives and those who sell certain parts of their lives in magazines , journals or TV programmes or their entire private life .
Secondly , taking this into account , I think that everybody has the right of having a private life and the right of living without journalists following them to everywhere .
Of course , they can control that by complaining in a trial .
But in contrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures and it could arrive an embarrassing moment and if you have sold a kind of things like this before you ca n't say nothing .
It is absolutely rewarding to receive good news from an old friend who has been absent of my life for so long time .
I would be completely happy to provide you with some accommodation while you stay in my country .
I am currently working at a place where I am getting a great wage so I have the possibility to accompany you on your journey .

Wrestling is new sport , which is unknown to many of my colleagues at the College .
Wrestling is contested by two people while others wait for their turns respectively .
Wrestling is both interesting and entertaining sport .
Traditionally , we provide a firewood as a means of light at night for the sport .
It takes place in the middle of the village where there are enough space for the spectators .
Refreshments are on sale at a discounted price to visiting team .
I am a teacher in a High School and the authorities in my country let me stay there , improving my English .
I would like to say that learning any languages is complicated to someone , whatever you come from , but in my opinion there are many matter to discuss .
A good ilustration of this would be children .
One child whose parents come from different countries is able to learn two languages at the same time , this child does n't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language , but they are listening to their parents speaking English their native language all the time and this let them learn without any difficulty .
On the other hand , if you go abroad you will be able to improve your English in anglophone country , in this case , your knowledge will be reinforced with your stay there .
But if you have one opportunity to go abroad , this would be so good for you and your English .

Construction will be ameliorated .
However a sweeping appearance wo n't be different .
Although , I think , that all the systems , which work in homes ( electricity , gas , heating system , water , etc . ) will be upgraded .
New technologies are going to seize architecture .
Though , it will affect on the environment in a good way .
For one thing - convenience .
Huge , bulletproof windows are my biggest dream . I could n't live without them .
Except that , every room will be full of interactive gadgets .

THE MOST INTERESTING WEEKEND ON MY LIFE
Are beautiful moments , but now I reckon that there is n't nothing more interesting than having all your family together talking about whole background .
Surprising stories that we will not never imagine .
My family are n't so close and is distributed in many cities on my country , after some incidents in the past , many things changed and each family followed their own way .
We rented a wonderful place outside our city , spectacular atmosphere .
It was the most interesting and astonishing weekend that I have lived eve .
Everything was amazing , a lot of memories , we laughed a lot , we did many activities like bbq , table games , watched movies , swimming pool , among others .
Now I believe that the best moments in the life are when you have time with your family , is the best way to recharge energy for everything .
Many times we pay more attention to other things , it can do it in many opportunities .
In my opinion travelling by car is more comfortable than travelling by public transport because you can choose where do you want to go and the time you prefer to start your trip .
Travelling around the city by car was faster than public transport .
Sometimes public transport is interesting because you can use it when you want to go to a party and you probably drink some wine , beer , etc .
I 've seen your letter and I 'm writing this to you to say what I do in my country to help saving the environment .
We tried to convince the Headmaster to help us monetarily but it was n't enough .
Indroduction
The aim of this report is to outline what are the best places to have fun in Valencia for young people , what facilities exist for them and how these could be made better .
Activities around the city
Also , it would be a good idea go to the beach to spend the day and play volleyball or sunbathing , because this it is always a good plan .
Other activities in the surroundings .
In addition i suggested going by bus around the surroundings of the city , where you can do adventure sports , like canoening , climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoy the countryside
Recommendations
I recommend that they should do both activities , Valencia city and also de the surroundings .
My favourite kinds of movie is comedy and drama comedy because it has interesting plot and person , who watches comedy can lought all the time .
As Lloyd Cohen ( the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis ) said lottery play is not economically irrational and uninformed .
He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe , but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibilty from scaping from one 's current life by acquiring wealth .
Cohen 's knwoledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational .
Some people like to calculated the gain or lose from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dolar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams .
Though this has been an amusing debate , we the affirmative side , on the weight of our argument and proof , have concluded that lottery should n't be banned in the US and Spain , because it is a tradition , it gives help , hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment .
I hope my suggestions will help you .
The swimming pool in Brunete has customers from all age groups , but it is especially suitable both for young and elderly people in order to improve their mobility .
On the one hand everything is very cleaned including floor , bath and corridors , in addition , if you are a disabled person you will not have any trouble to get there because there are some ramps to help you come in .
On the other hand you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use facilities , and besides , you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building .
In my opinion the swimming pool is convenient because you can walk to swim if you live in town but is very expensive , particularly for young people .
Famous people have been always sorrunded by a lot of journalists and paparazzies who follow them wherever they go .
Those people could be politicians , film starts , singers , football players and so on living in a constant stress because they can not have a " normal " life , and , from my point of view , that 's normal because they live for this , they are public people and because of this they have to keep calm and carry with it .
Therefore , most of this famous people complain of this but it is logical that all the media , television , radio and journalists are constanlty devoting every minute of the day to them because people are interested in them , in knowing what they are doing every second , in knowing with whom they are , in knowing what they like or do n't like , their hobbies , in short , in knowing everything about them .
In conclusion , being famous is really difficult and frustrating as well , but in contrast , they earn a lot of money and they are loved by so many people though they have to accept some critics because not everybody has to love them .
It has many disadvantages .
We live in a time of acquisitiveness and people buy many things , even if they ca n't afford it .
Times in which we live are conducive to addictions .
In Italy there are few cities with the hunderground and often in the smaller cities there are only bus .
I hope for the next generations a better public service and an increasement of its use .
At 6:20 I open my laptop , go to page : Youtube.com and start to study French with Mrs .
I write down new French vocabularies or grammars into my notebook .
I pack my backpack , take my garbage bag and look around my room for one last time to make sure : I do n't forget anything . I go downstairs and put the garbage bag into the trash bin .
You should n't spend so much time watching television because it is n't healthy .
Actually , I do n't watch much television , because I do n't have much free time , but if I had it , I think I would watch more .
Now , that I 'm on holidays , I watch more tv , especially some series like : Criminal Investigation or The Mentalist .
The reasons for Greece 's terrible economic situation are that Greece has surrender its currency sovereignty to the European Central Bank , by which Greece could not apply monetary policy to spur its economy , and the Greek government is very corrupted so that Greeks could easily dodge taxes .
In contrast , in Taiwan , we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well - organized .
Monetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy , and , from the empirical experience , many countries have successful applied such policy .
In 2012 , Japanese central bank unprecedented depreciated Yuan , which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation .
Obviously , Taiwan has its own currency , new Taiwan dollar , and if Taiwan 's economy is worsening someday , Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government did in 2012 .
Not only Taiwan is different from Greece in currency sovereignty , it also wins in government 's efficiency .
According to a global survey , Taiwan wins reputation in effectiveness , in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption .
Therefore , Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes .
Without a doubt , the efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to people 's welfare .
All in all , Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well - known for its effectiveness .
As a country , Taiwan has to stick to its ordinary path to create lovely and healthy environment to its civilians .
They told every dream to their dad , and they know he would enforce it even though under the circumstances it seemed to be impossible he would try .
He said that if Nick makes a house of two floors he would buy it and pay the studies of the children lifelong , which gave a reverse to the impossible
After months of working in the house he finished , and his cousin gave him a bonus reward of one million dollars to start with , buying a big house with everything they want .
The pie chart shows the principal causes which justify why agricultural lands became less productive , whereas the table correlates these causes with three different regions of the world which had land degraded , namely North America , Europe and Oceania , during the 1990s .
Overall , it is clear that the main causes for land degredation were deforestation and over - grazing .
These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed , in Europe and Oceania , and , consequently , these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degreaded .
A closer look at the pie chart reveals that over - grazing was the most important reason why land was so degraded , with the highest percentage of 35% .
This was followed by the deforestation , with 30% , while over - cultivation had 28% .
It may be justified by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity .
Not surprisingly , these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes , particularly in Europe and Oceania .
In the first case , Europe reprented the highest percentage of land degraded caused by deforestation and over - cultivation , 9.8% and 7.7% respectively .
By another side , Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% bacause of over - grazing , which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded .
By contrast , in general North America had the lowest rates in deforestation and over - grazing , with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively .
for this resaon , this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded , with only 5% .
Canton Tower is located at an intersection of Guangzhou New city Central Axes and Pearl River .
This is not only a sightseeing building , but also has a lot of recessional facilities .
For example , the tower has 4D cinema , the highest revolving restaurant and so on .
Do you want to go to have a look after reading my introduction ?
In my opinion I think that I should have more confidence with my family and remember that they wo n't leave me for something I had done in other way my best friends can do .
Is much more convenient you walk to the city centre .
At the same time , you can get fit walking approximately 30 or 40 minutes , and you will not have the problem for park your car .
You will expend the same time travelling by bus or walking , but the difference is to get angry or not .
Transportation is a means of movement of one geographical location to another by any means of transport .
We know in the olden days how our forefathers suffered in their movement .
At present there are many means of transportation .
The technology brought about lots of development in transportation .
The train is also a very useful means of transportation and very economical .
I believed that technology really improve our ways and means of our transport .
Although I took part in many competitions , there are one which was the most enjoyable experience in my life .
First , when I was in the starting line I felt could not finish the competition , then when we were in the water the coaches did not stop to encourage so was easy to swim to the finishing line . I was so exciting to see our family waiting for us clapping and shouting loudly every time one of us arrived .
If you are interested in taking part in this sport , I would suggested to buy all the equipment you will need : a comfortable swimsuit , goggles and a huge bag to keep them .
' The moment of realisation hits you like tons of bricks , leaving you in a life full of regret and guilt '
Anywhere she went , she was always surrounded by a handful of students .
People got attracted towards her quite easily and often , they would find themselves adoring and admiring her .
Although she was n't pretty , she had an aura of importance .
All his life , he had only wished to be popular but his dream of popularity had been long ago snatched by a girl .
They had n't abandoned him neither had they distanced themselves from him .
His selfishness stood in the way .
Right now , he has the one thing he always wished for - popularity , but only now does he realise , that it was meaningless , point less .
In this essay , I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not .
One of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town , which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere , not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking , cycling citizens , especially young children , babies .
However , it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway .
All in all , I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than advantage , because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it 's less important .
Local politicians should focus on sustainability , using vehicles which do not harm the environment .
Because I did n't find any ticket for the concert in London I bought one for the concert in Birmingham .
Else the ticket for the concert I bought the VIP ticket as well , so I had to go before to Birmingham , because the entrance to the venue was at 17:00 and as I live close to London , I had to leave at about 12:00 so I did n't have to rush .
I got to Birmingham at 14:00 , I think , and then , as I 've never been to Birmingham I had to look for the 02 Academy , where the event took place .
After 30 minutes started the acoustic performance which lasted for about 15 minutes , afterwards we took pictures .
My name is Maria and I saw your advertisement and I am interested in the job .
On the one hand , I am studying to be a PE teacher so I know how to organise activities for young people such as fishing or doing a sport .
I'm good at entertaining parties What is more , I really enjoy working with them since they are very active and willing to do any kind of activities .
Yours Faithfully ,
It 's true that commuting to work is n't as convenient as going to work by car .
On top of that , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that you will save time because both buses and cars wo n't be able to move in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives you more freedom and flexibility to make your own schedule while public transport limits you to a timetable that not always meet your needs .
After cars prevailed among the public , our governments have tried to pave rough roads , which promotes people to use cars even more .
Nowadays , it might be argued if the current transportation system would be working in the future like present , while there is a still big room for public transportation remaining as a significant method .
This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be around us or if it will disappear completely .
For a start , the convenience for us to travel around would probably be one of the main arguments .
In some countries , the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient , which forces people to use private cars .
However , it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also for their parents it is definitely more reliable .
What is also important is the impact on the environment , which is already considerably damaged by human technology .
If a car which emits no serious global warming gas would be developed , there would be no argument that people had better reduce our use of cars , yet , as long as we are manufacturing them we could not find more eco - friendly and efficient ways than public transportation .
In conclusion , it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future even though travelling with cars is more convenient than travelling with just trains or buses .
But in the same way as cars development , our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco - friendly .
All of the world is constantly changing - develop a new technologies , people invented new think .
Everywhere will be cameras and motion sensors .
Kitchen will be better eguipped , may be with smart appliances and people , who ca n't cook , will prepare the meal by yourself .
I think that the differences between home now and home in the future will be small .
Personally houses in the future will not be cosy , but very sterile . I do not like it .
Travelling by car is getting more convenient .
Traffic accidents , the main problem of car travelling , will be solved by self - driving technology .
Using public transport is cheaper than having a car , especially living in urban area .
If one wants to go somewhere , one can use a shared car which is parked at designated area .
If car - sharing and self - driving technology are mixed , it will be much more convenient than both the conventional public transport and travelling my car .
All my life I practiced sports , but definitely my favorite sport is squash .
The first year I went to a tournament in Torreon and I win the first place , during the first 3 years I was ranking in the first 10 places of Mexico , but then I had to reduce my practices because I had a problem with my knees .
For someone new in this sport I would recommended be patient and constant in the training , because the practice is what make you better and helps to improve your level , and finally always enjoy the game .
Never had any serious relationship .
Now he was 35 and he was still keeping on smile at the news of his colleagues and friends marriages .
Nowadays everybody has one or more cars , as a consequence of that , some people believe that public transport is going to disappear .
There are several reasons to believe that ; firstly , many people are influenced by the advertising which mixes happiness with driving cars and makes people think that public transport is not as a smart option as cars .
In second place , it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground .
In addition , public transport is cheap because to buy a car meaning spend a fortune and in big cities , where are concerned about the environment such as Amsterdam or Tokio , there are many facilities as mobile phone applications or special offers .
To sum up , no one knows the future ; however , I believe that travelling on public transport is as convenient as by car or more because it is good to save up money and to reduce contamination .
" There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient "
In my opinion less people are travelling by public transport and started to buy their own cars which is more comfortable to use whenever you are in a hurry or not .
In the first place you feel more comfortable in your own car than in a bus for example . You do n't need fear that someone could suddenly stole your purse or you do n't have to listen to the others when you travel by your car .
Studies have shown that your self esteem and feelings of protection increase when you are a car driver .
In the second place not all public transports are in their best shape .
In conclusion travelling by car is far better than using public transport

I inform you that I 'm interested in the job .
I love children , I have already worked with them , it was a wonderful experience .
I 'm very hardworking and a funny person .

Spain must be really incredible !
He was signing autographs and chatting with fans .
That 's all for now , but I will write more , when I find my feet ! I will appreciate my dad 's work forever .
I 'm sending this Email to get some information because I 'm interested in studying at your university .
I'm granted student by the government of Saudi Arabia and the scholarship will cover the tuition and everything related to my studies .
I 've graduated in 2010 majoring in accounting with a degree having an accumulated GPA of 2.49 out of 5 , since I came here I have been so ambitious that I will be getting my high studies as soon as I finish studying English , it turned out that I have to jump through the loop in order to over come these obstacles which I believe it is an ordinary requirements to get a master 's degree for the foreign students .
In addition , there is recent statistic that shows a very high percentage of Saudi Arabia students who came to America to do set their master 's degree that they could n't get in university due to some requirements for instance , GRE , G MAT , or even their GPA did n't meet the university conditions .
In fact , I do n't want to be one of those student who could n't accomplish their dream and go back to their home , I 'm willing to do whatever it takes to get into your university .
I would like to have the orientation material to increase my chances of getting into university and I will do me best to get very high grades in order to increase my GPA when it 's added to my transcript , to sum up what I 'm looking for is to take a preparation class in business to be included in the final accumulated GPA .
Finally , I believe that it it a great opportunity to study in the United States and to improve my education and my lifestyle .
Besides , I 'm an eager , mature student willing to study master 's degree at your university and I 'm looking forward to getting response back and your recommendations .
In this writing I will comment about one of the last mistake that I have made and its consequent .
First , I want to focus your attention on the fact that normally the mistakes have not importance , because all the things have fix and , if they have not fix why do you worry ?
Every plant has a color sign , red , orange , green , blue and an intermediate color between the red and the orange and this was my confusion .
I left my car in the plant with the orange color , but when some day later I looked for my car I made it in the plant of the intermediate color .
When you came out to the road you need to go straight until you reach a restaurant , then you must go to the left where you would find a big square with swings and slides .
Recently , studying online has become a very popular alternative way to study .
Although it provides students with lots of advantages , not everything is as good as it sounds .
How can they solve their problems if there is a lack of student - teacher interaction ?
Something impossible if they study online , which means that their only classmate is the computer or the laptop they use .
However , this method of studying is cheaper than the common way , and it also can be completely free which is a big advantage .
Nevertheless , I can understand people who choose the second option .
Nowadays people want to travel by their own conveyance by their own car , bike , scooter or something like that .
In winter it is fine we can adjust in crowd but if we talk about summer session we can not adjust when we are travelling in a suffocated environment .
We need to book tickets in advance , in case we are planning to go via public transport because again the issue of availability of seats are there .
I live in Trieste , a very beautiful city , but this city has a great problem : it has a lot of cars , more than inhabitants .
Of course it 's an exaggeration , but I say this to confirm that in this city the number of the cars is very high .
By the way , the public transport is not so convenient , because at a certain hours you can not find bus .
Another problem of the buses is that if you take one during certain hours , it 's impossible to find a place free to sit down .
So travelling by bus is not convenient , not only for time but also for the problems that you can find .
The other question is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia , where , the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy , so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fuel the car directly in Slovenia , where they can find much more competitive prices .
He wants to convince me to use alternative means of transport , but after I see the price of this ecological vehicle I considered that I 'll buy one of them only if the price becomes
And after that , it depends on the personality , status ( single , engaged or married ) , and even the ages of people , they will decide to learn in their own country or go abroad for getting english .
On the hand , studying abroad is a great opportunity , especially for young people .
They usually go abroad because they have not so much responsibilities just it prepares their professional future .
But They can only afford it to work as a au pair , waiter , kitchen porter or porter that include accommodation , normal wages and you do n't need high level of english .
This way is cheap as well and they have not to change everything around their life to achieve this aim .
Trapagaran , environmentally friend
The purpose of this report is to explain the that my town has become more aware in the need of taking care of the countryside .
In the last five years many new bins have been situated near all neighbourhoods .
On one of these bins are destined to plastics , another one is for wood and paper , the third one is a bottlebank and the last one is for cells .
This one is very important because it contaminates so much .
For instance , clothes , shoes , toys , electronic devices , etc .
Those are a great place where families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside .
Moreover residents have become more conscious after they have read the leaflets which explain the importance of respect the environment .
Conclusion
I strongly think that it is necessary to make people conscious about the importance of save the planet .
I would like applying for this vacancy because I think I have most of requirements that you are asking for .
I enjoy learning new recipes and I try to find out different flavours and sensations cooking .
I worked for more than six years in a supermarket as well so , that is why I am accustomed to deal with customers and cope with difficult people in busy environment .
It is no necessary to say I am able to work with a cafe schedeule , I have experience working shift days and weekends .
I would be glad if I could get an interview for giving you more details about my work experience , skills or what you need to ask me .
In Madrid , you can find clothes of the best desingners as Carolina Herrera , Dior and so on ...
but do n't be afraid if your budget is quite limited because we have some places where you can find great colections with 50% off .

Nowadays people 's life is having an unexpected change all because globalitation .
Globalitation starts in the 20 's , so a huge amount of population has experience this change , in my opinion is kind of good .
The need of export and import items has increased in the last 10 years consequently the life of the people has raised in faster respond .
The personal contact shows a decrease in this time because people do n't want to face their real problems , instead they can see all the poblems happened in the world by their smartphones .
In the future people will comunute between them by their computers , cellphones , tablets and this kind of technology will lead us to a lonely life .
Nowadays , we already have things like smart phones , which can nearly do everything we want to .
But will people 's lives really change so dramatically in the next 50 years ?
Of course there will exist some more electronical things like some new handys , with functions we could expect right now , and there will be some other gadgets .
But if we speak of the change of people 's lives there have to be some more dramatically things .
To put it in a nutshell we could say that our global world will be more electronical , and there will be more gadgets , but that wo nt change our lives dramatically .
And the most comfortable ?
In my opinion any transport is completely safe , however people say the plane is the safest transport .
And , maybe the car is the most comfortable .
It is true that both are advantages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car can be enjoyable , dangerous and relaxing , I knew this is a contradiction , but I can explain it .
If you are tired you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax yourself , and if in the car there are more passengers you can change with them , so you will feel less tired .
Some advantages could be :
- There are n't enough car parks and they are very expensive , for example when you travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking .
- Often you can be involved in city traffic jams , especially in the rush hour .
All these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persons are in danger .
On the other hand , travelling by plane people say is safer then do it in others transport .
I do n't make sure this affirmation .
I 'm afraid so that started when I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon .
In this moment there was a tropical storm , and the turbulences are horrible ; but a not time I have stopped to travel by plane .
I look for the perfect offer but in summer it is impossible to find it .
I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle line , on the contrary than here in Spain , where few cities like Madrid or Barcelona , strengthen their use .
Public transport is one part of social development .
It will make people feel comfortable .
The bar chart shows the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. and Jack&Jones Co.
we can see the number of the projected sales of jeans of Jack&Jones Co . will be at 450 thousands of pairs in next Jan , it will be higher than the number of the projected sales of jeans of Mango Co. about 300 thousands of pairs .Then the number of Jack&Jones Co . will drop to 250 thousands of pairs in Feb next year .
after this fall , the number of Jack&Jones Co. will rise up gradually until to hit the peak at 90 thousands of pairs in Dec.
The pie chart share illustrates the projected market share of Mango Co.,Jack&Jones Co.and others companies in jeans at the end of next year . Jack&Jones Co.will get 30% of the projected market share in jeans , Mango Co. take 20% of it .
As it was quite early in the morning there was just silence everywhere .
" I encouraged myself .
Although many people believe that our lives are getting better than they where 20 years ago , scientist proved that if we carry on with our ways of living using , for instance modern technology , we will lose control of our lives .
Technology has reached such a point where we need to do anything in order to achieve something .
People where given the task to write a piece of writing of their choice using the resources already provided by the institution in charge .
Out of 20 tested people , 17 managed to write their composition within an hour .
Secondly , keeping the main task , they were given a tablet with wireless connection to use instead of books .
This time the study showed that all of the applicants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes .
The objective of this study was to see how people adapted to new technologies and how our cultural roots are being forgotten .
If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences , we should start to realise how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it .
My name is Montserrat Márquez , I am 23 years old and I am really interested in the advertisement I saw the other day about working on summer camps in the USA . I have worked before but in my home town , Mexico city , and I think I would be a perfect candidate for this job .
I am a suitable person for the job because I used to work with children of all ages , but I prefer to play with kids between 8 and 12 years old , also I am always trying to improve different activities therefore avoid getting bored , and I do not mind working in other areas of the camp .
To sum up I would like to participate with you , and I can promise you will not regret it , I hope to hear from you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
Montserrat Márquez
I promise you will not regret to come , everything here is wonderful and there are many places we can go to visit .
If you want to become an artist or politician , you must be ready for journalists following you all the time .
I suppose that sometimes celebrities enjoys people gossipping about them .
that is why I do n't understand why is it so important for people to know what happenes with celebrity ?
Also when you spend time with your boyfriend or girlfriend , you know that someone is taking a photo of you .
WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Introduction
The aim of this report is to inform about the ways in which my village carries out measures to look after the environment .
For this , we will analyse several aspects such as what local residents do with the rubbish and how Lanjarón tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people .
Nowadays there is more and more rubbish because of the high amount of package used to wrap products and increase in consumption .
A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to join several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling .
Keeping the village clean and attractive
To get this the council sets different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in .
For instance , monthly it is held a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village .
At the end of the competition those whose area is cleaner and attractive receive an award .
Conclusion
We have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us .
Others consider that it is military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary .
First of all , there is no absolutely safety in the modern world .
Therefore , compulsory service at in the army gives special military knowledge , which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict .
More specifically , it allows for understanding of teamwork , develops organizational skills and practice discipline .
Moreover , it can educate young people be more self - reliant , because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents .
However , the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact .
For example , it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service , because during the one or two years of service , soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military .
Besides , there are emergencies , which can happen with guns or weapons such as explosions and accidents .
Furthermore , there are hazing acts at in the army .
Army years often have an impact on the whole family , especially in case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to the warzone .
Finally , there is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages , but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world .
This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for it .
Firstly , the food I make by myself is more trustful than the food that is made in restaurants .
Because I do n't know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant put .
Because all of the restaurants want to earn money , so they will just use cheap and not healthy ingredients to cook the food .
But if I make my own food , of course I wo n't use any kind of unhealthy ingredients .
So the food I made by my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants .
And also homemade food has better quality than low price restaurants .
Secondly , it 's much cheaper to eat at home , because restaurants want to earn money .
Some people think cooking themselves is too annoying or tired so they go out to eat .
Thirdly , eating at home is more comfortable .
When people are surrounded by strangers people all think they are watching me so I ca n't do that or this .
Also the restaurant do n't know how much you can eat , so sometimes they give you too less food you do n't get full .
Fourthly , you wo n't have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and come back home .
Because of these kinds of advantages and reasons I prefer to eat at home .
To sum up , the fundamental characteristic of social media is the design of " Virtual profile " , it requires time to maintain connection between links , friends and be part of groups , this connections will produce negatives effects especially on psychological well - being .
This outcome , along with several studies suggests reasonable use of connection media .
However , it is also likely that people 's life , such as loneliness and depression , might explain the effects that social media can have .
Furthermore , it is also possible that in a future people will be a subject responses , posts and chat rooms , in which awareness of wrong vocabulary , poor routines and compulsive use .
In contrast , one positive aspect of social media cover the education area , in which the knowledge , the expansion of ideas , and the discover of different ways of learning will contribute in the community .
On the one hand we have technology .
Technology has developed really fast in the last twenty years so it 's expected to develop the same way in the next fifty years .
Fifteen years ago cell phones did n't have music or a camera , while nowadays they have camera with high definition and you can download a lot of music .
Every aspect of science will evolve , for example new medical discoveries will be made by doctors .
To sum up I believe that people lives will change a lot because everything will evolve .
They help me to develop and to see the world to a difernt perspective .
People like to watch movies , because it 's a fun pastime and it substitutes books for lazy people .
Many people think living in the counrtyside provides a better way of life .
Most of us think it 's a great idea , but is it better than our comfortable life in the city ?
Would we live better without technology ?
As we know the countryside has no pollution compared to big towns , because there are n't cars , lorries , moped or any other motor vehicle .
On the other , hand technology makes our life easier .
We can get information , chat with friends or even order food instantly with Internet , however unfortunately we do n't have it in the countryside
However I think humans have evolved and we are very happy with technology and Internet .
There is no doubt that using your private car is much more comfortable & convenient for any person .
Your car represents a kind of luxury & comfort which is clearly illustrated during driving or travelling for long distances as long as you have a comfortable seat with a certain personal zone area .
Furthermore , you are not accompanied by some silly passengers or difficult persons during your trip as you will relish your trip with some adorable friends , nice family 's members or close colleagues that you have chosen .
Besides the presence of a car during a trip is very important for coping with the different conditions environments you are facing during the journey .
On the other hand , public transport now become non hygienic as lots of people are crowded into a small and closed area and so a lot of breathes & air droplets are easily propagated in this enclosed place and consequently , you are more susceptible to the various contagious diseases especially in the winter season where the respiratory tract infections flourish e.g. cold & flu .
Furthermore , your actions and movements are limited by the schedule and the track of the transportation mean you are taking .
And so you do n't own your time to do what you want whenever you like although this is my leisure , my free time which means the time of relaxation & meditation .
My town is one of the cleanest towns in my country , the authorities have been arranged amny procedures to ensure that the town keeps clean at the same time be environmentally friendly procedures .
As a first step to keep the environment clean and healthy is that the garbage needs to be separated into 3 parts that is why the environment department decided to give each house three recycle bins , one for food and green garbage , one for only papers and catroons and the last is for the rest .
Another handy rule has been decided which is the plastic and the glasses need to be thrown in different bins that are available for the public udsage in each supermarket center , in these people can find these bins in easy destinations available everywhere .
All the previous steps and more are being applied by my town sitizens in order to improve the environment quality and go long with all the procedures that help them live happily healthy life .
We are used to just turn the lights or air - conditioning on when we do n't really need it .
A lot of us , just turn the engine of our cars without considering walking up to the bus stop .
The fare is high compared to other European countries and the fare system is complicated .
The punctuality of trains needs to improved greatly , too .
In my opinion , we need to save future for public transport for our future and it is vital to reduce the use of private cars . Travelling by car is more convenient but with improved public transport , we need to reduce use of cars .
That is our responsibility for future generation .
And then you always wonder what would have happened if you had chosen the alternative .
You do not particularly like that feeling , do you ?
There is a group of young people who decided once that it is ridiculous to choose if you can have all in one - do you want to meet them ?
The group is going to perform in The Globe theatre and they have promised to meet your expectations .
' Gravity ' is an otstanding , brilliant , sci - fi film , directed by Alfonso Cuaron , starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock .
This amazing film is about two people from a crew of astronauts sent out in space to launch the ' HUBBLE ' telescope .
Soon one of them was informed that an asteroid hit a satellite and created debris , which was heading for the Shuttle , where the two astronauts were .
Eventually the debris hit the Shuttle and thus more debris was created which took the orbit of Earth and moved around it with a very high speed .
The damages which the impact of the debris caused to Shuttle were catastrophic !
To survive the astronauts had to get to the International Space Station which was very far away from them .
After the long sequence of events the remaining astronaut first got to the ISS then with Russian spacekraft moved on to the Chinese space station called TIANGONG .
Her struggle for survival occurs to be successful !
My hometown , Piliyandala , is probably the smallest town in Colombo district provides shelter for more than 100,000 people .
The town has approximately 15 villages and all of them are governed by the urban council .
The Garbage control service is one of the main supporting subsidiaries of the urban council which was founded two years ago .
With this garbage control system , household waste being collected on weekly basis and transported to recycling centers .
The recycling centers sort these garbage and are put into different categories to be recycled , categorized garbage are then transported to the recycling process in the nearest factory .
Two years ago , the council started a wastebasket distributing program among the villages with the intention of easing the garbage collection process .
With this approach , it is very convenient for the workers who are engaged in the garbage control service because they can collect all the garbage of a village in one place .
Meanwhile , the urban council highly discourage the use of plastic products and other artificial materials for the sake of our own cleanliness .
Nowadays lots of people are discussing the problems of life in the next 50 years . in 50 years ,
surely , science and technology will
planes , trains and buses will be faster and maybe thanks to the progress of technology we could beam - up every where .
This will be a great achievement !
body - communication , for example , will lose his importance . all the communication will be virtual , people will speak only on social networks .
I think that this will be dramatic ! also all relationships and friendships will be virtual , and that is absurd .
Everything is going great !
what she prefers?(I remember you said she liked chocolate .
Also we can go to some parks that I think are incredible there .
It tells the story of a beautiful woman , played by the always stunning and talented actress Milla Jovovich , who is pulled off a bridge by a mysterious serial killer .
As time goes by , Milla learns how to identify people 's body gestures , as she becomes more confident with her new ability , her life come slowly back to normal , but not for too long , for she becomes suspicious the murderer can be closer then she would ever expect .
For most of friends in the dorm of University of Education , Mimi is just an ordinary girl , neither beautiful nor smart .
He loves Michael at first sight when he first met and tried to take any advantages of opportunities to win her heart .
There is no doubt that the Southerner in Vietnam have prejudices against Northerner for a long time .
It is unfortunate for Michael to get access to her because she is a Southerner .
Overcoming much prejudices and obstacles from her family , he proved to be a loyal and sincere man who Mimi can lay her hope on .
But everything has changed since he came to Danang city to further study .
He began to have intimate relationships with other beautiful young girls there and broke his promises- " Wait for me !
Everything is fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises .
Right after from taking off the plane , she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view of satisfying her long waiting for him .
The more excited she is , the more dissappointment she had . Mimi catch sight of her lover was kissing another young girl in his room .
Hey!how are you ? How is life going ? Hope your done with your prestigious exams that you told me about .
Anyway I ve recently been organizing an environment saving event for our breathtaking city by doing a recycling campaign .
Since your dad has recycling factory I taught that he would be pleased getting the bottles and the other recyclable material as well .
Aswell as you know in our country there 's trash being thrown everywhere and most of the things that are thrown are recyclabe .
This is the main reason why our environment is getting destoryed .
The charity I chose to invest in was the envirosavers charity , as they have recently done a good job in re - building animal habitats so I taught that they might need money since they just spend money in building habitats .
İn the event there will be charged entertainments for all age groups , there will be live music , we also have a lottery which will be going on .
You never told me that you were thinking of playing an instrument .
What kind of instrument are you going to play ?
In my opinion , you should try to organise a schedule for your activities .
I hope that 's useful.good luck and let me know how you get on .
I 'm Vincenzo Manna , an engineering student who , by means of linguaenglish , is going to spend three weeks in Brighton ( as you already know , my colleague Gelsomina Davide and I are arriving next 27th of July ) .
I would like to ask you just a piece of information .
Surfing the Internet , I have found that if I catch a bus I will be able to get off in several station ( Coach station , Patcham , Preston Circus and so on ... ) while travelling by train I can choose between Brighton and New Brighton .
I hope to improve my English skills thanks to this journey , and especially my listened and spoken English .
In fact , I am studying a lot to pass the CAE examination ( Certificate in Advanced English ) , but I am facing several difficulties .
My name is Pawarit Chonlahat so I lived in Bangkaen district since 2010.I found that this area is changed so rapidly , such as , Now it have a lot of condomedium were buildeda long the main road and nowaday this area has a big shopping mall and modern hospital and large police station that 's make my life so convenience and safe because i can walk from my house to go to shopping mall about 10 minutes other that i can walk to hospital just about 5 minute so i did n't worry when i got sick and The large police station is set in front of the hospital that can assure safety for everyone who live in this area .
For this reason , This is the adventages of living in this area but because of many populations in this area that make traffic in every rush hours especially in the morning very jam and take so long time to drive a car to work that is the disadvantages for living in this area so , In my opinion , this area should have improved transportation infrastructure like investment in Sky train system to link covered around this area .
Mary and Amber were having lunch at a restaurant .
Mary yelled loudly at the young man to call him stop and everyone in the restaurant noticed about him .
To his surprised , Amber and the manager of this restaurant had already stood in front of the door .
As a result , even thought he kept expressing his apologist to Amber , she still decided to call the police .
Although the two movies are of complete different genres , similarities still exist .
The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones , and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life - altering events .
Ali , an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son , saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet .
Once again , their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges .
In sum , both movies portrayed love as a chemistry reaction that stems out when two people willing to help each other out of life challenges .
On the other hand , after Ali starts his kickboxing career , Stephanie always cares about his conditions , then becomes his middleman .
And in Silver Linings Playbook , Pat and Tiffany , who both used to stuck in their misfortune in the pass , leave their pass behind and move on with each other 's love and support .
Albeit those things in common , at the beginning of the movies , the depression of characters came from different situation .
Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psycologically difficulties ; Pat 's desire of his ex - wife can not be fulfilled , while Tiffany can not get over her guilty of her husband 's death .
However , characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality ; Stephanie lost her legs , and Ali is an impecunious man .
Although their hearts are all empty , the harsh environment is more hard to survive .
In conclusion , every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways , whereas people could always find distinct inspiration .
In my opinion , being included in the fresh TV news is a huge contribution , great opportunity to introduce yourself in the way you like it .
They 're being followed constantly by paparazzi , their private photos are being bought for millions of dollars .
We should n't underestimate the importance of societal and environmental problems .
On the one hand , I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems including environmental one .
Their activities caused lots of negative consequences such as air , water and land pollution , deforestation and climate change .
These issues are so burning in developing countries .
Whereas developed countries became aware of these problems , poor countries have plenty of societal problems , so they continue to influence the environment in a negative way .
For example , developing countries can not protect the environment because of their poverty , low incomes , and population illiteracy .
On the other hand , sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal one .
Such disasters as earthquakes , floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year .
Unfortunately , we can not pretend natural disasters , but we can solve societal problems .
If people take responsibility for their actions , we will avoid plenty of consequences .
As for me , we can achieve this through developing leadership .
He must inspire others to achieve appropriate goals and to do their best for the world .
In my organization , we strive for peace in the world .
We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and such ways we can avoid a lot of global problems .
This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society .
Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something whereas I do n't know how to do it properly .
I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing country welfare .
Though the new problems occur quickly in our state some people and community , try to do their best to develop the civil and democratic society .
We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environment problems .
Moreover , our country pays little attention to them so population should do everything on their own .
For instance , I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and economizing energy .
These skills are necessary for us , and they help us to improve a little our ecological situation .
In conclusion , each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede a further progress of our civilization .
What is more , this project will give me available experience including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendency in the social sphere and careful attitudes to the environment .
Television can entertain everybody today , it does n't matter the age , can be a baby or an oldest person , we can notice that there are interesting topics for all kinds of audience .
It 's a multimedia device that while you watch TV , you can listen and see other people or cartoons , and it seems the characters are alive talking directly to you .
Today the networks have a schedule of 24 hours of activities , you can watch the programs at any time you want to , and if you do n't like a program you can change the channel and watch anything else , if the increase of channels and the competitiveness , the audience has increased also its power of choice .
We have the power to choose what we want , but with so many options we must be aware of our own decisions , I want to say that , although we have so many options , not all of them are effective for us , we are able to decide if we 'd rather see a comedy or a documentary .
The programs tend to reproduce our real life and our desires , such as a soap opera which presents characters with difficult in their lives , but there are also the solution of all problems at the end , the lady get married and live happily with his love forever .
Although they have a nice ending we need to remember that the real life is different and the difficult makes part of our lives , they are there to us to give value to everything we have and to remember us how fragile and , at the same time , how powerful we are .
We can also watch a documentary that teach us a lot !
There are documentaries produced with so many careful that they provide us with a lot of information , sometimes it 's much better than reading a book or having a class .
Many of the automobile owners live in big towns and often they park their cars in the city centres , where they work or study .
Recently , governments in many countries , put a ban for parking or even a ban for driving in major city centres , because this leads to increasing traffic jams .
Moreover , cars pollute the air significantly and it becomes unhealthy for breathing .
In many towns are built underground parking places , where you can leave your car when you have some work in the city centre .
Some drivers are not keen on this ban , because this is inconvenient for them .
They do not like travelling with buses or trams .
How does Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' magical ?
In ' A Midsummer Night 's Dream ' Shakespeare creates a magical mood and setting by using characters , such as the fairies , and events ( such as transforming Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head ) .
He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers relation ship as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia consequently Helena in love with Demetrius .
There 's be no humour to make it interesting .
The fairies nearly control everything .
The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania 's argument , which makes ' contagious fogs'(2:1:90 ) and ' hoary - headed frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
The fairies also affect nature as Oberon 's and Titania 's dispute results in the wind ' piping ' to them in ' vain'(2:1:88 ) .
Due to having fairies as characters , it adds magic as fairies do n't exist in the human world .
As a reoccurring theme , Puck 's use of magic creates humour , conflict and balance in the play .
Puck 's magic also adds to his naughty , cheeky , attractive character in this play .
This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her ' sweet love'(4:3:30 ) .
It also creates the comparison of Titania , a beautiful , delicate creature , whilst Bottom is completely grotesque .
The idea of Titania having a ' flowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and the idea of Bottom , at that time , looking ' monstrous ' and ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creates a distinction .
The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey head as her ' lover'(3:2:186 ) seem ridiculous .
As well as for his need , he uses his magic to help ' A sweet Athenian lady ' ' in love'(2:2:260 ) namely Helena with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is shown as a sympathetic character .
However , Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania .
When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom 's head into a donkey 's head , he gets annoyed at first at Puck 's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a ' vile thing'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an ass ' head .
In the book , Titania does n't seem to use her magic much , nevertheless , she uses it a few times .
Titania 's uses her magic to ' bless'(5:1:383 ) the bride bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta would have beautiful children and live a happy , married life .
Titania 's fairies are also characters who use magic . They use it to protect their ' fairy queen'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotted snakes with double tongue ' , ' newts and blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Their magic , like Oberon , is used to help people nevertheless not for themselves .
She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies .
The food they eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:152 ) and ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as well as not being our daily meals or snacks which also shows another contrast between the humans and fairies .
The fruits , used above , also sound like ones that would be found in a forest(berries ) .
The language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite .
Most of us probably haven't heard of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) and ' woodbine'(2:2:251 ) .
Shakespeare 's choice of words creates this .
He talks about ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild thyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beautiful land , with green grass and all sorts of flowers .
Let her shine as gloriously
OBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language used in this spell contains many references to nature ( ' Venus ' and ' Sky ' ) .
This is how it creates magic and creates the setting as in William Shakespeare 's time , they did n't use many props .
Just by reading this , you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called ' love in idleness ' and you can understand Cupid ( the Greek god of love ) had blessed this flower with his archery , giving you an understanding that this is a love potion .
Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as ' let her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky ' to create the thought that Helena should look like a ' goddess , nymph , ' in addition to being ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
Shakespeare says ' Flower of this purple dye , Hit with Cupid 's archery ' causing mystery and letting us think about what he means .
Shakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters for example : when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , she mentions nature many times .
She refers to the Moon as ' the governess of floods'(2:1:103 ) and refers to the seasons quite a lot .
She describes the winter as ' angry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miserable season .
Spotted snakes ' and ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) are references to animals .
Animals , insects and plants are commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' and these descriptions add to the magic .
The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical .
After all the book is called ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' .
Due to the magic , the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream as there 's be no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened .
Thinking of it as a dream creates innocence and vulnerability .
Also , Shakespeare uses the thought of plays .
He adds the play ' Pyramus and Thisbe ' which is a bit like a mini play based on the storyline ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' as there are two lovers whose parents do n't permit their marriage .
When the ' mechanicals ' or workers change into their characters , it is a bit like magic .
The characters in the play like ' moonlight ' are basic ideas of transformations like ones that magic creates .
Also , there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world .
At this time , the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion conjures creates magic .
The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play .
To summarize my points , I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations , spells , potions and aspects that do n't exist in the human world .
I personally think , without magic , this book will not be as popular or engaging .
Shakespeare has done it again !
you will enjoy the friendly atmosphere here .
If you like artworks and antiques , you can go shopping for stone sculptures in addition to papyrus there .
You will never forget this amazing experience and the fragrance of the land of pharaohs , legends and history .
Nowadays most schools and universities are helping students to find their most suitable jobs .
This is caused by the changes that the labor market has experimented recently .
Enterprises want to recruit young and experienced people and universities and schools have noticed that so they are hands on the task .
It has been suggested to offer " work experience programs " .
It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but for the experience that it could bring them .
Some enterprises require experienced employers and if young people have it , they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace .
So , including in the CV the experience , seems to me , a step further in the students ' career .
Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification .
Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a work involves .But sometimes universities gives them more theoretical formations instead of practical formation which enterprises are searching .
Generally speaking students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience .
I would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of " training " for their work life and some theoretical knowledge .
They have to learn the skills that a job involve and the only way to get this is practicing .
Now a day 's we are having " n " number of International Sports , where one can prove their own talent and have their socialism .
The fun in this game is we need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait 's until the opponent responses to it .
My suggestion for the people who wants to start their hobby as badminton , firstly one need to know the rules and regulations of the play .
As it 's a mind set game , the player need to focus on the weaknesses and act accordingly .
To be a successful player one has to learn some tricks , which helps their game easier .
Thus by boosting themselves lead to success .
I am very pleased to hear that you finally manage to open your restaurant .
I 'm really sorry that I can not accept your offer to work at your restaurant .
But I have someone in mind that can help you at the restaurant is my sister Sorina you met her at my party .She is a lovely girl , hard working , flexible you will love to work with her .
She has lot of experience , she worked in a restaurant for 5 years and also can cook .
Let me know if you are interested to know her better .
In Viet Nam , many places are worth travelling such as Da Lat , Sa Pa , or especially Ninh Thuan .
VH Bay in Ninh Thuan is assumed as one of the best bays in Viet Nam so that I especially recommend you to go there .
To experience well , you should stay here at least three days .
Besides , you could sell your own food on the streets , which sounds very interesting .
Each Monday there is invited a different guest speaker to the Film Club for manage the discussion with a good drink thanks to the Coffee Bar special late opening .
On the next season there 's going to be a new cycle about WWII and Tom Hanks and Matt Damon will visit the Film Club for speaking about the film where they appeared " Saving Private Ryan " and their process to get involved into their characters for a real - like acting .
CONCLUSION
If you love the cinema or if you only want to take a break in your daily routine and meet new people and make new friends you ca n't lose this great opportunity to turn a grey Monday into an amazing start of the week .
I 'm suggesting you choose between two different places : beach or mountain .
Fisrt of all , remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess ( Spanish omelette , fried chicken brest , sandwiches , ships ... ) and , moreover , you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming , jumping the waves , surfing and so on .
Playing in the sand burying people one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors .
Nevertheless , if you do n't like sand at all , you can choose the other option in the mountain .
Furthermore , going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy ciy life , though .
Theerefore , which one of these two places would you choose ?
In my opinion , no matter where you go , just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful , amazing even unforgettable moment .
The purpose of this report is to showcase the in which power consumption is reduced , joined by the saving of natural resources in my city .
In Cluj , in each year , during the summer , the local authorities give citizens the opportunity to rent bicycles , thing that can reduce the air pollution produced by car fumes .
Surprisingly , people support this project and every year the number of bicycles rented raises .
The localauthorities can also organise events in which they can encourage people tostart saving natural resources like water , or to convince people that power consumption can be reduced in many other ways .
La Cacharrería is a small , Spanish restaurant in the old town of Cáceres .
The tables are small and tall but they are comfortable .
The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed .
La Cacharreriaes a tapas restaurant so you can choose lots of different , small dishes and share them .
The service at La Cacharreria is very good .
Another thing about this restaurant is that it is cheap , about 20E per person .
La Cacharrería has a disadvantage , you ca n't reserve a table and it is very popular .
I recommend La Cacharería , because it is a great place for a quiet meal with friends .
Different factors such as stress , psychological problems , noise , lights that do not let you rest .
I do not have trouble sleeping , or interrupt my sleep repeatedly .
I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and that way I can see improvement .
There are different medications or even natural things to improve these conditions .
Implement each council and tell others about your improvements , is a good way to help others .
Some people think there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
Cars actually have many advantages .
The main reason to consider there is future for public transport is that , according to ecologists , we must cut down the massive use of cars .
Then , the public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet .
In conclusion , from my point of view , people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport but we 'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in accurate conditions .
Please find below clarification related to the below issue :
During a meeting with head of the department in MOH I was complaining about service of the microscope by their staffs ( almost 99.9%from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract , and handling by Electronic W / S in M.O.H. ) and I suggested to provide the required training for his all staffs , in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service .
Next day I have received a call from one of the technician Mr. Humam Altannous ( who was compliant against us ) and asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lab ( which are not under warranty or Contract ) .
But he is not ready to accept it and asking us to come and repair the unit without any repair request issued . please note that our telephone conversation was only for 2 minutes and during this conversation he was misbehaving and mistreating me and hang - up the phone ) .
He was not asking any Manual / trouble shooting instruction during our call what he mentioned in his email .
Next day I was compliant against him with the Head of the department , during that time only I came to know that he is one of the technician who is taking care of repairs of the Microscopes in the department , and his Manager requested me to not repair any unit without official request , beside he will come back to me regarding my complaint against his employee .
We hope that above explanation is sufficiently clear and exhaustive .
Thanks for your kind understanding
Due to there will be an international festival for young people in our region , I have written that report in order to know the preferences of them and the trends which are on nowadays .
Firstly , I have asked about the music that is listened to and about their favourites styles and groups and the results showed us that they are n't similar compared to music they liked a few years ago .
In fact , they hardly ever can defined themselves such as pop fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plenty of girls who were interviewed told they could n't stand reggaeton music , however they used to want to listen to it in discos because they could dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't have musical culture and magnificent bands of music like Rolling Stone are going to have remaining in the oblivion .
Secondly , I debated with young people to television programmes that are watched currently .
Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people in order to gossip about them .
However , the documetaries are being forgotten and only a twenty - six percent of them would like watching more interesting TV series like Lost .
Actually , in opposition to the music , young people feel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by which the clothes are being worn .
Nowadays , all people use the Internet and application everywhere .
Moreover , it is very easy to make friends and communicated with somebody .
Furthermore , if you are a shy person , this way is very useful for you because you can talk more directly with someone .
Secondly , if you use the Internet to meeting new people , it 's a good way to finding people with similar interest . You can enter application and you can explain how you look like and someone is interested in you .
In conclusion , I 'm agree that Internet it 's a good way to meeting friends because you can know a lot of people around the world .
The statement - ' There is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient . ' can be discussed in two different aspects .
Transport has become faster and more convenient , and it can be attributed to lot of factors such as better roads , new technologies and innovations etc .
On the other hand if I would be travelling to see my friends or family in nearby town or just on holiday tour , I would prefer my car .
If you are travelling in your car , it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination , you can make any number of stoppage , and even stop for your favorite ice cream .
In future ; environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these transport mediums .
Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints , they are trying to encourage public transport .
This initiative will surely help countries to reduce pollution .
This is the reason for the government decisions of education play an essential role . I have always thought that it should be reached for all .
I studied in a state school and I believe that I get a good education not only academic training but also strong principles to live in society .
From my point of view I feel like we are losing things so important as the effort to reach goals or respectful everyone .
For instance , knowing other languages , like English is increasingly day a day .
There are many reasons for travelling , and to travel from one place to an other people use different means .
The user of the transports mean are differ , the public ones are able to carry big number of travelers , where as the private means used by very little number of people .
All these points are support the importance of the public transport means , and ensure how useful they are .
In my view , the public transport will keep on offering their services , and will never be effected by the appearance of private means .
Introduction :
This report is intended to evaluate the Active Leisure Club and to give some suggestions to the Club 's new facilities .
I believe that should be taken in mind when the new facilities are built .
The Club offers a wide range of activities to spend time .
Those activities developed my interest in sports and nature .
The staff must also be congratulated .
Everyone on the organisation was kind , helpful and cheerful .
Recommendations :
Although facilities are well organised , they are too small since more and more people are becoming members of the club .
However , the advantages overcome the worst aspects and I will be happy to join the club again next Summer .
Thanks a lot for your letter ! I am pleased to hear that everything is well with you and that you are coming to Poland .
I 'm very sorry that I haven't replied earlier , but I had hard time at university .
In my opinion Poland is beautiful country , so you will not be disappointed ! I would recommend you starting your trip in Poznan .
If I were you , I would start looking for a job with checking local advertisements on the Internet .
Hereby I am writing in reference to the advertisement published for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , in order to apply for the job
I am also a talented cooker for kids , my view is also trying to convince them that cooking is fun and sometimes they ask me to teach how to make basic dishes such as ommelettes , spaghetti and more .
I appreciate your attention to this letter , do not hesitate to contact me in case you have any doubts
Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life , you focus on the competition and is like to have a rest from the cotidian life .
In conclusion , personally despite the danger of some sports , doing sports is by far better than just sit in your house and watching them .
I 'm so glad to hear that you give me an opportunity to make your club facilities improvement .
It would be a great chance for your club to share my ideas to improve your facilities
1 . All the people who work in the club are attentive and professional
2 . The facilities are cheap to use
The temperature of the changing room is too low .
The problem about this mansion is that the same hides a lot of secrets and misteries which are going to be discovered by its temporary owners who are a family whose husband went to war and died so the real ocupants of the house are nicholas , an easily scared boy , his sister anne who turns to be one of the most important characters of the film and their mother who is called grace and has a particulary obsession for catholisism .
The other characters that also take an important part in the movie are the servants .
The film descrives how the love that a mother can give to her children can easlily turn into an obsession.however,what makes this film so special is that that pretends to be a typical horror movie but at its final scene there is a suddenly change wich turn it more interesting .
It was made in the right place for such an unexpected film as it was made in a big manor on an abandoned foggy island .
I would recomend this film to anyone , even those who are easily scared scared because it is not as the resto of horror movies , it is a film in which you are continuely discovering secrets as if you where another character .
At first this transport was appreciated marvelously .
Everyone felt so delighted but unfortunately now people feels uncomfortable when it comes to travel via public transport .
Today every single person is curious to earn money as much as they can and the interesting part is that this curiosity is increasing day by day so is their income .
As people feel comfortable in there own vehicle .
The main advantage of having your own transport is that you do not have to wait for the public transport , you can save your time as you only need to accelerate your own transport and drive to your destination .
Public Transport is slow now , even though they are very comfortable but unfortunately people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class would travel through public transport it would affect his respect .
But still there are so many people who use public transport frequently but that is only their compulsion and poverty .
When they would be financially stable they would surely buy their own vehicle .
The exhumed fumes are one of the great problems for the environment .
Firstly , many people think public transport has not future because travelling by car is faster and more independent .
Secondly , people think buying a car is a cheaper option in long term than travelling by public transport every day .
However , a lot of people are becaming more and more consciencious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of the most important reasons is precisily to take care of the environment .
Public transportation is the most popular method in travelling to places .
These transportation can be easily found anywhere to reach your destination .
On the other hand , travelling by car is more convenient and safe .
Travelling by car is preferred by some people because of its convenience and advantages .
In addition to this , we would not take too much time in looking for a bus which would go specifically to our destination .
But we can not deny the fact that public transportation has been around in years and in every country as a means of travel .
Most of the people prefer this kind of transport , especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
I disagree that there is no future for public transportation as it is still widely used all over the world .
Moreover , this has helped a lot of people especially those who can not afford to buy a car .
However , public transportation in the future might be improved and developed and will still be used by many people .
The side effect of depending only on cars as the main transportation are remarkable .
we should encourage public transportation all we can because every city now has huge number of cars run on it 's streets and this number is going up speedy .having this huge increasing of cars that will impact badly in public health & environment and infrastructure .
It is more convenient with modern lifestyle to travel with a car because of the privacy and independently.the remarkable development of car 's luxury and more option .
although it will be over cost in full , car service and effort of concentration on driving all of this negativity you can avoid it easily by using public transportation , it should be cheaper than using your own car you do not have to look after it you can do activities wail you are on it like reading or chatting with your friends or having important phone call
The environment impact is an important factor we should consider , having this number of cars like having thousands of factories in our streets giving us tans of CO2 gas and many other pollution gases.the speed new train or plans or even buses now competing withe car 's speed and even more fast than it in a lot of places .
Using public transportation is better than use individual cars , but we should put more attractive things inside it and should have new designs and more privacy and luxury means , expanding in electric car and other clean energy is very important right now to reduce environment 's pollution as far as we can .
It was so impressive .
Hope my thoughts will be interesting for you .
As for my personal experience of sports , I do n't do it professionally .
Most of all I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton .
There was a such time when I was visiting volleyball club , but I gave it up .
It 's easy , interesting and funny .
It makes my day more productive .
It 's also useful for cardiovascular system .
I 'm absolutely convinced , everyone should realize that the most important is health and sport really can help .
Predictable , some of the solutions will remain intact .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comfort .
Nonetheless , the changes will be visible on the interior as well as the exterior .
Buildings will become smaller , yet more functional and organised .
Furthermore , they will be ecological , the main reason using renewable sources of energy .
As a matter of fact , reduction of living space will not be noticeable due to thinner walls .
The electronics will undergo the most evident changes .
All electronic devices will be controlled by the voice thoughts .
I am writing this letter because I am concerned about facilities for shoppers in our area .
I appreciate also that it is located near to the housing estate .
Unfortunately , I think there are some aspects that demand improvements .
Furthermore , the shopping area lacks restaurants and entertainment facilities .
People usually become hungry after shopping , so opening eating places in this area would be very beneficial .
In addition , the shops arrangement is actually very messy and finding the store I need is hard .
Moreover , you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area to certain sections ( e.g. clothes , food , and house ) .
Finally , opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainment facilities like movie theatres and gyms should be considered .
Yours faithfully ,
My favourite sport is undoubtedly jogging .
They can begin to jog for 15 minutes and then increasing the time so that their body can get used to the muscular effort .
Furthermore , it would be useful having a chronometer to check out your improvement .
If you prefer , you can substitute stretching with few yoga exercises as well .
Personally I am not completely agree with this way of thinking .
The prices in the shops often are very high and clothes are not good qualitatively .
Also you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets .
Otherwise you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need , every thing on the rack is calling for your attention , after a while you want to buy everything .
Also you can always return it like in the stationery stores .
The diagrams illustrates the process of making bank notes .
The first step is design which includes background colour , artwork and security issues .
Then move to the next step , preparation of metal plates , while skilled machinists is needed in this process .
Printing is quite related to the first two steps because the design and skilled machinists should both be considered .
The most important step is inspection , where printed sheets should be inspected manually and carefully .
However , there is a big difference between these three types .
If the quality of sheets and bank notes are good , then they will be packaged and distributed .
Conversely , bad sheets and bank notes will be destroyed .
Ms / Mr head of department :
My name is Elvira Vergara and I apply for the job in the summer camp of your advertisement .

I have worked in activities out - of - school before and in other summer camps in the south of America too .
There are so many options on television that sometimes it 's hard to make up your mind , do n't you think ?
You can see international channels and live shows around the world , something that in the past could be too good to be true .
Even knowing that not too much has changed our options nowadays still make the television a very good tool to get a family together and spend an enjoyable time .
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with your service I received when I spent a night at your hotel on 20th March 2014 .
Firstly , I must inform you that I am dissatisfied with the hotel receptionist because he forgot to place my wake - up call and as a result I overslept and I missed my flight .
Furthermore , I was late for a very important appointment and I lost a lot of money .
I am writing to inform you about one of the most interesting place in our town .
There is a lot outstanding views and worth visiting places but let me tell you about the Warriors Museum .
The breathing landscapes you can see from a museum are also a great advantage .
Yours faithfully ,
The first time practicing Muay Thai was 5 years ago , at that time I was n't sure of practicing it because I did n't consider myself strong enough for fighting , that 's what most of the young people think , at least in Mexico and some other countries , and that 's one reason why people do n't practise Muay Thai and is not known .
Was hard at the beginning just like when you start doing something new , so here are some tips if you want to start practicing Muay Thai .
When you practise any sport , you have to be confident on yourself , without confidence you will not have any progress .
You know you like a sport when you enjoy it and you feel comfortable to practise , that 's what I recommend do , enjoy and be happy practicing because Muay Thai is a beautiful sport !
I am economics student in National Chung Cheng University , which is placed in Taiwan .
I would like to be a graduate school student of Financial Accounting in The University of Texas at Austin .
The reason why I change my major is that I found that I have a big interest in Accounting than economics when I studied in the first year of university .
So If I can join your school , I will cherish this opportunity and work hard in school .
In my university , my accounting grade was better than others .
As a result , I am enjoyable to study accounting .
Also I have some jobs experience that is relevant to Accounting .
My first job was an assistant of my financial accounting 's professor .
My job was to find the company 's financial statement that is corresponding to the news report .
My works needs to close the accounts every day , so my carefulness must be improved during the time , because the money did n't belong to me .
I think patience and carefulness are two pivotal personal traits to major in financial accounting .
I believe my job experiences can help me to be a better graduate school student of financial accounting .
This is a nervous and excited decision to me but I wo n't regret it and I am ready to join the field of the Accounting and to be a graduate school student .
He 's been doing great in both academic and extra curicular activities in the school .
He is one of the players of basketball since he was an elementary student until now he 's on college .
As the tournament began he 's been getting a high points for his team because of that nice contribution they have won the game .
It had been a very extensive and tiring day to all of them but Mike felt he had achieved something really good because fortunately he was won as the most valuable player too .
He 's not only doing excellently as a student however he 's been known as one of the popular students because he works voluntarily as a couch to the younger kids in his town .
He wants other kids to be inspired also in everything they are capable of doing .
So in their generation they have something good that they contribute in the society at their very young age .
For him , it 's absolutely right to begin doing something meaningful in their lives .
the mistake is something you may do unintentionally however , people believe that mistakes can later be improved or ignored whereas , sometimes we may make mistakes that could break somebody 's heart .
Who was not only fair but very attractive girl .
And they both had a great understanding however , this innocent girl had grabbed the attention of all the viewers similarly , the two .
Michael could not digest this fact since he could not compromise on anything .
do not do such a thing that would make you regret later"Henry said .
Henry fell down and his head was injured Michael left him to bled profusely and later a pedestrian saw his body tried to look at his pulse rate but encountered that he was dead .
Later the girl discovered that Michael was all behind the incident .
If you are old enough , you can see how far the technology has gone in the last 20 years .
As a rule , a friend or psychologist play this role .
We must pay to receive the psychologist 's attention , but friendship is free of charge .
What if you 're alone and no one can understand you ( and you have no money and insurance to visit psychologist ) ?
He is still in his twenties and he has studied computer engineering .
He had everything that any person would want to have : live abroad , earn much money , have a partner , work in an international business , an so on .
At night , we can stay at home , as you said , and also we can buy chocolates and see a movie , that 's great for me !
Finally , I 'm afraid my parents ca n't take me to your home on Friday evening , because it 's my grandfather 's birthday .
The population grows , with more business skyscrapers , residential houses and advanced transportations , at the cost of diminishing farmland , wetland as well as deforestation .
Though the modern cities emerging repaidly , the problems caused by excessively exploiting the enviorment are severly various .
The red coral reef off coast in Austrialia , for instance , serve as shelter for algea and other sea tiny fishes and index of enviroment fragility .
Due to the massive construction of five - star hotels on beaches , the biological chain there are cut off and enviromental variations are gone away .
On top of that , It is the regulation capacities of enviorment that for temperature , moisture and even the sandstorms are erode as less plants engage inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen the whole system .
What 's more , extreme weather appears with EL NINO periodically causing catastrophic floods in northern cities in China and long - lasting drought in South American .
For the population density is ever - increasing currently , the loss triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family .
In a response to address these side affects that the civilization bring about , governments must take measures stey by step to tackle them .
Firstly , governing authorities should set up protect area for animals and plants , inhibitating hunting or even leisure activities like hiking .
Secondly , government must fund environmental organizations , in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop the illegal hunting , deforesting and animal extinctions .
Furthermore , the government should go out of their ways stand united in a way which joint endeavours could be effective globally .
In conclusion , government are supposed to balance the modernization and sustainable development .
We prepared it for a long time , but I had wonderful experience .
The course is going to finish so the teacher want that we go out to a restaurant .
The choice was n't easy because the teacher is vegetarian .
At last we decided to go to a restaurant near the school .
The atmosphere is kind and familiar .
Therefore I want to say a special thanksgiving to our teacher .
There are many kinds of cafes , the ones for those who like sports , art , literature or music .
In this place there are guys and girls attending pedagogy organize activities to entratain children of every age .
The most rated restaurant is " Mario 's Pizza " , where you can eat delicious pizza with the top you prefer .
Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter of discussion .
In the moment of choosing , very different aspects like ecological effects , the economic viability and even time uses , take part on the decision .
Firstly , the car option is the best one in comfort , because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities .
Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one , because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour .
By the other hand , traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport , cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and , depending on the city , the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains .
However , the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience , cars are the most expensive ones .
Not only because of the oil'prices , but also the costs of enssurance , the car , the parking taxes , etc .
In comparisson with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come .
To sum - up , neither cars nor public transport is considered the perfect option , but considering long term consequences as is nowadays common in some European countries , bicycles are the best way .
Riding a bicycle reduces traffic , costs , ecological impact , and even car crushes .
it 's so kind of you to send me my favourite Glaswegian postcards !
I 'd fancy living in a family and not in a college or in a shared flat as it will give me the opportunity to be continuously in touch with English people , day and night ; then , it is the ideal solution for me : you know I 've been recently given the sack !
What about lookig for colleges which offer Wi - fi Internet connection and a proper meal at lunch ?
Looking forward to receiving your new letter , and on tenterhooks for the information you 'll provide .
Fashion , clothes style , trendy appearance , make - up properly , the hear ...
Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our life ; but , it should be like this ?
It is certainly true that people are very critic with the appearance .
We have subjetive opinions ; we normally judge because we have a preconception idea .
We match clothes stile with a lifestyle and a personality .
That is why appearance should not have consequences in our lives .
However , there are people who do not follow that , and they dress the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most .
Overall , my personal opinión is that we give so much importance to the clothes and the appearance than it should be .
Although in some occasions some clothes styles are required , people should have freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear , and it should not have consequences in our life .
The death of the public transportation
People do not think about the environment , they only think about the time that they will spend on the traffic . the scientists said the new society it can be called " the fat society " because the the people do not want to do any exercise , people do not walk anymore , people just use elevators , etc .
a lot of commodities , this is ta reason of why there are not future for public transportation , people do not wanna spend few time walking to the bus station or tu get a cab , although the service in the public transportation it is not very good because of many things like the inflation of prices , the way that the bus or cab driver refers to the persons , the way of the bus or cab drivers drives , etc .
In cities like Mexico some people have the opportunity to use Uber , that is a service that you can use if you have a credit card , it is an amazing service , but not all the population have car or the economic status to use an uber , so people have to use public transportation , no matter if the buss or cab driver yell them or drive bad , in Mexico the public transportation in specific the cabs are not a very secure service , because some of the drivers still and kindnap , in may situation they can kill you if you do not have your precautions . but despite of this is very sad that in that place people can not do some thing because they do not have the possibilities to pay for something more so they have to took .
In cities like United Sates of America where people have the opportunity to have a car or a privileged social condition so for the American people public transportation it does not matter , they have the possibility to take public transportation or not , they can decide , so they decided for commodity .
The future of the public transportation can be death or can be in growth , it depends on were do you position your point of view , in Mexico maybe will never die , but in the United States the public transportation is now in agony .
She went to the kitchen and saw a beautifully prepared breakfast .
Suddenly , she remembered that for three days she living with Chuck - her boyfriend .
It was the first day of Spring and everything is going rise to life .
Fortunately , there was a mother with her child strolling behind them , and saw Sarah got hurt .
Stephan went to the hospital immediately to see how Sarah was .
After these incidents , not only Sarah but also Stephan realized how dangerous it was when you focused on technological products instead of the things around .
Both they are determined to pay more attention to the surroundings .
When I started reading I could not put it down because it is a fascinating story that grabs you .

An increasing number of people begin to discuss for the success in school or work , the having an ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge or a field of study .
The majority of people tend to claim that having an excellent knowledge or the research field is the most important for school or work successfully .
However does the claim really ring true , conforming the real situation ?
I find myself not on the same wavelength with such an idea .
It is my contention that the people , who have the ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances have higher percentage be successful in school or work .
As far as I concern , there are a bunch of reasons to support me perspective .
That is to say , the investment of the internet make it available for everyone in the world .
That is why it is not to be the key point that considered the key to success .
To explain , there are a trend that many universities all over the world setting up the freely courses for the people who thirsty for knowledge , also often invited the famous scholar to give a speech to the public that is welcome for everyone .
People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interesting in .
Excellent performance in the field of study has not been determined of factors for your success .
A case in point would be the latest news broadcasted recently .
According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank , the percentage of people using the knowledge in the work field that they from school has surprising reduced in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent , a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of half - century .
This phenomenon had been curiously many experts .
However , after deeper analysis , we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast pace changing world and the text book can not catch up with it , knowledge is changing from time to time .
Hence , this research remained us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor to success instead of having excellent knowledge or a field of study .
Nowadays , the statistics show that many people are younger than generations before .
Previously , the most women used to get a baby after the wedding with their partners , but today , it is not so important anymore .
Actually the teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children .
Apart from this the small difference between the ages is also an advantage .
Although less experience is owned , they recognize what a child wants to do .
On the other hand a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their babies without having experience on that .
However the progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life so I believe both are good at bring up their children .
He started to make his homework , but he had trouble concentrating as the memories came back to his mind .
It is very important to think about possibilities that should create your fortune .
In conclusion I have to think about one thing , which is more important in my life that the other one .
I will always choose the health , because when a person is healthy he or she can do everything .
There are some solutions to prevent the rise in the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks .
National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) points out that the most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar sweetened soft drinks .
The limitation of this solution is the public may not satisfied with this size of soft drinks .
To overcome it , the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it .
This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverage decrease sugar intake efficiently .
Family education would be introduced to their kids .
National Nutrition Survey(1995 ) reports that teenagers are main soft drinks consumers and the most consumption of beverage is sugar sweetened drinks .
In conclusion , increasing the consumption of soft drinks is one of issues to prevent from obesity and overweight .
A number of strategies could be efficient to address these problems .
If we take these measures within a short period and keep it for a long time , obesity and overweight problem would not happen in our next generations .
We can say that the Coyle 's idea is well developed thanks to two features that pass through the chapter and likely the entire book : first of all , many significant references and specialized people are mentioned to define what " deep practice " is ( a psychologist , some experts in their own field , authors who already analyzed that particular topic … ) ; secondly , but no less important , Coyle himself collected the most of his information while visiting at least nine places , nine " hotbeds " ( 12 ) where talents grow , as a sort of collection of data gathered from laboratory experiments .
As a consequence , theory and examples proceed together in a such natural way , that the reader must exclaim undoubtedly , as if she / he were before a Sherlock Homes ' investigation : « That 's it !
In my days friendship was easily made with neighbours , schoolmates and social clubs friends .
Although we did not have the current social communication means such as Facebook , Twitter , Whatsapp , we were very sincere and close to each other more than these virtual frienships prevailing today .
I already exprienced one friendship through an organization , International Youth Service IYS , a benficiary association established for youth friendship .
In which we have to wait more than thirty days to send and receive one message that interchanges these days with one button press .
I have a personal experiment backs to 1987 , in this year I had started a pen friendship with a German girl called Claudia who was 17 years old then .
The surprise is today I am 44 years old and Claudia is 40 years old and we still correspond to each other through the modern means of Facebook and Whatsapp , of course , we no longer can wait for thirty days while we can chat and see each other live .
In my country I have two sincere friends since we were about 7 years old and we still in a strong friendship up till now .
It is not necessary to agree with each other in everything where we always debate and challenge whose opinion is correct .
Real friendships everlasted like what I am actually made with my best two friends , should be founded on trust and faith .
The best of all in real frienships is to always believe in your friend 's abilities and be his real mirror for good and bad actions , he will be the same to you .
As I am in my late 20s I 've found it hard to find a sports activity that would neither be so competitive as those in fashion in my country nor demanding , so I could do it in my free time .
In one of the windows I found a skateboard and along came the memories of the year 2000 and MTV channel that I was brought up into .
The recent studies found , that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient by combining a bike with a train .
In addition travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee .
On the other hand , the studies showed , in many other cases and especially in irregular trips there is more convenient to use a car .
A car is unbeatable for its flexibility .
It is much more easy to use a car when going shopping , or making a leisure or an occasional trips .
Although , there are some disadvantages of using a car such as traffic jams and a high maintenance cost .
Popularity of cars confirms it .
In spite of that , studies said there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable .
There are those who try to avoid the use of public transport and prefer driving their own car due to the advantages it offers .
Firstly , it allows you to go directly somewhere without finding out the information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains .
Moreover , the use of your own car has more advantages . Travelling by car avoids getting wet when the weather is rainy .
If you travelled by bus or train , probably you would spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination .
Despite the bad weather , if you travellled by car , you could park your car near your destination , so that you could arrive comfortably .
The government usually advise the population to use public transport to cut down pollution and the amount of gases which damage the atmosphere .
In addition , it is often claimed that is cheaper than travelling by car .
Although it has some benefits , in most part of the country , especially in the smallest towns the public transport is not enough developed .
In my opinion it could be useful hardly ever times , so it would be necessary a great amount of improvements .
.H. Lawrence 's saying " Nobody ought to own houses or furniture - any more than they own the stones of the high road " is an ambiguous saying that questions the need of the people regarding a high number of properties .
First of all , to a certain degree , I comply with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in his grasp , because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family .
This speaks of the idea of the government or another organization having the control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods .
This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and does n't necessarily break any rule of personal space .
Second of all , as I did say " to a certain degree " , the idea of controlling one 's own choices regarding house picking and what they can do with them takes away a bit of their freedom , which is the complete opposite of what we should get to .
In conclusion , I can not tell whether or not the control of the people 's houses and furniture will bring any help in today 's society , as we are only hypothetically speaking , without any form of testing , however it does have its strong and weak points .
My English is improvable but by speaking I hope that I 'll do it well .
I think that I 'm good for this job , because I really sociallize with children .
I like organising activities and games to make people enjoy their time .
Also I 'm very responsible and hardworking so I would take care of the children and I would do my tasks the best I could .
Eventually , I want to say that this is an important opportunity for me to learn and to do new things .
It is worlds biggest youth cup and are located in Gothenburg in Sweden .
This centre offer several activities like swimnpool , paddle , tennis , ritmica gym , judo , ballet ...
Furthermore , has various coaches and with a perfect timetable for the parents that are busy the daytime and for young that need to go classes after lessons .
This installation is near the field football and basketball court .
In my point of view it is a good situation because the children can do different after school activities without moving too much .
I want to emphasize that thanks to his full schedule and amount of the coaches , adults like children can do different activities at the same time instead to have to wait .
On the other hand , the only disadvantage I can see is there are n't activities for the old people .
This centre should provide activities that do not require much physical effort for this kind of people like petanque or something like that .
Finally to say that is a perfect sports centre and inexpensive including a range of activities .
A friendship that ends , never started
Thomas , David and I were neighbours and grew up in an ordinary calm village .
He is one of the most persevering people I know .
Thomas is a calmer person and has the control about the circumstances .
It 's the fastest and most comfortable way to get to your favourite destination .
Especially I like to a first class seat in a plane .
It really feels like you are i a five star Hotel in a luxury suite and not travelling 10000 meters above the ground .
I do n't like to travel by boat , because it 's unconfortable and it takes a fortune till you arrive at your destination .
I would like to talk about a diamond jewellery set that I gifted to my wife on our last marriage anniversary .
The tool to communicate with foreigners .
In my personal experience I can say that if you learn a foreign language like English , you wo n't have a problem when I 'll go abroad on holiday .
However , I must pay the fee and every evening it 's my commitment study something or do my homework .
I suggest having all youngsters , who want to learn another language , they ought to go abroad .
The young people should do an experience like this .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Only a few long seconds spent thinking about what he had to do : he had to save the passengers .
He desperately run through the train towards the driver .
Desperately he started to kick the door , furiously , blind with rage , harder , faster .
Fortunately , a voice from the radio was trying to contact the man .
In a hurry he dashed to the microphone and answered the control station .
I used to play basketball for three years and it was a great experience and I had a lot of fun .
I enjoyed playing basketball not only because I wanted to play a sport but even because it 's a healthy way of leaving .
The advice that I would give the people that would like to start playing this sport is that they should have a bit of experience in working in a team that is full of new people .
The most important thing that ya person should know about this game is that a lot of intelligence is requested because you must know how to reach how to get nearer to make their aim become reality , and that one is that the team should score as much as they can to win the match and have fun .
In my opinion this sport will always be my favourite because it made me feel happy and have a great time with my friends , and it also maintained me in good shape .
I am writing to you in response to your advertisement which I saw in the notice board of your school .
I like managing the conversation in a group .

I strongly believe that research has a valuable benefits to society and the environment .
For example , making the life better and comfortable .
Bachelor 's paper [ 1 ] is one of the good sources of describing what does research mean .
First of all , researchers should be interested in what they are doing .
Interesting in the area of research leads to invent and optimize ideas that are already existing .
Second , critical thinking which is the deep thinking about the problem and the way to solve it , is an important factor of successful research .
Also , honesty , originality which is the ability to think critically , independent and creative , and precision let research to be more valuable .
Moreover , working as a team for researching , let researchers gain lots of research benefits .
All members of the team will get benefits and push each other to achieve the goal by giving some advice and more information .
In addition , Clear , easy to understand , and precise scientific paper are one way to represent , share , and discuss the ideas and results with others in a scientific environment .
Exchange information with other researchers , via scientific papers or seminars , sometimes come up with solutions for other researches ' problems .
Researchers should not give up when face hard problem with the research and keep try by different ways to solve it and they will do it at the end .
To conclude , there are some of an important research principles .
Whenever researchers consider most or all of them when working on the research , researchers will get results with a high precision .
Researchers enjoy their research as an enjoyable activity .
Second , I feel comfortable when I travel by my own car . I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy .
Furthermore , I do not worry about the theft or any crime which used to happen when I traveled by train .
However , I find traveling by my own car much more advantages than others .
Therefore , I think public transport will be disappeared in the future .
Immediately I contacted their manager , asking If they could do with some help .
She said that they will need someone who can take care of their performance outfits .

However , there 's no need to worry any longer , if you have a look at www.elihinkel.org/tips/tenses.htm .
At this website , you can find a clear , detailed explanation of the tenses , with illuminating animations .
I 'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there , you 'll have mastered the tenses the next time we see each other .

Entering your car and giving the directions and then having a stress - free drive towards your destination and let a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore .
But are driverless cars as safe as old fashion cars ?
It is surely a fact that autopilots in car 's sure are handy .
It takes hours driving to and from , hours where one just have to concentrate on driving , hours gone futile .
Although it must be admitted that driverless vehicles are expected to help children , the blind , the elderly and others who currently can not safely drive themselves .
The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption .

In my job , I have daily work with groups of people and I make presentation in front of them .
I have good organizational skills and can explain things clearly in order people to understand it easily .

Computers help us in organizing our data , also you can find any information you want very fast as it has lots of search engines .
Computers can help you with your homework to find the information you need .
The truth is that everybody had really high expectations of him .
I have read your hotel 's advertisement about Niagara Fall 's romance package in a newspaper .
I am writing to you because I am interested in booking this service at your hotel and would like to receive some further information in advance .
First of all , could you provide me information about the whole costs of the package ?
What I am most interested in , is a room with a fall 's view indeed .
Since I want to spend a night with my partner at your hotel at the end of December , I need a confirmation on your part of providing the room at that time .
In addition , could you provide me information about the nearest airport and about the way to get to your hotel from there ? We must know this for any case since we are going to travel by plane from Budapest , Hungary . I would be pleased if you could assist me in booking a cheap flight as well .
Yours faithfully ,
Now we are spending too much time in waiting for public transport and of course we would like to get our destination as fast as possible , but public transport does n't provide such possibility for us .
Furthermore we use personal vehicles or rent cars for travelling , because it is more convenient and gives us the feelings of our independence .
I understand completely that some types of public transport such as airplanes and ships , will exist some time .
But this is an exception because existing technologies do not allow the usage of such personal transport as we would at present day .
First of all , my altruistic nature is due to my biological desire to help other .
for instance , one day I was walking in the garden when I saw a girl falling down from a children swing in a playing area , I helped her immediately , after I was sure enough that she was fine , I called her mother and told her about this incident , she thanked me a lot .
I was thinking she was my responsibility , but it ca n't be the same every time .
in addition , young ages are observing an altruistic behavior from month 18th .
for example , last week I was stressed out , so I lost my phone at the university , I was not realizing that until I returned home . while I was on my way to the university , my little sister praying for me to finding out my phone .
Finally , scientists hypothesize that our brains are helpful enough when we can helping out other people .
How are you?I hope everything is alright .
Saving the environment
Because human activity releases into the air substances that damage several things in our planet such as the atmosphere and ecosystems .
The global warming , deforestation and drought are some of the consequences , therefore we can do countless things that appear to be meaningless but if everyone does it we can live in a much healthier planet .
Every day scientists try to develop new ways to improve the way we live , so that we are hable to pollute less the planet .
One of the things discovered by these scientists are the Eco - homes , in other words Eco - homes are a type of homes that help us causing less damage to the planet and atmosphere in our everyday life .
It sounds a little bit strange but by installing solar paniels and other features in these homes we live a much greener life , undoubtedly there would be some changes but because we know why we are doing it there would be no problems .
Also the effects of those actions would be gigantic and would help improve the environment situation nevertheless we will still have to change some activities and be less self - centred so that we can all work for a greater objective .
I enjoy playing this sport because it is very funny and competitive .
Furthermore , football give you the opportunity to make friends because it is a team sport .
So wear comfortable clothes and a good trainers .
There are a lot of opportunities .
You 're right , in fact it was very difficult to me but I finally took this decision because I want to make new experiences .
I'm very excited!I'm going to the United Kingdom in a week 's time but I 've already made some plans about it .
Do you know any languages school?They're very expensive so I will need more money .
And my parents refused to give it to me because they say I must become indipendent .
I ca n't definitely get a full - time job 'cause I want to relax and have fun .

The Vietnamese education and study system is completely different from the Australian one .
Like to Asia countries , such as : Korea , China , Singapore , the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive to all students , especially for the primary students .
These subjects mainly focus on math skills , grammar , writing , but there are not any courses related to life and communication skills or innovative science .
Meanwhile , the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system .
Additionally , the subjects in the school are given with the aim to develop thinking and creativity of students .
They also play many interesting sports .
Secondly , it is not only from the school but also Vietnamese parents of the primary students are also expected in the education of their children .
Therefore , outside the school , Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes , such as : math , writing , grammar , … .
Consequently , Vietnamese children have not any life skills and have many health problems , such as : short - sighted , tummy - ache , spinal column … Sadly , the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short - sighted tend to increase in recent years .
Meanwhile , Australian parents also care about their children but other way with Vietnamese parents .
Outside the school , they send their kids to sport Centre or go to the social activities .
Sum up , Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children . I think that primary students need to spend more time for playing and enjoy their childhood .
My first time was an exciting experience I will never forget : the touch of the rock , the high , the pain in your fingers ... I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive , even sometimes I feel fear .
But do n't think that climbing is a dangerous activity!. Although you climb to the top of a rock wall , you always do it with a checked security material .
Moreover , climbing is a sport in which it 's not too important if you are a man or a woman because you does n't only use your strength but also your equilibration .
You should give a try to this amusing and thrilling sport that it 's a sort of competition with yourself : every day a little bit higher , every day a little bit difficult ..
I love holidays and summer , the season I like best because of a lot of things : In summer I always go to the mountains , in my grandparents ' house , where I get fun with my uncles and cousins .
Grandma 's food is great and I spend days staying outside , playing badminton or volleyball or having a walk in the wood .
But what I love best are the afternoons with my favourite cousin , Sara , and his brother , Luke .
I have recently watched The Ultiamtum of Bourne and I 'm so excited to share it with you . I believe you 'll absolutely love it .
Eventually , he reads about a journalist who is writing about him and a program called Black Brare .
Just before the assets get the journalist Jason Bourne helps him to escape .
He tried to get some information from the guy , but unfortunately a sniper shots him dead .
I will not tell you what happens afterwords not to spoil it for you .
Throughout my life I lived in a few cities and villages located in South of Russia .
Each of the cities has unique set of transportation means .
In villages the only way of public transportation is small buses , most of which can service up to twenty passengers in any moment of time .
In regional centers most people commute via trolleybuses and tramcars .
The latest is transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely lose time in traffic jams due to dedicated railway passages .
Those who are not satisfied with public transportation system may use private vehicles .
I absolutely love children and honestly they love me ; I think it is a sort of a gift , because not all the people love children and can get on well with them .
I 've had a little bit of experience in summer baby sitting some kids ; in Italy it is more diffiult to be a babysitter because if you are underage , parents should have responsibility on you so it is better to be over 18 .
During those few times with which I built my experience we all played together and we cooked together , so I taught them how to make some chicken and some pasta in an Italian way .
One of my carachteristics is that I 'm a very precise person , for example I enjoy making lists because they make my mind clearer , and I strictly follow what I wrote so everything , hopefully , endes well .
It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship to the horse you ride .
If you provide confidence , the horse will trust you .
With this reliance you can go throughout everything together .
Surely this was not everything .
As the production of cars is increased , it seems that the needs for public transportation is declined .
Unfortunately , there is a certain limit to space , so it is not possible that everyone use their car every day especially in mega cities like Seoul , New York , and London .
It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway because you do n't have to worry about your car while working .
It is related to the environmental issues .
There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes .
Surely , the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means .
Moreover , it is quite optimistic that people will need more it rather than private transport .
I am a very active person and I am accustomed to doing different kind of sports activities such as swimming and riding .
I consider me a responsible person with the ability to be able to face any kind of problems .
As soon as the languages I speak native Spanish and Catalan and also I speak French and Germany fluenly and recenly I have passed the First certificate in English .
I feel that I have the right experience and qualifications to do this job .
If you think that I am the most suitable person to be recruited , I would interested to hear from you .
Yours faithfully ,
This topic leads me to think of professional skill " Architecture design " .
This result in different of views on whether people agree the best things for improvement people 's lives have already taken place .
I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong , even some improvements are easy to use and solves the most of problems .
First , the development of population still continue , the space for living still a serious problem although , the skyscraper already solved the most of problems from population crisis .
On the other hand , the skyscraper makes more problems , such as pollution .
For example , I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan .
The skyscraper provides more space for excess population ; however , the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials , such as steel and concrete .
They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site .
The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials .
This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only transforms to another regions and type .
Second , the computer system looks like solves the most of problems ; however , this system make more dangerous in specific situations .
The " BUG " must be appears from man - made system because of the incomplete coding .
That is why our personal information always leaks to the " hacker " .
For instance , when we enjoy the electronic commercial service and shop the goods on the Internet , the hacker may steal the private information at the same time .
They will use that information to cheat people 's money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information .
This is normal phenomenon in Taiwan ; however , police ca n't do anything because of the hacker 's anonymity .
That is what I said that the best improvement things still not exist , even the computer system already solved some problems .
That being said , I still feel the reasons I have presented was strong ones , such as architecture and computer system .
As soon as I read the article about your problem , I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions , since I have the similar interest in physical fitness , too .
I feel very strongly that the daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be on shape .
For example , you could go on foot or with your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead.by doing this , you will burn more and more calories daily without a special equipment and having fun with your pals .
Furthermore , if I were you , I would go with engaging in healh club .
As a result , you will save time and embarrassment , especially if you are out of shape .
You will not feel self - confident and glad , but your outward appearance wiil be better .
Friendship today
Friendship is actually a really important issue nowadays .
In my opinion the best way to develop your new friendship is , meeting them , have a coffee a drink or whatever .
For all of these reasons we have to take care our friendship theses days and social networks are ok to be in touch with your friends but if you wo n't to make new ones .
Money : essential for youngsters ?
A new , tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for collage or to embark on their professional career .
We have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this juvenile generation .
Why do we call them youngsters ?
I 'm not dismissing the idea of financial aid , though .
What I 'm doing is challenging the way we approach to it .
We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time we help the next generations to succeed by their own means .
If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid they grow lazy , then economic relief is welcomed .
Undoubtedly , I 'm presenting a major challenge to every parent : shall we be able to take care for youngsters provision and yet teach them that money does n't grow on trees ?
Money is almost essential , but the way young people learn to interact with this is essential to shape a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort .
The Tuesday was an extraordinary beach day .
I was all the day liying in the beach , talking with my friends and having an incredibly time with them .
These two day were family days , I had to go to the church to a mess which represent the last alive days from Jesuschrist : the last dinner and the passion .
Travelling by car is so much more conveniente if we think about small places such as villages or small towns .
Imagine to go by car to cities like London , is it the car more convenient ?
In the last few years public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology , flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables , tickets and places .
Besides these , the public transport is better for the environment , especially the electric bus .
The electric bus is an option in many countries as a way to improve the environment .
This type of transport is a great contribution to the environment , because it 's cleaner than those that need petrol or diesel to work .
The theme of environment is very important nowadays and can cost a lot to a country .
A country has to pay for their ecological foot and this means as much pollution is produced more environment damage , in other words bigger ecological foot , and consequently more has to be paid .
Governments will define environmental stategies in order to decrease the costs of ecological foot .
Such strategies will involve taxes above poluent cars , the increase of fuel price and definition of benefits to those who opts for more environmental means of transport .
So the convenience of travelling by car is not totally true .
Of course you are owner of your time and destinations , but it is enough ?
Think about its impact on your espences and on the environment , would n't be better to take a bus , an underground or a train ?
I have working in different activities like this , for example in a famous basketball team as a volunteer , or in the hospital with children and their parents who live there .
I consider I am a fun , communicative and responsible person with experience in this kind of activities , and who can help in all the things you need .
These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading across mankind 's history .
Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea , this article focuses about the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain .
First of all , the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimulus .
However , reading is the most important source to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind .
For instance , when you read , you have to associate characters and places , and memorize details .
Those kinds of things help to the brain to be more active and process information faster .
At second , there are some researches that prove that in general people who read are smarter than people who do not .
This affirmation is based in the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain reading books .
This is another big reason to take care about reading , because in this competitive world , only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society .
At third , when people read , they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what 's going on .
That situation is another example of how reading is an excellent brain 's exercise , because when people have to imagine things , the brain has to be creative , and that kind of process is too important to improve yourself in problem 's resolution and creation of important ideas in real life .
There are many good movies , especially thrillers are always enjoyable in my opinion .
One of those is the movie ' Silence of the Lambs ' , where Clarice , an FBI agent in training , has been asked to talk to an imprisoned Hannibal Lecter who has information about a serial killer the FBI has been trying to catch .
First I was really impressed by the performance of Jodi Foster ( Clarice ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
Not only in their individual parts , but also in the scenes they did together .
Secondly , the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and for that really enjoyable .
You had to pay attention throughout the entire movie to keep up with the story .
This movie is outstanding , I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it .
As I mentioned before , are both the acting and the storyline really impressive .
How 's your first English literature lesson at school ? I hope it had loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired !
I had learnt the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London as well as the lifetime of William Shakespeare .
You may have thought theatres would be fashionable place for the royalty , courtiers and merchants .
During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I , play watching was an entertainment for the locals to relax .
These actors paid full attention to convenience the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting .
They used props , thick make - up , gowns , wigs and all sorts of accessories .
The ' Juliets ' even had to shave their beard and moustache and enjoy their role throughout the play .
What a gargantuan sacrifice of self - esteem and reputation they had given up !
One more interesting fact is that , both the lovers in the play were Italians but their playwright had never been to Italy .
It could reflect 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in touch Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors .
Three trumpet blasts were given symbolizing the start of play , yet none of the respected silence would be given .
Cannonballs were rolled around to make sound of thunder .
Pig 's blood was used during casualties or deaths in sword fighting .
Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter , romance , and tragidies .
The play lover , King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men .
By now , I have widened my horizons and increased my interest towards the spotlight on playhouses .
As you asked I am going to give the information of how my village looks after the environment .
My village has been working on this project for decades they have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day 's everything has cost us a lot of effort we started from the easiest examples ( dividing rubbish into different containers ) to some that are more complex ( renewable energy ) .
We live in an area where its population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human 's activities ; so in our community we have very strict rules when referring to taking care of the environment .
All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy ; ( hydraulic energy , solar energy and wind energy ) every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy , that provide part of the energy to each house the days that the sun shines but if there is no sun the village has a dam beside us which provides them enough with water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy ; not only we have hydraulic energy but also wind energy ; in the out skirts of the village there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced .
Also our water has one of the best purification methods after we use it we clean it so we do n't contaminate the water of the river or dam .
To try to keep the environment clean we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking all the rubbish and controlling the whole area in case there is something not normal .
Apart from this group of voluntaries every person of the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as minimum as possible here the bicycle is the most famous way of transport car are n't common they are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances .
Some of them think that buying things are very boring and unnecessary .
First advantage of buying new things in shops is that it is very satisfying , in particular for women .
Many of them are relaxed when they are searching for new , remarkable clothes .
We would buy next , impracticable high - heel shoes , which will spend couple of years in wordrobe .
Last but not least disadvantage against for doing the shopping , in the mall could prowl many pickpokets , because they could rob us .
In conclusion , buying new things is a good idea to spend fascinating time with friends , however we could also lose a lot of money .
Personally , I do not agree with the statement " shopping is not always enjoyable " , because I like this kind of spending leisure time , for instant , with my mom or friends .
This bar chart deals with the costs of three different photocopiers .
Interestingly the pruchase price of " Carde " and " KD " is almost the same .
All photocopiers show a very low warranty price .
The reason therefore are its small warranty and especially running costs .
The kenn running expenses will compensate the purchase price in the future .
Many people claim , that wearing fashionable clothes is very important .
They spend a fortune on outfits and wait for being admired and appreciated .
I agree with the idea that clothes can help in expressing ourselves .
It is very important to choose those items which represent your personality .
In this way , they represent originality just by using their creativity .
The most significant thing is that it is not what makes you beautiful .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
Peter ran into his father 's arms but he disappeared and he promised himself that he never ever would tell anyone about the secret .
I do not think that no future for public transport because not all the people can have a car , especially , poor people in the developing country .
In addition , some people do not like travelling by their private cars on the highways because they fear the accidents .
But on the other hand , l agree to some extent that travelling by my private car is much more convenient .
I can travel at any time being restricted to specific times , as well as l can rest at any cafe to drink my favorite coffee .
I enjoy using GPS during travelling on my own to explore new places .
Consequently , we can not dispense with public transport , even if some of us would rather to use their private cars .
Some non - building areas , in some countries , are now occupying by housing and other residential buildings .
Human beings need more natural environment to live better and to ensure the living qualities .
Inhabits can go to countryside to have a pacnic or excursion with their friends or families to relax .
The consequence is that they are easily to get sick with modern buildings , which would influence their mental health , and even worse .
Without a pleasant place to live in , they are confronting extinction .
As a result , some most vulnerable species will face to die out .
For governments , restriction on exploring human land is one of the ways to solve these problems .
Policmakers can enact a law in reducing land development .
In conclusion , a wide range of buildings and constructions can not only destroy our own living environment , but also that of animals .
Governments are responsible for changing this problems to achieve the harmony between man , nature and animals .

As far as she considered , she find out that she had a right .
Firstly , just after she had went into the school they greeted her with million colofull balloons with inscriptions with all the best wishes .
After she had finished her lessons , her boyfriend arrived on his motorcycle and took her for a nice trip .
Eventually they came to the lake on the suburbs and then she saw something unexceptable .
Firstly she noticed only a big tranparent with a title " Happy birthday Anna ! "

It is hard to believe during the segregation time , black people were treated as a second - class citizen not only in real life but also in the constitution law .
The movie revealed the ironic reality and the ignorance and stupidity of some unkind people during the segregation time .
I had heard about slavery , discrimination , hate crimes against black people , but I did not know what really happened at that time .
I knew the first person who ended the segregation at southern was a 9-year old girl .
What if I was an African- American , what if I was born during the segregation time .
Would I be brave , determined ?
I was born and raised in China , being a Chinese , it is our obligation to remember what Japanese soldiers had done to us during World War II .
It was the first day of Max 's School excursion to the Patagonia , they had arrive there yesterrday night but , today was the day they would actually go exploring .
When they got to the loction the guide decided to call the wildlife protection in that area to come help .
Once the wildlife protection were able to help the puma , everyone congratulated Max for his bravery and help .
The last documentary I saw was a documentary of National Geographic called Ocean .
It was about the life in the ocean and the consequences of climate change .
The first thing I learnt was that we are destroying the Earth and , especially , the oceans .
So overall I would recommend this documentary to everybody because all the people must know what we are doing with the Earth and they must learn to look after it because we only have one Earth and if we destroy it , we wo n't have any place where we can live .
I conduct group and individual training on Hatha Yoga and Thai Yoga ( Ruesi Dat Ton ) .
I am also a Therapeutic Thai massage professional .
All my yoga lessons and massage sessions are conducted in line with Correct Approach to Spine ( CAS ) method , so they are very safe and based on scientific reason .
Safety and knowledge of the body mechanic are very important to CAS vision as they give feeling of confidence and understanding to yoga practitioners .
I have more than 10 years of experience in the field of yoga and four years of teaching .
I had practised Ashtanga and Iyengar 's styles of yoga and Ruesi Dat Ton ( yoga of Thai hermits ) , learned different approaches during my training in India and Thailand , and my practice brought me to Classical Yoga - Correct Approach to Spine school , which way of exersising I found the safest , the most beneficial for health and scientifically grounded .
Because for me the practitioner 's safety is the one of the most important thing as ahimsa ( non harm ) is one of the crucial principles of yoga .

My husband and I appreciated very much that you are receptive to new ideas .
As you know , we frequently visit your Health and Fitness Club .
Can you imagine that we were a bit disappointed when we read your plans to build a second sauna cabin beside the swimming bath ?
For them ( or do I have to admit us ) , it should be a better idea to build a changing room with more space at that particular place .
In addition , your proposal to provide additional equipment for the gym and a wide screen TV for the snack bar did not get applause in our home .
Maybe you can consider a bit renewing there with new classes , such as kickboxing .
Thank you once again that we were allowed to give our suggestions for you wonderful place .
I read your advertisement on your Internet Website .
I am as good in organizing that I am able to meet a lot of people in a short time .
I would like to take a meeting with you to explain to you my skills with more detail and also I 'll bring you a copy of my Curriculum Vitae .
They began to plan some adventures together .
He must go to a certain place , recover a suitcase and send it to Casablanca .
She said it was a present for his aunt , who lives in Casablanca .
He took the case and planned to travel to Casablanca next weekend , taking advantage of a bank holiday on Monday .
This would cause a global warming causing the winter disappearance .
I live just in front of the sea and I 've been working in restaurants and pubs since I was 16 , where I learned cooking and serving tables .
I am the eldest of four brothers and sisters and I have been used to take care of them , when my parents were at work , especially because I love babysitting !
I can cook and I like organizing sports and different types of activities , so I think I would be really suitable to work for you .
I can speak English and German and I am a really hardworking girl , always happy and cheerful with everybody .
I attach my English C.V. so you can read my references and my past experiences .
Home of the future will be definitely different from those in which we live currently .
For sure the main role in every home will play technology .
Everything will be working remotely , lightning , heating - probably there will be a possibility to programme everything by time , day , month and so on .
All appliances will be eco - friendly .
There will not be a home without air - conditioning anymore .
Room configuration and style will be somewhat different - more glazing , more open spaces .
Unfortunately we ca n't know that for one hundred percent .
One year ago Robert Stromerg directed " Maleficent " , from the film " Sleeping beauty " .

Maleficent is sad and she does apologies and she kisses Aurora .
Finally Maleficent overpowers Stefan .
At the end Aurora lives with Maleficent in the magic forest .
The cast is excellent and the color in the photography is spectacular .
As I think , learning likes a weapon for any individual which enables him to be like a champion .
Learning has no end , We spend all of our lives learn from circumstances we face .
Learning not only means to study in schools , universities , etc .
This can be easy only when you are determined to achieve what you want .
This composition is about the famous person from my country .
I choose this man because he was a significant player during the slave trade .
He fought for the liberation of slavery in West Africa .
This has led to many black Americans to visit the Gambia for investment purposes .
He was captured while hunting with his colleagues in the forest .
He works very had in the sugar plantation for the slave master .
He was later given the opportunity to learn English language .
He did very well during their exam and was given another opportunity to teach English to other slaves .
He was famous and respectful in the slave Campus .
He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolishment of slavery .
He died during the demonstration .
Because of his efforts that lead to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom for captured slave in the campus .
The Gambia is well known by the adventurers and the tourist .
Most people using a public transport to go to their workplace and travelling around the city .
Mostly , they are more preferring to use public transport than the car because it can avoid the traffic block and save time to get into their workplace earlier .
Through all of these points , it is not faulty to say that is the public transport still available and very useful in our daily life , even there are a lot types of cars , which are more convenient .
so , there will be a future for public transport because of its own benefits or advantages to human society .
It is very friendly transportation where the people from all places , meet in one transport and they can make a relationship between them .
Additionally , the pollution , such as haze , will be decreased because fewer people using the car .
As a conclusion , there is a future for public transport and it also convenient to use it for travelling .
I have seen your advertisement for the job of the USA Summer Camps advertised in the local newspaper on the seventh of June .
I believe I 'm a good candidate for this job because I have passed the FCE examination and in a few months I will be taking CAE exam .
I also speak Spanish and Portuguese due to the fact that I have family in both countries .
I am particularly interested in this job due to the fact that I already worked in summer camps ( In Spain and France ) for two years and I 'm very passionate about being with children . I would be able to organise sports and evening activities too because I have helped in many events at my school .
Unfortunately , I do n't have much experience of working in kitchens , but I think I 'm hardworking enough to pull it out .
With reference to my character , I am very organised , friendly and determined .
Yours faithfully , Laura

Subject : Aplication .
Dear Sir Cunningham ,
I am writing to apply for one of the positions of camp monitors you advirtised in the last Monday 's Daily news , I am interested because this post will give me complementary experience .
I am 18 years old , and I am quite selfconfident and a reliable person , I used to take care of my young brother quite often and I handle well with young children .
I have been working in several camps during the last year for this reason I have some relevant experience in this area , in addition I am doing a degree in teaching at the University of London , and during the last quarter I have been in charge of a group of six children in activities related to sports and cooking .
If you require any further information do n't hesitate to contact me on 666777555 in the evenings .
I would be very grateful if you would consider my application for this post .
I 'm not a sportsman , I like watching basketball , tennis , football , but my favorite sport is the running .
We need only an amazing runnigshoes , and that 's all , ok ... ,
For me it is like a meditation . I can think about everything , or nothing .
It is very good for the circulation , the running helps me to be in good shape .
The restaurant I would love to review for the class is one of the most popular restaurants located just near the downtown plaza .
It is called the ' Egyptian Cuisine ' and its name actually represents what it has to offer .
It offers a delicious Egyptian menu which provides enough dishes to cover all tastes , as an example , their delicious fresh eggplant traditional salad .
If there is anything that favors this restaurant , it has to be the quantity they serve ; a surely efficient quantity along the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town , if not in the whole country .
What about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer ; with a soulful live band and an elegant dining set , their atmosphere adds up to the flavor of their food .
In addition to that , they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit ht whole class , professionally named , the meeting table .
This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons ; firstly it offers a traditional menu which will ensure to cover all different tastes .
Secondly , the lively atmosphere it offers will surely keep the class entertained during the entire dine - in .
At the end of my essay , I would like to devote this paragraph and thank my wonderful teacher for this opportunistic chance to offer my sincere opinion on the topic .
Many thanks and I hope for a wonderful trip regardless of the restaurant voted for .
It was a very different experience to learning in Korea .
Participation in class by asking and answering to questions demands more active thinking from us .
Nobody would argue the significance and effectiveness of modern technology , having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable virtues , such as massproduction , information and communication devices as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs .
However , it has also posed some alarming issues , namely environmental destruction , and increasing unemployment and health concerns .
This essay will attempt to analyse both sides of this controversial phenomenon with some applicable supporting ideas .
To begin with , evidently , technological progress has noticeably enhanced individuals'quality of lives , controbuting to the economic growth of numerous nations .
To illustrate , machineries and the use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop massproduction and raise the availability and quantity of various types of food , having made them cheaper and more affordable .
It is played in a box drawn on the ground in the size of a volleyball court .
A centre line parts the box and a line is drawn inside each box about 2 feet from the line which ends the box , and this line is called proudly as Ellai kodu(Border Line)in Tamil .
Rules of engagement are quite simple .
The first and most important rule is you do not let the opponent player who raids your field(the box)to touch your border(Border Line).The second rule is You do not let the opponent to cross over the ' No men 's land'(The centre line),when the opponent touches the Border of your's .
The opponent must raise a leg when the other one touches the border to tell them " Lo , I am in your territory".If the opponent touches the border , he can retreat to his field , no shame in that , but he do n't get any points .
But before retreating , if he touches anyone among them and leaves their field without getting caught , then The raider gets a point and the person who was touched by the raider is dead(Out ) .
Each team gets opportunity to raid other 's field alternatively , and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin , as usual as in most games .
One can wonder , but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature , written circa 300 BCE .
It says the bravery of men is reckoned by the number of scars on his body except on his back , because they thought to be dead in the field is far better than retreating .
I love to play the game with my friends in my village , a very refreshing game , I would say .
It is a popular English science fiction and it tales about the adventures of the " Doctor " .
the Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey and he travels in all of time and space with his companions that are normally humans . in his experiences he saved whole planets to other bad aliens .
I think Doctor Who is totally different from other science fiction films , it always has done the unthinkable , the impossible , things that no one else has even dreamed of .
Doctor 's travelsmachine is a Policebox ... it is small and blue outside , but it is bigger on the inside .
I like Doctor Who very much . I always dream to travel everywhere in time and space since I was a little child ! ! !
! if,(one day)I will have the possibilty to do it I will go to distant galaxies and I will see how the universe began .
The 2014 expenditure for collections is taking out the library budget in 2015 .
For the rest of 2015 , the library will not be purchasing any collection from its budget .
We recommend you to consider the electronic content available through these library subject guides
My apology for any frustration you may have .
Thank you very much for your understanding .
The Headmaster had asked his school 's teachers to begin a class in English and she was one of them .
I think that people will live more ecologically .
In The Home of the Future everybody will segregate waste and take care of environment .
People will have the device that extinguish the light when we leave the room .
We also discover flowers that irrigate themselves and machine that walk a dog or wash them when we do not have enough time to do this .
We will all have vacuum cleaners that will dust everything without our knowledge .
If the place of your happy living is relatively large city , you will say indeed : " We obviously need public transport ! Everyone knows what happens on the streets in rush time ?
On your attitude to public transportation highly affects the quality of public transport itself .
I mean a timetable punktuality , time interval to tne next bus and so on .
At last , how big the crowd are in the bus or subway car in rush time , how convenient for yourself to be there , rather than sitting in your own air - conditioned and perfect looking car .
" Resolution number one : Obviously will lose twenty pounds . Number two : Always put last night 's panties in the laundry basket .
Equally important , will find sensible boyfriend to go out with and not continue to form romantic attachments to any of the following : alcoholics , workaholics , commitment phobic 's , peeping toms , megalomaniacs , emotional fuckwits or perverts .
And especially will not fantasize about a particular person who embodies all these things "
I was always fascinated by this American tradition to make a resolution list .
The idea of writing a blog triggeredmy mind as well .
I had a copybook where I wrote some interesting facts about that remarkable trip for me .
Since then I have been dreaming about collecting my impressions and memories .
As my sister constantly says You 're lucky because you have a memory of a goldfish You remember absolutely nothing .
In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory ) I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures .
A year ago an idea of beginning a blog encountered me as advice from an English teacher .
He recommended me to write in order to apply my English knowledge .
Maybe it 's really time to make a resolution and do begin writing it .
It was a family tragedy when I got a task to write a composition for my literature class .
With humbly and respectfully , I would like to inform you and your organization that I am the appropriate candidate to you .

The cosmic era , communications , easy access to the Internet - all of these things will become common in the distant future .
For example , the spread of IT technologies will change economics and the financial system .
People will start purchasing all the items from the Internet .
New methods of transportation may speed up the delivery to the purchaser home and , as a result , it will improve the quality of service .
The new communication networks will transform the whole world into the big village where everyone will be able to make contact any person .
The development of the space technologies and companies connected to construction of the spacecraft may give a start to space tourism .
I believe that the public transport does n't have future because travelling by car is so much more convenient and comfortable .
The seats are more comfortable in a car than in a bus or underground .
That 's why I prefer Travelling by car instead of public transport .
I am very glad to read this good news , it is the first step for the final result and I will try to do my best to give you useful information for your interview .
Remember this is fundamental for each interview .
Try to be spontaneus and not too much sliced .
Maybe you can receive some general information about your last job .
Do n't worry about people who will interviews you .
I worked in that staff more than ten years ago ( new employees recruiments ) and I can guarantee that for the first interview it is important only to receive a good impression .
If you 'll do it ( and I 'm sure you will give it ) you 'll receive another appointment .
I hope to have said everything .
This film is about a kidnapping of two little girls .
The man is really frightened and this situation gets him more and more desperate and he can not control his reactions .
In my opinion it is so really exciting because you are constantly thinking where the girls are or who can be the kidnaper .
I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller , this thriller is the correct one .
We want to know and understand what is happening nowadays and , for this reason , it is important to know what happened before .
Because that can give us a lot of new information about us that we did n't know .
On the one hand it can be funny to imagine and create the story of how everything happened formerly .
But on the other hand , we can have too much imagination and to be disappointed with the truth .
Consequently , it will be a constantly research on the field of our origins .
I enjoy playing it so much because it 's really challenging .
There are so many opportunities which card to lay and which colour is trump .
If you are very good , you can take part in competitions .
There are German championships every year and there is a league , too , where teams of 4 play against each other .
I really ca n't understand why chess is considered to be sport and Skat is n't .
When it comes to helping communities , people hold different attitudes toward whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities or not .
Some people think young people spend enough time to help their communities ; however , others disagree with the idea .
Although young people are required to help their communities every week , actually it is still not enough .
It is true that young people are required to help their communities by their schools or companies .
It is also true that these kinds of requirements really work , and many communities are benefited .
Actually , there are many communities still do not receive enough help , or many social issues and events would not be discussed again and again .
Many reasons result in this phenomenon .
The world becomes more and more competitive , young people have to spend much time to cultivate themselves to survive in this society .
Young people are not only have to spend much time to make them be professional in one specific subject , they also have to know a wide range of knowledge .
For example , to be outstanding to enter to the best university , student have to perform well on their curriculum , such as literature and science , they also have to be good at music or doing exercise .
Therefore , they do not have much time to help their communities .
To sum up , the world nowadays makes young people to survive by themselves , and they do spend much time to help others .
The Shakespeare 's path to Russia was rather thorny .
This is not surprising .
While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the Thespian art to flourish in England , in Russia was very dim and sinister period of Ivan IV the Terrible 's reign .
So , in Russian print the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748 .
First translations appear in the end of 18th century , but this is not Shakespeare actually because they are made from German or French and the translators change plots as they want ( and turn them into some tearjerkers as a rule ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia in a meantime appears to be a daughter of Claudius ( obviously to make Hamlet torture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is close to unbelievable , but at first critics and educated people find Shakespeare rude , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on you , blind and narrow - minded people !
But everything changes quite rapidly then .
The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original is published in 1828 .
By 1855 only six plays has left non - translated .
It comes to fashion and becomes honorable to translate Shakespeare .
Russian society gradually begins appreciating Shakespeare 's skill in portraying greatness , depth , and complexity of a human being .
" The sun of Russian poetry " , Alexander Pushkin takes his English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare .
In the poetical drama Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov we clearly read Othello 's features .
And these are like nodes on the tree of Shakespeare 's genius .
Since that time Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists .
We love his simplicity and veracity , we adore his multiplicity and fantasy , we appreciate his straightness and audacity , we prize his delicacy and his funny bone of course !
First , I want to explain to you what happened to me on Saturday morning . I had to meet up with my friend Matus at 14 am when he told me that he could n't come over that if we could meet up later how you can understand he made me so angry because I ca n't put up this kind of person who who is in late always .
I got cold feet I could n't understand what was happening .
All in all , He apologized and at the end everything is solved
Hello , my name is Sebastian and I will talk about Azul Historico , which is a restaurant in Mexico City .
The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Católica number 30 , suburb Centro Historico in Mexico City .
Azul Historico is a different restaurant and is located in a patio of an old building in the zocalo , the type of architecture of the place is colonial and between the tables are some trees , and this trees covers the diners when they are eating .
When you are eating you can look some birds who are in the trees , so it make unusual and different this restaurant than others .
The cost of the restaurant dishes is expensive and the cost is around 150 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to choose three best dishes of the place but these three are some of the best typical food of Mexico : the " Cochinita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " and " Carne Enchipoclada " .
" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to choose the meat ( pork tenderloin , beef steak or deer meat ) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chile chipotle with potatoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dish and you need to choose some of the three type of meat that I said , but this are accompanied by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating of oaxaca and the last dish is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexico .
If you want a different and unique restaurant you need to go Azul Historico , because it has a delicious food , some times have a regional music and the service are excellent .
If we consider the potentiality of this means of communication , the television would be one of the most important invention of this last century .
On the other hand , despite the numerous documentaries , news and cultural programs which are passed on every day , another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of the so - called rubbish TV , which has been impacting badly on the younger generation , and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children .
Furthermore I should probably mention the enormous amount of advertisements that every single day people are forced to watch once they have switched on this box .
In my opinion , the real problem of this potentially useful tool is due to the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication .
As a matter of fact televiewers are not able to decide the palimpsest , but they still can decide to switch the television off .
Over the past years , humans have renewed and improved scientific progress and this causes a big change in the life of every day .
First , technology has radically changed the daily life of a simple family : computer seems to be necessary and in every house there is more TV than one .
Conversely , with the latest medical discoveries , doctors are able to treat many of the world 's diseases .
Finally , with the exploitation of new renewable energy , humans have an infinite source of energy .
Well , there are a lot of different opinions but I 'm not agree that the effects of scientific progress may be dangerous for the individual .

The film I would like to review is an old film I 've always enjoyed : Young Frankenstein directed by Mel Brooks in 1974 .
This comedy , entirely shot in black and white , is a parody of the classical horror films , in particular it 's a parody of those films based on the Mary Shelley 's better - known book , and presents a lot of elements that gives this film a really hilarious mark .
The performance of Gene Wilder , as the main character Dr Frankenstein , Marty Feldman , as the hunchbacked assistant Igor ( pronounced eye - gore ) , and the other members of the cast is amazing and has made Young Frankenstein one of the top comedy of all time .
I am writing because I would like to achieve the First Certificate in English ( FCE ) .
Yours faithfully
Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays ?
It has it 's own rules , tools and the people who are specialized in it .
We need music in most of our times or even every single day , to enrich our days with happiness and joy , and also to melt away sorrows or depression , that can affect us and prevent ourselves from doing the best .
Which has many branches and types , those are traditional : owned by any part of the world , and the other international types that all people over the world are share it .
The traditional or local music of a certain area has it 's thumb print on the person of that part .
And the instruments used in that local music may vary from sort to another .
For example , In Northern Sudan people have been used " Tambor " as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs .
Internationally , the kinds of music are many , however , most of them share the same instruments .
In particular the Piano is a universal tool that is used by many musicians as a primary controller of the rhythm of the Orchestra .
Last and not the least , music is a sort of treatment to those who are suffering , so regardless of it 's type or nationality it 's a kind of medicine to the soul .
The prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods as the inquisition , the knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies since the knowledge through books had become a threat to continue underpinning their power within the social pyramid ; therefore , those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them .
Although , some ideas were maintained ; ( for instance , the astronomy by Galileo Galilei ) the book - burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if books were burned , the knowledge could not circulate .
Nevertheless , a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutenberg ( 1440 ) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recovering significant books from Plato , Aristotle and so on , authors against political , religious and social issues that spread their ideas to more people becoming aware of the power of the written word , creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones .
In addition , it was produced the collective readings through the ecclesiastical method with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in the books to all social classes .
On the other hand , at present , people identify another knowledge revolution , the internet in which the access to the knowledge is easier and faster leaving aside books .
People die , but books never die " it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time taking into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the entrance of the information ; for instance , in the inquisition , the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books .
Although there was an oral tradition , the knowledge was accommodated to the political and religious thought of the speaker ; so , the most efficient and objective way to transmit the knowledge was by books and it was not possible because of the burning .
Nonetheless , with the invention of the printing type mobile , the knowledge was different for the access to it .
If one book was burned , there were ten books more without restriction .
In contrast , nowadays , the books are not necessary at all ; because of the internet network facilitate even more the knowledge .
That is why ; I could accommodate the phrase by Franklin saying that " the knowledge can not be killed by people because the knowledge is infinite . "
On actual days what we most need is to find ways to prevent childhood obesity because nowadays is a very common sickness that attack more and more children everyday causing them feel bad about themselves .
According to the CDC the percentage of children age 6 to 11 years old has increased from 7% to about 18% in 32 years on the Unitated States .
This means that in the past tree decades obesity has more than doubled in children , same that had diseases just like diabetes , ashtma , cardiovascular risk factors , mental health disorders and muskuloskeletal problems .
This disease is not just about all the physical and health consequences that have , but also the mental ones .
The best way we can prevent childhood obesity is recommending all the families some different doctor that can help them to give a safe life to their children .
Nutritionist are specialists that know a lot about all the types of sickness that can attack on the kids and even the ones that will murder them .
Giving them the opportunity to take care about your situation will change all your life in a good way .
So it seems that these people can live happily and peacefully , without problems , but this is not true .
I have little cousins and sisters so I 'm very good with kids , I 've experienced all kinds of situtions so I think they wo n't be a problema for me .
As I said before , I have young cousins and we meet on saturdays so I need to think of activities and games to keep them entretained .
I 'm an outdoors person so I will be very happy with the accomodation . I would be very thankful to work for you if you decide to accept my application .
I have seen your advertisement on the internet and I would like to apply for the post as activity coordinator .
I am 16 years of age and due to having a sister I really like working with children and also know their interest well . I have enjoyed and practised swimming since I was eight years old and I have also won some competition , therefore I believe that I am suitable for the job .
Furthermore I go jogging every Sunday morning with some friends .
My reason for applying for this position is that I am good on combining my experience in swimming with my wide knowledge of the countryside which I think it will be interesting for the children .
Today , human civilisation is changing at a higher speed than any time in the past .
If this will also be the case for out future , then I think that today we underestimate our future .
I am sure only about one thing : technologies will have a more important place in our lives .
Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that would solve all our problems .
Maybe by doing this we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
That morning his grandmother went to the hospital because she had to do a surgery and she told him to buy some magazines for her , because at the hospital she 's bored and she could n't get off the bed for a few days .
So Peter went home to take his wallet but before that he decide to take a nap because he was tired so he started to sleep but it ended up that he slept for over 3 hours and his mother started calling him at the telephone and she was really angry because he forgot to buy the magazines for his grandmother .
So he woke up and looked at his watch and knew that he had to buy them immediately or his mother would be even more angry than before .
Unfortunately the hospital was already closed to the visitors so he had to wait the next morning .
But I do n't think that in ten or twenty years the scientific progress will be able to produce this type of transport , so we should imagine something simpler .
And how will our way of travelling change ?
Transport will also respect the environment and nature .
since decades man preferred to use another way of transporting than his own foot .
Scientists could provide in the past years new transportation tools from cycles , automobiles up to motorcycles , motorcars , trains , metros that has been used to arrange and accomplish complete public transportation net through the same country , and sometimes exceeded it to another country boarder upon an agreement between those countries .
Many people assured that they are preferring using their own cars , but they were being forced to use the Public transport for many reasons such as , the complexities they are facing with the driver 's license , in addition to the fuel high cost .
Let 's do n't forget the hard times during cold weather changes especially in winter while reaching the bus stations , or their low chances of having a good place to sit , may be another important reason that raise the private transport scores than the public one , which is molestation .
Moreover , I went to Vilnius primary school and invites schoolchildren to come to a concert .
I had to make one hundred invitation cards .
The cards included the programmee of the concert and some photos of children from all the world .
It is a very good and useful experience .
I gained a lot of experience while organizing an event .
Also , I learned that you have to be very enthusiastic and self - confident because finding the sponsors for a concert is quite a difficult task I liked that teacher trusted me .
I did everything by myself because everyone had sometihng to do on their own .
I hope that I will use this experience in my future .
And now I can easily speak about many shopping facilities in my city .
If you have enough money for Kiev luxury shopping called ' gold shoppping ' , you 'd rather go on Khreshatik street .
In conclusion I have to say , that in Kiev you can find everything , if you really want to .
Art / Music is less important than science / technology .
In my opinion , technology become more and more important than art which be a necessary part in our life .
Most of people in this world ca n't live without technology .
As soon as we open our eyes every day , we begin to use technology such as alarm , cell phone and light .
The more technology we use the more important it is .
Technology makes us easy to connect our family , friends and co - workers .
We can talk to our family and friends immediately , which is not limited by space .
However , technology made it easier ten years ago and it became more common in recent years .
Technology is one of important part in our life , which has made life more convenient .
Therefore , we use calculator to count numbers in a few second .
In the old age we calculated number by our brain that might lead to some mistakes .
Our life has transformed into an easy way by technology .
It is easier to contract entertainment which could release our stress immediately .
Pressure exist everywhere ; for instance , your boss was angry and shouted on you or you should carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father - in - law .
When you ca n't breathe in your life you need some entertainment ; for example , you can listened music with your cellphone or watched some funny videos after all things that bothered you .
Technology enable us to touch entertainment immediately .
Technology has changed our life in many ways which brings many advantages for us such as convenience , easy to connect friends and easier to contract entertainment .
In conclusion , in these three premises I consider that technology and science is important rather than art and music .
Developed technology , we can see the game which happened in the opposite of the earth .
Activation makes people exciting and remember their memory .
This activation make us also enjoy seeing and play the game .
However , in soccer , every single player touch the ball , even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball .
Second reason is that soccer involved for all players to participate into the game .
Can we say these players participating in the game ?
If somebody wanted to play a soccer , I would recommend that he or she has to have a stretching because soccer is very active sport so always has a possibility to be injured .
We need to respect other sports and other people 's perspectives .
When she came back from school , her parents and all her classmates were hiding in a living room and waiting for her .
Anna did n't understood what had just happened .
She slept all the day after this big celebration .
For example , ours capital city Prague there are many historical buildings like Carl 's bridge , Cathedral of St. Vit , big clock called Orloj and so many others .
If you go to south Morava , you should definitely try some vines or drink called Slivovice .
For example , near Prague is castle called Karlštejn where lived Karel IV . or castle called Buchlovice which is on south - east of your country near the city Uherské Hradiště .
Otherwise , the opportunities for a job here is quite a lot .
If you would like to ask something or get to know more information about some place just let me know .
I am Melina and I am interested in your job vacancy .
In my opinion , we should build a perfect world for them to grow up in a safe and environmentally friendly place .
I have experience taking care of children .
I enrolled on different courses about children development and currently I am working as an au pair where I have to speak English .
I participated in sports clubs of my High School .
Although I am very keen on rugby and basketball , during the University I took part in the badminton club .
English will not be a problem because I know how to communicate with young people .
my favourite sports are gymnastics and martial arts .
i 've been practicing martial arts for eleven years but i havent lost the passion I feel about it .
i have been practicing gymnastics during 4 months and fascinated with it , i like to be tired for doing stunts , and I also feel very healthy because I exercise daily , if its not gymnastics it 's kung fu .
I like those sports because you need much strength and dedication to be getting better , I like kung fu weapons and handsfree forms , to do something spectacular in kung fu you have to do acrobatic gymnastics .
I invited my friends to try these sports and apparently they liked , many did not because they did not know well what it was but after living it for yourself you realize that are very beautiful sports .
I tried to renew my membership twice yesterday and there was a message of error both times .
I received a call from my credit card administration this morning to confirm and authorize that payment , telling me that there were two attempts of charging my credit card bill .
After authorizing my credit card administration , I tried to renew it , but again there was the same message of error .
I am waiting for some instruction about what I have to do now to renew my membership .
One more advantage of qning a pet is that it helps children learn to be responsible and carring .
On the other hand there are a lot of disadvantages of owing a pet in big citiew .
Television can be able to both entertain and educate at the same time .
Environmental protection for instance , or more practically the correct use of the water in our houses .
Another example can be represented by the first aid activities and so on .
The topics can be easily focused if we have in mind a model of society where individuals have a central role .
Several contents could have an educative value , for example those concerning our relationships with others , or our relationship with nature and with different cultures and religions .
All these topics by using creativity and new technologies can be faced in a way to make them soft and adapt to entertain .
Here are some basic informations about the news .
A charter plane carrying 72 passengers , including players from Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense , crashed near Rionegro , Colombia , according to the country 's civil aviation department .
The civil aviation agency had initially announced that six passengers , three players , two crew members , and one journalist , survived the crash .
I think it is a catastrophe to victims and their families .
To avoid accidents , government and airline companies have to do something to prevent tragedy .
Next , when you are in a class , focus on what the teacher says , she / he will teach you and give you a clearer understanding about grammar .
And they will also remind you some key points you do n't understand when you preview it .
In the class , you should take notes and write down what is Iimportant .If you have any question then you should ask teachers to help .
If you do all the things above , I promise your grammar will improve and you 'll master it eventually .
Usually I am there with my friends or colleagues for a dinner or a lunch .
Surprisingly , they serve it with a half cut bone which is quite fun by itself , even before you taste the dish . Mashed potato is creamy and full of butter .
Try one of the cloudy ciders on the tap and you will not be disappointed !
Taking care of our environment is considered for many of us one of the most important things in our lives .
Nowadays , in order to have the best for the actual and following generations , there are international common ways for individuals to contribute to solving environmental problems .
Recycling is both a popular and an undervalued method .
Using its respective light bulbs , household appliances and any other thing that saves energy is the only way that individuals can help but , it is not effective .
Although an entire town or city contributes to saving energy in their homes , it can not be compared with the waste of energy that industries make .
In this case , restrictions should be implemented by the government .
Taking everything into consideration , there is a good argument for supporting recycle , which is the following one : The biggest waste of energy take part in primal resources industries , if we reuse all the materials that had already been exploited , we would reduce at least half of its costs .
The chilis restaurant at 123 street , Toronto is really a great place to hang out .
The Scrumptious food served makes me go back there often . if you want to have a lip smacking dessert this is the ultimate place .
Everyone will love the appetizers and main courses served there .
Moreover the ambience of the restaurant is marvelous .
Whereas if you are going in there to party with friends or watch a game you get a table at suitable place . I believe that if we all could go to this restaurant at the end of our course , we will surely have a great time .
For several years , a secondhand clothing store increase and a lot of people use it .
There were many specialists to repair , recycle and collect products in Edo .
In 1723 , there are 1182 secondhand clothing stores .
It was just the number of union members so in fact , there more secondhand clothing stores in Edo .
However , secondhand clothing stores are increasing recent years .
There are many secondhand clothing stores now .
Media or also known as mass media is one of the most powerful means of spreading information .
It gives people the opportunity to get to know what happens all around the world in each matter such as poverty , occupation , discrimination , suppression of human rights and so on .
Nowadays we can easily get information which we need through the Internet , in the newspapers , on the TV .
As European citizens we are bounded directly or indirectly with the loads of social problems and issues in Europe so we have to acquire our right of free access to information privately and randomly in order to stop corruption , to acquire knowledge about our rights .
So that we can be active citizens and help the EU continuing developing
Nevertheless Today I usually go to the cinema when I really want to watch a particular film .
Nowadays I try to choose films with good actors or actresses , special scrips and plots , documentary stories or special renowned Director 's films like Almodovar , Sanchez Arévalo o Alex de la Iglesia .
On the one hand Comedies are my favourites ones because I have to laugh when I have finished my work .
Once I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours . I did not managed to get particular one , because of size , which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others did not seem to be valuable for fixed prices .
Second , shopping malls have full places of advertisements and loud songs playing .
He hears different kind of songs , advertisements for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality .
Finally , not every assistant is able to advise you appropriate .
There are some assistants who if you ask or even do not ask , they start suggesting the best their products as well as the most expensive ones to you .
This can make your shopping really annoying , because some type of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of product .
To sum up , shopping is not always an enjoyable thing , because it takes time , it is often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants , who eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products .
If I were you I would pick up the one in the avenue , because of the facilities
I really do hope you get used to the neigborhood .
The football is the most beautiful sport in the world , it 's the profession dream of almost all the boys when they are kids , when you play in your neighbourhood , you are playing that you 're Messi , or Cristiano Ronaldo or your favourite player of your team .
But the passion is not only when you are playing football , you can increment your passion supporting a team in the good times and the bad times , going to the stadium , and when your team reach the glory , you can also feel that , and in this moments you are the happiest person in the world .
So I invite you to join the love and passion when you feel when you are playing or watching a match of football , and if you share this love with another person the passion increases a lot , your feelings are in their higher level , in this sport you can feel the glory , and in the next second you can start to cry because you 're team ca n't finish the way to the championship .
There are lots of interesting sports but there is normally one that you like the most .
I am talking about dancing , specifically ballet .
I consider it one of the best sporty and cultural activities because you keep fit at the same time that you express yourself making an art stuff .
You have to be a disciplined and well - balanced person , that 's it .
Both characteristics will help you in other type of tasks and will improve your future development .
The start is the hardest part considering that your body is not used to do this kind of sport ; however , once you are in it everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active .
So , if you are starting it , do n't give up because of difficulties are coming , just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity .
You will notice how the improvements come up without thinking too much .
One of the things that I enjoy the most is that you dance in a group therefore you meet people and you can make a friendship after a while .
You must not be in your own , otherwise you could not dance in a company , so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that , make a strong relationship forever .
4 . Everything was kept neatly .
Anything was found difficult nor struggling .
Neverthless , I would like to improve some skills and although I did very well , I still got confused .
1 . I overthought every so often , because I was not sure if what I was doing was alright .
2 . I should stop thinking in Spanish and more in English since translating might be confusing .
Choosing a sport to practise is a complicated thing . You should choose something that you enjoy , but at the same time , something you can afford to pay for .
Although you may think that is a dangerous sport , which can be , the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in the water makes it worth the danger .
If you are going to start practise it , I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor .
Nowadays , people is aware of environmetal problems and they will try to figure out .
For example , all future houses will use solar cells to produce electricity .
Moreover , there will be important thecnological advances in our life , like as intelligent mobile phones which could help us with day - to - day task .
They will control our empty fridge and if you run out of any vegetables , your mobile phone would warn your supermarket and they would bring it .
To conclude , it is impossible to argue against the fact that people 's live will change in the next years but , these changes will help to improve our environment and our dairy life .
It is often said , that shopping is a pleasant procedure but sometimes it becomes bothersome .
However , there are situations we do not find enjoyable at all .
I will mention some of the reasons why and when shopping can be unenjoyable .
Shopping may cause frustration mainly , when we have to squeeze through the crowd .
Secondly , shopping definitely become unenjoyable when we are not able to find products we want and desire .
On the one hand , overspending money .
Nevertheless , poeople try to save money by every conceivable means .
To conclude , we have to know when and to which shop we should go to avoid stressful and not enjoyable situations .
Researchers have proved that human activities such as industrialization , deforestation etc . can trigger global warming .
In this topic I would be highlighting some of the dangers of climate change and different ways through which government and individual may help to overcome this challenge .
One of the most evident effects of global warming is the depletion of the ice at North & South poles , in turn causing sea level rise and encroachment of land .
These phenomenon caused serious damages to ecosystem and sea life .
Further , continuous rising temperature is impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters .
There are scientific evidences , that calamities like Katrina , Hud - Hud can be linked to global warming .
Government can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints .
For example , governments can impose limits on emissions by manufacturing plants and force industries to help in forestation .
Individuals can also play their part in controlling global warming .
For example , individuals can reduce use of the plastic materials , use public transport to control emission , recycle waste material etc .
Government & Individual both have role to play , in facing this biggest challenge of the Time , Earth is facing .
I have two kids one is 8 years old and the other one is 10 years old so I have plenty experience with kids .
My task there were vary from working with children of all ages to organise events , sport activities and evening activities . I also helped with cleaning the centre , helping in the kitchen with cooking and working closely with clients and customers in our Café .
This will be a great experience for me to work so close to the countryside .
Yours faithfully ,
Michael is an editor in an international student magazine .
He holds a short story competition to improve students ' writing .
While I watched that message , I was excited to find my friends to enter this competition .
I thought no matter who wins the competition , we all must get 1 dollar for prize .
But my friends were not interested in that competition , they thought writing is boring and got 1 dollar is small .
Finally , they copied my article in this competition .
When he read the content of article , he discovered many of them are similar .
Academic culture refers to the attitudes , values and that are shown by the people who work or study in universities .
After I joined ACU ( Australian Catholic University ) I have found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia .
In Nepal students study individually , do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused .
Meanwhile , Australian education is based on making students learn new skills .
Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers .
Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement .
It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks .
According to Hamp ( 2002 ) , the goal of EAP ( English For Academic Purpose ) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree .
It helps to share the ideas , knowledge , among the students and make them think critically , by using formal language while writing and so on .
In conclusion , the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning .
I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question , share my opinion to the tutor .
In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group .
I want to talk about a restaurant called " Bierkeller "
It 's a restaurant located in Villa General Belgrano , Cordoba and the specialization of it is german food .
The restaurant is beautiful , it 's of a normal size , with many space and very well decorated , you have many photos and paints to see .
People at the restaurant are very kind , the treat you in a very polite way and is worth going there
If we go to Bierkeller we wo n't regret and we will have a great time trying different types of food , learning maybe a little bit of the history of the town and be happy as a group
Almost everybody has ever thought of taking a gap year between leaving school and starting university , but we do really know all the advantages and disadvanatges that it entails ?
From one hand , a big part of global population consider this year off a way of learning and experience while you enjoy travelling all around the world and you get to know people from all the different cultures .
Nowadays , employers are looking for experienced people who knows how to adapt to all the different situations you can be involved in , such as an international lecture or a difficult plight .
It is also said that at the hour of heading to college , those people who have taken a year off are the ones who have less difficulties to learn and relacionate with other students because they have had used to it before .
It is a fact that those who spend a year abroad working on something , they can save money for university and they become more independent .
But taking a year off has its downsides as well , like the time people waste working on something they are not going to do in the future , because with any kind of extracurricular studies , people strangely find a good job .
That is why it is recommended to wait until you finish university to look for a job .
Another fact that should be highlighted is that while you are working for a year , people from your age are at university , and that means that they will probably finish their degree a year earlier than you , and this could be an inconvenience for you , because you will have to have a year younger classmates .
Many automobilindustries are working for a new future of automobils .
For many years Apple , Google and several traditional automakers have been running prototypes , which are driving from self and nobody can steer the car .
The question arises if driverless cars will be a boon or bane to us ?
This have got a devastating effect for her independence and freely living .
When this people can drive a self driving car the feel more comfortable and the can live more freely .
Self driving cars are very modern and drive with a very highly technically software .
The automobilindustries have to work on a plan that self driving can be bought by people oft he middle class too .
When this will be going on self driving cars can be an enrichment for our life .
The Reading museum in Berkshere has visitors from all age groups , but particularly suitable for young people who need help for school projects or want to take up creative things as a hobby .
They have a number of workshops for young people from beginner to semi - professional , and most of those are not so expensive .
You can learn various interesting art - works such as painting , photograph , ceramic , from the lifework professionals .
Their lunch menus are gorgeous and the price are reasonable .

subject : the transports of my local area
introduction :
as requested , i have investigated the features of the main means of transports which are used in my local area .
these are very cheap and people who do not have a car use it to move everywhere . however , this transport isnot so comfortable because sometimes you must travel with lots of people .
people use their car for travel a long o short distance , this is really comfortable because you can manage the speed and where you will direct .
these are the combination between buses and your own car .
conclution
The other reason why I like practising football is because it is a collective sport .
My advice to people who want to play football is to be passionate , to like and feel football .
And for those who like football but are scary to get injured , they still have the opportunity to watch games on TV and play video game console .
It is common to see during summer many people in parks practising sports , like running , biking , or just doing every kind of physical activities .
So , when I wake up every morning , also pushed because I am a very active person , I get such a motivation to go out and do something .
But , not only in summer I practise sports , once in winter I practise also fun sports , like skiing , snowboarding , and Ice skating , among others .
So , when my friends ask me which is my favourite sport , a problematic decision comes to my mind , simply because I like them all .
If you want to practise this sport , you can simply take a couple of sneakers , and any light sportswear , and start to run anywhere .
Nonetheless , if you really want to get into this sport as a pro , you can get to invest a lot on clothing and gadgets .
Nevertheless , once you started to practise running , and want to really get into it , and improve , I do recommend you to take care of your health a to find professional assistance .
Injuries may happen for practicing it often if you do not know the way you step , or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistant that your body needs , for example .
Famous people , such as politicians and film stars , deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
The relationship between famous people and journalist is an attractive focus on our society .
Famous people need a love , family , entertainment and support .
Like we all know technology is making the best of it .
The society is growing and as it grows it gets more used to technology being everywhere .
They just prefer to travel long or short distance in individual transport , known as car .
This is because technology has given us this opportunity , and as time goes by more and better modifications are made to car .
The clients benefit of professional coaches , who train them in order to perform the exercises correctly .
There are appliances as treadmills , bikes , weightlifting and many others .
You should build one to improve the popularity of your leisure club .
Those people who use the spa can benefit from treatments of the highest quality .
Anyway , their children do not have a special place , so it would be recommended to arrange a safe place for them to play .
I hope that my report helped you , and Active Leisure Club will improve its facilities .
But something happens unexpectedly and the new chapter is completely different what you had imagined .
In my opinion , a good book has to have surprise , has to have a good plot , a good variety of characters and , as I said , has to involve you .
In this CD , the Singer expresses all her feelings and told us about her last experiences during recent years .
Firstly , you can find songs about her children , lack of affection , broken heart and some commercial songs which have an interesting lyrics .
People could think that if you buy this type of music , you will waste your money and it is just commercial music .
Time passed and John had an unimaginable inspiration with his experiment .
One night he went to a party with his colleagues .
He thought it will be good to distracted for a while .
It was already night when he was in Luck 's house ( Luck was an old friend ) and all of them were talking about life things , but then Luck remembered that John was working in an experiment that he did n't know what was it about , so he asked John in front of everyone :
I heard that you were working in an experiment !
When Peter listened that , he was interested in knowing about John 's experiment .
He had the insight that the experiment could be something vital to human life .
John accepted his help ant told him to go to his laboratory .
After four months of hard work , they took the experiment with all the information to inspection .
They decided to design a vertical field to expand the laboratory .
Everything was going very good ; nonetheless Peter intentions changed and became riddle .
Furthermore , the court has walls and the ball can bounce off they .
This is in regard to the summer camp application advertised in the newspaper .
I would like to work as a volunteer in the upcoming summer camp at Arizona which you are organizing from 20th March to 30th March .
I am 32 years old Computer Science graduate currently working as software consultant .
So I would like to take this opportunity to work as a Volunteer .
With my experience as a teaching assistant I can easily handle young kids and keep them busy in learning . I am follow a lot of sports channels in TV during my free time and that helps me in setting up the rules for the sports activities and ensure they are organized well .
It gives me great pleasure in helping kids in their activities and teaching them through play .
It makes me feel contented that I am contributing to the society by participating in the tasks that shape their future .
Having energetic and cheerful attitude , I would like you to consider me as the best fit for the camp volunteer and accept my application .
In my opinion , public transport has been improved during the last years , because cities has been doing a lot of investment for that .
At big cities , such New York , the main public transport is the underground , which is usually fast and not too expensive .
I do not agreee with the idea which says that there is no future for public transport , because it is a perfect way of transport for commuters and nowadays , a lot of people is conscious with the global warmig and the envirnoment , and refuses to use the car every day .
In addition , the fuels price is increasing during the last years .
In summary , I think the public transport is a good way to move and the number of users is increasing every day .
If I am not travelling with my parents , I will go to your city .
Nowadays , travel in public transport has been an experience who none has failed .
However , exist now a discussion about what the people prefer , if the public transport or the vehicule of oneself .
In conclusion , we can say that every kind of transport has their own pros and cons but in my opinion the difference between both this is that in the secon you chose you own style .
Extremadura is a small place where you can not find many transport types .
First of all , the most of the people in Extremadura use the car for going to the job , to university or school .
When you use the car , you do not have to think in timetables and you do n't have to pay expensive tickets for travelling .
However , I think that this transport has some disadvantages , for instance : if in a small city there are a lot of cars , the pollution will increase and the environment will be injured .
Also , when a city is small the people should walk to different places since everything is near to your houses .
Related to the use of the car , I would like to say that the Extremadura 's roads need a big reparation because , for example , the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it .
In Extremadura , the second transport most used is the bus .
On the one hand , there are buses that connect the several neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them .
On the other hand , there are buses for travelling large distances .
Finally , in Extremadura the transport least used is the train .
Hello , dear guests ! We are glad to see you in our city . I want to tell you about interesting places in my city .
We are live in Moscow , it is a very big city , so there are many interesting places , where I used to do some activity .
That 's why I decide to tell you about some interesting place in our city .
In the summer it is a place where you can play Volleyball in the special ground with sand , play ping - pong or if you are tied you can sit in special hammock .
Guys should not go to snowbording .
I think it is good plays to other activities .
Most people eat scrammbled eggs and drink a cup of tea .
I would prefer to eat more light dishes like vegetables with rise .
Supper always contains sandwiches .
I ca n't stop studying English language , I'm a sort of ' englishaddicted , but I wish I were an English native speaker , I do n't know why .
, later I took my degree in Modern Foreign Languages and Literatures , starting my to and from England to improve my skills .
While studying at the University my idea was to move to the UK to work there , but I got married so I could n't realize my dream . !
I found myself teaching English in my Country , far from the language competence I was longing for .
Nearly every education will apply a placement in their education program , to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level .
Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects .
Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get .
In addition , on placement the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company .
So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school .
In a natural work pattern you have to do , also like school , your tasks but the communication is also an important part of it .
This important way communication lacks at school , because it 's a nearly a one direction way of communicating from the teachers .
While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills .
However , public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience .
Especially in the countryside , public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency .
Consequently , people prefer taking the car .
Firstly , because they gain independence therewith .
Secondly , they can visit each place without any circumstances .
It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is running .
In addition , the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing .
Furthermore , ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years .
Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car .
Nevertheless , public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car .
Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing , especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours .
The purpose of this report is to inform about how the city of Granada take care of envirnoment .
And there is a big universitary commnunity involved in recycling .
Clean Infrastructures
How was said , Granada have a decent public transport and now it is being improved by adding a metropolitan train .
However , Granada can not be considerer as Ciclyng Friendly , there is less ciclyng roads than in other cities of similar size .
In addition , the oldtown is not as involved as it should be in clean behaviour , being the University who make the biggest effort .
I considerer that Granada score 6.5 of 10 about taking care of envirnoment .
When you will get to the highest tower , you will watch the most breathtaking view .
It is a place where you can always find loads of tourists and foreigners .
When the weather is good enough close to the castle take place many kinds of parties and enterinments .
Unfortunately , tickets are expensive but worth buying . I also honestly recommend you to see all the places around the Big Castle such as Town Museum or Folk village .
Tomorrow , I 'll go to visit my grandparents in Galicia .
It 's a long trip but it does n't matter because I 've good friends there and I want to spend some time with my grandparents , David and Gema .
Nowadays almost every person in the world watches movies temporarily or permanently .
Regarding my preferences , I would like to admit that silent genre conquered me .
Of course , unprepared viewer ca n't understand inner beauty of this genre and will choose something mediocre .
However , simplicity in some cases can be very good and smart .
I do n't appreciate melodramas or love stories much , but they should be paid attention to .
In my opinion , very few people use movies for broadening the mind .
That day was a terrible day with Michael , he woke up and felt totally exhauted after an overwhelming birthday party .
His mom was disappointed about that , too .
He did not answer at all , besides , he hit the chair near her , and unfortuantely , that chair hit her in a serious manner .
She even could not yell a word , just looked at him disappointedly .
The aim of the site is to get together people interested in cars .
In this network you create a profile of your car , write a list of improvements you have done in it , upload photos and movies about you car and of course you meet a lot of people with the same interests .
So they often need help of professionals .
I think that it is necessary to involve some professional mechanics to give advice to users .
The other website I often use is Google.com because it is the greatest searching service ever created by human beings .
I think it is the best among other searching systems because of it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing excess .
I think that many google users will be happy if the developpers bring more useful information to the main page , for example weather information , carrency rates or hot news .
Moreover google map service needs some improvements such as street names , map accuracy and more city panorams .
I hope your arrival was successful and you have been enjoying our town .
If you want to spend your time visiting famous and very beautiful place and see by yourself the main sightseeing in Moscow , I recommend you to visit the Red Square .

I hope you will enjoy seeing this place and become really excited by this excursion watching the great architectural monuments

My brother only has one child , but my grandfather has four children .
My grandfather must work hard to support his children by additional job .
They had no money could use on entertainment .
Second , more and more infrastructures appear in our city .
These kinds of space can make parents comfortable and concentrate on their care .
On the other hand , the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system .
This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care of their children .
That being said , I still feel that the reasons I have presented was strong ones , such as more resources and infrastructure .
Having a healthy lifestyle is one of the most important things for our health , because it reduces the chances of getting sick and it gives you the energy and concentration you need .
Eating on a schedule is a very important tip you should take in consideration and also trying to avoid fried meals or fast food .
Unhealthy food and neglecting physical exercises increases the chances of getting fat and having problems with your heart , liver and other organs .
Fruits , vegetables and water
Your body requires many types of vitamins in order to function properly , which are found in fresh or boiled vegetables and fruits .
However , drinking 2 litters of water everyday is essential to your health and has a lot of benefits such as helping energising muscles or keeping your skin look good .
Another think you should take in consideration if you want to live a happy long life is doing physical exercises , such as walking in the park , going to the gym or playing team sports .
Besides that , you should also sleep between 8 - 10 hours per night , so that your body can function effectively .
-eat fruits and vegetables
-drink excessively alcohol
In conclusion , you do n't have to do a lot of effort to have a healthy lifestyle and there are plenty of benefits from it .

Thus , our state spears no effect on fight it , transportation now is very over crowdedness and difficult , especially in the rush hour which people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock , the main reason for that is the increasing the number of people in our country ( housing problem ) and the result of that a lot of accidents has been done and a lot of people were died .
According to a study published by the journal « American Journal of Medicine Brevintev » in August / August next that the more public transport in the city , where population has become leaner and healthier .
The U.S. researchers from two universities in the state of Pennsylvania and the Foundation « Rand » American research and development staff to monitor regularly attend public transportation or go to work by car within a year .
The study results showed that people who ride transportation .
Public decreased their weight by three kilograms on average , compared to people who use the car to move and the study attributed this result to walk to the bus stop and running to catch the bus in the expected position requires goer public transport more traffic , while this does not happen with motorists .
He appealed to the experts in political circles in the United States to invest more money in public transportation and improving security in the ways of the infantry in cities and make them more attractive to encourage people to use public transport .
The supervisor of the study , John M ..
MacDonald of the University of Pennsylvania : « investment in public transport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity people » .
Suffered the transport sector in the Arab countries of the many shortcomings and poor performance and is a form of environmental pollution and this is due primarily to a lack of the capacity of public institutions to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately and allocate investments effectively and improve the organizational capacity and result
So it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate cost and in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries are still public transport systems are undeveloped and drive people to rely on private cars .
It has been observed , for example , that increasing the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries , and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades , the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of congestion severe urban centers and poor air quality in many cities , land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming .
The optimistic opinion , some people object that " no future for public transport " saying that the future of public transport is clear and the prof of that in ancient there was n't any transport and by the time people starting to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle , cart , carriage , boat , ship , lorry , private cars until the plane , so they hope that the transportation be best by the creative people .
In the other opinion , the pessimistic opinion , in developed countries like Japanese and Kuwait we do n't find like these problems because they have a good planning , they make ways underground and overground , then they have ways only for people and ways only for cars , finally , we should have a good plan and the government should care with that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .
I recommend you , too , to visit the castle because it is very interesting .
I 'm not sure what is the most expensive restaurant in my town , maybe there are some near the beach because the tourist normally go there .
In my opinion , a trip will be fascinating because of the fact that the building of the Brewery is orginally German - owned brewery which has been brewering been for almost 400 years .
It is a good purpose , to see and get to know the place , where in Poland produced traditional and well known beer .
I hope you will take it into consideration and go to sightseeing our local but famous Brewery .
Yours faithfully ,
The Asian restaurant Tian review
For our end of the course 's dinner , I 'd recommend the Asian restaurant Tian .
The atmosphere seems exotic and calming .
Finally , to add one more touch to the experience you can take a ride in their tuk - tuk .
Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately .
He got that mysterious look in his eyes .
He just realized how to solve one of the biggest physical challenges mankind has been interested in for ages .
Time travelling !
Time is running , seemingly continuously , same as seconds hand on his clock .
But we got this perception just because our eye can see only limited number of images in a time period .
If time period is long enough , like minute , we can see strict distinction between one and two .
Peter grabbed his notebook and immediately wrote all this down .
However , some people say that public transport have no future , they might be right.ple do n't agree with it , they prefer travelling by car .
Considering that the companies now are moving to the surrundings of the cities and the lack of more and flexible timetables some people exclude the public transport option .
It is believed that travelling by car is more comfortable and convenient for everyone , consequently car brand 's look at is as a new opportunity creating new hybrid cars in order not to damage the environment .
I personally believe that because of all this the public transport will have no future in our society .
She woke up in the morning full of enthusiasm and zest for life .
She was sure that everyone remembers about the celebration and have a gift for her .
She went to school very disappointed .
All of them were waiting for her with lots of gifts in a beautifully decorated room .
In the past technology was poor and only a few guys had a smarphone or a computer .
In contrast , today everyone has the latest model of telephone or computeror whatever .
In the last ten years technology have made a big jump and thanks to the Internet we can search everything whenever we want .
In the past was better than now because grandparents or older people could tell you how to do something for the first time , they could give you some useful advice and you could establish a relation with them .
Today everyone knows how everything is easier with technological machine but it 's more sad because you ca n't compare your thoughts with nobody .
For that reason , I think that for me , young people in the past learned a lot from their grandparents and it should be the same today too .
Children are supposed to be the future of their countries , but in Africa , especially in the countries in sub - Sahara Africa , there are many cases of famine - extreme cases , so children spend very difficulties .
Unfortunately this is the sad reality .
Besides that , the lake of food and clean water are responsible for many diseases , which are responsible for a large number of deaths , because there are n't enough sources to cure the populations .
Ear we have some of them : anemia/ anemia ; rickets and malnutrion …
The principals cause for famine in Africa are the ethnic conflicts , which causes warms ; the decrease of fertile grounds and the use of ground only to produce monocultures to export .
In that moment he understood that the mayor will build a big motorway there , next to the river .
Suddenly , he thought that the workers will cut all the trees , and the squirrels will lose their refuges , so he thought that he had to do something immediately .
He wrote a letter to the town hall explaining the situation and asking to stop the construction .
firstly , the primary cause of bushfire is human activities .
lacck sense of civic responsibility is lead to bushfire easily .
For instance , some people discarded cigarette or match which is unattended like barbeque or campfires .
In addition , in many developing country , unemployment they also migrate to forest and set fire to enhance cultivated surface .
Bushfire caused by numerous human activities but almost started from carelessness of people ( Roland as cited in Schauble , 2009 )
Thursday I went with my family to the Strasbourg Cathedral .
It 's big with many activities .

It measures about 30 centimetres .
The lesson is not very well , she was interested in other dogs and she was not listening .

The Alhambra give you this opportunity !
The Alhambra is a group of palaces , gardens and fortresses built by Muslims and occupied by them for over four centuries .
Its true atractiveness , in addition to the decoration which is in the summit of the Andalusian art is also their location which is unique .

If you are lucky enough to visit this wonderful place in summer I recommend you attend the Granada International festival of Music and Dance which is celebrated in Genelalife 's gardens where you can enjoy amazing artists and orquestras in an unrivalled setting .
The graphic information presented in the flow chart illustrates the procedure regarding to the form of bank notes , which can be sorted into 6 main phases .
Initially , the format of the notes should first be designed considering the background color and security issues .
At the same time , skilled machinists are prepared with the use of metal plates in order to set up a fixed mould .
The most significant procedure is called inspection , which means mannual check by particular machines and staffs , and then they are classified into 3 different columns , including good quality sheets , partially damaged sheets , and bad sheets .
In the final stage , the well - performed sheets are packed and distributed to each branches , while the broken ones are safety disposed .
As following desriptions , namely , Design , Preparation of matal plates , Printing , Inspection , Packaging and Distribution and Disposal .
When you need a bank notes , the first thing you should do is to design what aspects of information you want .
Afterwards , you are able to print the sheets of the bank notes(50 bank notes per sheet ) .
The most significant part of the
step is inspectation , where the printed sheets should be
manually inspectors by the officers .
If it is not very well , we can destroyed them securly , however , a few sheets may partially damaged , it does n't matter due to the fact that further seperation will assiste you to get the wrong sheets .
Overview , it is clear that the process of making bank notes begins with Design and ends with Disposal or Distribution .
Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable .
This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances , but on long journeys that will be very uncomfortable .
Travelling with your personal car is much more comfortable .
There is the possibility to set up your seat .
It is your own decision when you get up , because there are no time boundaries .
There is the risk that you would not get the connecting bus and so you are stressed .
In conclusion travelling by car is the easiest and best way . I think that it is not possible to use public transport because there are no buses or trains .
Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport .
here are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans .
As a result , there is the debate whether educational institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed .
In my opinion , I agree with the statement with qualifications by following reasons .
Admittedly , some of the research need to invest many resources that educational institutes can not afford .
Educational institutes should dissuade students .
However , if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study , Educational institutes should support students for their study area .
In addition , students in the course of research maybe create serendipity .
Like Alexander Flrming Alexander , the inventor of the antibiotic , discovered the Penicillin accidentally from the research of the germ .
The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility to possibility .
Therefore , Educational institutes should encourage the student attempting the field which unlikely to succeed .
Remember when in school you learned the three esential things for living ; reproducction , nutrition and interaction .
Well , humans become more and more sedimentary whith the pass of the time and forget about interaction and mevement .
But that 's not my goal of practicing a sport .
Apart of ovbiouslly having fun and socialice , the way you feel after running and burning feels really good .
Personally , I think the best time to come is in the summer .
Because at this time we have a lot of interesting activities like concerts , festivals and so on .
Thanks also for your invitation to join the group .
I will be able to show you and your friends the most interesting places in my area .
When I was in high school , I loved to go to different kinds of activities .
So , having a good time - management have become important in my study .
However , instead of focusing on my study , I paid more attention on rehearsals .
At that moment I felt regretful and frustrated .
From that experience , I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for a successful study .
Therefore , I avoided social activities during the period of exam .
In the same way , Rowh ( 2006 ) points out that it is important to get controlled our self .
In my case , I planned the activities into a proper time because the planners clearly show me the outline in the near future .
Without a doubt , this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility to my own learning .
More significantly , I understand that time - management and planning are crucial in academic life .
Therefore , in the future , I will keep improving those abilities and become a more oragniezed person .
Football : The most incredible sport in the world
It 's a great party and we can have real fun watching a football game even if it 's by television .
If you want to start practicising this sport you have to get fit and run a lot because you got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport .
The aim of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in my town and make recommendations to try encourage the tourists visit the shops .
Some of the information was collected on the shops , and on the web .
According to the investigation , the majority of the shops are in two areas ; Firstly the puerto shopping center , it is allocated in Puerto Marina , and the offers of the shops is majority fashion , coffee shops and pubs .
The other big commercial area is in the city center , with a more variety offer , fashion , bars , supermarkets , local food shops , wine shops etc ....
Alternatively every Friday in the parking next to Tivoli World , there is a street market where you can find every kind of products , local products , food , CDs , DVDs , etc ....
In the light of the results , I feel it would be to our advantage if we make promotions of the city center as a good destiny .
I would recommend the tourist office to encouraged the variety of shops In Puerto Marina
In conclusion , the tourist office should have more adverts of the city center .
I was stunned by her words and become speechless for a moment .
Let me introduce myself , I am Luis from Spain and I work as a civil engineer in a Spanish infraestructure company called Acciona .
I completely agree with you , maybe each word you say .
My company is making redundancies and I am always worried about that .
The point is that I completely focus on my projects soI spend ten hours every day making a tremendous effort with my budgets , trying to increase benefits and I am doing well .
I manage risky projects and eventually I get high revenues .
There are also many historical building in my country .
As you know , my country is made up of different races so there are many different traditional food in my country so you can try different cuisins like banana leaf rice and hainanese chicken rice .
There are many interesting films with valuable plots and famous actors .
Most of them are extremely interesting and worth seeing it .
My favourite actor is Tom Cruise and consequently the best film I have ever seen was " Far away , far away " , where he plays starring role with his ex - wife Nicole Kidman .
I was impressed by the production because of the its valuable plot .
Both , they pass through a lot of difficulties and lived poor life .
The aim of the two personages was to gain a piece of land in America .
They have taken part in a competition with riding horses .
Only faster competitors was given the land .
Most people in Bali rely too much toward their private vehicles hence they totally abandoned public transportation .
They say , " there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient " .
In order to do that , it will cost us huge transformation .
Aside from a great blue - print of a well - organized transportation system , which covers a good 25 to 50 years planning , it also involves local culture .
It is definitely a hard job to do when we want to change People 's culture .
A conscience that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live should arise first .
People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling in a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to have each two to four of them trap in car , in other words one massive transportation measure against twelve or more cars on the same road .
The next is an understanding of what we can do to nature by changing our transportation measure .
The world is constantly changing and technology is advancing fast .
This affects people 's lives considerably , so we can say that in 50 years , the lifestyle will be completely different to what we have today .
We can say 50 years ago we had not thought to have technology currently exists , such as Internet , TV , smartphones , etc .
Also lifestyle was completely different , the industry had not developed technology that now allows you to be more efficient and several people did the work now can be done with a few of them .
So , if technology continues to advance as it has done until now , lifestyle will change too .
Perhaps in 50 years more , we will live in a world where technology makes our life much easier , but at the same time we will be depending on it .
I was very surprised to hear that you want to spend your year off from university in my countrey and I am also extremely flattered .
I would recommend a job as a waitress because you do n't need much experience , and I know you do n't have any , and if you get a job in summer as a result you 'll be at the beach most of the time and you can spend the rest of the year visiting other places .
It 's one of the most beautiful castels , in my opinion , and it represents the most important thing this countrey is known for and that is Dracula .
Another attraction which is a unique one is " the merry cemetery".It is famous for the colourful paintings on the tombstones describing , in a very original way , the prson buried there and their lives .
The first reason is because I already have studied there three years ago and it was a wonderful experience , I met very nice people from all over the world , I improved my English level thanks to very skilled teachers and I really enjoy my stay in Oxford .
The second is a pragmatic reason I have a five year degree and I worked for two years in a medical devices company but now I am unemployed .
In Italy is quite hard to find a job at the moment and I want to try a work experience in the UK but it is necessary to become more confident with my English and that is what I hope to obtain from the IELTS course .
I already know that it could be tough , especially to be far from my family and my girlfriend , but it is something that I feel could be right for me , and for my career .
However as the countries develop and economy grows and life change , people change and standards of life change too ; The interaction factors that lead people to have their own a car is depending and limiting on several factors ; There are also factors such as social and financial conditions that tend to influence people to have their own car instead to travel by public bus / train ; We should also consider the conditions of roads , access and traffic , giving an opportunity to people to opt and travel on own car or public transport ; In some countries there are separate lanes dedicated for public transport which help and facilitate the traffic on condition of heavy traffic ; With traffic technology solution owning a car is always better .
another factor we should consider is the public transport stops on the way to destination which require to plan and catch up public transport to avoid late arrival at your destination .
The subject , no future for public transport is ambiguous as the advantages and disadvantages are both consider on .
First at all , I want to explain the communication with the town ; a lot of people came by train , it is situated at the top of the town , is the best travel to yours because it is the most quickly , but proving that you prefer to come by bus , the bus stop is near the train station .
There are many shops around the town , for example we have one that where children can make teddy bears whereas the parents can see them from the restaurant ; many children said that it was the best place in the world .
Apart from that the town is near the beach , and there we have many restaurants where you can eat while you are watching the waves on the sea .
Our personal recommendation is the " Sir Hotel " is a muddy hotel because many years ago it had been a castle , as well you can sleep in the king bed and every night it has theatre where you can take a part in a play .
I am writing in reply to your advert , which was advertised in the local Newspaper on 31 May 2008 .
As you can see in the attached CV I have experience working with children of different ages .
During three years I babisitted my neighbor 's two daughters .
In addition , the last three years I have been as voluntary in my tennis club , where I have developed different skills to organize activities , sports games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 years old .
Working with children I have learned to be more patient and moreover I am able to motivating them to do the best of themselves .
Also I have gained communicational skills speaking with the children and the families .
Public transport is a useful way to commute from place to place , especially in big cities .
Besides its advantages are cheap and fast there are many disadvantages of taking bus or train such as time , quality of serving , and crowdedness .
it is said that instead of taking public transport , commuters will travel by car because of its convenience . in my opinion ,
public transport will be hardly replaced by travelling by car .
Secondly , The infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars .
It makes the petrol 's price increasing every day .
It has been affecting to the environment like climate change , increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to increasing the demands of using petrol for private cars .
In conclusion , public transport would be the excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to examine the available local transport usage and possible improvement .
The town is covered with more than thirty lines most of them with a duplicate performing the same path on the opposite direction .
Children often use them to go to and back from school , and the older population , with increased problems seeing far away , prefer to use the bus to travel around the city .
Most of them do n't have air conditioning , meaning that in the summer they are tremendously hot , and some have problems with the windows that cause the bus to be extremely cold in winter .
The alternative - Taxis
Taxis are available throughout the city , and can be called by a simple phone message .
Recommendation
There have been rumors of the contruction of a Metro in our town .
That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation , since they are fast , are n't affected by traffic , and they are generally cheaper ( since they rely on electricity ) .
I 'll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting for them for sure .
First of all , if they are staying in České Budějovice , they can spend there at least three days with sightseeing .
Anyway they must visit our main square with many historical buildings .
There is a huge number of shops in the centre so what about doing shopping ? Sightseeing in this town is for tourists very convenient because they can reach everything on foot .
If the weather is nice , they could definitely take a trip to Kleť .
It 's the biggest hill where you can go on the lookout tower and it 's not far from České Budějovice .
There is an interesting observatory too and what 's more the best restaurant I have ever been in .
They must definitely order the best soup in the world .
There 's a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle placed on the big rock .
I hope your friends'll be satisfied with my tips .
If you want to know more about the destination , just write me a message or give me a call .
First of all , vehicles designed to carry large number of people can not be unnecessary in big cities .
Modern megapolises are suffering from surplus of automobiles .
It happens not only because of environmental aspect , but mental as well .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of average person , who spends most of the time in downtown , to replace a car for a bus or an underground .
Whatever type of journey you took , you would be more likely to prefer using train or plane , because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical tension .
Overall , there are a number of causes to disagree with the suggestion , that individual transport is getting more and more popular in comparison with public .
The only thing , that definitely should be changed in the future , is an approach to usage of cars powered by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Concert Hall , it can be found a Japanese restaurant named " Ichiban " , opened a few years ago , it 's not well known yet , but this does n't prevent that quickly gets busy at the weekends at lunch time .
Although sometime it might be rather noisy , because of the people gathered there , I find its decor quite attractive and , as usual in this kind of restaurants , relaxing .
I have to mention the soups , especially the seafood soup .
It deserves to be mentioned the great variety of rice and noodles - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All dishes are served with a careful presentation , are highly creative and very attractive to the eye .
A negative point of the restaurant , in my view , is the lack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusion , I recommend visiting " Ichiban Restaurant " , you 'll have the chance of enjoying a delicious meal in a certainly agreeable atmosphere .
Reflective Writing
I have done to take responsibility for my own learning .
Independent learning has become an indispensable part of finishing tertiary - level education successfully .
However , traditional teaching method , force - feed the students , has made me overly dependent on teachers in China , which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately .
Compared with EAP course , it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently , especially for academic writing .
Firstly , it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time , because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers supervision , so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently .
By this trend , I have became a procrastinator finally , which enabled me to face the problems of time management .
In this sense , the term , " time management " means the ability of controlling time on prioritizing tasks , and planning effective scheduling of time to balance study and work , and keeping concentration on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .
Rowh ( 2006 ) states you will stay up late for accomplishing assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance .
Based on examining my actual experience and research , I noticed that a gap , unsuccessful time management in independent learning is the root cause of these problems .
Then I made a few conscious changes that I began to manage duration for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks , as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life .
As an independent learner , it is my sole responsibility to autonomic learning , which is a very important factor in future passing EAP1 successfully , as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia .
The most historical place in Spain , it is the city of Cáceres .
Therefore it is a multicultural and multirracial society .
As well as the historical city , it is short and narrows streets .
The center of the historical city is the Big Square , there are mixed Arabs and Romas buildings , and two cathedrals .
In the third place , this year Cáceres is the capital of the gastronomy in Spain .
My favourite restaurant is Chinnesse .
Some people do n't like this food , but in this restaurant you can eat other types of food , for example Spanish food and Mexican food .
The atmosphere in this restaurant is very good and very clean .
This restaurant is very big , we would n't have a problem .
This restaurant is buffet , we paid 15€/person and we can eat and drink all that you want .
From my point of view , this restaurant have one drawback , the waiters and waitress do n't go on the table , you should go to your food and drink .
I love this restaurant , the food is very delicious .
In this set of materials , the listening passage discusses advantages of alcohol and how they contribute to improve health , and personality and the reading contradict this by revealing down side of it .
In the listening passage , the professor discusses the advantages of alcohol and how it helps to reduce heart attacks and strokes by 40 percent , due to the fact that it reduce blood clot , and slowing the deterioration of brain function .
In addition , moderate drinking helps to keep healthy movement , because some researches has shown that people who drink moderately have less proportion of body fat , because alcohol speed up metabolism which makes calories burn quickly .
Moreover , it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non - drinker , and they are more social , popular and they are likely to be married .
On the other hand , the reading contrast this by mentioning disadvantages of alcohol .
Furthermore studies have shown that alcohol induce appetite which makes people consume more than they need .
For example researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol .
Second , alcohol can cause some serious health issues , especially cirrhosis of the liver , heart failure , brain damage and variety of cancers .
Third , alcohol takers tend to aggression and violence .
With the development of globalization , there are varieties of impacts for different aspects of daily life .
People also have a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages .
This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China by some examples .
Firstly , there is a benefit of globalization that people can buy some special products from various countries on the internet instead of buying in the production site .
So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses .
In recent years , there are some different size of logistic companies have been hold , and different modes of transportation has developed rapidly .
For example , in the past the main transportations were ships , trains and trucks , so people had to wait long time for their parcels and letters .
However , now the increasing number of consumers and logistic companies has chosen airplanes which can save much time to transport their parcels .
Secondly , there is still a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in China .
The reason is that the development of globalization has let our country improve its economy .
However , because of the increasing standard of living , a growing number of people have chosen to travel which has brought a heavy pressure of transportation .
So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people , the government and experts have to think some different ways to solve this problem .
For example , some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centre .
In conclusion , globalization on the transportation has brought both positive and negative effect to Chinese people .
So in my opinion , people need to find right ways to let globalization push the standard of our living whereas discussing its advantages and disadvantages .
Bra really takes care of the environment .
If you visit it you will probably appreciate all the innovations applied to save our environment .
These engines use bio fuels so the environment is not affected .
I think if we want to protect our environment starting from the little things .
You should speak accurately and also fluent .
The last year I was in Poland and I could see how was important to speak English , with this idiom you can communicate with other people , no just English people if not with around the world .
When I was a child I did n't understand why I needed to learn English but now I can see how important it is , for this reason I 'm motivated to learn .
On the other hand I love travelling and in case that you know several language all will be easier .
You could understand the guide , the sign ...
It could be nice and give you more opportunity to do whatever you want and do n't lose heart at the beginning could be difficult but bit by bit you will see your progress .
With strong patriotism , Vietnameses nowadays are trying to develop the nation , to get in the globalization progress .
Each nation has their own historical places , Vietnam is not an outcast , we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand throughout about the past .
Those places will help them to take a close look about the root of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture , custom and tradition .
We can mention many places such as Sword Lake , Hỏa Lò prison , Temple of Literature ...
It is Temple of Literature , the first university of the nation .
Temple of Literature was built in 1070 under the Ly 's dynasty .
In spite of wars and the destruction of time , Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape until now .
We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time .
As many other Asian country , in the past , we were greatly influenced by the ideology system of Confucius , a philosopher from China .
He built up a system which based on 4 essential relationships in the society .
Otherwise , they learned mostly about literature , poetry .
We can briefly describe the overall structure of Temper of Literature which consists of six parts .
Firstly , there were 3 main gates , the center one only for the king , the left side one was for administrators , the right site one was for military .
Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside .
One remarkable , featured point about Temple of Literature is the people who passed 4 rounds of examination , then gained position titles would be graved their names on the stone grave carried on stone turtles .
Right at the moment entering , you can see them from two sides of the courtyards .
Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now .
Before the university entrance examinations , many students come here and wish for their luck .
Temple or Literature ( or Imperial Academy ) can be seen as the most featured historical place in Vietnam .
I do a lot of sports for example : cycling , karting , football and basketball but my favourite sport is swimming because I have done this sport since 1995 with my grandfather .
Actually , this sport is very healthy , so some doctors are recomending this type of sport .
If you begin to practise this sport , you should wear goods snorkeling glasses and you should warm up five minutes before you get into the pool .
Besides , you can have could shower after and before that you do swimming , this is good because your body temperature is hotter than the water of the pool and if you get into the pool very fast you can have a problem with your body temperature .
In Japan , there are many interesting places to visit .

To climb to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters .
However , numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful view such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt .
This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope , so people who are proud of strong body try this marathon .
Furthermore , around Mt .
Fuji has beautiful scenery , it is popular and it offers exciting activities for people .
Fuji will continue to give wonderful impression to many people forever .
The next time it happened to me such a thing I felt no wind but this particular stink .
It was as if somebody was cooking some cauliflower .
At that time I was unemployed so I was n't able to move house and as I was n't afraid of it I had to put up with those strange events .
These are quite interesting and have helped me to know deeper children 's pleasures .
I have learnt a lot of activities which let them have fun at the same time they get in touch with nature .

In conclusion , I would say that our village is an example for environmentally conscious city .
I hope this report informed you fully on the environmental situation in our villge .

Report : How Budapest takes care of its environment ?
In connection with the first issue , Budapest completes the task very well .
In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely .
So , almost everybody , who lives in Budapest , has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection .
In that area Budapest accomplishes very awful .
However , it would n't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often - it 's just a matter of organisation .
Ecological situation is seriously bad not only in my city but in my country in general .
All the rubbish is taken to the huge dump a few kilometres off the city .
We keep on generating rubbish and using harmful things .
Still we use plastic bags and bottles , phosphate detergents , throw batteries away .
Unfortunately we do n't separate rubbish .

Yours faithfully ,
The fact that " shopping is not always enjoyable " might be considered an universal truth .
Although it is true that shopping might not be a very interesting topic , it must be stated that it is necessary .
There are many different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furniture , instruments , etc .
Groceries and furniture , as well as instruments , follow the same pattern .
It all depends on the type of person buying it , their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now .
In last place , it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are buying ( i.e. the room , the organization , the prices , the distance , etc ) and the unknown people who are in it which may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable .
In conclusion , shopping might be both : enjoyable or not .
Owning a motorbike has advantages .
One very important positive aspect is that , thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs , the keeping of a motorbike is considerably economical .
In addition , as it is smaller than a car , parking becomes much less complicated .
On the other hand , motorbikes do also have drawbacks .
For example , the lack of safety , which raises the probabilities of getting hurt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage this kind of vehicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike consequently not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable owning one .
In conclusion , owning a motorbike can be useful or useless depending on the lifestyle you have , your economic status , and the number of people you need to travel with .
If you must come a long way , then you 'll probably opt for travelling by plane ...
It 's a good idea , but ... I 've got an aviophobia !
But this mode of transport is n't so comfortable , esspecialy when we must travel onshore , then it 's complicated because travelling by boat is allowed only by the sea or any sizeable river , which courses are usually placed less conveniently than roads or even railway tracks .
For me it has some very important advantages , like that you do n't stand in traffics , reductions for students , low risk of accidents , potentiality of sleeping , eventuality of travelling with bike or other big luggage .
Most railway lines are quite spruce and for me , travelling by train is pleasure !
In my opinion , everything depending on our preferences , but train is general - purpose means of transport , I recommend it !
At first , I 'm not interested in it , since I did n't any idea how to play , as I had only played basketball and volleyball , however , I did n't enjoy these two at all .
Moreover , I also did n't like to do exercise which was tired and my strength was extremely weak that every time when measure 800 kilometers I always ranked the last three .
The funniest thing to me was that I thought I were a kid who studied kindergarten for the way he taught .
When hitting ball back successfully , he would say ' ' good , keep going or you did it '' .
Hitting ball again and again , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , which not only includes running but also concentrating .
I am writing to apply for a chance to work at weekends in your cafe as advertised .
In addition , having been equipped with my rather good English - speaking skills and cross - cultural communication skills obtained during the working time as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company , I feel very confident and amicable while dealing with customers .
Another reason I apply for this job is that it will be really a good chance for me to help partly increase my income at this time and improve my family 's living conditions .
Your consideration and acceptance of my application will be much appreciated .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admit that young people has more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advance that older people tend to not understand well .
Also , because of the fact that the urbanization have not helped most countries to adapt the cities into places more accessible to senior people .
The new technologies are something that we can not love without anymore .
But , unfortunately , the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master , especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university ( older people ) .
I am one of the fortunate people who was born on the technological era , which means that I have had access to computers , gps and mobiles , for example , since I was a little child .
The technological equipment help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them .
On the other hand , to someone who did not have these when they were more young and active , such as grandmothers and grandfathers , the new instruments are just things that they can not use nor understand .
The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home , on the street , in a museum , etc .
Another transformation , which is corollary from the advances that humanity have been seeing lately , is the modification in the cities and our living habits .
Since last century , the world population is more present in the bigger cities , which , as a result , have been increasing in size and in problems .
The urbanization implemented by government across the decades in the cities are sometimes not suitable for all public .
For instance , older people or the ones with disabilities have great difficult to use the metro system because of the number of stairs .
My mother is a perfect study of case for me because she can not well the transportation system in Paris or New York without been lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting .
Sometimes , the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement around on big cities compels the older population to stay at home .
In this case , they do not have the possibility to go out and enjoy the benefits that cities may bring to their lives .
Therefore , the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who is capable of understanding how to manage the modern instruments and use all kinds of transportation .
On the other hand , for the older people , the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle for them to enjoy all that there are out there .
Introduction
The aim of this report is to give my opinion about the facilities and services the Active Leisure Clubs .
Facilities
In general the facilities are well preserved but the majority of the users think that the installation should have an improvement in the baskteball and tennis courts maybe the bathroom should be remodelled .
Advantages
The workers are very kind and simpathetic and enjoy teaching .
Desadvantages
The activities are expensive .
I believe that it would be a good idea to fall in the cost of some activities .
Recommendations
It 's recommend improving the facilities , falling in the price and opening every day until 10.00 p.m.
Since car was invented , we have been seeing a large increase of cars ' production and of its use .
However , as time went by , improvement has been made in public transport .
Nowadays , they got modern and comfortable and they are n't as late as they used to .
Travelling by car might be more pleasant but it can also be costly , for fuel can be very expensive depending on the current economy .
With regards to traffic , travelling by public transport can also be quicker , as there is a bus lane and no traffic for tube .
However , over the past years , people have been travelling mostly by car which seems to have led to higher levels of air pollution .
This is undoubtedly an important environmental issue that should definitely have our attention .
Celebrities and their life take intrinsic place in lifes of contemporary people .
The process of becoming this fact real and common in our society began about 100 years ago and what is really absorbing , nearly 95 percent of advanced society can not imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all .
Probably if you hear about heroic attitude you will be able to do without doubts something magnificent as well .
In this way I think that is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous .
There are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them - it is called low self - assessment .
Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities ' private life and professional career you have to remember that the media distorts reality .
Of course you can look up to the celebrities but you have to be aware of the consequences .
INTRODUCTION
The school provides lots of different activities for those who are interested in music , drawing , dance and theatre .
The atmosphere at school is very creative .
During the whole school year a great number of exhibitions , concerts and performances are given by pupils themselves and by invited musicians and artists as well .
Children have to take entrance examination .
The other thing is that students are not able to refuse attending some classes they do not like because those are considered to be a part of an educational standard for the particular artistic area .
CONCLUSION
It is definitely worthwhile to study there , although it is advised to let students choose the activities they prefer .
phenomenon of homeless people became a serious problem and many countries can not solve this problem .
The number of these people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world .
One of the major reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Arab countries like Syria , Libya and Yemen .
In addition , financial crisis , almost of the companies has a financial problem so the ideal solution for them is downsizing .
Furthermore , children street is a result of families troubles .
Cases of divorce are increasing and many children escape and prefer to live in the street instead of home full of problems .
To conclude , the world has a complicated issue , so The governments and the charitable organization must take a quick decision and put a real solution to solve this problem .
After the second false start you 'd be disqualified and then you can kiss victory goodbye , - that 's how I mentally tune myself , - Take it easy !
I look around tribunes : there are n't so many people despite the fact that today an Australian Hurdle Champion of the season will be defined .
Although whom am I deceiving ... - I 'm thinking and nervously stretching out stiff neck .
Everyone 's nervous except for Jerome Tanny , last years champion famous for his threatening prestart grin , that we all call " Shark 's Smile " .
That 's strange but before the start my thoughts as if an old steam locomotive are going to those depths of memory which really hard to get to in ordinary life .
Owing to the increase of population , human beings use more land to build houses , which leads to the decline of forest rates .
The floods , droughts , and famines , all of these making great effects to human and animals , for instance , the loss of properity , the missing of people , which is not good for the development of human beings .
For one thing , animals do not have homes , so some of them become endangered species , worse still , dying out .
I think that efforts must be taken quickly to protect our homes by goverments .
Firstly , the population should be controlled , if human still increase rapidly , there is no more room for human .
Secondly , governments should teach their people how to protect the environment , such as destroying the farmland too much is a bad choice .
Thirdly , reserves should be put up to provide room for animals , and we can help the endangered animals in this way .
Finally , governments should ues the space properly , like making plans before set up building , estimating the effects to human and animals .
Faithfully yours .
Personal experiences
This is a question that I struggle to answer , but I have to claim the most important person in my life was and is my marvellous father .
He is always on my mind even though he is not physically .
This should be enough to feel you happy like a comfortable blanket does .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty sure that you do n't need much money to be happy .
The urban myth that statues could move makes the contemporary people frightened .
And the Doctor Who , Sci - Fi TV series of BBC , exteriorized this terror from the Weeping Angels .
After Blink was broadcasted , it raised common fears about statues to tele - viewers in Britain and over the world .
According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine , Radio Times , the Weeping Angels were picked as the most scariest villain of the Doctor who twice by about half of respondents .
These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of Doctor , like the Daleks exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe or the Cybermen transforming all living things into cyborg .
Then , what makes the Weeping Angels frightening ?
Uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originated from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar .
This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non - living as life - likeness .
In Blink , Weeping angels ' uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation .
They look unnatural , in spite of their similar appearances with human .
And expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre , due to the deficiency of pupil .
Also , their facial expressions are almost flat as dead pans .
But when it comes to their interior factor , the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning unconscious physiological reaction into conscious one .
After the Doctor 's warning , they may not turn our back , look away , and blink as we are protagonists of the episode .
In several scenes , Weeping Angels , the lonely assassins , never shift their positions and postures , even though protagonists and supporting players blink , look away or turn their backs .
The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously .
To change the pose of the horrific statues technically , directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally , for a moment .
At last , directors fade out the scenes flicking out the light bulb in basement for maximizing the threat of Weeping Angels !
At last , Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar .
For instance , the angels camouflage themselves as monument of tomb in grave yards , carvings of the cathedral on the streets , and ornamental carvings in front of an antique police office .
Consequently , it makes audience unfamiliar with their circumstances .
Then tele - viewers are terrified at the basis of their livelihoods and people grab up blankets tight !
She began to study at the prestigious University .
That was a great responsibility for her , as well as prestige .
Anna feared , that she would have difficulties to cope up with the expectations .
However , aquaintances of her , the students at the University , comforted her .
Her grandfather , first doctor in the family , was her authority .
From now on , Anna would have to direct her attention to making grandfather proud of her degrees .
Surprisingly when you are practicing this sport you improve your velocity and coordination too , so it could be an interesting point to taking up if you are not involved in it .
Personally what I can say is that practicing this sports make me feel strongly lively and not only when I am playing it , it also happens when I am watching it especially during the world cup .
I am encouraging to those people who do not like practicing sport that it the best way to maintain your own health
Potential issues such as rule violation and conflicts may be arose because the foreigners may not understand the rules .
Japanese , as pointed out by Trompenaars ( cited in Morrison , 2006 ) , is highly influenced by the values of universalism .
Similarly , the high level of uncertainly avoidance and the low level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient and self - disciplined .
Also , Japanese think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment .
As a result in Australia , conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture ( Hofstede 1994 ) , people may usually emphasize in their self - satisfaction and think of themselves first instead of the public .
They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users .
Consequently , the bathing pool may face the hygienic problems , such as someone does not wash before bathing , and scrambling issues .
In order to achieve cost efficiency , the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered .
A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration .
Rental cost is also a limitation as it is relatively higher in Australia .
I am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit while you 're in Poland .
It is a majestical castle conviniently located on the river .
It 's a huge breath - taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens .
The place is fascinating , because it is loaded with history and nice to spend a day and relax in royal gardens .
The Wawel Royal Castle is an obligatory place to see , while visiting Poland .
It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners are coming to Poland just to see the Cracow city and among other things the Wawel Castle .
I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit , because it is beautiful , full of other worth - seeing monuments , cute small cafes , various choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside .
I hope you will describe your impressions about the city after visiting it .
Yours faithfully
Evidences show that many natural system have been affected by climate changes , particularly by temperature raises .
I think it is time we start taking environmentally friendly attitudes to help the planet .
First of all , as dioxides and carbons gases have been increasing ozone pollution worldwide in big cities , awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative usages of transportation .
Also , the adoption of bicycles and walking , for instance , seems to be a responsible attitude to the planet .
In addition , water pollution is , as well , a global problem , as so many industries dump a large amount of waste into rivers and lakes and also human waste and rubbish end up in the water .
A solution could be done by improving recycling , waste disposal and even , by cleaning up shorelines .
Moreover , life may not be possible for the future generations , unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy , like green , to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency avoiding side effects to the planet .
To conclude , I firmly believe that we can reduce damages and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes , as the use of green and clean energy sources .
During the lesson I have been very impressed by Socrative ( www.socrative.com ) , therefore I decided to devise a quiz about HTML and CSS .
At the end of the test , the teacher shows the results ( correct answers percentage for each student ) .
The teacher ask the students to comment on the results and the activity , and discuss the opportunity to repeat the activity .
This review is to tell you about the Astoux restaurant , which is situated in the heart of Cannes on the seashore .
All this can be accompanied by different selections of white wines .
All the products are fresh and the chef takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients .
In addition to it the service well accompanies the high quality of the cooking .
Despite the high price of the food , I had a pleasant dining experience .
This is the reason why I highly recommend going to the Astoux restaurant .
His brother Paul had been searching something in his bedroom and it seemed to be a completely mess .
Suddenly , Michael saw his brother crying and he asked him " where is my playstation ? ? " . said Paul inconsolably and he run to the kitchen .
When both of them started to search clues around the house they did n't found out anything interesting , but after a while , they had seen several pawprints and in that moment Michael remembered a fact : He had been forgotten his dog inside the house but the puppy had disappeared !
Obviously he knew their dog Spooky had been in Paul 's bedroom taken his playstation .
Surprisingly Spooky turned up and escaped with some keys in his mouth but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
First of all , they are supposed to be desighed with great care and considerations , such as the background colour , artwork and security issues , all of which are crucial for notes .
Secondly , skilled machinists will make preparations for metal plates that are one of the most vital ways to ensure the quality of bank notes .
Next , it will come to the most improtant step , inspection .
If they are good quality sheets or partially damaged , but still in good condition , they will be packaged and dispatched .
I hope the charity event you 've organised with your school was successful .
I know how much you care about animals and love them , especially dogs .
We decided to organize a play and donate the money we earn to a Dog Foundation .
We tried to involve many students as possible since we needed actors , costume designers and technicians .
The event was very successful as we earned € 2,000 in just a day .
Just next to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given that there would have additional drawers under the bed to keep some clothes , a large wardrobe might not be needed .
On the other hand , aside from my bedroom , I would love to have my own reading nook , where to read peacefully .
So , if my mental estimates are correct , there should still be enough space available to also place a little armchair , where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my chair desk , not very far from the window .
As far as television is concerned , well , being honest , I haven't been watching much TV for years .
Nevertheless , it 's something dispensable for me and , for this reason , I think I could get by without having one .
Now that I have already finished describing the arrangement of my hypothetical bedroom , I am going to talk about its lighting .
Firstly , I would only use energy - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .
Regarding the desk is just beside the bed , the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head ; that way , placing another lamp in the furniture would be unnecessary .
Finally , concerning the bedroom colours , I believe the walls should be painted of a light colour , like white , beige or , maybe a light green . The ceiling could be the same colours as the walls or , perhaps , a darker hue than they .
Lastly , I would like that my curtains were red , given that is my favourite colour ; however , I would use maroon , which is quite similar , for the curtains because it is more sober and , consequently , more suitable for my room .
My son is 13 years old and we understand each other very well .
He does not conceal anything from me as I try to understand what he really needs and support him .
We speak about everything and respect each other .
I completely disagree with the statement " there is no future for public transport " .
I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities convenient to everyone .
Despite private car is more convenient to its owner then public transport , it is not in use the majority of time and that means wasting city space for parking while it could be used as a public space .
At the same time it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously .
For instance network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of personal car and work - load of public transportation .
Nowadays all the car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot - driven car that in future would resolve the issue of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week .
Unfortunately the main method is to make private cars if not a luxury then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation .
And underground , light tram system are still more ecological and fast .
The aim of this report is to describe the training course that I was attending last month , for a week and the activities in which I was involved during this period of time .
It turned up to be a disadvantage for me , given that I am interested in the theory .
I managed to find out very few things about the theory , due to the large number of participants .
I realised there is no time to think too much when it comes to practice , because you have to act quickly and to prove yourself and the others that you use your knowledge in order to accomplish a certain task .
The efficiency is one of the most important things in terms of time management .
I would strongly recommend this training course on time management , considering is useful not just to gain some theory aspects for those who want to be more organised , but also if you want to really manage in a daily situation .
As a result of useful activities putting theory into practice , you will have a better chance to achieve your goal .
You may thought that I met them or I got an autograph but I must disappoint you .
But I love this experience , I was really enjoying it .
It 's unforgettable experience and it gave me a lot .
Yours faithfully
This picture illustrates the process of producing cash .
The first step is to design the looking of the bank notes and then prepare skilled machinists for metal plates .
The next step is the most important and it involes inspection , which means good and bad sheets are separated during this process .
Those good quality sheets are cut into individual notes and dispatched after packing and those bad sheets and notes are destroyed out of secutity aspect in the very last process .
Overall , the whole process of making bank notes has six steps and they are design , metal plates ' preparation , printing , inspection , dividing sheets into three groups and distribution or disposal .
Green house gases have put a red light warning on the planet , and countries around the world are starting to realize the importance of reducing these gases .
Big cities are crowd with vehicles and as result levels of pollution are dangerously increasing .
This is developing diseases and alergies that are affecting the citicens .
Plans and programmes are being developed to reduce the number of cars driving throuhgt the cities .
Some of these oave the same destinations .
From the Metro system , the bus , the train , and the high speed rail , all these public transportation become more and more popular .
Lots of people really enjoy the moment when taking public transportation because they are more convenient , cost less and more eco - friendly .
In my opinion , taking public transport is more convenient .
We do n't have to drive by ourselves , and we do n't have to think which way we should go to reach the destination .
Additionally , taking public transport cost less .
Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time which leads to greenhouse effect and the rise of the average sea level .
Taking public transport can effeciently reduce the emmission of carbon dioxides and will help the earth to recover from those disorders .
The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statemant that the public transport ha no future because travelling by car is more convenient .
Can you imagine a transportation which never appears ?
Since a century , many transports have been invented , therefore our lives become convenient .
What transportation do we need and should be invented now is hard to think , because no place we could n't go .
For example , the speed of transportation can become faster , using green energy sources , improved the capacity of the public transportions and so on .
With the advance of technology , a lot of problems have come to pass , the natural resources are becoming in storted , and the air pollution is getting worse .
This is harmful to everything in the world .
So , we have to consider how to improve theses problems for our next generation .
Learning of another language is very useful these days , because of globalization and also cooperation between countries .
It is importatnt when we work or study in international area .
People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their life .
They can have better position , work for foreign company , communicate with foreign companies etc .
It can be the benefit at school as well , because if you need some information for some project , you can look at foreign literature too .
Also you can be part of travelling and working experience which can offer to you your school .
If you want to try this option , you need to have a very good level of particular language .
Another very important benefit of learning new language is that you can travel you will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them .
It helps you to ask people on many important information which you need during your journey .
For example , which way you should go , where is good restaurant , how to travel in a country , how to solve your problems , where is the cheapest accommodation and much more .
Thanks of learning another language you can have also friends from all the world and you can better understand the culture of new country .
I think that there is not many disandvantages of learning another language .
One of them can be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them .
It can be really interrupting if it still continues .
In conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will be always important for today 's people and new generation too and in addition it will increase need to communicate in another language .
I am writing to you in reference to the First Certificate exam .
I found a bilingual Spaniard ( with several international certificates and now he 's teaching in a bilingual school in Madrid ) .
Also , I found some books on the internet with Crambridge 's exams .
With the process of the globalization , people are eager to know the other country than ever .
In the past , most people consider the museum as the best way to get along with the unfamiliar land .
First , as the technology developed , we may find visiting museum is far from convenient .
People using new technique has gradually constitued the majority .
It leads to an increasing number of people choose to using the online museum .
On the other hand , needless to say , the limitation of museum is that it can only store some pictures and paintings , it is far from an enjoyable visiting when you can only see the picture 2 meters away and no touch .
Admittedly , the museum has its owm merits;it is easy to find on the map and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country .
A documentary , a book about the culture is cheap and easy.we can consider it a ecomomical method .
Visiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw about a country , but not a best way anymore .
If you decide to find some information about a totally unknowed land , the museum is not a wise option .
But do n't panic , let 's think rationally .
Technology will control our homes .
With technology we will clean our house , technology will protect us , with technology we will spend our free time .
In every room we will have a big screen , where we 'll be able to see , where are our children and if everything 's ok .
Do we need friends or family members if technology can take care of us ?
Machines can tell us lots of imporatant information .
I really appreciate it if you could give me a piece of advice about what course should I take .
I 'd like you to take into account the following requirements .
Secondly , I 'd like the college to be located not too far from accommodation if possible . I would n't like to spend too much time on public transport every day .
As far as accommodation is concern I 'd like bed and breakfast included in the price .
Summer camping is all about providing fun activity in a safe environment .
In my opinion , to be a suitable person for the summer camp job you should have qualifications to create fun activities and to keep kids safe .
Creating fun activities is an important role of the summer camp workers .
As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7 - 10 years , I have the ability to create and perform fun activities .
In the morning program , the kids have enjoyed playing football , soccer ball , basketball and water ball .
The program has included many competitive activities that full of fun and cheerful .
In the afternoon , the kids have enjoyed a multi - dance program that has different international dances .
Safety is a core component in the summer camps ' activities .
while designing fun activities , the camp workers have to take in concerns the safety level for these activities , the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed .
As a retired nurse , I have a high sense of safety and harm prevention .
In addition , I have the experience in providing the basic , the advanced life support , and the airway protection .
While these situations are rare , they need an effective fast intervention to save kids ' lives .
In conclusion , I think providing fun in safe environment is the main component in summer camp that each family is looking for . as a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun , to provide safe activities and the most important is my ability to intervene in the emergency situations
Foster Hollywood is an American restaurant in the center of Caceres .
The interior is spectacular because it is decorated as the film of Hollywood .
The tables and the chairs are very beautiful because they are as in the American films but they are very inconfortable .
The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed but always it is crowded .
I love this restaurant because the food is really good is the tastiest food that I have eaten .
My favourites dishes are the " Nachos " and " Catarapi " , the second is a dish of spicy pasta , it is spectacular .
I think this restaurant would be suitable for us because it is a great place for all , it is in the center and the most important her food is really tasty .
We can get a lot of up to date information around the world through watching television .
There are many channels on TV , not only entertainment but also technology , health , environment , weather forecast and news channel , etc .
Discovery channel is the knowledge bank and animal planet is very interesting .
Moreover , nowadays many education channels are developing to help the students .
Mathematics , English and environmental knowledge Quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children .
We can also improve our moral attitude by watching the discussion and speech by the outstanding leaders .
So , I think advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the watching person .
So , we need to try to get equal balance between entertainment and education from TV .
I have seen your advertisement on the Internet and I am really interested in it .
Because of this , I have learnt many activities and games that I could use in your summer camp .
I always work with many children , so I have experience managing and organising groups .
About my personal characteristics , I am friendly and self - confident but I have another quality that children loves : I am really creative , I can make costumes with not many materials so they will enjoy a lot dressing them up .
I usually play sports like tennis or running but specially I am interested in living adventures , and I would like we could live this one together .
I enclose my CV to complete information .
Yours faithfully

By the way , my boyfriend will finish PhD program this summer :-) , and then he needs to do compulsory military service begin 7th August for one year .
Fortunately , he is assigned to substitute services , so he does n't to enter real army .
We think that will be convenient for him to apply the Postdoctor position during the period of military service .
His ideal plan is he will try to apply the Postdoctor position this fall or winter , and then he can work abroad after finishing the military service ( August 2015 ) .
To take public transport or not that is a question . Travelling by car is convenient , however , it
ignores the car congestion problems and the pollution for the CO2 .
preference .
Public transport reduce the car congestion problems .
work or travelling by car .
For example , taking the train form Taipei , the city in Taiwan , to Taoyuan in the newyear just costs half an hours in contrast nearly two hours awing to the car congestion in the highway .
In terms of protecting environment , taking the public transport may cut down the carbon emmittion .
Because there are nearly 70 billions people in the world if everyone travelling by car even the half , the pollution will be the burden to the world .
It is the urgent timing to avoid greenhouse problem that people should think how to decrease the carbon emmition .
To be brief , taking the public transport is not only avoid congestion problems to save the time but benefit our mother nature future .
Admittedly , travelling by the car has its merits such as more convenient to everywhere we want , can enjoy the time with family in car .
Nevertheless , it cost a lot of problems and pollution .
He attended in a local motorcycle race and won the 5000 $ cash prize .
Three consecutive years he attended in the local race but at most he could get the second rank .
Tom asked him about the insurance and the old man said the insurance only pays 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease .
He thought I should perform a show to jump over the several wrecked cars but it was too risky because he had not any experience in this kind of show .
We need advertising and to find a suitable place for show until 3 pm .
A short - term and enticing Russian loans are very attractive for Serbian politicians who are struggling with the financial difficulties .
As an Orthodox and Slavic country which is yet to become a member of the EU and does not want to become member of NATO , in a difficult economic situation with public exposed to strong propaganda , Serbia , is an easy target of Russia 's soft power .
People were changing during ages and in the same time they were building astonishment history .
They were thinking how the world would look like and with that thought civilization was created .
Our curiosity is not restraining .
Many buildings like skycarpers are suggesting living in flats which exist above the ground and it is not extraordinary , but how about whole cites prospering under the water with it own source of light which could replace the Sun .
Despite the fact that visual aspect is the most important thing to most people in my opinion in this case everything was said and no new forms could be created .
The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters , for instance , the Cyclone Tracy in Darwin , Australia ; the Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America etc .
It concisely depicts the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters .
The book is also very readable , not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply gives us an overview of handling natural disasters , so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon .
The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is that the people who live along the Yellow River , how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and make a better solution .
At the beginning , the Yellow River was always unleashing terrible floods that swept through towns , villages and farmland .
After day of heavy rain , the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed can not withstand the water when it out of its limitation .
The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas .Fortunately , the flood also makes the plains fertile and feed millions of people .
While I was flip - flopping through the pages , I let my imagination run wild with the story .
Even though the mother of nature is complicated sometimes , she would give us a light of hope .
People will continue suffering the dangerous floods and there is no end after many years unless the government take an effective action to stop flooding .
It is arduous for people living in devastating surroundings .
The Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization .
Reading this book is like unwrapping a present which is packed in layers of sheets .
My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people in the Yellow River .
Meanwhile , a surge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with lots of thought - provoking words .
That 's all for my presentation today .
I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity .
The World Cup , Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations .
During that time , the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship .
The fans , supporters shout , they even cry together .
The sports game events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between the nations .
On the other hand , some sports matches can make international relations worse .
The patriotic emotions explode in unaggressive way .
For example , during the semi - final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia team , the players played quite violent , the supporters of the two teams were very tense .
Even after the end of the match assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams .
I think that international sporting occasions can be one of the best ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely .
However , I believe that games can not be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations .

People 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
First of all we can define ourselves " slaves of the technology " because now we all have a telephone that have lots of functions and that turn us away from real life .
In this way everyone is the perfect copy of someone else and the originality or a creative mind is considered as something bad .
Yes it will and I hope that we will improve our thought and we will have the cosciousness that we are not " supreme " and that we will never have the right of imposing us in the world .
Taking acceptance the strength of music , it is hard to imagine human life without it . "
To my mind , beautifulness of music does not depend on its sorts .
For example , there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which organized in many countries .
People almost from all over the world attends to participate in it .
Being the core of culture of a country , it influences on national fame .
For instance , in our country music consists of two main parts : Mougam and Folk music , which have been getting popularity from all regions in the world since it was sprung .
However , modern music is not always acceptable for different people .
To take account that it has been improving day by day , we can meet the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music almost in every country .
Most of the countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music .
Inasmuch as this process makes peoples close to each other encouraging them to corporate and befriend .
To sum up , it is necessary to point out that there is not any negativeness or perfectness of national or modern music at all .
It is essential to treasure music as one of the significant kinds of art .
She was always involved with school trips connected with political places like court or government .
One a day she decided to pass away all of this thing and get started something completely different .
Unfashionable clothes turned into fashionable dresses .
I think that Spain is an incredible country since it has all kinds of landscapes : mountains , beaches , lakes , and you can enjoy adventure activivities , for example , trekking routes , climbing , bungee , surf ... You can make different tourism depending on the city where you want to go .
First of all , I would like to talk about Extremadura .
Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has a good weather all year .
However , I recommend travelling to Extremadura in Spring or Autumm because in summer it is too hot .
In Extremadura you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfragüe Nacional Park or Tajo - International Natural Park .
Moreover , you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones ( I recommend you this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it ) or small natural lakes on the North of Extremadura .
Also , Extremadura has many towns and cities with an impressive ancient neighbourhood , for instance , Cáceres , Mérida , Trujillo , Guadalupe , Alcántara ...
Other places that I would recommend are : the towns of the South of Andalucia which have clean beaches , cold water and a good leisure with many restaurants , shops , parks , zoos , aquatic parks ...
On the other hand , near Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches which water is very clean and warm .
In particular , I recommend you to go to Baleares Islands .
In addition , you can visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches .
However , you must go and know these unforgettable places .
The first one was very boring for him because he was very tired and he was n't about listening everything that the teacher was saying .
When science class arrived he felt really excited because John , the science teacher , told them that he was going to explain them a very interesting thing .
It was about what problems are we going to have in a few years if we do n't change anything related to contaminating our environment .
John talked about the serious problems there are caused by not recycling things as plastic bags , bottles … that end up floating in the sea because humans do n't take care of our environment , and all this is causing that loads of acuatic animals expire .

This is to apply for the position advertised concerning the USA SUMMER CAMPS .
Due to my background I believe to be the ideal person for the abovementioned job .
I have been involved in summer camps with children from different background and diverse needs .
In particular , I have been dealing for 10 years with children with disabilities .
Such experience has been an eye - opener for me .
I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at the daily life with differnet eyes .
Children can indeed teach you a lot , being able to express their feelings with the spontaneity that adults often lack .
It was impressive to see the strength showed by those children .
Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core , children with disabilities were growing very independent and strong , despite all the challenges they could face on the way .
During the year in Ghana , I was part of a team of volunteers working with children .
After consulting some children 's representatives , we organized Olympic games for the children attending the schools of the area .
You do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition .
As volunteers we were also helping the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room .
In conclusion , I believe to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it .
My experience with children from different ages and Countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your Esteemed Company .
There seems to be nothing better , nothing more interesting , exhiliring , breathtaking or stunning just as taking up this sport .
Being on the court , it appears to be funny , gives me a feeling of fulfilment .
Not everybody knows how much devotion and determination requires being a good player .
You just surely have to work your fingers to the bones but it 's definitely worth .
Despite all obstacles , I would n't change this entertainment on anything else .
The amount of pleasure which I can get it 's simply incomparable to anything else .
ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS
There are a lot of bergains and cheap items on the market , which very often catches our eye but I want definitely warn you against it !
In terms of differences is that this houses will be modern , more secure , economic .
Most of the furnishings will be a machine and domestic activities will be done for us .
However , they will lose the atmosphere of houses with antique furniture and interior , which create the unique and familiar atmosphere .
Everything is going forward , so everything will be changed .
First of all it 's a man sport , simple and simultaneously complicated .
To be a fan of NFL team is very special experience .

Introduction
the aim of this report is the desciption of the shopping facilities in my home town - Vienna .
Vienna contains a lot of great shopping areas , that is why I am going to speacialse on the three most popular places .
Conclusions
I would like to start of with one of the most renownedly malls - called " Donauzentrum " .
The mall is linked to an entertainment section , called " Donauplex " .
The Entertainment section stays open after the mall closed .
There you can find a cinema , some restaurants and bars .
On the countryside you can find the recently edified mall named " G3 " .
It contains nearly the same shops as the " Donauzentrum " and several restaurants and cafés .
The " Mariahilferstraße " is the perfekt place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls .
Even the most extravagant shops can be found there .
Beside the shops some nice bars and restaurants can be found .
Recommendations
Espacially on a rainy afternoon the " Donauzentrum " and " G3 " are the prefekt way to spend your day .
To people who prefer spending their time on the countryside I would commend a visit on the " Maria Hilfer Straße " .
Yours faithfully ,
I 've just read your advertisement for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , and I 'm really interested in it .
I 'm also a volonteer among the red cross association , so I 'm used to look after children and organise all kinds of events .
Does the accommodation belong to the summer camp structure ?
We do the collection , to recycle as many things as possible .
All the building here have been built to respect the environment , in fact every house has photovoltaic panels on the roof .
These panels are used to bring the light of the sun to produce electricity .
The first Sunday of every month , a group of volunteers goes in the parks of the village to clean it and to cut the grass .
I always participate in these events because I love the environment and I 'd like to keep my village clean .
We all know that the Roman Empire affected a lot Italian culture and history , in fact if you want to go on a tour around the most beautiful cities in the country , you should definitely go to Florence , Venice , Naples and many others ..
You will be able to see ancient and modern building such as theatres , churches , cathedrals and civil buildings built by the most famous artists in the entire world !
Cities are full of museums where tourists can see all the customs and traditions that have characterized Italian culture .
That 's why Italy is such an interesting and historical country .
So , I think that both hobbies has their advantages and disadvantages .
Many people feel that learning English especially in ' England ' or in ' The USA ' , is better than learning that in a country that does not have English as its mother tongue .
For instance , in Peru everybody speaks Spanish so you are not accustomed to the language .
The advantages of learning English abroad are the everyday practice , which you should have if you are in an English country and all the people who you get to know from all the world .
One argument in favour of this idea is that Peruvian people who learn English for a short period and then travel abroad , have an enhancement in just one or two months .
However , the disadvantages are that you do not know how to behave in another culture .
In conclusion , I am of the opinion that people ought to study abroad if they have the opportunity , so apart from your lessons you can interact with native people and learn usually - common phrases .
She did not appear in the club , and she did not come to the hotel on consecutive days .
In case a person who is going for an interview for a job , punctuality is a must , hence he can drive his car fast or can go earlier in his car to reach there early .
But he could not travel on a bus very fast in order to reach destination very quickly .
In conclusion , usage of public transportation is reducing day by day .
In order to boost the usage of public transport the government or the governing body should consider these factors and must find a solution to these problems .
The technology has changed us much faster and more dramatic than we used to think .
Nowadays all of what we need is a full charged smart phone with the Google Map application .
In the past people could only have a purchase from store to store by themselves , now we can browse almost hundreds of goods on line and buy it through a simple click .
For this tremendous outcome I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years , with greater extension to every aspect of our lives .
In my imagination , the future would be more messy and crowded with less species of creature but more of us , the human beings .
We will face the more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental pollution .
Some of the countries will be submerged entirely into the sea , some will survive , and less space for increasing people .
Fortunately the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living , to clean air for breathing , and to purify water and food for supply .
When we have a dementia ( a steady degeneration disease of our brains ) we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of on - line " Big Cloud " memories .
No longer do we suffer from studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we known though the linkage to the huge database online .
We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects to our personalities .
Moreover , our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns even the physical functions corresponding to the changing environments or simply by our specific commands .
However , the more we feel convenient , the more damages to our intellect .
We do n't have to think too much about almost everything , needing no person to company with since we have all these distractive devices for joy and relaxation .
The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of these unrealistic convenience we have .
For example , saving the endanger wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient .
Time - saving and convenience are admittedly considered two essential values of modern lives .
Nonetheless , we have to confront the truth that the resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly .
We may think that depends on how you like to travel , as they all have their advantages and disadvantages .
But personally , my favorite way to travel is by plane .
It is faster than the two , it is no difficult to travel on it and it is quite comfortable .
Also you can travel to different places and longer distances while boating , for example , you can only travel to places where connection to the sea .
I 'm really glad to know about your future plans , I definitley think that this year of travelling and discoverying will be a great way to grow up , meet new people of different cultures .
If I have the opportunity to help you in your organization , please no doubt that I will certainly do so .
Firstly I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital , which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites such as museums , art galleries , monuments and churches .
Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture , the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts , exhibitions , festivals and so on !
As you arrive during the summer , you should then have a vacation in the South where the beaches are breathtaking , with such a clean water and golden long shores .
In connection with your desire to find a job , you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field : as you wrote , you 're searching for a monthly job and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly fit your expectations .
If you are interested , I could give you his phone number and e - mail so that you two are able to speak about the matter and maybe find an agreement .

There are also good pubs and restaurants .

Their novels have much in common : first of all the plot is usually pretty complex ( as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heighs by E. Bronte ) , and so are the characters , which are always well described especially on a psychological level ; furthermore both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class .
There is also a lot in contrast , most evident is the difference between the settings : Dickens prefers industrial cities while Emily prefers rural villages , and these choices reflect different topics , in fact Charles mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood , the miserable conditions of lower classes and the bad consequences of the industrialisation , instead Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability , even if her female heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prude .
Then we can notice that the narrator of the novel has different roles : Dickens 's narrator is omniscient , Emily 's one is part of the story itself and can change revealing characters ' perspectives .
We feel happier during the conversation when someone who has a good sense of humor .
Also , people could have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor .
I would like to provide examples to illustrate my thesis .
Consequently , we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor .
To illustrate , my niece did not get a great score in his test .
Also , people can have a good relationship with their humor .
Furthermore , sometime people with a sense of humor can help others to conquer the difficult issues .

country , Indonesia , is full of natural attraction .
It is an archipelago , surely many spots of tourism here .
Also , you can interact longer with other passengers especially native Indonesian , just in case you need to explore more about Indonesia as you would like to get temporary job here .
Indonesian people are famous with their friendliness , so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia ; they will answer your questions with pleasure .
Here are few tips for starting conversation with Indonesian : Indonesian person will reply a smile with a smile , so you can start with it ; not all Indonesian speaks English , but most students could speak English .
I suggest you to choose college students , because they are more familiar with English , besides they will welcome you with pleasure to experience their English ability ; when you are going to use public transportation , you could ask an information you need to the official employee in the station or to student for the same reason , not many Indonesian speak English .
Bali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people , many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia .
The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than other islands mentioned above but other islands are more challenging and natural .
It can be little bit difficult to find temporal job here , unless you got any connections with agency or local people .
Personally , I think this development has both positive and negative sides .
Thanks to increasing living standard , people are able to afford a bigger and expensive wedding .
If in the past , they just hold weddings at home to save money , now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead .
Secondly , it is likely that nowadays people focus more on appearance , so luxurious and elegant wedding is an occasion for them to show off .
Finally , people have more relationships in life as well as in business .
As a result , more new relationships are created , people get more chance to co - ordinate in business and help each other in life .
Those who losing contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again .
Furthermore , modern weddings bring to people new experiences about food , lifestyle and culture exchanging .
Grooms , brides and their parents usually have to book restaurant , hotel , invite singer and famous master of ceremony to make the wedding serious .
Last but not least , in some cases , only for the sake of showing off , many couples , after getting married , have to work hard to earn money to pay the debt for wedding expenditure .
To conclude , marriage is a landmark of individual .
However , a wedding with a reasonable scale will either satisfy the guests or reduce the burden for the couple and their families .
Some days before we had decided to organize an excursion to a nature trail nearby as soon as we arrived at the railway stop , we were so fascinated by what surrounded us that we had been walking for three hours along a path , Suddenly , our surroundings appeared to be far wilder than it had been before so we stopped trekking and we had a look at our map .
We turned towards the bushes immediately , we were worried as we had listened to the radio that a bear could have lived there .
Fortunately , it was a beautiful deer as Bamby which looked at us and ran away more frightened than us .
Eventually , it was a special trip !
I am interested in the job because this would be an opportunity of spending my summer in a more fun way .
Another thing is that : I would improve my skills in working with children and I find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications .
I also take pleasure in playing tennis , for the benefits of practising sports and staying active .
Besides , I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor ones .
I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons : I am familiarized with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one .
Another reason is that I have gained experience taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently .
Furthermore , I have a great sense of leadership as well as the social skills needed from being a scout for five years .
For that , I hope my letter is taken into consideration .
Third school day gone , one of the classmates caught me in a hall and asked if I want to join them tonight for dinner .
There was the only problem : I can not communicate well in English and I was really shy about it .
But when the dinner started there was nothing to worry , because my classmates appeared supportive and patient .
This evening was so delightful !
I told them about my country and family , I was speaking English and they were understanding me !
I am going to France this December , and Francois will show me independent Paris !
The artists invited all the staff to a big party in a restaurant .
It was unbelievable to speak with the artists and ask them questions about their life and habits .
Nowadays it 's common to think that travelling by car is much more conventient than travelling by public transport but it 's no true at all .
Some surveys have demonstrated that travelling by car is more expensive that travelling by public transport .
Moreover other costs will act upon the prices of travelling by private vehicles .
In the same surveys , the researcher show how travelling by public transport is safer than travelling by car .
As for the pullotion , it could be reduced if people use the public vehicles ; it is well - known that the CO2 emissions per passenger kilometre by public means of transportation are 80% less than a car .
Significant changes have to be done either to ensure the quality of service and the conditions of the coaches , trains and other public means of transportation .
In this way the customer can feel comfortable as they fell in theirown cars .
The latest research carried out by The Health Department in Spain show that young people are not as healthy as twenty years ago .
That could be a higher problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could raise 60 % in the next 10 years .
Finally , it is proved that youths are devoting less time to do exercise than they should and as a consequence , they are not improving their general health enough .
As far as I am concerned , I think Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertisement campaigns in order to improve health in young population .
Furthermore , Spanish schools should pay more attention to this matter and teach children how to develop a healthy lifestyle .
Travelling by car is only convenient in a restricted sense while public transport is overall more convenient .
What is meant by a restricted sense is that for adults , who are healthy and able bodied , having access to personal transportation is arguably quite attractive .
However note my emphasis on adult , healthy and able - bodied , for young people , for older people , for people with disabilities being able to drive brings more costs than benefits .
A public transport system is much more convenient for this group of people because they wo n't need to worry about the skill and attention needed for driving .
Furthermore the monetary costs in the long run are much better using public transport both for individuals and for the wider society .
They ca n't do trivial things such as shopping or going to the cinema with their family insensible for the fans and papparazi .
Even when celebrities are having holidays people ask them to give an autograph .
The complexity of human behaviour is critical in Sport .
As a result of this many studies have shown that athletes shuold be motivate to push themselves above the record .
You need a motivation to believe in your self that you can achieve it .
This attitude is especially true to Sportsman and women .
One of the most difficult sport on the Earth will learn you what it means hard work , sacrifice , pain , strain but also satisfaction , determination , pride and struggle .
The complexities in swimming are not only for the body work out but above all for the mind .
If you want to swim evryday pushing yourself above your limits , you definitely need a strong psyche and a solid motivation .
Futhermore like Michael Phelps said : " There will be obstacles , there will be doubters , there will be mistakes but with hard work ... there are no limits " .
