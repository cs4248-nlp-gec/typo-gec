Catch it or lose it
The alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .
One lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .
On the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
Dear Sir or Madam ,
You are the boss .
But think about the costs .
What else ?
And also , where are you now ? ? :)
And for that I want to THANK YOU once again .
So I had n't have time for much .
I 'm gon na go now .
Talk to you soon , Mike .
I think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .
I do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?

Hi Sam ,
I got up and I made my way to the front door .
I did not know that he was still alive .
I think she did this for my own good .
It was very odd to see him in my home .
The worst part is that they get angry with us !
Paula .
The gym .
On the other hand , the gym is too small .
