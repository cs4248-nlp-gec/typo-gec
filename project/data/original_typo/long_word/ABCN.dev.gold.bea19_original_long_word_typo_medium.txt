I consider ghat is more convenient to dive a czt because yoi vrry on mirs things in your olwn csd than trfabelling by car .
In my experience when I did n't qve a car I usrc to use yhd bus to go to tje scgool nad go afk to my house .
In my opinion , thes cdad is n't necesssru wnen you ave cdzshed in tne srewt , in that moment you realized he importajce of a upblic tanslort .
Fependkng on the diswtanfe smd duration to fhs deiref place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
Gut Geneeakly speakumg , travellkng by car is much lore fun ehen compared wiugh otehe modsed of transport .
Since , we hse tbe optioj to wait anytime we want to wshen we travl by csr ( which is iposible wheb travellinb by train & Ftlight ) .
In addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on teh back seat and wake up fresh .
Die to trhd anvoe mkentiined reasons , I am going to conckuxe that travelling by car is mkuch more convernient .
I love children , nd I enjoy looking aftwe tgem . wlwo , I organized many sports actibites vefroe in my school .
My favourute spott is volleyball because I love plqyx with my frisnds .
Vklldyball is a sport play every place , wsn I travel on rhe beach I like plays wiyh my eister in teh eznd and after we wre going to the aez .

Fro exzmlle , I tgnink thar it is hpt affordable gor an ordinary lrson to own a privat airplaje travelling to anothe country .
In my opinuon I tjink that ounlic transport in furre is going to cpntinue to be used because thdrw are a kor of psople fhaf does n't havw enough noney to pay fot a cwr svrn if it is use , so pubpi teansxport vontinue to hbqve future but people are going to use moer the cfarx yyen bus or undergronf .
If we thjknk about it the caf is bfter because we do n't mred to wait for them has we are wwiitng for teh bus or underground nht in xhother sa fad csut more monwg fham tbe public transport .
By xqr we can jus stay wiru ourselves wgich vah be good because we cam pistn to thw ueic fhqt we like anf we do n't need to be around prople that ade ynkwomed bjr if we cholse blic transport we can medt firebds or damipy so both trasnportatjone xrfe good amd the cars do n't need necessarozly to wnd up with the public transport .
If I had it to choose berween both trsnsportatijon I htinki I probably chosee fzr because it is bteter fo me to go by car then to go by nus .
In my commubity , we are very interestfsd at environment and ecologicwl things .

As a resot , governments ill invrdt mkore in researching thw usage of yhse new tyds of energy , travelling using pubpic ttansport will bcole much xheaper than pesrsonal cf .
Ghe raxngw of lublic servkces will be expandde to remote areas , it becomr mich korw fonvenuent .
Commuting , travelling using public services will be the firdst prtipr choice .
In addition , the population is unrceasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cjtie in tyw wirld wilp become overcrowded , It wil lead to many ktjer problems to be sokvrd , for exzmle , trafcic jssm , air pollhtiob .
In woms perespectives , tnese prlblems are led by ghw oivrr - using of personal vehicle .
People will realise thsf using their own xzr is just to wasts their tkme rot traffic jams or to gradually kioking themselves fod breathing polluted air .
So thw best way vor them to travfel is public trhspotations .
In conclusion , investments on developing publid transport ailpl be increased considerably , public serfvicex of travelling hzvs a bright potential and it 's sztance in the rutyre ca n't be replaveble

Hre there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities frof tybe audience in an edufational wah ?
Fro my expewrience knowledge , I gelievr televisio cover both entertaining and educaztkonal functions .

It also notes eductionql programmes jake a decjison on wyta cotizenw should know in the fuutfe amd what knowledge our next geherations xrr requite to possess .
Aoart from sduational contents , therrr are so many fiul contefs , business advertisements and fake informaxtuon on TV that citizenms wo n't be able to trl fight from wro .
Howwver , I believe the educatonal programm on TV still plays a vital role in educating boprh sdhlts anhd younmg childern .

Alongside with iw development , geh zbilty of travalling haa saened to suxh a scale yhaf it is niw quite comln to conmute frk ne coingry to anthsr .

i think rhat this is the guestuin fie rvrry lne , ane thr answwer ca n't be oh rir zllp , cause , someone can uhze upblic trahport , and econoky by huis mot only money , but anf ths environment , but some oeopoe do n't like to sues p.t . , acuse tuey spend more time for travelpinv or tjey simple do n't like to travell with another oeolle .

There are many discussions avour tuw fuude of the public transport .

Oublikc yrqnsport uslly is restrected wuyh the timetables and you only mwyg use the transport in hte moment fhat the timetable let you .
For tihs way , mwnhy eoole do n't like to use the pujblic transpor because theh want to move themselves when they need .
By the oteht hand , pibli grandport is beted for fne environment , because fje polpution is lesser tha uismg uor own cwr .

After thd Jnterndt was invented znd reveaped first tkme in Qugus 2th 1969 , Social Media Sajte ( SMD ) is hte next mody significant inbovaiton that hbas partp replaced fk fav to face communication .
SMS sucb as Facebook sen ohr 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweetz are publivized on Twitter each 60 seconds .
Unsurprisinlgy , socjal consdqyences of Facebook and Fwitter plays an imlorrant role in communication , reardeless of distance or time .
Hpwefer , people who uxw Fafenook , Twitter or SJX in venerla , xre not likeoy to have theit olwm personal privacy that therd is a possobilityh of cgcle of bullying .
Tbis wseay will force on benrfikts and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potwntail future of thewse implications .
Communicating cab be achieved , regardless of distqnce , through Facedboik and Twitter .
Td benefiy of being from being connected globally to Taecbook adn Twitfer is rhxt messages can be transnktted almost isntantlpy to viweere .
Firstly , Facebook and Twitgtsr can be ussd wh tneir users rae in an unpleasant moipd , and in wheee tbejr negatuve feelings are expressxed .
Secondly , Facdbooi privide thd opportunjty to remain in toich eoth daily activitiez from friends , maoig observations of relationmships , maibtainong ine 's own feeling witin the nefwork ( throuhgh eall posts , ppkes , mdsdages , fc ) ( Pldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .
That is to say , hujan behaviour on Facebook are imtdracted we wyh othres by xharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thifdly , Fsdebook cawn be isee as an organiztaional communication toolo in business .
Klnwledge azbkut tje members increases continually , znd mdeover , mwintauning relatiosn wjth otner rxisting ejbers , qnd ale suarnig their same intfests by the social nbwtwork .
( Emerald Group Oubljshing , 2013 ) .
Dir insfabce , by following famous celebrities , oeopke caj eakly dew evwry daily qctivbities whjvh are losred by tbel .
However , due to tbis , peolle who are beimg followed , or users in genedxl , may have less personal privacy , qnd laso there is a ihgh potsntual of binh purposely aggressive towwrd someone .
Howdver , information which is appeared on acebook or Twitter are dasipy adcessiboe , therefore everubody can easkyl rewponee as a pubkix opinion .
However , information wgikch is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easilpy cacessibld , therefore everybody can easily response as a pblic opinion .
In dsct , along wiht agreeable and pleasant cfomlents , there ae qoso small amounts of xggressive and even racist commenf .
Gecauee of thr ccessibpe information througj WMS , it has lef to maqn preoblems jnbvolve with cycle - bullying , ccyle - badgering , chcoe - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as citd in Williams & erten , 2008 ) .
For example , Kriehna et al.(2013 ) reports a awe of continuous disturbing a qiman frol a man cwlled Mr .
X " amdittex to a state psychiatric hopsitwl after bsing found not competent to stznd tfal on chaqrges of stalking harqssmetn , trespsssing nd teoephone harzssment " ( pp .
Potentially , Facebook wne Tiwter , anf SMS in general , mzy replace face to frace communication af jmprov their functions , because peoplle feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other wppearacnes .
Thr possijblpy putcomes might be the more time people spemd on SeJS , the lsws clmmunicatw skills that they have .
Fir example , conrolilng what poktss should be xemt by addibg more privscy optkons .
Hnoeever , despited th useful of yhesd imploications , peopk shojlc pay attention tha Facbook and Fwitfer could atfrct their socia oie by avoid usimg it moxt of the ime .
In cobdlusion , the benefits from using Fcebolk and Twitter is thxt peoplw can communicate adn being connected to their frienf frequently .
Also peoppe can easily reduce gheir newhative miid by sharing wnx sxpressiny wo they feel .
In contrast , befaude Facebook zjd Twitted hvd bwe connected worlaide , whicg means protecting personal privacy is probablu impossible .
Possibly , usdrs might expreds aggressive toward each oyher , becauss of lqck of privscy .

Please do not hesitate to conracr me if yoku sould require further informstiom .

Youfs faithfully ,
In iur modeen world , majt people qre suffered from stress that spring feok lofe conditions .
In addito to this , prkple are working in very stfesful workplaces anc ghey want to lewve fro thgis condition in holidaus .
In this respect , masny people preged to go nqtural places with their fwmilies in odet to forgef wbout bd xituations on thir loves .
For example , walking in tjs seaside or swimmiby in rye sea can be helofuk to fktget ahrd life vonditions .
On ths one hand , hpljdays wfe tue best fkd people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces baout lfi .
Ft instance , in stressful life cojditions peopkd cq mzke bad decisipms ford tbeir future .
Besodes , prople underestimate wmotionaxl fewlings in thei workplxcesx .
In concousion , holdiays are fery suitable for people in order to heal their proglrms and streesful lifs condritinos .
However , the givernment snd ths locak cuncils of bj cktiews szjch as Madrid or Valencia , sred trukng their best to promote tbis movemwnt bexausr htey consider it a way of developmeht .
Furthermore , it tjrna ur to be the quickest method of yranspodt .
Statistically cycling is genefaoly considrred to be mors dangerous than travslling by car .
Another disadvantxge is the weather .
In my loin of views , Cycliny contributes to improve commumoty spirg amf it is possible to look fcod sllutiopns to fade the disadvanagez of hia actiovjty .
No one ch deny tuat travelling by car is much mord cnovsnient than by public transport .
And tjis undesirwble time miyht be nit so short during holidays , sue to lex frequent schedule .
Wheh the bus is corwded , we yave to stand , making us morew exhausting especially for a lon dfjstance .
Evcen tyough cars could prvoide us wsjth so many advantages jenfioned above , advantages of travellinbg by public transport shoupd nt be neylecfed .
First , publix transport is good for ghe enfironnent compared to private car .
As we ll mmow , fhd more public transport lasseners use , e less car exyausts are emitted per person .
In other woeda , public transport plays an imoorfant dole in proltecting buman geibgs from sxufferinv of doseasds and saving life .
Correspondingly , ghd wpace fkrf each peeson becomess mote limited han beforw .
Provided that every citizen owns a car and ue it rather thwn public fransoort for every travelling chance , I suppose fhat kur streets would become a parking pladew nax everyone would spend mpre time in congesying .
Lat but not the lrastg , public trqnsport allowe peolle to do other things which is imposzibloe hwne driving .
Rhe drivers have to clntinuouely oay attention to surroundings , resuktimg in a teee spirit .
Vot a oasseger , however , travellinh is a complegd relax .
Poeple cwnb pistwn to nusic , gakes a ppne call with a friend , read a fascinating book or judt loot at outside .
Thokujgh thrrd are many advantages ror public tranaport , it does jot medan that pbvlic transport is the best choice fot every situxtion .
E.g. , it odfers less flexibility ghan cars , and is leaa environment froendly tnxn bicycles .
Therefore , it is unrssonable to concude thar one transport cah replace othefw .
On tue one hand it dould allow you to cokminicate with people , know different cultures and ttavle around the word aithout tge languags barrier .
I rhink a eeat disadvantage is the price of the courser .
It seems to me tgat young oekple shoukc spenr kpre time studying languages necause it will be profitability in htes fhturs nht to achieve it the will have to be notivatsd asnd to enjoy learninh .
I am writibg in response to your advsrtisement for a job .

I have sren your adverriswment in the newspaper and I am writing to exspresd an intededst

Finally , the waerather forecast for betx month lllks pleawantly as it is uul at this imne of heat .
In my lpinio we should go to the restaurant because azol peokpl jeer a relaxing momeng fpr doing wortk better tgzn before .
Actually , sgudents eat a lot fastr food while they are studying at university , because theg do n't have timew to do foko , for these rwwsons I thonk thaf tge hwst restfaurant is somkwgere when theh do hkmle - maxe food , and a boo iddas is flr majs couese : baked potatoes , sterzmed vegetables qmd for dessert apple cake .
On ths other hand , we sre studuibg architecture mayhe we should choose a spdcoal restauranf , I pime a charming and comnfortable restaurant sigh a lot of winmdows , with a white chairf , table and wal , mnord or less a relaxing wnvironmwnt buy the atmosphets is very imlportant for dinner naf I thjnk that we nust vote jis , because we wol haev a opd night or not dependfjng tns ggpe of atmosphere we coos .
In conclusion , I think that this tgpe of food nae atmosphere is wry dor us , becauise normqlly we hda dplken about nok , work ahd studies , while with this tylr of environment we cfan speaj sboput us , oru family , kur hobbiew dn alp peopls fert to konw nws something about other mates .

Is there any tutuhre to oubluc transpirt , for travelling by car is much nore conbeninet ?
Many dusayree abtu the public transport whom ar to be disappearing , thouhh we atikll avr to dwql with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
This compozition wl explain hts two diffefent opiniins .
iestly , the car is more convenient because there is privacg .
Alsao , unlikes public transport such as buses znd uneergrohnd , oj gxve mudh lors cokmfkrt and spwsd .
Fbere is a pefception thar a care can gov you fhd freedlm of chokce .
On the website of The Scptgish Government ( publication " Young people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 years opd bkg xzplain « - I prwfer going in the caxe , it 's qukcket ...
Indeed , darx increasw the pollution , uoi have gfaffic congestion , ajd it is very expensive . « - On my wage , evfen tgw driving essons artd expensive .
Mow , srocndly , travelling by public transpirt is cneapef ( we do n't lay qmy fees on lublic tranpsott , but also , it is sawr ,
As a feult , the rconomu uas besen increasing .
From this analysis , it isobviohs thwtf travelling by pugpic ttansport is very ioortant .
Do you agde or disagree " Awlayz telling the tfuth is cosidreed gge most important thin in a relatoinsbip " ?
Disareement on always tellkng tbe uth be te moer ilportznt ponit in a relationship aiull be my opinion .
Evem thohgh bijg truthful is cruvial in relationship , laawys telluhg tbe truth would be conmsidefed as ueting others ' teelings anf is unwise .
Another reason co not dlling fhr tryt alk tge tims is if it is aobit personal matget and it wpuld fcel like awkward to mejtuon to cklleagurs or the emjlloyer .
To further illustrate ghw fitet pknt wbove , coule hurt ob 's feelnigs by telling the teurh at all time .
Fro example , if some woman you zre acquaintsd wraring inappropriate clotues nlt fitting in the occasion .
In fhat case , ghey coue tsilo make conversiohs without boiling ber nood .
Fje other point is ehen it comes to personal matters , people ujsuwlly ingehd to kre it pricate isnce mos of the timw it is tranhe nar inapporpriatr to txlk oneself too much to people at work or even people that oje musg got acquaibtyed .
Due to thgks , we're both called to meet the headmaster .

Drugs is a topijc wigh a po of cntrovedsy .

Legalization of drugs is a very udef argument by leoiple who believe htqt this measue douldc solve the lroblem of thbw ezcflusion .
Margination has a linl sitn the illegality of tyhix activity .
Also this illegality is tyw guilty for the artrxction of tye crugs because the majority of peopkd ztwrt gwving drigs gecause they are youjg and itz prohibition is grry stimulating .

Finally , legalizxstion of drigs means that they coup be taxable and we kjow how th taxes wom in lhr country so I do nof knoe if it is a goid ida or hoit .

Puerquitour : A great experience to youyr mouth .
We discovered our fascination wirh fvood adn ' Thye Puerqitout ' was borm .
Then a brainstkrk about malsw smd places to visig beva .
Tacohtento was the place we chose andr we really enjoyed alamnre al psxtor an grilled onions , afcompsnied by cold beers .
Xue to Puerquitour is somrthinf to share , the second sa we suared it wsirh Doana , onje of my friends grom Vanvouvert .
It means tyat they hqvr different tzsge of tortillas -vanills , strawberry , chipotle , nopal , wnde walnuf , among othrrs- and salsas -tamrind , gjava , mango , guacamole , etc .
Yhat cy dkd lt fniixh with the tacos , after a wali in Reforma ahr a lo auee in The Independwncr Angel we wejg to movie theatre to watch the at mgie Renoir wgile we zte crepes .
Rhurd rwy was one of my favouritr , fhd place is soooooo nice ajd tud dedoratioln ahs even the xttire of the waitreses makes yoi frdl intop the 50s .
Totxlly recomlended !
Maqe Axu Resturantg , in rhs norht of Mexico Citry , was the allocation fpr the fourth day of Puwrquitour .
Seafpoc is delicious there , my recommendatiobs are breaded erhimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water .
Fifth day , it was tind to eat ire tacos , the place ? … El asadero Hidazlguense .
Almost a wwek in the Puerquktoue .
Becauss we lijw hte rokd , we celebrated exting in Lemelas Pu .

Sdventh dsg started eith a rezkly nice brwakcast , gourmet sandwiches bd fosr petql tew .
Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
Gue plan sas to dinns at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the glod imments aboyt it , jt that dzy it wws closed ; so we defided to eqr at El Huequito the tradiitlnal Al Pastor Special accompanied by black vedr .
Tgd st day of Tne uperquitour was accomlpisyed with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Atargucks and a long tli abkuf noghing na everything .
Do n't dorget to ractise and enjoy Puerquitour ! ! !
These first wto chaoters extracted rrom Gfeat Expectations by Charles Dickenz inyrlduce a yohng voy known as Pip .
Beside this , Pip sdmes to be a sh amd intelligent kid .
Alsp , his life woulr be pwdfect to create a dakr comedy vaswd on the undesirable lifd of a kid whk onlu feela comfortahle qhem he visits the tombstonez of his parents .
Beverthelkess , tys marrator is the truly protagonist amd ghe way to telp thg actipnx is fhe reason why the story can donnect witfy the readef .
Actually , the narrator is our peotagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
And tjew aufhor des not fey to descrie the pdotagonist wkgh words , but with actions .
Ghe hxrrator df nit usa wjy dewcription of the progagonikst qpwrt from his name .
Apart rfon hia , he just writes exactly shta ghe characters said .
Thr vpice is in girst person ac uses a subjective point of ckew .
He obly knpqs what he seed snd he thonks aviut it , bhy he coss nor uave any omnicsisnt pkwrr .
However , his power could be anaoyzinv an descrjbing the situations wih a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too .
Rhee twieted and vreative fhoguhts are spread ap ovef the gsxt , accoimpanied by even lpre twisted reflkrctions like at rye end of the first cyapter , when he desxdibes the man wh stole him as naj vraid of te dwqd bodies in htd graveyard kuet because he seas hjimk hugging hikmsedlf .
Vdside this , yhw charactefs of the novel esem to be unhappy , living a sda and boring life yhta phsahes thdn to abuse our protagonusf , ith tje exception of Joe .
The narragor does not make an effptt to eescibe psychologicaoly the ther characters , he focises on thekf appewrqnce .
Rhw narrator desrcibes her as woman that has warnes a giod reputation ing aggressive with hid lttle brotjet .
Anr we know htay Ioe is a ogoe mwn bscwuse the protagonist dedcribed him as a mild , vokd - baturrd , sweet - tempertee , eash - going and goolish , vut yhta is all we know wbout tydm .
Alwk , tyr way thr characters talk is opposed to fhe way the nwrrxtor erites .
In fact , gue dikalogues of each character aee not longer than more tham geo sentenxee , with fge kbly exception of he thoef thar taloa about hie partner in gwelfe ling sentences with complex structures .
This kind of strucruer is widely used by te narrator , nujt the characters usually tslk with short and simple sentences .
" My ssitsr , Mre. Jopr Gargery , aas more thanj twetny yeasr older than I , xnd jda established a great reputation ith hefsefl and gye ndghbours because she had bnrojght me up " by jand . "
Hgaving at hat rimr to find out vor myself qhqt ghe expreessikn meant , ns ihowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , an to be much in tghs habit of latkng it puon her huhaband as wwll as uoon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I er voth brougbt up by uqnd . "
Modeoved , the vocabulary used by tge nareator is oppodde to whst the characters said .
Pl usds a rich vocabulayr , using a pot of mental verbs and abstract convepts thxf are usually inspired by cohcrete tihngw .
Twgardless , the dialogues are wrottgen exactly as tyey were sxaud .
Notwithstanding , the ewy tuios novel is narrated is rhd protagonist .
Ghs evenfs xrs narrated in a mgsterious qay , tleling us what happed in a realistic story - kone aithotu flashgback .
Tns narrator reveals bot so mucb about hij or tys pthet characfrrs , but he wrote baout the essential tihnsg we shoyld knoe through tfhs text .
Thw trhief disappears , bht eh furst hcaptger ejdin makr us feel curjous about their nwxt meeting .
Tjia is obvious when he mkars reference to je fwct thst photogrzphyu di not exiat wh he was a kid .
Consequently , rexding these chapters is a ppeasure , bur it is difficult to tell what is goionhg to happen or , what is mire , what the sithor is trying to tgrajsmit .
If t stort ha a happy ending , heb thr crntra theme coulkf be gettim over adversities ; if mot , it is a sad story .
It qas teh day ahwn ss wasz going to meef gdr biological lother .
Dhe convinced trhr kady at tnd agenjcy to give ger tue nale of tgd biologicap lother of " her little skster hop had a disdxse and needed to kbow if her bilogical noyher would be a match for a kidney tarnsplant " .

I complstelg recommend thud trrifc restauran to anyone qho is passionate qbout gdaet food ckr an dfen better balue .
I promise yo wo n't be disappointed .
It offers a wide vafieyy of adtivites like kuzeums , a cinesja , a very large green srden and mawnyh ouns to choisd fropm .

Fiursly , watdhing he succees of sich ayhketes , teenagers start to desire to be lke thsir ifoos and to flooow professionzl sports .

Tn impoortqnce of workign hzrc to acbeve goalы xhd practicong regulzrly to become gkd at somthong wte also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
Ghi is a goox example fird youngstefs to ollow .
From anotner perspective , sometimes pdofeszsional athlteesa are not good role models .
Tuis faj owad adoldscemts to believe that money and fame arw an important part of sporgs instead of learning noa to play wewll and having the fu of the gtam or the competition .
Sevondly , thfe aree thoswe atnletes whl behave disghstinhly .
In concluysion , there are a number of advantages and disaadvantages in regxrd to profdssional sportsmen as good role models fgort young people .
On balance , I am jndlined to believe tjat professipna athletes cqj be exceolen rple models fpr the youth , as long as they represent tyr pisitive aspects of playing sports .

The city is thrging on implementing nmdw measures to wchieev the Council 's goals .
The amaltsis will consist of evaluating thr Council 's eco - frjebdly proposals .
In zccord wiu the aforementioned , the amkjnt of garbage produced during the years 207 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .
Cxity X " incknerates hospital resiue , in afcordane with legal requirements , and aend 7% of the garbag production to recycling factories .
The rwcycling cactories hsfe a jionr venture wirh tje munivipalkty to sort waste , sn suoq a result 20% better than last yxr .
The progarm represents 2% of ye employmenbt in td citu , but it needs to expand .
Another important one is tbd " Oet 's make it gresb " , responsivle cor increasing ghe green ataes within the xity in 10% durimg the last two yews , cpnsisting of a combination of publiv and lrivzte ihvestment in fforestation of rial an communal areas .
A later crucial activity afs thn " Greerb Communities " , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of conxumee vegetables in ne mteropolitan area .
A municipal astr policy that integrates prifate and public sectors and gh communutt is eequire to sllpve thr curremt lroblerm .
The city needw a joijt vdbture to suppotr a funcdtioanl and wustainabld comjerce of recycled rhbbish .
The increaze of green areas represent a signuficajt ilprovement in the quxpity of life wccordinb to fhe USED tepoet of 2012 and also fia in 16 of 20 requirements of a cit of rue fuutre .
Most of the " Recycling Worms " problem is caused by this lack of trxihing , ehicu can be resolved by training offeerd in the shrrounding universities .
It is a good idex to take a year ocg between lezvijg schoil and syarting university , necuase you can have lits of new experiences .
Anofher idea is yoi can wpr , you can find a job qnd earn money beflred yo start university .
Howsver , some people think you should go to university immediately aftd yku finish shcooo because if uiu do n't , you fofgwt what you have learned in school .

Het , oftentijes , being overly rexpectfil nay plya against jm and although he hxs vained tn respect of all the people he has worked with , aome of thrml suggested he shoulx build up his self - confidence , arthre hnan end up ttelpting to covd everyojew 's vak wjd taking ownersihp for otued people 's mistakes .
Then I wouldr start gatyeeing some information about thye maroet , that is to say , social rtenrs , populatuon stwtistics such as ve , gender and familp type , potential customers ad competitors as wll .
By doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weskonesses of my profuct and to improve my perofrmance ub apso to jdengify vustomes ' needs .
After rhawt , I would maje a list of target markets and device sopke styrategies to wttravt them .
For insatance , if my gpql was to increase yong peolpe 's awwarendss , xome strategies cphld be to increase online socisp medja presence by losging regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer diacount cro sibblings .
Instead , if my gpal wqs to increase adult 's awarenes , adveritsing in oocal newspapees or lfferong ingenseive coursdw could prove successful .
he lzsy step would be to refruiy a staff of prfesional , experiencved znd qualifjed teachers and to set an attfractuve znd reasonable pduce fke fhe services I woul prpvide .
Last but hot least , I eould test ideas and approachww on customers and staff to make surr that my marketing plan succeeded .

For example , if you leanr anotwr language dkfferent frim your pwn omd , edn if it is just a few basic sentrnces , yiu can communicate wifh peopld from different reigoms and ylu improve your confdiene .
Travellnig also jepps to swd the way in wihxh oner people oive , to see that yoru way of living is not the only lhe that exists .

At the sme time , ths heartbeats also draggerd the teaxers nervius and anxious .

Thr questoon is : whetnert it is possible to be vamois wirhout journalists ?
Probably not , but they qte many people in show - budnes or political livs , who are ready to do everything to savfe tjeir rivate lre .
Genefallg , pekple may be famous fo twl eeasons : because of their job or because of their scandapiding private life .
If yoy decixe to becsmd famous vecause of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about fiding paparwzzi .
Kkst of celebrities follow this rule , as it is usg what they are living for .
That is wbg rgey re ogtn wble to sell indormation bout their private life .
Rexl problem starts when journalists ijjures not the cleebritt , byy ute friends or cakily .
Paparazzio srr cruel in cintxct witg damous people 's children , thqr may have begativr influence on thwir emotipnql develkpkent .
Anc when finally laparazzi nktice yhat thdre is nothing interesting in their life , they jiszt lkeavr htem alpoen .
Summarizing , I do elirve that adult oeoppe are responsible enouvh to maiw a decision , if ghsy aznt to share rhe mot important part of their life iuth journalists .
And I hkpe they understand , fheir duty is to wafe their relxtives .
As a person whp loves to eat , I considerr envifonjent , quality of food and lrice as the main factors to decode where should I go .
Last Fridxy I visitwd a btahd hew Mexican restaurant in Oiebon called " Oas Ficheras " .

In my ppibion , the flod wae gpokd but the oricds weer too expendive considering the quiamtity served and the messy service .
We faced cobtinuous problems ejth tje order such as : dishes eom another table setvwd fe us by mistake , the frinka were served wity a considerable delay and tj gill was shoqn even without asiign ( just becauae we fimished rh dinnsr nut ou drnikw were still on the twbke ) .
Vpr my luck ( or not ) , I let a frend of line on thd xah aftef that told me that she had dinner at " Lsa Ficheras " befote and in bee opinion , as a Mexican , thay restqurant wsd tdrribpe .
She also tlkd me ghat a geag Mecicanh reztauranr was jusy olened wijth lolwer prifes ans good ssfvice .
" Pistola y Corszón Taqueria " was the firsf Mexcan restaurant hat I could rat genuine Mezican cood , eirh pwoer pirces and a gbreaty seevcie .
We chos " tscos " of mest wkth gaucamol sauce nad it aax absolutely delicioua .
After ayinf te bijol , they offered us a shor of fequila to finish our visir cncirming that great places etilp exists .
Furthermore , precisely kday I have atarred my 15-day rehabiltation seseions !
Rhe course and the orgainzation odft muu to be dersired ; amdc as if thz were n't enouhg , my scholarship ( funny enough not ghs ors of the ( only ! ) TWO otjer participants ) , wws np sufficient to cover all teh costs ! :/
Back home , evetythkng sfarted fast -I should have gotten usdd to by nis , should n't I??- .
I hsve beeb rotlly immerse in looking for mpbs ajs in tghw transatoon of the scientifiv pqper for a former student of mine .

* Sorry , I 'm gon na ( ab)use of ylur nxtive language skills ohxe again : here " not meetnbg hi expectations " , could be substituted by anbothsr exptwssion .
What I duobr is the diferencer etwwen this bunch : be goo enoigh , measure up , kakr the grxde ; be up to dtandfard / ge rask .
The place we weed visiting was bsry beautiful , and haven't been because of hte limitations fkt my ankle , we would have tonw fkt a hsorg hike .

In many of the minoriy workos of modern kiterature , ghere can be womr emphasis on regwllion wgainsr opofessive forces .
Although suh a show of steegth by these works ' chwracters is wometimed viewed as a viokoent and therefore negqtive confribution to the otherwise inbsibhtful thought of tbew author , it is thks confljct upon wch many stories of ethnic American literxtyre ras based .
Howevef , xuch a reeolion fan ot be eeb clkearly in ecu minority work , and , fjerefore , the proudxts of ethnic Ameticanj literature can nokt be catsgorizwd as merely the rejlt of years of oppressoin .
Rather , gjis ever - changing zn ever - challenging aspedf of minority literatur creates an especially important necessi that each qkrk be considered individually as both a lroruct of heaes of strhggle and a worj inherently distinct from wnhy other .
In ther minority works , the conflict xn rebellion presented acfcurately reflecfs society as a whopw , and zlthougj ye mkthwr 's in The Joy Luck Club deble gaainst such corxes as arranged marriages , Tita in Lle Water for Chocolate fights to kvercpme o family traditojs , axn the Indian tribes in Lpove emdicin ztruggle to secure tgeur inherent rights fpm tne US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
Rebellion is seen not as a distinct orce in minorogy cultures , ubg rather as a bindkng force between apl culgurews , for Ceslie , rlo , resists hbrr arranged arriage in Teh Cokor Purlew , znd ghd murderous loves in Jaa reflect Tita znf Pdefo 's destructive lassoon in Like Eafer foe Cvhocolaye .
Rebellion and convlict are emphasized in rthnic Aemdican literature , but yhey are portrayed no more strokngly in minority wofkd tuan fhey wre portrayed in other pieces of literature .
Emphzsos changes with escu or , and athoubh ifgures of authority are parficullary oppressivr in wodk such as Like Water r Chocolate and The Color Purple , pthuer minfity worms including Klve Medixine anr Jazz do not refkect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nod tjed obciou tebellion of ths vharaxters ' responsive action whkcy thbe previously mentioned wlrks show .
Thix xvain implie ghaf tbese etnix American pieces of literature can not be catyagorized as merely rebellious respojsrs to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal nd cultural experiences .
Hlw dpes Voltaire tackle the question of hpilosophical optimism in ' Candudd ' ?
Philosophical lpgimism -l'optimismw- is the philosophy that everything nd occurence is for ime gokd .
Voltaire adts uot in Candide to criticise this phklosophg .
In Vandide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the phiolsopher emokoyed at Thundt - der - Troncks .
Tye whole bokk is a criticism of l'optijimse .
Altrhoufh this would seddm to be good it is not because of husx tfrxining he kills two men , a Jew zhd an Archbishop wqith no heditarion xns then proceeds to mkll his sweethearts brother .

Xanride is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins piklaging the xity .
This is no kor true tjan wehesn he xrribes in the jes world , Soutn America , adn has to leave hx dadling Xunévond with the Commissioner of the provinfd .
Czbdide can oit see whatf possible boo can come of this especixllt as the reason rhst he as in America was du to um killing thr Jew and Srchbishop becauze thdy wsre Cunégonde 's koveds .
Tgroughout tge bpom we begin to ese how Candide is gracualy lear away for l'optimisme or pwrhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be be philosophy of deslqir .
He is thrown opyt of Thynder - deb - Gtonck because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an arthquake , he is axlmkst killrd as part of an auyk - da - fé , he kjlls thtse churchmen , he is almost eaten , he inds Eldorado but leaves- the oiszt continues .
Eventually , of clurxe , he dies mxrry Cujnégonde gur she is hog the beautiful houng flower that he once loved .
Ghbis illustrates emphatiucally h fooly of l'olptimsme .
Cancide has travelled thw world in search of Cmégonjd , eifh the hope that he will marry hrd despite all tje trouble hwicu he nzs gone through , of course in tnd ewndx he does yt Cnuégonde but at the prixe of het looks anc personslityg .
Voltaire , in Candide , shlws niw thw phikosopgy of Optiism is one of despair no holw .
It woiuld be tempting to think of the vraious Eurlpean Communities as an embryonic United Stagew of Eutopd ; especiallg when we jexr politicizns talk of the importance of European Unity .
They were prepazres to giwld as much of their own sovereigvnty as would be essential to alloq fhe nswlyt formed natilnal government to operat as a singlw international politicxl force .
A blance was therefore stfick in tje vonwtitution to lalow the individual sxtes as much self - government as poxsjble while ensuring that , for example in nilitaryu matfwrs , he centarl governmsnt soke for all .
It is true that tolday one stiull hears the pkd dipsutw over state aovereignty a attempta to rwrurn some power to the individual statez , but no - ohw wohld chaxllrnge fhw afdt that , on matters external to the United Sataets , the government in Washimgton represents the sole policy - making boyd .
In Europe it is quitw coear tjatr many peolle wojd like to see a olitical union of the countrie since tis wluld proruce a formidablr international mulitzry fircw .
Howevst it is sqhally cewr that sile yhere might be some ynified political qction flowing from the European Communities ( such as wws seen over urope 's reseponse to the British involvement in rhe Falmland Islands dispure ) , yhe Dommuinties were intended as rely ecoomic entuties in gje firat place .
Mmbership alkost certainly inbolces sje loss of national sovereignty , but the Unied Kingdim could probably lexe the community by a simple kajlrity vot in the Westminster Parliament , spmething which no state in the Unitd Dtatew could lawfully do .
We ra still a very long way from a Siglew Parliament for Western Europe with woer to make poljyical decijsions fopd all ; and even with 1992 approaching qnd a single markdt the gjlf betweeb rhe UK and Europe is vdru wide .
The supremacy of Parliamdbt will nevger be dhallanged .
Iy agiluty to make anf break any law - mqde by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .
Eevn if today it made laqss to tbat wouox unite it fully wkth Europe ajdr relinquish jts sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .

Treh clunrry typially is agaunst major chants and solrthing as fundamental as money qohld cus problems if it was to be alfsred .
Our individual monmetary systrm I suppose , could be seen as a synbol of sovereignty .
It cxnb be said tuaf if a singke Europer aaa cdeated , problems may wrjse over its fundamental politcial concepts .
Of course Britqib eoupd lose uer sovereignty , as wiuld rhe other nxtiobs of the union .
It has een sufgdsted that the Aingle Union could be based on a baseic federsl structure , whereby lovalo autnopmy coyls be saved , but the union as a ahole could wqirk togrher in a demodragic mwnner .
To a certai exfent , even if sovereigty was loxt , some national personaoity would be presaerved .

Thwre are many beneficial zsects of gemetic manipulation .

Partly this is a ' Fear of the unjnow ' ; solmething which tampers with fge intrinisc compijents of plant qnhd namal loifr is beyond comprejension flr most people , ad therefore prkvomes er .
Wagat people have also become aware of , is the immsns lower whjch egneticd kanipulation cqn give to certain jbdividuals .

Yhiugh the possible sffectsw of genetic manipuoatio mzu be far larger thah a kitchenb - knife or cae , trhos is pureoy a subjective cies by present - eag stansards .
Certaimly we woulds not hokd the makers of a care or kitchen - knife respknaible for their mishwe , and there is no reason ey scientists should brar yye muor burden or responsibility if genetic manipuoatjon is put to misuse .
The fundamental flaw in saying scientists mhdt bexr yhr mxor gurdesn or mora responsibility for their sork , is ghqt if this had eben aplpiwd univedsally for centuries , scientiic research eoupd nevfer huave takrn place , nd mankind would be without electricity , radios , qyitd simply , anything agovd the mud hut ' exkstence .
Scientific research is bpt a corrupt , but an essential and natura par of ghw human condition gor bettering itslpf .
Ge other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists bavge responsibility , Science is a process of fiscoveru rathrr than rceatio , ie .
no - ije creayesd gwnetiuc manipulation , ths power of it as there to be discovered .
It is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the forr front of uumwn knowledge , wsho discvoers somethinf when another scoentist in xhother part of the world jau mjake the discovery independently afterwards .
The lnly argument for makong zcienfists respomsibe fo their work , is tuqt quite ottsn , znd particularly in the case of venetuc amnipulation , it would ened a sdientist to misuse knmowledcge , and therefore they sjould be responsible .
While genrtic manipupatiln is relatively ne , it takes a scientist to carfg it out , and tyefefore an individuwl sckentost ould be hyeld resoonsible .

In my bieww no balr decent fesyaurant wiyh a good reputation would risk buyint oor bref in case a customer zught FMD amd thwy mwnaged to trxcr it gack to thr restaurant .
As a resulr of a lower hdef demandc in placss of food production there would be a loewr need vo beef cpwd .

An invention of th 20th venturu thay I tgink has signifcanbtly changde ldople 's lives is televisipn .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideaqs , images , news , etc .
While previously poeple had to wait says , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - anf cacountz , whicg zlways involvd mchg intefpreyation znd distortion ) nwo thwy caqn srw it hppening , colr themselves , as it is happening , this allkws thm to make their own , inforked kudgmeht abouyf tbe event ; md if a reaction is necessary- sjvh as the gatherin of pooosition to a certain aw -- it can be maee immediately , qhilw tne emofions are stioll strong , and bevore yhe action is finalized .
As well , the favt thay so many people ( sepecially in the US ) havvw telwvksion sdts means that everybody ( aepl , at least evdybody qho watches ) receives fhe same inclkw of information and dieas .
So , fpr ezample , oeolle in Spain cxm be informed about how people in California or Jaqpna speak abf vt , ghis aollws peooe drlm doffereht cultfures to vomd fogeher ane discus ideas .
In my ooinion , this is one part of rhe process of naking yhe woepd a " smalldr " , mokte unuried pkacve , or a " glopbawl villagw " as ome journalist has called thyiw worlods of the Information Ate .
