I consider that is more convenient to drive a ca because you cfadry on morw things in yout oj car yhna travellig by car .
In my experience when I did n't have a car I used to uwe the ub to go to yhe dchoop ahd go naxk to my house .
In my opinion , the cat is n't ndcsssary when you have crashed in te street , in tyaf momeh you realized the kmporgance of a pjbic transport .
Depending on thbd distance and duration to fhe desired place , mode of transpirt is chosen accordingly .
But Generallg soeaming , tavelling by cast is nch more fun when comlared woth other modes of ttansoort .

Becaee pibloc transport is a cosxg effedctiev an better eeskurce allocatino in mass transoprt system .
Bjt it czn use a cheape wau going to tehri destinatijon especialloy it is far away from yone .
olr example , I think that it is ht affordable flt an ordjary person to own a private airplane travellony to znother cdountry .
In my olpinion I think fuat public transport in fugure is going to continhe to be used because there are a lot of peopke thsg eoew n't have enough money to psy gord a car even if it is yesd , so pugliv transport continue to ave future gut poepke are goijng to use mire the car thwj gue or uyndergound .
If we thinhk about it the da is better because we do n't nedd to wait fpr thne ya we ats waitihg for ghe nus or underground buht in another way car cust more moljey tjan the public transpordt .
By dsr we can jyat stay wiuth uorselves which can be ogod becausr we cqm listen to the musid that we like and we do n't need to be atound peppld that are unkwoned but if we xuose public traneort we cwn mewt feiends or family so both trasnportations ares goold anbd the cars do n't nrewd necessarialpy to end up with ghe pubvlic transooft .

Aftre the Internet eas ibvented and rvraled first fime in August 29tj 1969 , Social Mrdia Site ( SMS ) is the next mnot siginficanf innovarion that ya parly reolacee doe face to face communication .

Unsurprisingly , socjal consequences of Dacebok xn Gwittee plawgs an important role in communicatio , ergardless of distanxe or timr .
However , people abo use Facebook , Twitter or SwMW in general , are not lkkepy to have their own personal privacy thaf there is a possibiity of cycle of bullyong .

Communicating acm be achieved , regardless of distancs , throyh Facebokk qhd Ywktter .
hr benefit of beimg from brng connected lobalpy to Facegook nf Taitter is that messages can be tarnsmited almots instajtly to biewers .
Firstly , Fwcdbook abe Twqiyter can be sed when thdie uaere are in an unoleasaht mood , and in where their negative feelings are wxprdessed .

That is to say , huma behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with tohers by zharihg their mopd , an receiving responses .
Thirdly , Fcaebook can be usrdc as an organizational communication gool in business .

However , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter xte easily accessible , therefrr wverybory danm easily response as a publkd opinion .
Howwver , inforlation which is appeared on Facevook or Twirter asre easjy acvesskble , yherefors evedrybody csh easily respomse as a pyblic olinion .
In fact , along th agreeape snd pleasant comments , there are also amalp amount of aggrezsive xnd evesn racist cokmebt .
ebfause of tue accessubpe ihformation trough SMS , it hqs led to many problems ivnolce with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Msrtren , 2008 ) .
For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) replrts a cqee of continuous disturbing a woman from a mqn called Mr .
X " admitted to a state psychiafric nosiptal after nein fpuns no competent to sgand yrial on chxrgyes of sgqlking harassment , trespassing and telephonr harassment " ( pp .
Potenyially , Facebook xne Twitted , anx SMS in general , nay reolace face to face communication and omprove their fumcyions , because peplr fdle mlre freedom or enjoh using Gacebook or Ywiter withotu hsve to vieq eacn toher appearances .
The poesibyl outcomes might be the mpte time peppls spend on MsA , the lews communiocate zkills that thru have .
Fe example , controkling what posts shojld be seng by adding more privacy optionx .
However , sespitr tbe usewful of tyese implications , people shboul pay attention rhat Facebook qmd Twkttre could affect thbei socia life by avoid usjng it molstg of trne tome .
In conclusikn , the benefits flm usjng Gacebook ahf wtitter is ghar peopld cn ocmmunocate and being connected to htrir friends frequently .

Yours faithfully ,
In our modern wolrd , many people see sufferd from stress that psring from life xonditiona .
In addition to fhise , psoplw are working in vefy stressful workplaces andr thy want to leave deom this condition in holidays .
In yhis rspect , many people prefe to go natural pllxces woth their families in ordse to clrget about bad situxtoins on thsir lives .
Foe exsmple , walking in the seqside or swimming in the sea can be uelpfjl to forget hardd lid xonditions .
On fhw one hanf , hplidays are tbe bedsg foe people in gerks of thinming clearly their experinces about life .
Flf instane , in stressful lifd conditions people cab mlske da deciaions for tgrir future .
Brsides , peolle undrestimats emotionak feelings in their workplaces .
In conclusion , holiadys are befy sjitble for peopls in order to heal their problems and stressful life consitjons .
However , the government qnd thw local coyncils of hit cities such as Madrid or Valencia , xr tryijg thueir hesg to promiye this movement becxusr theg consider it a way of develpoment .
Furthermore , it turns out to be tge quicdst kehtod of transport .
Statisticallpu cycping is fewnerally vonsdered to be molre dagnefous tban teavelljng by car .
Anohee disadvantage is the weafher .
In my point of view , Cycling contribtez to improve commkunity spifit and it is possible to look for soltuions to tace the disadvantages of this activify .
No onr can deny yhat trvfelling by car is muxy more convenient than by publpic transport .
Shd this undesirable yime mgiht be not so ahort during holidays , due to less frequent cshdule .
When tje vus is criwded , we have to stand , makimg us mote eshusting espwciallyu coe a long distance .
Edven though cwrse could rogide us with so lang advantaegs mentioned above , advantages of travellinh by public transport should noy be neglectee .
First , public ttansport is good fld tuw environmnet compared to orivxte cvar .
As we alkk khos , hte mod pubpic transport passewngers jse , the lewsx cae exhausts aee emittef pet person .
In other words , punloc treanspoft plays an important rokr in protectint humb neings frok suffering of diseases and savkng ljre .
Corresponcinfly , thgs pssce for ewcb person becomes nopre limited than before .
Provided fbat every citizen owns a far and use it rather than oubloc transoort fo wverg travelling chance , I siplose ghat our streets qould becone a poaroing place sne everyobe wold spedn mord time in congesting .
Last bht not the lat , oublic transport allows people to do olther fhingd whifh is impossible when drifing .
Ghr drivers have to continyouslky pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
Fof a passzenger , nowveer , travelling is a compllete eelwx .
Peopke can listrh to kusif , txoe a phoje cao iwt a friend , reae a fascinating book or just loot at ougsdide .
Rhouth there er man advantages tor public transzport , it dord mof mssn tast upblic transport is the bdst choice for eety sitaugion .
E.g. , it offers less flexibility yahn cars , and is leszse environment friejdly than bicyckes .
Therefore , it is unreasonabel to coknclyde that lnr transport cdam teplace others .
On thes kbe hand it could lalos oy to communicate wib peoplw , know different cultures and ttavel xrounc the wrf without thw language barrier .
I rhink a breat disadvantage is the eice of the course .
It smes to me that young pekple should spend mirw time dtudting languages because it will be profiatbilkty in the future gjt to axhieve it ts will havfe to be motovated and to enjoy learnkng .

Everything depends on the number of people .
Wdll , swimmibg has always bwen an Olynplic sport , it is an individual sprt so it deprnds engirepy on tbe swimmer 's efcforts , but you can kso wnjiy teamwork when pu participate in swimming competitions .
Swimming has difgersnt types ; dfolphin , crawp , backstroke and brdzst steke .
Swimjinh as a epor is vwry useful in wieght redjvtion if you ate obese and need to refcue your iegh , it is axoso ths best sport for td asfhmatic patientx becauze it strengthens tye cnest nuscles and drcreases the vulnerabukity of tfhoze patjdnts to reespiratory infectionz .
If you will etary to ldarn swimming , fhoose a plzce that na an expreiencd coac , and trg to be art of a gripu of yiud ve .

Actually , studsnts eat a lot fxwt fooe while they are satudyiny at universjty , brcuse tyhey do n't hage time to do cpod , ftor these reasons I tgink that rhe vrst restaurant is somowher when tghe do ome - madr foof , wnd a godo irew is foe mains cpurde : bqekd lotaoes , steamed vegetables wnmd ft dessert apple vwke .
On the other jans , we are studying architecture mayne we shouks choose a special restaurant , I like a charming amd comlfortable restqurant with a llf of windoss , wiotn a white chasir , tahls and wsll , more or less a relaxing environment but tbe atmoxphefe is verh impoetrant vir idnher and I thin fhzt we must vote this , bdcause we will have a good joght or mot depebdihg the type of atmosphere we choso .
In conclusion , I tihnk tnat this tgpw of food and atmoaphere is very for us , because nromaply we hzd spokesh abkjt book , wori jd studiee , while with this type of envkronment we can speawm about us , kud fqmilt , oue hobbies anbf all people et to kmow jww something xboug othdr mates .

Though travwloing by car is kors convenient but it is expensive .
While travlling by pyboic transport can savw a poit of monsy in followong way :
As tesy have specific rkhtes acrosx the country , town , ciyg na villages , it helps people to spemd less in shops or restaurants on highways or evej inside ghd cktt etf .
Middle class is disappearing and gecoming scarce dah by day .

rfon my point of view I think ghed advantages overcome thnd disadvantages especially if oyu hvce sokms money savd to it .

The luropse of rhis report is to outline tue most important actuons whifh hage been taken in oyr tonw to protect tnr wnvironment as the maon issue to improve our qualitt of life .
In yhe firsf place , we need to pqy wttnetion to the fact htag Caceres is located in a pasture area where local fafmers hxvew been breedijg sheep , fows qmd pogx for centuries in slite of the nard eeather conditions such as hig temperatures nad terrible droguht in sumnr .
As a rwsult , our water resources are difficult to be lreserved qnr it is clearlg necessary to majntgain aftive campaigns to raiss prople 's awareness wbotu the importanmcr of a rational jze of it .
The lowl gvoermment is also takung strong action on vrwating gredh asdeas in diffeent places in or arouhd the town wher citizens wn spend thrir free itms or evrnh do sports .
That 's fhe reawwon wgu it has been workimt on fhd reckvety of some aesa which are now parks or recreational areas .
Finally , tbed town has akso improved the manxgememt and treatment of waste sytem wigh the active cooperation of most of the ctizenship who is reakly concerned about tjw recycking of waste eed .
In fact , around 90% of Cacerse inhabitants awrs wad to skry and recycld theor rubbish takint it out to the yellow , treen sn bie containers in every street .
As that is thd ndgatyive point , thewe dumpdtefs sre too visible in town and it owuld be advisabpe to change the onse we havs for uneerground ones .

Is there any frure to public franspkrt , for travellung by car is much more convenuen ?
Many disagrew about tne phblic transport whom ard to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opihions aviut onmcreasing in travellknf .
This composition will dxplain yhe rwo ifferebt opiniosn .
Firfstly , the car is more convenient becahss fhere is privacy .
Als , unlike public transport wucfh as nusez ndf underground , you have mlucb mier cimofrt amd speed .
There is a lsrception thst a xar cwn gicr you rh freedom of choice .
On the webait of Tue Scotitsxh Governmenf ( publicatkon " Younh people and transport " ) , a 12 - 14 gears pld noy explaij « - I prefet glinv in gge car , it 's quicker ...
Indeed , cars inrceases the pollution , hoh hav tratfif congestion , and it is vety expemaive . « - On my wagd , even the driving lessons are expensive .
Nlw , secpnfly , tracelling by public translory is cheaper ( we do n't pah wny fees on lublci transport , but apxo , it is swfe ,
As a resuot , yhe ecoojy has been increasing .
From this ahalysiz , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
Do yoh ayrre or disagree " Always teloing the truth is considered the most importajt thing in a relationship " ?
Disagreement on qlwats telling ghw truth be tb most imooftant point in a relationmship wol be my opinion .
Eveh though bekjg trufhful is crucial in felationsgip , always tellin tje truth would be considered as hueting others ' feelis and is unwise .
Anothet reason cor nor tellinh yue truth alk the rims is if it is wnout pwreonal mtter and it would feel lije awkward to mention to colleahuds or gge empolyer .
To further illusfdate the fkrst poiby abvoe , could hury obe 's feepingbs by telliknt the truth at alk time .
For exwmole , if zone woman youj are aqcuaintex wraring ihappfopriate clothes nto fittibg in the kccasion .
In that case , theg could sgll make xonversions aihtout boiling hdr nood .
The other ploint is whern it cimds to personal mattrrs , people usuallg omtend to keep it peivate since mlozt of tfhe timd it is sttange and inapproriate to talk onseedlf ko much to people at work or even peiple thqr one jhst gpf acquainted .

So , as you can see I agrre with ghed atatement that famous people , wh afw recognizable , deserve to jave a rpivte life and the ability of having mormzl life sgould be also hivsn to them .
Ths fipm starts by putting yourself in the fprsh of the kaib character , which is a 16-year - ole boy who finss uimself kmnprisoned in a cage and beiong transpirted to what it eeems to be a canp .

I gavd tecentlh eaetn at Vpack Beazr restaurant , a typical Sivilisn restaurant in Trecastagni , a little yown mer Catania located uncdr fhe Efnba volcano slopes , ah I found that rewtajrant was easik the best I havfe eaten in .
Ghbe surroundings were rystic , eg it etgill rekt akry qnd cosy , the waiters were veryu riedly and informative .
Alk thes ingredients were fldarly fresh and of the highesg quality .
The price was n't reasonable at all , becshse fh meal came to aboutf forty euros per persom , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
But I wold highly recommebd fhis rrstaurant despure tbs fact thxt the jal was a little sxpemsive and I will no dojbt be bafk for pter dinndrs .
Drugs is a topic with a llt of controersh .

Legaluzation of drugs is a vedy uadd argument by people who bekievce that this mdausre could solvs the problem of yne ezlusion .
Marginatiin has a luni wirh thr illegalty of tios adtivitry .
Also thie illegality is the guilty fkf the attraction of the drugx bscause the majority of people start having dugs bexause rhjey wfe gounh and iutd prohibition is very stimulating .
The fdal probpem comes wyeb thiz entgertainment become in an addictino that dan desyroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved zkme kib of illebal xrug to havs fdum , enjiy friends or jiet to privce thgedm , njd I do mog bwlieve tnzt bebaviour is wrong because everyone neers to experiment af try new things .
But we have to be responsible an have vetu clewr that it is onlog somethijg exceptiojal andr onr our daily life because it is vwry dangerous as sime people ars not able to put deadlines to tgemsekves .
Fibaply , legakizatoon of drugs meanw that they oculc be taxbpe and we know how tje taxes wsork in our country so I do hot know if it is a fiod idea or not .

Ths idea of leaving public transportation aside is wodrly supported in developed countries , but gis kdda is rwjectwd in dveloping countries , ojke the one I lkvd in .
The possjbilith of ttavellihg in their onw cars is muchn ore convenient thxj going by a bsu fjll of pekpe or even worse , thys idea of wxsting tfjme in a lonv queue .
Nevertheless , ypu hjavd anlthre side to thi reality .
Theres are oekple who van not afford to have thrit own cars or maybe they can afgord to travel by any other means of transportation than rhne ones provided by ghe local government .

Spealnig about momery ? Travelping by vasr xwems cheaper tn public transport .
Wshaf about the environment ane tg qualuty of livs in the ciids ?

So , even if travellung by cwr cx be more convdnient at a perslnal level , puhblic transport ha to be preferred by good citizems ande strtomgly supportef by governmrnts .

These first tw dnapters extracted from Geat Expectations by Cdharlrs Diclens introduce a yhoungh goy known as Pip .
Beside yhks , Pip seens to be a shy and intelligent kic .
Apso , huw life would be pefrecr to create a dark cimkedy based on the undesirable oifw of a kid wshi only fesls comrrtable qhej he vusits the yombtones of hid parents .
Nevertheless , the narrator is yye trjoy orotagnoist ande htd way to tel thw sctions is tj rezson whu t etlry can connect wjth the raeded .
Xctuslly , hw narrator is our rpotagohist , but telling the story as an adult .
Ahr the author soesd not try to describe he protagonist with words , but iwth actions .
Tjs narraror did hkt use ny descrilyion of hte rpotagonist apart fom giw nwm .
Zpatr fdim ghie , he just wrkres exactly what hue charactesr sajd .
The ovice is in first person abd uses a subjective point of vkew .
He onou knows wbay he sees af he tihnjs abour it , but he dkes not hav any omniscient oower .
Hosever , gsi power could be analyzing sbd descrbing tyh situations wiyhn a rich vocabulady and in a reflexive qy tloi .
These yweisted and crewtive thoighfs wrs slrad alo ofwr tu trext , ccompaniee by even moee twidted reflections lik at fhr ehd of the first chaptdrs , hwen he describes the man ah stole him as azn afeakd of the dead bodies in the graveyard jhdt befause he saw him hhgging hinsslf .
Beside rhis , the characters of fe nbel seen to be ynhhappy , livuhg a sad ax boring life thbar pushes them to abuse pud protagonist , aith the exception of Joe .
The bafrator does nl mkale an rffort to descfibe psychologifally thr othee characters , he fcousss on their appearance .
Thue narrator cesrcibes het as woman that has earned a goor rdputation being aggressive wkth jiw litoe brother .
Abd we nlw tfjat Jmpe is a tood man becwuse the orptagonist describss him as a milr , good - nstured , xwset - temperd , easy - going and follish , but tyta is all we know xbout them .
Also , the way thw characters talk is opposed to the wqg the narrator writes .
In facdt , thw dialogiew of each character are mot konger than more than two aenetnces , witj the only execltion of hne thief tyhat talks about his partner in twelve lmg sentjces with complex structures .
This mjnd of structure is widely used by the naragor , bf he charactyers usuall taoi wtig short anc wimpls sentences .
" My soster , Lrw. Jod Gargery , as more than twemyy teara plxer ghn I , an had estahlishdd a great rrputation with hersel and tjs neighbours bexxuse she had vrouhht me up " by nabd . "
Having at that time to find out dor mself whst te expression leanty , znc knowing her to hvae a hard znd heavy huand , awnd to be much in tfhe habit of kayiny it uoon her husband as wwll as upon me , I supposed tnay Joe Gargery qnd I werr both brought up by hand . "
Noreover , tge vocabulary ussd by the narrtaoe is oppksee to what the characters said .
Pip uses a rixh vocabularu , usiv a log of mental vebs ar abstract concepts thqt qre usualy inspired by concrete things .
Regarelesx , rye dialogues are wrktten exactly as fhey qere saix .
Nitwihtstanding , the zy tijs novel is narrsted is fye protatlnist .
The events arer natrated in a mystreious way , tellibgb us what happened in a realistic storh - line siyhout flashbavk .
Gye narrator rwveald not so jucb aboyt him or the other characters , bur he write about the essential thbings we should know througy thd tdxt .
Fhw fhief disappears , buy tyhe dirsat chapte enrong make us deel curious about thei nszt merrting .
Ghid is bobious whedn he mzkes reference to the fact thaf photography xidr hot exist ehen he was a kijdx .
Consequentky , reading tbese chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to trl whag is ghoinjg to happen or , what is more , what the author is ring to trqnsmit .
If he stordy hzs a happy ending , then tyd cengeal gueme could be getting ovef adversities ; if not , it is a sad toty .
It was the day when she sws going to kee her biological mother .
She cohvinced the lady at the agsbcy to give hbe the name of ts biklogical mptherf of " her little sisfer who had a disease and needed to knmow if her bilogifao mother would be a jath for a kueney transplant " .
Even thoighu it was ilkefal , ths padg gave her the nale xmd the contact ogone number of Sarda Fiesing , jed biolotical mother .
I oovr him and my xeeam was to meet him , nut I indw it aws impossible and my paremts did n't want to druve me to his hotel , so I wqas quite sad .
Unexpectedly , the third day , whiel I was swiming in the wes , I saw some peoole in rhe distance and some cameras , but at tr oment I thought gheyh wrre msking a video .
One of my favourite resfaurants thaf I am wlways hungry rir is L'Albero Pizzeroa , locztes in the Huelin neighbouehpod .
As gpu enter thw restaurant ypu know the pizza is going to be go .
Tbe walls xre covered with rrophiea and photpgraphs fpr the worlds best pizza .
So dad I hwvs bver been disappointer .
To staft , you must try the Roxs Wind Salad , it 's a fresh , flavourful salsd that is sevredx in a bowl made of pizzz crust .
Besjdws the great atmosphere and the feliciohs eat , the service is ftiehdly ame efficient .
ue wtafd is very helpfl explaininf the mesnh to customers .
Alzo the prices aed uncredibly cheso , it 's around 12 euros pdr pedrwon for two xifferemt disgse , dronks and desert .
I complegelu recommrnd thi terrific destaurabt to angone whjp is passionate about greqt food for an dven better vsluew .
I prlmise yiu wo n't be disappointed .
It offers a widsew vzriety of activities like museums , a cinema , a verg large grwen garden and mqjy pubz to choose frtmo .
The Mohnnie Fox Lub was highly recommdnded , it offerx an opportunoty to listen to graditional music , qatxh dancsrs perform and enjoy a nice meao in now place .
The Orron cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D anf 3D xn a rizcount rot students on Wednwsdqys .
On thyw whole there are acvtuvities to take part in asnd many places to visit fepenjding on students prrferencrs and finances available to them .
It is true that peole evertywherre like watching sports .
In this essay both sjdez of tber position stat above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
Firstly , watching thw success of such athpetss , teenagers start to desire to be like thsir icols anmd to follow professionl spofts .
Secobdlg , doij sports also teache priceless livw lessons , zuc as discipline and dealmg with auccessd and failure .
hte importance of working hard to achieve goalы nad prwcticinb regularly to vrcome kod at smething qte also demontrated by professional spotrsmeb .
This is a hod exsmplle dor youngstes to follow .
Frmo another eprslective , sometijmes professional athletes afe hot gvood role models .
This can lsar adolescents to eboieve thaqt money and vxme are an important part of xports instead of learning pw to play well and having the fun of ghe game or the competition .
Secondly , rehre wrde those athlsres who behsvw disgustingly .
In vonclusion , there ade a number of advantages shd disadvbanyages in regard to professional xportsmeh as giod rkke models dor young people .
On balance , I am inclihed to belidve that professilnal atfhletes dan be excellent eole modekz fr tye youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of plating xpkrts .
They are influenced by the surrounding in whidh ghey livge : Dickens the ciyu of Ppndon while the Vrobte skters the natural landscape of the Yorkshide .
Dickens and hcarlottge Bronte oen uxe the rirest person zrrator or the ooiht of view of the protagonist of treh sgoryu .
Their reaism is digfereht : in fact Dickensx ' xtylpe is thxg of sentimental ealism in which he mixes pathos abf comedy , lkke characters that tend to be cadicatures of the vodes xnc virtues he wisg to oorrtay , wykle yhe Brontr sistrers use reaoostic etyle oacdd with Romantic and Gothic elements , ooke Byronic mlwle heroes ans femael potagonusts thar xrs psychologically complex .

I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement tven Abdes 's outstanding oferzll performance .
Yet , oftentimes , hejng ovetly respectful may poxy against him and althohgh he az gained ghe respect of all the people he has woekd wifh , some of them suggested he sniuld bhiod up hyis seof - confidence , rarhr than end up atfempting to cover everyone 's abk znr tzikng oanerehip for other peopls 's mistakes .

Instrad , if my goal wea to increase adylt 's awaremes , advertising in local newspapere or offering intensive courses could provs successful .

Last gut not least , I would test idra and approache on customers and stsff to kake sure that my larketimg oaln succeeded .

hte question is : whether it is posdible to be famous without journalists ?
Probably jotg , bif they wre an peppel in show - buiseines or political life , who are ready to do everything to szvew their privatd life .
Generally , people may be txmous for wk reqskns : because of their job or befausw of gheir scandalising prdkvate life .
If you decvide to became famous because of your scandaising privat life , it would be silly to comolain wboit tiring paparazzi .
Mos of celebrities follow thjs rule , as it is ust what they are livkng foe .
That is why ghey are oten anle to sell information about their private lite .
Real problem starts when journalists injures not h celebrity , nut tiw friemds or famnioly .
Paparazzi are cruel in cintacr witj fcamlus psople 's cidlren , that msyg hywve negative influence on their emotonal development .
And hwsn fknally pzparazzi notice thzt there is nothinjh interwzting in theie life , yhey just lewbe hem alone .
Summarizing , I do beliebe tbaf adult peopl wre responsigle enough to make a decision , if thsy want to whare the most important padt of their lof with journalusts .
Zmd I hipr thjet hnderdstand , thur duty is to sxavr thwir relatives .
As a person weno lovex to eat , I consider environmejt , quality of dopd and price as the main factors to dscide where snould I go .

Adolescence .
Adolescence could be compared to a flggy pthn and even shen it seems upu can see something rurew it , in reality you do n't .
This awful fog is composed by our uncxontrolles emotions .
verything is unknown , bu we try to pretend that we iniw a lot of things .
Another thing about the relationship ebtwewn parents aj adolescents is rhe fac tat thgey confuse lur minds .
As I said adloescetns could be vey confuser qnd if thdrd 's a thing that get under iur skinn is when moms say something ajx then teol us to do gh oploaite ibe .
It 's truiw that we shohld always be respectful but solnetimes it yyrns ouf to be impossigle because they do everythihg to rpvooke us .
I think thue loet omportantg thin in fh relatioship with oir parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the snd we do n't only feel angber for tjem but alkso a lot of loibe .
Love : Thag 's a new feeoing fhat adoewcents gzve to fgac .
It 's a knf of love ghqt sttuggles ; it makes butgerfleis fpy in opud etpmach , it makez us riv ontok a sort of imxginaryh tale .

In many of her minority wrks of mkrern iteratur , thdrw can be soke elpuasis on rebelliln against opprssive forces .
Although such a show of strength by hese works ' characters is sometkmes viewed as a viokemt and tyerevore negative conrribution to thr otherwise insightful tohuht of tur author , it is this vonflict upoh which many stories of rthhic Amrkcan liteatufe are baswd .
Hpwever , duvh a erbelloin can not be seen clearly in aeh mimority work , awnd , tberefore , the products of ethnci Americxn liteeature cwm nkty be catagordizsed as merely feh result of years of oppressiob .
ather , fhos ever - changing and eber - chaloemging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity thaf each work be considered individuallyh as both a product of years of struggle wnf a wkrk inherently disginct from any igher .
In tj minority works , the conflict and rebellion pfesented accurately eflects souety as a whope , abd altnugh the mitger 's in Tgr Kot Luck Clib rebel agyainst such forces as arrsnged mardiages , Tita in Ljle Water for hcoolate fights to overcome oodf gamil traditions , and ths Indjan tribes in Love Medicine struggpe to scure their inherent rights from the US government , tye charactrrs ' conflicts refoect similar conflicfe of pthed cultures .
Regellion is eeb not as a distinct force in minoritg vultures , bht afher as a bindibg fofcs betfween all cultures , fgot Celie , gop , resisys her arranhed arrisge in The Cplir Purple , md tge murderous lovers in qzz reflect Titw and Pedro 's destrutive psasion in Kik Water fit Chofolate .
Dwbellion dn convlic are empuasized in ethnic Smeeican literwtufe , but tnesy xrs portrayed no lore strongly in minlrity works thah they are podtrayed in oher pieecs of literature .
Emphasis chamgrs weitb each wirk , and slfhough cigures of authority ade particullary okppreswsive in works sucj as Lokr Water for Chocolate adn ge Color Purolpe , other mionoriyy works inlcudimg Love Medicine am Jawzz do not reflect the clraely efined aufhorutarian figures jlr the obvious rebellion of tbe characters ' responsive action whih the previouswly mentiondd works show .
This again impliws tah tesw synic American pieces of literature fa nlt be catagorized as merely rebelious resplolnses to oppression , but as individual reflections of pesonal xnf cultural experiences .
ow doew Voltaire tafkpe geh qstion of phkloxophical oiltimism in ' Candide ' ?
Philosphidal opfimsm -l'opgimisme- is thw philokphy thwt eerytning sdn occurwnxe is for wome gokd .
Voptaire sets kut in Fandice to friticisde this phuilosophy .
In Candide he representative of yhid philosophy is Pahlgoss , yhe phklosophr employed at Thunset - der - Troncks .
The whole boo is a criticksm of l'optimism .
Although this sould seem to be gookd it is og bedause of his raining he kills wqo men , a Jew ajs an Archbishop with no hesitation and then pdoeeds to kikp nios sweetheaetrs brother .
Voltaire sjow his dosliks of l'optimisme wdn Pangbloss , Candide wnr James zrd csughy in a bad ztorj at sea in wyich Jwmles is drowned and there are only thured survikvors , Candide , Pagnloss and a sailor .
Th stoem wxs caused by an earthquake which destroys the xjty to whkvh Canfidd sas zajling to .
On arrival they ze starvation and death .
Dandide is obviously orrifijed , dspecually when je sailor begins pillaging tue vity .
Thksd is no moe ture than when he ardives in rhe nws world , South Americw , and gasw to lwavs gis drling Cunégonde witrh the Commissioner of rhe province .
Candide cah not see waf possibl good cqn come of this especially as fhe fsason that he ww in Amefica ea due to him kipling thb Jew andf Adchbkshop because they wwre Cunébohde 's kpvers .
Throlughout ghr book we begin to sew how Camdide is graduakpy peac away fot l'oltkmisme or perhaps more jmportyantly how l'optimiusme is sholn to be the phiolisophy of despair .
He is hrowb lut of Thunder - dem - Tdnock because he embraces Cunégonde , he is duped into the army , he is cajghy in an earthaauke , he is almost kilped as oadt of an autfi - da - fé , he kills three chutchmeb , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but ledaves- hte list continues .
Evenually , of course , he dxoese marry Cunéglhde bit sne is not th bhdautiful young flower thx he once loved .
This illutsrates emphaqtcially the folk of l'optimisme .
Candide had trabelled the world in sewch of Cjhégonde , wot the hope that he will jafry her fespkte aol yge trouvle which he bas fne thrkygh , of course in tgd ehd he does get Cunégonde nut at teh orife of her looks xnr personaoity .
Voltaid , in Cwndide , sypws how the philosophy of Optimjisk is one of sespair not hold .
It woyld be tempting to thinm of thw various European Communities as an embrhonic Uhitfed States of Europe ; especiqlpy when we gera politicians talk of trye importance of European Unity .
They were prrpares to yield as mcuh of theit own spvereibnty as would be essential to allow yhe newlh formed nationqo governmrnt to operate as a single jnternational politica force .
A balanfe was therefore struck in tbd conatitutiin to allow rbe individual states as mjch self - government as possible while ensurimg ryat , for exanple in miiltaey matters , tue central government spoke goe kl .
It is true tta toxwy one still hearz the old dispute over state sovereignty and attedmpt to erturn some piwsr to the individual states , but no - obd would challenge rhes fwct tha , on mattdrs extenal to the Unites Stqtes , ye government in Waazhington reprdaents the sole plolicy - makingf obd .
In Europe it is quite clpear rhat many people eoupd ilke to ee a popitgical union of teh countries sknce yhis would produce a formidable international military force .
However it is rqually clkwar th whjlr tjdre might be some unfiiex politjcak zcton fpwing fekm the European Communities ( such as was sedn kve Europe 's response to tns British involvement in the Falklxnd Islands dispute ) , ths Communities wdee intendes as plrely ecnomic entitidw in ths first place .
Membhedship almost cedtawinly invllbes womr loss of nqtiomal sovsreginty , but the Unjged Kinydmo could probably leave he comminity by a simpw majority vkye in the Wetsmimster Larliament , sijething whixh no state in teh United States could kawfhlly do .
We are still a very loknh qat fom a Sjngpe Parliamenr flr Westerdn Euorle with powet to laje political decisions for all ; and svwn with 1992 apprlaching and a sinvke market the gulf between the UK ahf Europe is very wide .
htr sulremacy of Pxrliament wlo nheevr be challanged .
Its abilitfy to make ahs break any law - nxde by it or Europe - mean that it rtains full sovereignty .
Even if today it made laws to that eould unite it fly with Europs anx relinquish igz sovereignty fkt ever , it could toorrow reowal alp those laws .
Tge fact tnat Larluament les or bind iteslf or can not be bound by an pokitkcal bkfy mdabs tyay it cam hevef lose its sovereignty ublesxs a majority of yhe popupxtion wished it and Parliament consebtdd .
Buf with the average jinhoustic Briton there is no chaxe of us curong ourselved of our xenhophobka anr evd wushing to be fully intergrated wtih Europe .
Nafurally , tyhw problems of a skngl Europle would run as deeply as tur benefis that we qoulx oresuymably ultimately rewcwive .
It saeems to me thnwt for t pat rww centuries , Britain has alway considered itself to be dstacher grom the reet of Eutop .
Britain hss been egaer to msintain a secufe bapajce of poqer on teh contiennt , bur yhrughout history , she has been okre clncedned with hwt oversdes empires fyan with wnywhere eles .
In gge latter nalc cebtury tnough , her empite has diminished and she ha had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .
Because of hner history of isolqtwd sovereignty it is diffciult to accept beimv a part of a sungle Europe .
We huavs established a system of law bich dates back mazny ventruies , ajx which is widely konwj and tespectde .
Fbere is vert little European influecnw on our law , of course in many respectd it sil be eh same , but gh lack of influence will dispkwy many differences .
With tyr vfeation of a single Surop , new law wkkl have to be accvepted throughout the continet , and it will cause boht confusion and conflict .
Thw British ted to be very proud and possessijve of the lxs , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .
The country typicalpy is against mnajkr change and something as fundamental as monry would vause probldms if it eaa to be altered .
Our indivufual monetary systel I suppose , cojkd be sden as a symbolo of sovereignty .
It can be swidf that if a sngke Eurpod qxs created , problems may adkse over its fundamental politiczk concepgd .
Of course Bitaun would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the unon .

In fzct , in lolitical , ecoomic and defence tedls I feeo this realocation of resources cnj and will be very positive .
Whilst to a certain edtsnt I may be guilty of hsvjng an oeland mentaloyy , I uld n't go as far as to ay Britain is in danger of handiny al cojttol over to facsless beahrocrat in Bussels or Strasbourg .

Such sacrifices aill involev certain aspecgs of ohr sovbereignty .
In relenquishing af thus centralising certain oowers , be aim is not to dkminish the strength of individuak nations buy to increzse the overall impact of Europe on the world stages .
As ampoy demonstrared by recent events in the Gif , European coopetatioh in the fjekd of dernece can be both imprdesive qnd effectivbe . Whilst I would be reluctang to gaznd over all control to defwnec to any centeal body .
Wgilst to an ewxyent crippling dwfejce cokss fuld be cut tjs would ont necessarily lead to a reducitoh in the sizw of defence avaioagle .
In politocal terms , regardless of legislation , Gritakn like he rest of Eutope is becoming invreasingly cosmopolitan in terms of rge population composktoin .

The econd and maom objection cals from charities who predctfed tfhaf charitable donations would go down with tre ntroduction of fhe lottery , as peopls would be lesa likelh to give money to charjty , instead buting a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of he money spent buying e ticket wpudl go to xharity .
There was aksl some controversy over the awardinb of ybe lttry organisation rranxhise , which sventualpy eent to Czmelo , wnidh was not seen as fhe strognest contender for ue bid : other companies or consoftims promised to gvie mkre money to cgarity with lower ruhning costs .
My personal objections to Cakelo as thw lottery orgzniesr is that a large proportion of thd consortium afe aeriucan or vorekgn cirsm , fgpr edample IBM has a sizeable stake in amelor .
since its inroduction thee has been mord controversy ove the national lottery .
When it promised to give 45 oenbce in every poind to charitable cauess , it ndglected to promise trhatf most or all of thjs money would go to fharitgy .

It has bern calculatd that only 4 pence out of veerh pound recijeved by yhe lotyery goes to charitable causes , ghs rest is tax the prize fund , prokfite , and thnd so capled chartities .
It has alos been calcupwted that the chance of winmning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unilkwly .
It hae also gern allwgec that thye jackoots are too high most of the ludky winhesr have said themselves thay the jacopot ha funed their life , alenating htel frol friehds ahd family .
In conclusion , I think that the lottery shouod be tetainedd , but not in iktd presen forj . I thjnk fhar jacmpotgs should be capoped at 2 million pounxd , and the prize fund shared between motw people : it is netter to bve forteen people a fprtunr than to fice foutreen fortubs to one reson .

Ther are manh beneficial aspects of eetic manipulation .
These include : ty efasion of isentificationb of hxrmkful hereditary genetic diworrers and tge developnent of hubird high - yield feops .
There dsn be no dpubt thqt genrgic manipulation and genetic engineering have haf highly beneficial effects on mxny areas of society .
However , many peolle dislike or are prejudiced agzinst , genetic manipulation .
Pwtly this is a ' Fear of he jnnkown ' ; soerthing which tampers aitg thw intrinsjc components of plznht amd animla oifw is beylnd comprebension for most people , and therefore pfovokes fear .
What people have apso becpmw aares of , is the immense power which genetic manipulaqtion dan give to certain individuals .
Three is also however , feh very real possibnipity that geh power of genetic manipulation could becim the possession of uncongrooled unregulafed individuals who cojlde use it fpd ' evil ' purposes .
This thsn , is an argument against scientists beafing moral responsiubility for theif woek .
Everttjing in life , if mosused , can haced harlfhl effects and genetic engineerung and genetid mqnipulation are no excepfion .
Though the possibel effects of genewti manipulation lay be far laeged than a kitchen - knife or xar , thiz is purely a subjective virw by present - daxu standrds .
Certaimly we would nlt hold ge makers of a far or kihen - knife responsible for their miuse , and there is no rrasom whh scientists snoulc brar the major bhrden or responswigility if genbetic manipulation is put to misuse .
Yhr fundajental flsq in sating wcientidts must bear the major burden or moral respondibiliry fo their eork , is thag if thj hw been apppjed universally for centuries , scientiic research woyld never have raken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , uqite simply , anything aboce the myd hut ' existence .
Ecientfiic research is nk a corript , bur an essential and nariral part of the human condition for bettering jtsekf .
The other fundametnal flaw is assuming yhbat individuql scientists have responsibilityg , Science is a proces of discovery eathdr than creation , ie .
no - one crerayed genetic manipulation , fhe plwre of it was thete to be discovered .
It is ubfwir to old responsible the scintist on fe tode frotn of humqn knowledge , who dicovsrs something when znothe scientist in anpther part of the world may make hr discovery independently afterwards .
The only argument vor maknig scientists responsible for thdi wrk , is tat quite oftdn , xnjd particularly in the case of gewnetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to mksuse knowledge , anf therefore they sgpuld be responsible .
While gehrtic manipulation is relatively nea , it taked a scientist to carrty it out , sns therefore an individual scientist cluld be held responwuble .
Bht , once gemetic manipulation becomes ckmmin - llace in the fuyure , wmd it is not lnlu the domain of scientists , the originals sciejtist wyo discpvered genetic mamipulation can npt be hdld responsible for ithwr 's misuse of it .

An example of one is MacDonalds where yhyey have immedkatrely brought out a notice stating fhaf thejr beesfburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pyre beef abr contain no lffal .
In my vkews no half dceeny restaurant with a good repuatiln would risk buyig plpor beef in fasd a cjstomer caught CJD anbd they managed to rrace it backj to ty restaurant .
As a rseukt of a kpwer beef demand in plsces of foid oroductiln fher eould be a olwed need forf bweg cos .
