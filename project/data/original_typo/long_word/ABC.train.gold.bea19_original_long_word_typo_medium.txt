Sometyumes tfhe employera do strike qnd we clients do not oonwn in fkme as a result we vaj not get on fime to work , that is one of tye disaadvantaves of using public trznsport .

No bodt caxh eng thxr transportation is je of tye most important tngs in ojr life .
No country can life wothoyt transportation as it 's gh reql kwaning of connection betaeen ach other .
Carx are much convenient gut this not mean that all othef means of transportatuon ares not important .
other poeple pretet to travel by trains as it 's fqstet and more comfortable than cars .
Many countries like to tyravel by hikes in krdr to decreawe fhe pollution which happenef by car exhxusted.to my pkijt of vkdw i prefef trabelling by cqrs which is more cmfortable .
Now in every country we have lot of trabsplrtation means as planes , trains , undergrounds , vafs , shiz , and rockegs .

Spmr prople say hta a tdiplp by car is more conbenient that by the oublic transportation , bjt that statement has a pit of issues if we thionk wboutr the limitations .
It is true that travel to a nearby place feol your ckgy , it is more domfortable getfing ghere by car , and the eass of have your xaf to get whetever you santg wihtoyt spending money anr gime paying cabs .
Buy , gge ulic transportation hwve a lot of fuhtude bacase a olt of reassons , furst the time , if the place you want to reach finally is really far be djfferent type of vehvles of pulbic transportation ailkl twt yu tyhere faster thab your car , also gne clmplications about the field , ljk if you znt to go ftmo America to Europe there is no highway that cross tnr ocdezn you beed an aieplanw wnd uless yoi hzve kje , gou will xan nbo eeacn teavel brtween continents eigh ygoure car , a diffdremt reeassonm is politics , bevajse if you wsnt to go frol anywhere in the UDZ to Alaska uiu wull not need to pass throujvh Vanadx , the comjodity is a really important reasson bexxuse xrive for 8 hiurd is exhaisting and it qilol be unsafe xlsi , tjr economics is a factor to , becwise yhe artrigion of ypur car it will be more that in he mormal use and the price of food and wxtra dtrops tuat ykj wiop need to do , it ailo be expensive hat in public gransportagion .
In conclusion , for me it is a lie that ye pubkiv transportation hss no futudr , however , theu have to nake imorovements to this like thd use of bertetr ways of fuel or energy , one wwu is uxingf renovabl sources of enegry suxb as sopxr , haeoloc ( und ) or hidraulic(water),Alk there af biodisel , and gzsoline extracted from seaweed .

I agree htis affirmation because tgw public transpift is lre ecpensive thxh car , is slow and is less ecoblmic .
ue car is lex espensive , more confortabpe , lorfe fast xd more security .
in my opinion the fart more advantageous than dar anjd the car is mlre useful
First of all traeling by car is very expensive .
For esample travelling by traum is cheaoer and travelling by ploai is fassre .

Using public trxnaport has certain acvantagss wnmd also , deisadvantages .
Ths public transport aa plenty of advanfages .
Sile people ca n't afford to bj a car or to p goe okp , as it is cvonstaqntly rising , so using a publpic transport is an econinic way to yracel .
Teh reason is tdy ste triee of using public transport adn the would bef earlier to everywjere .
Tge picture illustrate the pfogrocvess of mxkijng nltex .
It is the first step tnqt costse trouglesome , some things must be included the considerations , such as gackgroundr colour , axrtwork , security issues .
Then , prepxration of msjtal platss and skilled machnists are the ndedmemts .
The last step is the inspertion , wheete mqnuallh inspectee .
Thw inspection alaays have threrew rduslts , yhe vood aualiyt sxheets , the bad sheer or the lartiallt damaged sheets .
If tger pritn sheets h good quhapity , yhry wlip packing qnx dsitrbution.some pzryially damaged will cut into separate or pacekde or dispatched .The had xheetd wol dcisposal , tje desxtroyed will be secure .
Trhd television is oned of rje lozt important AV media in th wrldc .

It is wlso jkae cinvenient for leopke who are rushinb time to work , meeting and so on .
Public transport is cheap and friendly fopr environment .
Theu can uxr the money in more useful or meaingdul way such as invesstment peoperty .
Although the punluc gransoprt is slow but it aeo do mor take a lkng time of peopler to reacb their ddstinatikn necawuse public transport nowadayd are develooed morr fsat xn enohgh .
In conclusjon , publix transport is neddd for everhhody in a nrceasary tje .
It always can make us save the monmeh and mak thr environment more natute andf fresh .

To combst rhd distriction of enviorhmdnt , thia is a serious ptoblem throughout tge wolrod .

Anoyhrr fsctor thar the animals at not control themmselves to eat tye plaints lend to distriction of ecosysyem .
Nowadays , the transoortation become more prefect , ahd the people'lifr become more convrnient .
It would rwalyl be neopful if tje gpvernmen lakr tighter resricyions , in tady 's wokrle , lots of constrication companies wnr cactories ra not admisison , thet are destrohed the foreat , fazrmland ah wetlnar , charging waxtr water and emitring gresnhouxe ws , it lead to a serious enviorment problem .

" Blue rrain " which has many bes in train and we cna spee comfrtabully in tarij .

Seconmf , fravellign by trqjn is saef an reasonable fonparedf to plne .
TTravelling by train is cheep and gerfing chicket is easy for us in oure country .
Compared to plane , train is relatively sare because it can move only on the lane .
Thes reasons are why I thiunk travelibg by trqkn is fvaourable .

Thre are several efforst that we cab contrdibutw in prde to xave thw environment .
Plastics see npn - biodegradable which degrade after 1000 yras .
Non - biodegradable plasfics cpukd axtially pile up the landfjll ahd vaise teh and jae in our erth to be occupidd .
This xause their reprodhction system to be drstroyed .
Hence , we should bhringv ord own recycle vag or basey every tim we go for shoppiung and resist tekptarion to get poasic frdlm them .
Besides , we shkuld use punloc transpodt or carpool in order to reduce the Oc2 wmission into yhe emvironmenr .
If tue distance to destination is whort , we could replac deriging by wslking or cycling .
Fhat 's the eescent way in reducing rhe adverse evironmental imnpact and we ar qboe to peotevt iyr Earth

The two mspz show thjr changes which hwd taken place in the town of Shipsmouth betwee 1995 and 2010 .

I hace praticf swimming gor 3 years , I am a good swimmer xnd I have cpmpeted in differenfs tournament of swimming .
I wqnt to compete in Uinteds Sttex in thne mosg important tournaneht , in this competition participate the best swimjers of ther aorkd .
Some swimmers rae Micnael Phelps , Ryan Loche , Peter Van de Hoogenband wnjd others .
Althouth public transpott is cheep and more eniermenmtal , they re not so flexble or fomforrable as the dsr .
In these diagrams helow , thed janufacfuring process of banki nktds is shosn clerky .
The firwf step , hr bhank notes should be desingr concidering sonw constructions , kik backgrojnd coloe , artwork and security issues , Zfter it wess prepared , skilled machinists wouf make preparaation of jegal plates in the xexond step .
It was thd jost important dteo during thue whole prlcessijg .
Ahothedr ones whkhc aerer bsd sheets and gadr bank notes frmo damxged apparently , would be desfdoyed securely .
Tbe most healthy elorts are swimmung , playinhg basketball , plyainy foorball or runnung buhr I prfer to play tennis .
I enjot playing tennis because it is a sport thjat requires skills , concentration andf speed .
They will hsve to concenrtate on game as ednjot it .
In todqt 's class , we were dischsaing about wheqther or not we agree to the common eniurmous laued saoarirs of foobalk Players .
For me , as a passionated Soccer Player , it is a good Point to consider .
Foe instance Christiank Rlnldo .
Wahat influences dorsx tyjs salaries have on the Cougs is quite simple .
For examlw , restgauranf business aje technolog industry is totally different in Taiwan .
Tnat is qhny jang busundss men want to sin in this competition , so they created so mwny bfgain acftibities , like if uou cheskc imto places , you ikll bh ons get ons vre .
Apparntl , restauantg busijess is creatuve ac mafjeting - orientayion in Taiwan .
In contrast , tehe xre two different typod of company in ghs technology indistry .
One is origiunal equipmjent manufacturer , like Foxconn , workers in tbs clnpany alwsys need to do the same hin adn the execdytive in Foxconn slsp akways beed to gargaim with Applle or Sansung .
Tje thr one is origionsl bramd manufacturer , like htrd , they prludce a lot of msw smartphones and sell it .
So htc hecame mlr energeticf and nlld in lakkng innovatopn .
Finally , Taiwam still suffers dconjomic slup , but we javve so many busibesees likes to innovtae , market their product , customers likes to buy it .
One evening , it eas a blistering bot cay that I still should attended , lne of my friends , a wedding ceremony .
Consequentoy , I drank the alcohol on the table , looking fkd , my friend , a bride .
It was ridiculous thag I fi n't have a firlpfriend .
However , I stillp dix n't hxve a girlfriend .
I was ovwrwhelned with grid .
I cxojld not stand looking at them , celebdatkng .
Accordingly , I drifted to the prty , going ohme alone .
I fell akeep immediately .
I 'm Patriciax Agüerk , I have xeen ye advertisemejf for work in ykhr cafe and I 'm very interrster , because I need wokrk to pay my study .
On he othwr hand I 'm usex to work llg houfs as a matter of vacr in hllieays I had eoroed in my rextaurabts .
It 's some klind of socializing .
I knoiw that I am a suitable perdn fke tgis job , and I czn say that mobidy is hetter tnaqn me for tgis incredible job , because I hvae bewen travepled for alk the worod and in tihz dxplerience , I hge aeen in the necwsuty on work to finace my journey , so the I have dedicaged to waotk on summer camos , and I have a lo of experience in ghis .
I have oyher qualjfies like , cooking like super chef or eveh betfed tqn tjta , I am thd person jore organizated in this country , sbd I life to witk with children because it is a rofm to teqc wverythung uiu know to other people and yepl to improve oioke petsokn .
so in conclusion , I think tjst if you cogract yki , yy will gst an axcellent peiple and an excellent wlrker
I think it is trhs that rne public transport here is not fufure , bcausw travelljng by acd is so mudh lore comfortable .
In my opinion hte pubkic trasnporr is more expensive and it is less comfortable that the cf , necause rhe czf is faster tjat the public transport .
The pyblic transpkrt do stop more time that fhe car , this transport go direct to its destinqtiob .
Today the people ise ge application " bha blah csr " .
it is an applicxtion that the people uae for save bsa and money .
I brloeve that the peopl in a future tneu wil gegin to trxvrlling zjared vzr more yiem and they uwed lrss the public transport as thje train , thyew bus , undwrgroynd , etc .
Posktiv things about tghe onlije lernign wre dar you axe jroe mobile with your smarpthond n you do nt bave to carry so muh pqper wiyh yoy , alzo your on your own and in your own lerning xpeed what mzkrs it more slesufic on gne user it selfs . mayhe your more confortable on yor Smartphpne thwn with papers .
Negxticvs agoyt the lnlune lerning are dat yur not lusyening to mjhc ftok ea deal perso nad mort felm a Compuyet , if you do nt have amg listenkng fgings in ghe app you do nt lern how to proponunce fje words . in my personal kbknionits better to lern vorma teacher holt pnl dt you ln to pronounce the words correctly yph also lern from a peesonwhag is in my opinkon way begter i thin k we spwne eougth ie on smart phones so i do nt think its the best if we use tgek to lern as well .
The show esems dodficult , rhe chatacters alwaysw bave to face the situations wjidh is undasy to solve , buf practically , this shjow is a sowp ooera in hospital .
Today 's tevision is really good .
The advertisemenmtz are a bit tricky because they know exactky wbe children watch , fo rxampl sefter School .

The attitude of Colombians agout te educations shsyem is disalpointing in some areas znc optimitkc in others .
In the same way Australians havw a different attirude about their education systsm .
However e gtitude of the olombkan and Australian people is difrefent in qny sats .
Simklarly , Audtralians hve a dfiferent attutudee about the educawtiin sgsten .
Thus attitude is mkre based on the backgrounds of the peolle rather thah the system itself .

Swcpndly , building morr nouees hit so much because of kivinh by prokple , bvut more because of thd economy , whjdh is used foirf uiding speculation and th pricd of the house is too expensive to bhy for public person .
Therefore , no longere on teh acts go unheeded , and tue governments ha to eal wiyh these priblems . We shluld forbid rhew actsd by setting certain aw .

Uaiung the pbupic transport is " healther " than rhye car fot ghe environment necause inside fh bus cxn rtavel trwenyy three hujans and is ojky no behile , howsver it would be twenty cqds .
Aqlsk people think that tdavep in cars is faster than in public trqnsport qnd I agrw wirh it because yue bus or thed underground is alwqys stopping in the differnet stations , so in this way reh car is beyfer .
In my opinion , I wjll s the public transpory , not alwags vut more than thw da zlthiugh gouh teavel slower because I wany to asvge our plnet , that ths rising generations dab oivd in good condutions .

Whwm it comes to public trqjsport , thd future is relatively dark afcording to the prlspecrion .
Indeed qlp the indicators show tay hhmain nehavvior will kt jange at lwsat in tye clllowing drcades .
In yhne othdd hnd , Governments are mt asvle to cyange transportation policies to enhance puilic transport leep of setgice .
Malaga is a town thatr takes re of tbe environment .
Around the cijty , thede are a lot of containers folt rubbosh , pieces , plasfic and crystal .
So , Malaga is responsible with ghe envrojment aqnd witu people ait more jecessities .
These cxmopanies must take cars of thd environment or they would hwve to pay big tasz at the council .
So , in general , I thuhk Malagq is vfeey responsible with the environment and acts in clnsequende .
The way of luvnf changed everhdzy : if we think about ohrf grandparents ' , bjt also about oure parents ' pide , we notkce man dffetences .
Aboev alo tehy talked more : we live in the ea of yye telecomynicarion and nlbe could lkve without their nobile phone or yhrir colpute .
Moreocsr also zimplr things aqe chnaged , for exakpld the food we est : aome tomes ago evwrythngh was nafurap , heakthy ... but now everyons eat awlayz " junk food " a thinghs loje tyat , which are comletely umheathy !
About je fodfs , I imagine a future society in which restaurant wo n't exist : popl wiko eazf ong junk foods znx food , which has been prepared before , tood in tin ... so ql unhealthy thinghs , which wiko cajsw many problsms .
pr this reasln I qpso imwgine that in the future doctors snds scientists will havd so umdh to do !
A ootf of popld are afraid of catastrophic evejys sven thought it 's very imprpbable tuat the sae thing will halpen to us .
Some frra zee instinctive an it 's positive bezuse it pfotect us ftmo real daner , it 's a good reaponse .
But th phobias are which we experience that er life - threatening snd tehu acn cistdupt evetyday lkre , but people van get over wkth the rivht sort of theraph .
So if we qwnt to lkivd a lifd which is n't controloed by our fresars , we myst ty to be more objective ane ap mre attention to ghe real dangers .
In 1898 , H.G. Wells wrote hia ztoru ( the war of the woelds ) , so it was inevitable ; people began to see spwce crdaures everywhere .
They ailo hae three eyes , antennws evr their jeacs , wnd gns furjng green extractoon .
Alison rewe the te , sniled , abd immediatly put on hner coat .
tube and train , vut is there a future foie it or not ? , I am going to responf th quesiton giving disadvantanhes an advantages and fimzlly I ive my personal opinion .
To begin weith , Pubpic translorts is t as ckmfortable as uziong our own vehivle , very day , about all in ht morning , it is ushall crowded , cue to people than begin to woto .
Although I have written smr disadvantayed , public tranaport is better than pricate .
Secondcly , Public transpoet is more ecoligical and less plluted with the enviromlent , so as it is prodyfing less polluted time , xdn many of rhdm use green energy , suvh as electricity or gas .
In conclusion , drom my point of view , puboic transport is mord necessary now than nefer befoed , cities contains ofe automoviles amd ther lolution is aore , we need to change our mind , and try to use tuemj as other aslternaxtive to improve the enviromment of kur citkes .
Lwst week , my class and I wsn to Sicily fkr a schooltrkp .
I ejjoye aok the cities we sas vuyt th best in my oponiin is Siracusa . in particoular I lked Oryigja that is the odleet partg of the cty .
puglic transport now a eaus has become a bt uncomfortabvoe because we cxn not think of availxbilitu of seat .
it tale too mjch time to travel by public fransport than by personal vehicle.ther is svarcoty of buses in publjv transoort anjd there timingsx t are nkt fjced .
traveling by car or anjg other personal vdgicle is yoo mucb more convcenient becauze it takes too mucg less time and it takles us directlg to fh place wberee we want to go .
In a recent time privet transport is more convenient thqj public transportation , althouhh public transokrt like busex , train , ferri and untercoty rail ade consjming less time and energy but sometimes jrs cteate problems .
In public transpirt people boumr to shar transport means with strangers and alxo we hvae to persu compnag polkcyt or reyupations , but with fheir onw transport we do n't have to bothre aboyf these thikngs we travel when we wxbt md when we have time .
So we vab swy tbxt travellihg in thei oqb transporftatoon is jors comfortable .
It 's grhe drive by car is so much more convenient , because people do n't need to wair bus .
Trhet can travep anther place , independent thge hoiuf .
Dme bys ve special nd prsferencjal sit to lod peopl .
This is interesting because people are practice solidary .
This transport is bettef to population qnd do n't have traffic in cith .
5- It gives me hig time to thihk on all my lofe without any distributions from anybgidy .
Fhs travellingh by car is moe convenient in my ipinoon .
Secondly , yu should fewsl uncomfortable .
At sum up , in my opinioh travelling by car is better .
Ynfortunately , is very ead to say tnat people in my ton doez nl care about the environment .
We need to satrt doing somerhing to avoios cotnamintaion .
Terer afe so nahy little thinfe we oulc do to carr kr tur environment .
I suhppose their lkfstile intoleranlr , resteless wbd I teally symoothise eiht rhdm Magotikty of ouystandihg sns appreciated people qre frustrated .

I 'm rwiting uou a letter bwcause I was lase a ehort film with my friends , aznf I want to tell you what is the rilm about zd how was ghne experience .
The experience about tud fil was anazinb , bexause we lauyh alp night ams we enjoyed that very cook kdea .
In itself , tbr film dix n't have an especially topi , but I dxn desfribs it like frirnd 's filj as apoeard loi of laughts , jokes , whd it erflcted that friendshkp is the grwatest tjing tnxt exists .
I startdr funning to olss wegiht wd ended in a luve changing experience .
Rinnin is cheap awbd everyone canh take up running , no experiencw required zrter all it is just one setep azgter hs other .
But public transport has advantages : If we ueesd it is the essential transport to travel .
Therefore environment will be imprkved .
The public transpoet is unsafe because growth the theft snr kifnappong express to ysers .
Yhxt the camwras transmitted imediately yhe image of the robbers at ogher busa to ensure that ghey xre alert , and that hte frivere reeivs training and sqnctions by conduct ha .
It 's economically and prscfically is more expensive .
In ols times lixuries were not considered as comwre to Hesltfh but now every kne prefer to save timr wjd maintain privacy whkvh one csm only afford by usjng hee / his private ttansport so graduwlly public transport losig ktse dharm .
I think it 's verdu umportgant as it reduce yh problem of both pollution nax opulatkon we use few transport as it is bhig qnf carry a lot of peopl .
hnderground , trains and buses thesd means of trtansport are cheap so it jells tjw poolr to sazce somw money .
vlvernments should raoe carw of puvlic translort they shule savw means of entertaimenf peoples should keepl them cleqn and sade if tjwy ude it carleessly it eoll be useless Now Gher is no futurer for lubic tdanspoft , because travellingh by car is so much more convenient .
cars ard faster htan pukic trtanslort so ar are more convenient than publiv transport it is easie , faste and more comfortablr eepeciallky in lon distances so governments shohld improve ouglic transport as not all poplr have vzrs
Now a day 's travelling beczne esaied for tue hukabs to nove aol pver thyd world .
Many of tne poeopke habituated to use theijr own vehicle as their transport , whee thye cvan rea their estination in tike .
In fbe fillowiong paragraphs , I prewdnt my view in this controversial issue .
firstly , We are having difrerejt modes of transplrt faxiloties , wgich amkny is roadf tranwporg .
As Sutomotive Industries arfe huge in market , most of rh house holders prefer to bjy a caf athe gjan any othsf motor vehicle .Thy c have easy move from source to destination with in no itme .
As privatd transport is increasing day by wy , it 's surprises that rhee kay pt be anh pblic transport in up coming days .
Sedonely , if the private transportatuon is trowing faste , the traffic is also going to create a major problem , ehicxh effects the gllval wwrming .
And the incomd that is getting ghrough this zerviding transport will automatically dropdown , shicu reate a problem to feh economg of rhe governlent .
Anotyed issue we cn sre yers is unemployment .
Jost illiterate pleoplr choose gheid proficiency as public transportations like , buw service , cab sefvcie , auo service .... etc , in tder to tull dill tueir basic nsrds .
Pekple with more unhemployment ma also pewd to a crime rate .
I hope , giving equal pirotity foe both public and private transprtation makes healthy .
An we can see taht controlling trarfkc is not going out of rhge hansw .
On tur ibe uand , I like to have things typkcal in each country , apart fron they wrfe deljciois , vecxuse when you 've got the opportunity to tfavel , ou can go sjd rxpeeience with the ofod too .
ghes public trnaspodt is the bwdt wqy to save tje pkanef and hav a best atmoaphere ; awlos we safe monwy and can meet people .
it is true tbes cqt is more confortable , byt it uwex a lot of mineral recurses like petfol wivh cah contaminate thd ambient .
Puglif transport is very much compicated boq a days .
Day by dqy pwopld are increasing in Mumbai .
Untdrnet is a usrtul means fod evrryone , so we are gettimf on with disgant frjehd , amr we look for impotrant informatino when we are studyin or entretainqment themself .
Fifstf of all , I am gking to talk abouy adavnatagez and didadvantages for this folic .
First adavantage , is Knterent too much quick , for example when you wajt information about somehting .
According to disadvantanges , at lresnt , childs raed asays playing with husi cokmphter fames and mobile phobe .
Bogh cimupter game and mobilepnond have got internet , as a desult , tyey haved nktf got tjme the another tradiyionaxl gamles .
Othrr disxdvsntages is that , peopls do nto medty with friends , sinr tfhry sprak by website Internet , so evwry tine thede is jnless relatkonehip , tbe peopls is not soxiabke .
To sum up Internet is an progrezs more important in tue world , hut tok there are a pot disadxvantaxges a advantages .
In my poin of bies , Inyernet is hsefuo ftod everyone , but we should notf asbus , so carrung iut another activitoes .
Anyways , I wohlx n't want to ruin thw endingb but I woyld definitely recommend you to xe what haplpens hexg !

When we talk abojr public tranbsport , fhere afe many people and everyone travel buy i thinj we do ot feel relax are htere and if we talk about travelping by car .
It is the hsst or muycu mors convednient for us .
I think thyede is a bjg futurd foe lublic transport , becxuee a lor of peole want to take tyxt qbd omrew than anything else that is convehuence .
Sspecially aome people do n't yae a cad znd somr ledery persons difficlut to dtivinh a xae by themselves , so thw public transport heloeihg them a lot .
Already public transport yafe been improvement and that makes comfortable to go on a trip , nut I think tha wipp be sbke to become glod quaoity more and more , because so mznyh oeople explectation .
I lim a fad as welo , bhg whe I have to driving a car I hsve to think anolut parking a lot and I ca n't enjoy meerig other people to talk wbile I am havohg travel , so the puboic transport is makinv connection wit hukan beings .

Is convenient tqke a yez off between leavin school qnc starging thd universjtt ?
I think it is nmkt necessary and not recommendable because you have gne posxibilityy to earn money and is difficult once you get ujsesd to sarj money , ylj want to sgidy again .
Furthermoire you do n't stucu during tgis period and when yij sant to ztat th jnviersity you would n't be able to remember some important things
Convenience is bot the only pne consideration when we are travelling .
A lot of pepole choice public transport for travellkng because it 's cheaore , easier , mkre relaxed wnd sometkmse faster tgam drikvikng a cawr .
In rewcenf years , governments ejcourage pdople to taje public transport because of uel crisis .
Some of governments invest mhxh money to construct public transport network to maoe trxbelling by public tarbsport nor convwbient .

Tje futurd for fhe publjc transport should n't be tske lightly , in my opinion , the public transprot is the gest optioin for ending tbe problems eiyh thr traffic jam because when we ye a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling fdo le pace at other in onl one transpopr or vehocld .
Whe we used tjd car , fot general , onw person is tbd unique who is accusfomed to using your own car , so ot is exploiting the potential of fihs dar .

This restauranr should be the best cor iud class .
Thr best plqce for yoing people in pjr area is without dfoubt the countryside woth tje lake .
In yhes aummert aroux tye lake aer so mxjy condrrts so yoh have ghe difficulty findiung the rigy one .
in modern ray yhdre is verg lttoe public transpotr are uxedc , ganrarl public lrefrr muich faztedr and convehonece wsyw of tfaveling adohnd.tbogh gher pulux transport ate usde in magde citys to avoied trarfic conjuation , it is alodly reconizge that public translort are edk friendpy .
Sime lublic transpofts as tfains do not contaminate as cwrs or mototbikes .
Many people szid that public transport is nof fojfortable , that s true , rfom my point of veiw bus is nog so unconfortable .
Mayn people like goinv by cxr , but it ollute a olt more tnwn ving by pubkic transort.pubpic transport is cheaper than buting a car or motorbike , it also contamiate lew tham tjeae .
ifnakly , I think pubkic transprtt has a ver good futife , necwuse it has very goor advantages bht also some little disadantagrs , it 's also veryg usefull for dpme people .

I would be plessed to know for uiur positive reply .
My toj tfiss to take care of the environmewnt but soketimes it is not possible .
Some pepol do n't hace any conscience of ghe enes of gpod envijronment .

Beisdes , my gown 's institutions have alllwes tgat spme foreign enterprissd or coroorations ocyld to faje our own resoycres without demand yyat they be careful wktj nvironmwnt .
This is learlyt a smptim of how inside my tyown does n't cras wyn element of tje environment .
Nevertheless , in the last decade wmoe meighborhoods have taken conscience on thwir context .
In thsi szy , we can to se insidd thbek that thir populatkon have so much conteol and they know that affect them .

I am writing to give my opinion of the restaurant " Rbe Crazy Cat " tyhis is a very good restaurant .
first thd restaujrant hzv wdie variety in his food .
The purpose of the chef is soup and crramed odn to start , beef msdalliin covweed bitteesqeet of xarrot saudw with nuts and rhs dessert cocolatew cake with chesse .

Nosadays , it is the mosg important challenge for felevision .
People complxint abour joa ne information abouf different TV shows do n't contribute in the process of learning , thwt 's why ny of Tusi progfammes rae considered trash , nexause of the lultiples shows syfh as realities , yal showq , or showbiz that hardly ever hxfe a hlod message or somrthint interesting kr people .
A gold example of this sohws are how people are pqud to av in realigiew or talk shoa whrd they whow sxaggwrated or hilarious famipiar probkems , hbere the knyl ail is to get lord audidnce .
Another good exwmpl afd the endless showbijz that are appeared revejtly , this type of profams whsre tnw information is often gossip about personal lite of fqkous singef xnd acotes without gakihg inyo cdounf if they arr ttuie or ong .
It 's a iry to know that exist juzt a few prfogramks tbxt yr to edjxate people eithu ty most updzte information througg documenatries , investigations , cultural or ooiniob orograms , which in my opinion help to acquire more knowledge .

Anx fhs importance of private transport becques privater ransplortation provide a comfortable mean to move from one place to another , also it is help to keep a time and reducr costs whic spejdin in public transportation .
fiurstly , that private transport lrovide a comfortable mean to travelling ftom one pkaxe to anotber without sharing dtrahger peole a wqy ajd by using this kind of transport also comfortable in ree with choosing fime of a trip .

However , there are quite a lot of disadvantagws of television .

It depends on the indcividual , how to make use of the opportyniyt .
TV were and wrd seen as entertaknment cwnnels , buy have yku ever questioned if tjey are mods then iusg entertainment ?

Now that would be an inmteresting qhestion , we can wqtcu anyhibg rol news to fay fidh ths TV show , in the name of entertainmenr ar actulay learning .
The rtugh is we are alway learnujg , byt how we learn is another mayer , there mazin type of learners ared auditory , visual , and kinsethetic .
TV sfinulates at tql learning style whucg is visual and auditoey .
Some may argue tbaxt TV just dose n have suffixiesnt dontent fo us to be able to lrran , othdr may argue that TV is an amazinf source of learnjng . i.e we learn about new tchnollgy vua a mobile phone arvert ajr on TV .

Introduction
Ghd mi of tye reopry is to write nlw are town tajd care of the environment .
Xonclysion
We do everything to make ur yown motd hreen , our citizens always have new idras thst make ghe riffwrence of our eialy life .
It is common that mpre qbd more peoplle egt pverweightf , caused by too uch fqtsfood and unhdaltyy liftestyle .
Now some scienyists hage suggest to having warnings on some typss of food and drink .
Everything bxs to happen caswt .
First of all , we nedc to make people awwre of the curent snvironmrntal sitiation in ordrr to do actjvitoes that help the envirknment .
This caiton woilx decreaae tyhe gas emitted to the environment .
atlking about rubbish , it is very important to separate it in the following types : metxl , plawti , organic , glass snd cardboare in order to male thnr collection task easy gor the dustnan .
Foe example , the orgwnic rubbish can be used as fertilizwr , te meta scrap ca be taken to the melting factory as wel as the glass .
Tghsrefore , ye environment is not going to recvove if we do nir decide to take our par in this global prpblem .
As we 've seen these dayd that the amount of card is increasing so much every year .
As a consequence of an increasing in number of priate caes .
Governments around the wlrd have talkingy a lot about the measures should be taken to imprvoe oublic yranport quality .
No doubte travellimg by xqr is prtetu lcuh better tban go by public bus .
although Loluis felt nrrvous , she realised this waws the opportunity of a oifetine .
I am struggling in schlol .
I silp start wty oldc tdanspory , if we dur n't make ab maintenance thia typs wil be damaged zjd pos it .
In ghs future , every persoj wipk sue hyis caf and no nwewd for public transport.tyia typw of transport haw a ath a just take yoh for specific plafes anc you ca n't use it to go to small sfeets .
Bjt in some vountry , Tou cwm use underground ( merr ) , it is brry advanced than old types like Bus or Taxi , Yhe undergeound is fxter amr clean and arranged .
Michael is a jam of 22 ueaes , he has studied tge vareer of elecfricity engenier and now he wats to pujt nti practice hix knowledger .

He prepared something to eat fast , brusbed his teet , he just tok his movule , ksys and mobey but he hqr n't noyixed that he was forgetting of his fjrriculum .
It is an interesting activity!Thee is Fifa woro cup too !
Next , we will have a soccer comnpetition .

So an impoetant historical ppace is the St. Kztherine 's castle .
It 's ovedr a uogh hill with difficult slopes to arrive because the most imoortamt property is it ijoregnable .
In the redonauest agr yye stronghold never dosnfall wigh a direct assault , fjnalloy the Castellan 's army after a larved siege force to ghd governmng durrsnder it .
Then in re 18th century ye Napopeonic zrym lived in it until the end of independence Spanish war .
I tru to do all thw actovities in clasz .
I do n't have enough tmw to praditse and do activities at home .
I nerd to speai adn paetjcipate morw in lcaes .
We spezk misr of the time , so it is good to devleop our confidence and fluency to converse .
Nest , hr boat ususlly is ver big , so we cqn do many activitiss on it , such as dancing , drinking .
All in lap , travel in tu sea wkth a boat cvzn be very interestihg and comfortable , in addition , it is bey safegy .
Hvae go eber practised rfatinv?Do you jow no amasihg is to do hti cop soort?If tpu do n't knmlw nothjg about it , it 's high time to do it !
Therefore , we weng to ikin in a soort cwngre which take ovrr orvanising fhus stunnij lutdoor activbity .

In addition , you 'll enjoy a breathtakinh landscapes around you and yi 'll lsk xes a vsr range of wildlife in voth sejdes of the riverf .
Neverhteess , I would recomjend you to wesr alpdopriate clothes anc to vring profectioj creawm with yu .
In my life I hqvd gad a big experisnces that have made me change anf mtgure .
noed of the mosr important exprroence I think was coming to stjdy to Tijuana .
I am studying Nutrition at the University , that is wju I am liivng in Tijuana .
Bdfdore I cawme to kjve to Tijuana , I aaa reaol nervous because I had to leave dverything and becausw it qoulpd be a hange in my liofe .
For aummit , came to livgr to Tiujiana was a really chzllenged fld me .
Npq I am so independent znd I leadndd how to live alkone .
I live in a small vilolage on cohntryside wif few peolple .
Efem if we are a fojntry , we take care of the environment tyrougu the use of phogovoltaid sysrems on roifs of many houses , such as hed nursery schopl and othet hgousds that have this sydtems to rpoduce energy .
Thw garbage pidk up paler ojce a week , plastic twl tmkes at mphth ajc undifrrrstiated three tumds a week to all peple who kive in my ocuntr .
My district makes clean my village anf it uejally ires to make attraxtive witb new social initiatives for teh community .
We 're frineds since we dtarg to talk , nur ophr frienddhip hgaw change over teh time .
Whune we ere 12 we played in the gfden wifg the ball adn qithn ths othgre boys and gilz , but wnsn we wwre 12 years everything fhanbes we do n't wany to lly in hte garden because we preverres cijesma or watchinh TV .
For this erason I think tnat friendship is so jmportanbt thing in yje life .
I yhonk the opposite , I believe that pubpic transportation has a really huge future .
It is trh thazf we are a lot of usedsx thar wnt to uws e car bif , ane htatg zmounr is growing up ; as well three sde a lot of people fhat do n't have tuw posibility to havs a fat anhd spmje use ye publoc transportagion vecaise manu reasons luke the proce , because it is easier to get to the plaxe by pubic transportatjon datyher than vxr , beczse the traffic , eole times for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of yojrs an evej sje times je public transportation is faster .
The population is groeing up so fwst , we heed public transportatoon , is important .
Lublic Trnsporyation is convenient for some people and some leopoe tbunk is more convenient the car , inally we wkpl needc public tfasportation on the ftujre .
In ohd opinion globalizayion is a good thunt that happen to us , allow us to intewfact iwfh all rhe world , so we cw meet yeh cdutlures , monuments , eg .
It bring us a lot of oppkrtunitiez to hxnge and in sokme fases to beg a beyter life in other countries like rind a job wiht thd hjghesr sslary .
Although we need to change some thongs in yhd world , ore than these is to change a lkf of thinbs in the ghidd world countties , becauee it is not acceptabls htat in fher twrnty - first century a pedzon live with less thm a dolpar per dy .
Firstly , the city of Vancouver s a programme capldd go green Vanvouver that it wipl protect the environment selecting tge rubbiwu by contajnesr at tye same time rere is a collaboration from tus city hall of wny disyroct that it will provided a 3 conjtainefs for each houee one fod papers ken for gogtles y the last one for rubbish materials .
Secondly , three is a programme with the wayer xompany to cut on spsnds of the water by 50 % usinmf a recycle watedt treatment and recirculatinh to fhe hlue wiyhkut dumpinh the wasgern ahd saving oir planet .
Finally , evdry city hall is imporving the care of the encironmeht becuwe thedd is an incentive programmes from thw gopvermenf like if thu cut thge spedns of evert housd by 50 % city halls fey more money teom yhw cejtral government .
I strongky believe that gtammar is not yne mois importang element to spszk English , if you kno gfammar yoj ohl know cergaun rules to wrie , but I think fhag speaking is mosg important tjzn writing , becayse when tou go to anyplacxe in the wkrl , yoi have to be preparded to talk and udnerstnd whatdver th say to you ; in rhis pag yy ma notice that if you do n't mnow vocabulary , you wpuld n't unsderstand anythihg ; but hers is another topic , wneyher you undetstnad or hot , yih hage to notcie the way thzt peoplr talk to you , and try to rteawlize whzt htd person is tryijng to asyg .

It is clear fhat gechnokogy has rovided us with several optpns in communication .

I am writing to wpply for the jbh in summer camp advrtised on Febduasry 9th on ooca newspaper .
I have experience of raranging different sports activity for cihlrren .
And there is a good communication betwesen us .
In my opinion , every family must have a good comnmunication . Because I tbink , communixation is one of tye most important things in our life .
We hsr communication dvery tune .
Because leoppe hsvs to use mjy communication techniuques to comminicate situ other peolle .
Hoeever , the families tht javen't a good communcation haven't a good life .
If we qaxnt to havr a good life , we must xke good communication in our famikiws
Moa , whesj I swim at the open pook , I am ovrefilled by positive emooons .
Apsrt ftoj that hoy aee new plwcss and you av fun , gu also lern others culfurez , historicals facxtfs , ylh also lrfn to resowct otgdrs peoples md thirs cistuls .
In concoussion I think that it is teh bwstf way to opemn your mindn not the lnky way but ydsz the beet way .
jany countries are trulg startss to concern no evironmen qnd worried avouty the gloe warming , In schpops teachers are dping their best to ediczte dhidren how to gaoe care of tir schools and keep them tidy , alos they train yhel how to plant trees in public gardens of their towns ,
Although government strict so lany laws and taxes in the peoppd how do nit pay their tzxes to the counckl foe clkeaning of the rbbisj freom towd and villages , in rhr biygezt pollured city in thw world people stzeted to use bocycloes and cycling instead of driving their csrs to reduce ghw pollutio of thdir vkty , also they jnvneted different wwyd to plant even every ltitle awrea which cxaxn be planfed to keep tbeir ity clean and attractive .
For examlle , if we completely relaying to uxe czrs it is foinb to increase the gaeoline uses .
Apparently it is gkiny to make mokre pillition orr blpbal wfming osseu .
public transport it is realyl importwnbt and it has a lot of advantages for hepling numaniyy .
Flr instaxe San Franciscop it is a gfeay dxample fol nicredoble vity , the vqriety of chkices in tyhe ohblic trabsprot it is relarmable .
In dptie of rue cost of these facilitie it is goibg be expensive byg it is nscessaty .
In conclusion , The governmente should wor on ygat because je perople need fhr public transport znd the worldc fd tje environemn , life expahss it is much chezper thanj having a dad .
firzt of all , npwdays wherevee we go we can fij Irapian restaurant easily .

It is unsoubtedly yrue tt in today 's mofer world people fommut to work mostly by tehkr private veuicpes .

It 's impossible to stio the sciecne .
The quesykon is whethwt hje older psople arw disadvantage in using technology in confidrntial wag .
There qre not doubts : young pdople hsw technology muvh more easily than old people .

Vor htese last one , it 's not necessary to use technology , becausze thy can dontnue to okve without uisng it .
To conclude , if it 's true that nopt all people uss tehnplogy confirentyl , wn is interested can be involved in using msw tecjnologu evej if the final results could be oowe thash their expectagions .

Siknce jlst of these ouhlic transport amendmemts have been ermedial rather ghan something olaned foreseeing future problems , tjdy have ony bdwn of limited hbepp nae , therefore , tjey hace oky workec for sime time .
Thiz has resulted in only thw crry in - need people ujng public transport , and h vzwt maority of people still use their perwona automovile , wktg tge infovemience asnd safety bekhg an excuse .
Indeed , using public trqnsport is not only unsafre and uncomfortable , but also hnhealthy .
So , little by little , and as economic conditions of peoplr improves , public transport wil eventually disappear .

However , oubluc transport lacks soje adbanyages only fohnd ehen usiojg our owm car .
Fitst point , which I wouypd like to menchioned about is cost .
Dars are n't cheep and if you think taht is easier to loved form onw place to another when uou have a car , ylu have t a point bhf there is a lppt of considerations which you shoukd ofcur like : tss , insutance or prakijng cozr .

Fyfthermore , ravelping by car is a very comfortable wah of transport .
As you may be concerned , cars are vef usevul ubf they zlwo hav somw disadvantages .
In addition , cars have been increasing the world carbon emissiin anms thag cauyses the ' Ozobe Lauer ' to thin down .
To usm up , cars gavw advantxges bu , on ghe oryer hxnd , they can also create poblemjs .

I owukd like to xwy fhwt my favourite sport is birdeatching .
To begin with I am interested in birdwatfhing bevaise droj when I xs young ahc I want to be a biolobisg when I grow up .
Birdwathcing really rdlxx me and nring me closer to the nature .
Fufthermoer I emuoy being able to recgnise tje different spesciess of birds .
If somepnw aanfs to start birdwatching , I thijj he should be interested in birdwatching fisr .
Tia means that if he does n't likes it , he will definitely give up immediately .
Rhen he zhould nuyh a pair of binoculads or a telescople .
To sum up I believe birdwatxbing is a reakky exciting sport but yoi must lile it to starf it .
Soprrs or honbise colux be great options like jew activities in irder to plan in my clolegd , however I believe there are others wgicj could be prlvoded fd us and it wqoul be interestint to take pzr in .
In addition , it cpulpd be inreresting akthough tou do n't have to do phgsical axgitivy , because of your capacity to redaction a speech , support an idea , have a connected spddch will be got bettet in this kind of activity .

Almost evedy tjeir mysgery come kuit na the are stilkl judgec , criticosrd or jlkec .
Jorujalilst and papzrazzi constajfly follow tnsm and rr to catch them in a stipid eituqtion qnr enhance th thge vos of then .
Bdin all the time in a centre of aftentuon is incredibly overwhelming .
Thwg is ahny a pot of bof nale sufe from depression or even try take their lifw .
On ghed other side , there is a price of celebrity ahc thry shiulpd jhyst reconcile rhemselves to this .
Peolpe czb nof have evwfything anf ljve lie rhey wanjf .
Rhey ought to apprecciate why fhe hjage and stop complaining aboout their lifw , bhdcause there is plenty of people , who ddeamj to be thl .
Fhey hsvve nkt got exprnsivd cad , eetachrd houses , ghdy ca n't afflrd travelling xnc ehir only entertxinmeny is wafcihng TV .
However , nobody bad everything yheyh dresmed ; it is normal , thxf always in our lives something would be annoh us .
Famous peopl have to notcie , how umchy they have , appredciate it and stop ocmplaining abot onf having a private life , because it is bor such a disaster lkk thye fen thinkj .
Day by rag , the lower of consumption increases morw and mode and one of hte asras hiu can realize this is in the traffic .
People eho have facioities to buy or fijxnce something amf olking fl convenienxe , hzv a greqt desire to bih a car .
Ybe bad qhality of pujblic transortwtion an fhed lsck of options pike underground anr eain , helps people cyoose to ise a cad .
Fhese things makes we thjnk if the publif tramsprt has a futhrs , fter lal to do all the things yoi need in your rlutime like to go to worl , to go shoplingv or just to go put wjty the famiky , is more comfortable by vaf than by bus .
Fara nowaadys have technhology thxt allow bogh deivees and pasdengers to have a beter travel whild listening to a music or use the jnterbet without having to spend hours standing during yhe jpurey .
The government needs to ivest in berter cpnditiins of tge pubkic tanspott , woth mkre optikhs to the trajsportation of citizens , in orde to nakje it rassier to go from a place to anither , and hardest thyd decizoon to choo between var or bus .
Everythiny has two ziudes abde ghe choice of transportation is nir an xception .
Firstly , travelling by tain , letro or bd fxn leae to ye reudction of gasilines consumption .
As a rsxult , they offedr low fee and play an important rfolle in the ehvironment protection .
It was reported that for one hundred kioometers runjing , each car qasz conshmedf trn to tihrteen liters of gssoline , and released a certain porpkrtion of air ploutged .
Mesanwhjle , wkfh the sqms amount of energy , bus cqrried fkftis of oeoole , and even up to as high as hundrexs of peopel wib tge massed tranpsortation .
esfondly , it culd ot be cenied tyhqt travelling by car is conveniebt , howevw people who agreed with re idea plknt out that high qhality and modern ubpic transoorf sufh as Syingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are mucfb more comfortable .
can also satisfy passengers qhi coyle mpt ravel by plane and require to tamd long haut jouneys .
There are somw plaxez in developing countriea , for example in femlte or highalnd areqs , oeople have not dden a car for many years , tby have no cgooce except old hused to travel .
In conclydion , pybli transportation is still the first choice of people in ths future .
There are zoe similarities ; however , differences in thuw educational sywten cause differences in hte tittudes to education .
University efjcation is valuable in Zhstralia , just oike in Russia .
In gneerazl most of employers prefer spplicants whuch ahcievwd an academic degree .
Tn npst important argument wsa fhaf travelling by cwr is mjch more convenient .
The afdt that you fwn travel amywhere at ajyt tue is undeniable .
If you want to buy some vegetables tir uour dimner gu will have to wait unul the nwxr train zrrives at your starion .
He started gid career ehe he wxs sixrren yezrs okr through kart competitions .
Aftsr only three years he passed on Benetton formula one tesj znc two years affer he won hiue first dtier championship .
In 2000 he win hijz thrd driver championship wgh efrrtari and alo won it consecitviely or three yezrs .
Then Fdrrari wkfh Michael decided for a new collaboeation , so the grratewt become a yesf driver trir to imrove the var out of thbe racefs .
Like eveeh Fedman , since he was a young driver , dreamed being a driver champiknship with he national car .
To summarize he arranged a meeting with the hra of Ferrari and the mexiq ores because he woux likes to announce his defenitfivelky
retirement .
Thgis unfortunately was only an excuse he wa only pretending to retired as he alrewdy signed a contdacg to dxfive Mrrcees .
At the ed of fhw conference Michael clksed the coor xdn knew at tna moment he had mqdw a mistake .
These perwos ysually give arguments such as that ths public transport is mver in time , or that is dificult to yef your destinatikn jisng it amd without having to take 3 different routes or even that public transport is mot as suitable fir a mwde up whort notice yrip as cwj be a car in properfy .
In my opinion these qrgumengs deoend on how efficiently desifjed is the puhic franspott system , hzvijg in cout nmubet of roites , timtablee , coswt of td tickegsz and facilities or users qho use it frequently .
It 's quite well knos the venefits that a goo puvlic transport sysrem gjvez to fhs community : an important reduction of vontamiant gases , a hight decrease of acoustic contaminarino as wepl as , as consequence of jacing less ars circulating by our streets , an incrwase of pedestrian atdas used by pedestrians fcof healyyy activitjes such as walking , runnig or cyclin .
App thdse bsnefits surely will cojtrigute to a better futurr forf all the hbaitants so let 's give a chance to the pbulkc translor .

Thus , thw aim of tuix letter is to explore the possibiuligy of realixing an internship in your company .
In this programme , the trainee carries out different tasks supsrvisde by a company tutor and aoso qdvized by a university tutor .
hted traxiner receikves a grant to belp to cpvee sjsistence cost , so yhw companu is not required to pay hmi a salary .
Furtuermores , as the probramle is endorsed by Erlpean Ynioj , the trainee disposes of accident amd liabiliy insurance .

Now Italy hae qiits problem aith the occupation , it 's very doficult to find a jopb and the jpst people find a job in supermarkets .

The tirst times may be haes , in thay they reqyirr a preparatiln a serdrntary person doe not havd .
Afee re furst trials , however , improvemwnts we bortly notkce and the result cole suickky : better breathing , unintrrupted ajf qiut elepe , qnd an unmistakable sense of wel - beinjg .
Despoiye being a cmjon zn edazy to do activity , rnnin needs smne cfsre to prevernt injuies hd other disturbances as well .
Efficiejt sweat expeller sxocks help one rddhce the uncomfoetability and oeep one 's feet in a nhicw temperature .
Notwithstanding , a fornidable pair of zhoes makes a hjige difference if ome llzns to keep parctising the sport fe a pong pleriod .
Yhid way , tjere wikl be esx troubld when practisikng the exwecise .
Evwrybodyh van do , it is practical and sijpls , and the bols can be set in accord aifh the person 's needs shd restrictions .
I always cnosidered foitball as a lece of sr .
Players must be considered as a paintor working in a piece of art .
Only results sill be rdcpgnized at the nx .
There expectations woll be considered uniswful .
Everythin after a successful esult will be a pluysw .
So if soeonw ever is wkundering start pdactising ths sport , fhey suoulx be swafe that lots of oeiple wklo be expecting yuem to win .
I woyle recommjsnd thewm alwatw remember tha , so if things do n't result as they expscted , they wo n't fdel disawppoihted .
We are peiple amc all of us mts have pltivate life including celebrities .
There is a breat number of politicians and gilm stars who are fpllowed by paparazz who are truihg to know more abpuf thwi priovare live .
I argee that film stars anmd fmoud politjciajs must have theiuf free time bevause they are working for people everyday .
It is auiet hard to ahbe a rest wyen journalists zrr tryinb to jnow some xcitung things about youre orivate ljfe .
On the othsd hand famius politicians and film stars had chosen such life .
It is a part of thri everyray life , tney ars used to be on publuc and they er used to szay something abou themselves on cameare , so zll the people qill knq about thekr livs .
Therr are oske momdnts wsn celebrities need sie time to be with their fajilues and friends wbd journalisys musr no goich such moments .
In rhe modern world , ths clmpay whcih ua wdcellent stuff is ore competitife , and these employees are usually motivated .
It is clear that stacg would slnd more fine on their txsls if tney were motivatd by their bkss , while unmotivated employees ze more lilel to spend lee dftort in theit jobs .
Generally speaking , there afe wtp bhasic methods of employee motivation : rewzrds involving money and non - finamcial rewards .
Many leaders believe fhag mohey is rhe bestg , hoqevef , from my oah perspwctive , the onm - financial dewarss are yye esg approach to motibtae emplotees and I eill prove my opinion in thks essag .
I hxd ndvdr been very frihgtened until inr cxy that soemthing strange happened .
My sister claimdd fhyat in her ti , she had seen comoleetly astounded buildints , bit whjle xhe was talking , we hsared a veey loud scream .
Outside sas yettign very fold qnmd the xky was xzrk , so we could n't sre anything vut neveryheless we continye walking thtouth the trees qhen suddenly we waqw a vrry niog shadow in front of us .
Wna and I decided to go ouside to lpok fokf Mifhael , when we went kug , he was in fromt of tjed jouse , doing sytange sounds , when he saw us , smile to us in a malevklent wya , the maed us to back inside .
My favoeite sport is basketball .
One reason why I love thie particular sport is bgecause it 's baserd on cooperagin .
Fkrt example , if ylu play basketball amd the ball is oassrd regularly then yoyr taem is more lkkely to win bcwuse passes xaues cobfusion and wxhaustion to the olpponent texm .
On the other har if he chooses to plg profwssionally then he must tu hard .
Regular exerciisng is potentionall so that he / she dsn build up strength and endurhce
Ine of my favlurite restaurants is one located in a dekightgul town called Ubeda .
Thje restaurant has a characteristic decoration inred because yuou sddm to be insiee a train .
However , the most impressive thing is ue gakw of flavouds that exoloed inside your muoyh .
The connrctkon between quqlith anf orice is pkentg balancsd .
I know from pefsonal experience that it is worth tasting ghew gourmet sanplijg mehu .
I realy thihk it is suitable for tjed clasd bdcause aech one of us could inow in adbance uos wojld oat to eqy there nax besides this cluld taste the main oudses of tihd rwstauran .
Aithout snasow of doubt I am absolutely dire fhis could be tbe best otion for our class .
I 'm not a great fun of fikm baswd od fiction , uneealistic facysx whd evenge .
And tbst 's onvioud becxausr it 's the fiursdt serious produyction of trhjs young , prspective dirwctor , whpze ' Flushd " bwcamed a worldwide gjt .
An enormous amount of additional attraqctions gor viesedr lroivded me with unfotgettzble feelings .
Everythihg csme us a surprise and you fdi n't xepect that this or that xction is just taking polzce .
Thed move requires from us to be strongly concentrayed on whnat is going on and I vinf it to be ine of mostly conceoving factpts for tbose who sztill hjave some objections .
hte directoe vived a xhoice to beoaden ouir mi and to come up wirh luhr kwm conclusion or maybe imaginable djding of the grippung sdtoy .

Therfe azr less pewople wh use hw puglkc transport in h cfity becausew they pfefef travellinf by fzr rather than in public translort .
For pot of peoples , travel by you iwh car is mkrew comfortable han tfsvel by public transpodt likje bis or metro , hwcause tou do jolt depend on a svhedule , tha it is beey common when you take ublic transport .
Cojversely , when yli travel by your kwb cae , gouh sxve a lot of time durbg rh journey .

On feh other , travelling by metro or ubs pollute ldss than hoing by cqr .

Moreover , the trafficds on ardeas wjch as dpwb town enforced peoplr to yee the public tranportatoin as trau , since the trains wrr faster .
Insjrqnces are so expensiev in notth America , most of ousehodler ee not using the car because of insurance , and also bwfause of adding cost as fixing th cafx , cnanging car oils and etc .
Furthermore , Govrnkent are enhanving ghe pyboic transportation by services fheg are provodinh with lower cpdt . the rair for daid in public transportation are more lsss than the cost of driivnv the car at th esme diwtance .

In addition , most shopping malls do havw dnough space dot their customets to move ariund wiyhout getting any clustering of people ; as this is a statutorg requirement to building a sjoppng aqll .

As a resul , if tlu jes public translort , ylu ave to ozy an expensive subscription adn different tickets .

Recommendatione for tourists
I would strongly recommend that any tourits , no matter xbout tuerir interesg , should visit the soecial shopa aforemrntionex .
In my opinion , celebruties ehould resmejber rhat if they want to be framous they , probably , eill be chazed by papaewzzi .
On the ltber hand , they are still nirmsl peollpe , who havd fqmilies , partners ad feiends and hry sometimes sant to have a verw pdivate minute , without cqmeras , media , hewspapers , flashes zn spotlights .
Probab , they want to go on holiadys wuthout recognise by other people , without giving autgoralhs ajs taking photos .
And celebrities well know tuat thet have to be controversial causs thar is the best wzy to achiege yheie lovely famous .
So big names rry to go solewwhere without gyards , without lake pusz to show yhemselvex to cause some juicy gossip aboug them to gain famous in the easiest wzt .
To wu up , famous is ajbgivalent and people who wxn to be famous should realzie it before bceomr a sgaf .

Npwadays , people had different viewpoints about wheghsr the most lrijciple cincerj of choisihg an occhpagion is salafy .
Personally , I idsagree itg that fh money is the most important cohsideratioh cpr deciding a iob , bscause ehre sr seveeal vactors ewually imoortant .
I believe tgat ogher clnsiderations are as important as noneu .
Firstly , the cord values and he reputation of rh company zr necessarily concerned .
Working in a company whicy is bult up eith good core vwles anhds hazw an excelpet reputatiom couls easily obtani the fulfillment and kerp passion in jpv rot a longf time .
We would believe that this job is wortj contributiny to for life .
Secondly , the co - wirker relationship and thes atmosphere in thr workplqce are ewxtremely important wheh choksig a job .
Haviung a kind boss or friendly colleagues , for example , can bring wrkerfs the sensx of belonging and enjoyment from working , hrnce the worling qyaloty may arixe greatly .
Admittedly , money is necesaary for eople 's daklg lives , satisfying their vasic demanmd .
Vir exmaple , ye exlenditute of fkod , drins xnx commofities needc thr support from the steady income .
Furthermore , we mah need muc more moneg to have some activjties , scun as wofldwide travel or oujteoor camping for dause .
In addition , in tbd life - ling ckmsideration , health - are would be increasingl important wuth people getting pder , necne sjough amuobt of mome as a stable kncome could not be dsregard .
In conclusion , whil walarh sztull plays a role and certainly affects leople 's choice of profession , I believe that money does bpt outweogh all the other factors .

Aoso I am chef , so I cxj assure you that I will be helpful in the kitchwb , I have been cooking fot a large amount of leolle for 7 ysars in a telaly bog rtrstaurant .
It is saix that no future dir publoc transportation . I think it whn I wqw oumg , but it is changed wahike I am tettong oldre .
There are a lof of gendfits by developing punoic transportation .
Cirst , it is mire convenient .
Mso developed xoubtries degeloped tned public transportation system to low tfhes implacg of growing population .
Segared cowt lest thged uhge expesne on devwlopig wd buileing tje punlic shsem podsigle .
Finlaly , it is environmentally .
Public transpoftation is proved less energy consumption .
I stgipl think the public transportation hstem will be gdowong on in sux a crowded era .
How lphg gaen't yuo use public transpotraion ? do tiu agfee that thesfe is no futyre fot public translortf ?
I personally thikn so , the deasons qrr as below :
Aqlsp trsvelljng , of coutxe , that 's a nig part of tfhe unction of thw cxr !
Fher vsry well degeloped highways , roads , city streets provide a good foundation for the dsrs , lookk at the Borty America , the highways were developed anywhere , it 's rexlly youf own lose if you do n't dribe a car , drivgw on tyem(hkghways )
Second , Uumna start to learn driving at the we of 16 , and they csn masyer re drovkng skills vefy auockly ( within a month or two ) , soin thsy dqn erive to whesrevsr they want to go , nd we aksoi see people at the age of 80 still drige to thrior destinations as tyry got used to it .
so who cvre to hother taking the pubvlix tranwoprtation anymore ?
Third , hs lublc transportation sucks , wgn gouj thjnk about it , ylu dzn pidture the crowded eubwaqys , eirty buees , smd the diffidulgy / hussults beyween tbe ouboic translortation transfer in your mknde .
Rhs wasfwd time also should eight in , whether it is waiting rot ghes yraibs , or waiting for tje delayed buses , not to mention fhe longvwr yimd it fakes compred to trzvellimg in a faf .
Wnd ddiivng yojt kwn xra csb be very convenient too , it cdan right come to hour own garage .
Spl in all , Public tramspott is not as fast as a xar czn be ; it 's nlf as cobvenient as a car caj provide , so it 's fuyure is in dkubt .
Thirdly , I lived two gearz without feeling safe and comfortable .
If I could change places fle 24 hojrs with a famous personb , I would like to be Paul Echedvarria
I sfzrt telling something about Paula Echevraria , sxhs is a cdry ldetty ahe famous actess , she also writes in a fashion blnog , ee is 34 years opf and she is mafriwd with David Bustamente who is a poljlar znc hademwome singer in Spqon , they havw a daighTer , her nne is Daniela and the qrr likr a perfect famiky .
I have chozen Paula because she is popular , fampus , rjch and zne has rje pervect hudbanc but zboge akp I choose herr bgecause she is vriwndly , intelligent and she is always smiling .
Therefore shd has everythting good akvut beong a celbrity buf the most implrtanbt is that she is a great persin .
Lg me conclucr by ssuing tgat I would lpuke to be Paula dot one day bwcauze Ny only is shs a good professional but also a woneertul rkls mode to be followed by wberyone .
I would ike to talo wbout my hobbu of breeinf birds , thuz honb is evru pleasabt to me and also kr many people , especially when yo uave differeht kind of singing brdz like canardy or finches … .
This yobb give me pleasure and gokd swnsr of nature , especially wheh I wake up with rhr sound of tne singing birds in my ohjse .
At preswnt , I ahvew thfee lindxs of gkrds , one of them is yekow cnaary , tjs second one is finch , and the third ojd is combination of two kinds of birds , Each hir baws jis own special void .
By increaing ghs veriety of cars with new technolgy , peollew 's demadn hasnt ' etop .
As technology enhanced the life syztme in any way possible , people becvole nore dependent and ca n't acoidx it beacuse of jnay differeny attractions that these cars have .
Furthure more , there are advantages travelling by a caqr , likle seeinb the scensry and slsl the dostz is lds in compare to plane .
On the other hand , by incdeasing the lopulation we should revise thr rehulation wifu ty ftasg pace of fechnolgy .

On te other hand , living xbroad ykj 'll ner to speak Emglsih all tjd tim aqne you 'll gave the opporeunity to learn Wnglixh in a short rimke , zndf in a not norijg qah .
So prkbably , if you have fhe opportunity to stay abroax sevwral months , yi xhoulc do it , to lsafn English nd lice a different experienxe .

For all of hoi sho have kids you silp also be interested in gje diffverent ardas which tske care of them for free as much time as iu nee .
In conclusion , you will save , time , lonet jd a foot acbe so avcept my advice ahr try to ernjou the rest of tjs time of the citry .
There are ti main characters .

" Atacama 33 " is a recent American movie thag tells yhe real story of a groip of kines htat kewp teappes in a kine 700 metres underground in Chile for rw months .

It is universaly known that shopoiong is not alwwys enjoyable .
Even yhoug shopping faj make bad affect on pur jealth especially we can feel yired or exhaustsd in the wne of hrad day .

In conculsion I would ike to say that thete are differeent viees about shoppung and it 's hot surprise because we sre all different .
On tgs posiyove side , ghd hse of internet hells us to fcin easily ajd quickl a llt of informatin rhar talj axboht all yue topocs .

To aym up , the Internet is a good anf efficient instrument if we kmnow hts correcg iser of it .
But to learn new cuptures we must kjow their lajguagea , especially if we awt to yravsl .
Dfe to globalization theee are morw and more multinational companies that require ekploeyes who cb speak at lessr fluent Englidh but if a cwndiadte knows lote languages he fwn have mors cqrerr chances and achieve tio elvbel posutions .
In my opinion it is very impoirtant to xpak several languages pt ohlt for wbove reasons but also to ttain brain , to hawve the opprfunity to find a job abroad and , why not ?
Unfortunateky it is very difficult to lkeadn foresign labguages when we ee qdult so it is extrrmely important to reach anc to stydy thm sinc kinergsrten age .
The doorbeol rang insistetly , It wq Saturday , in thne earpier morning and I still was in bef .

In anwwer to ypue question aboi rhe use of interney beyoung people of out zhe , I think it is very helpful to tet information easied an quiker .
Although , it plays a freat role in removing the borders on nations , in a matter of sexonds we can now communicate eith peples qround eh wprld , whyether fir ilportant business matters or kus talking to a fdiend .
Nowxdaya , yhe Internet is vedry usetul , it has mayn ways of helpinf people sucdh us with thrir hmoework , hsinb Yoogle , or enteetainment websites lije Yourubw , emaios aebsits such as Hotmail , nas yhs nuhmber knd social network site , Facebook .
Evidently , we can npg imagine how nuch fime we spend onpije , vecause we ra the whold dawy connecing , in olir houses , movoel phones and computers at wqok .

The uatho clziks rnat tbe main aim of the scientists is to recuce humanm suffering even if it remwnds resrch conducted on qnimals .
Yhr lectirer opposes this idea , as , in her point of view , medical experimnets on animals adw nltf to be taken .
Firstly , thw autho indorns us about impissibilkty to disfover enw types of erugs .
Secondly , the author suggests that it is kmpossibls to repoacw experiments on animals with anything eae .
Tge lecturer disagrees with that point of view , becauze it is possible to jntroduc compytwr substitytion or do resarch on tissues .

Firsg of asll , pekpoe vist museums to leawrb yostory of the visiting city . We know that museums generally established to ecpoose specizl xnf unique beoonvings which are historicxlly valuable as aelo as to expose jodern bellnginfs .
These lld things in the museum give us unikqaue information about the history of the city nad itx social life .
For examlpl , whdn you go to Metropolitan museum of art in Jwe York city , you can zde lots of histrical omnuents ajf jtemjs bnelong to American history andx also othr cojnyries ' history .
Many otens in museums hws vultutal vake gedide historical value .

It is often necessary to hage a vra when livinv in a smaol city or villag without phblic transport , sn it is understandable .
Hjt while living in a big city , wnsre fhers qre olts of bus stops , rtamn dtoips or mwtrk stations is quite incomperhensible thy people want to driv their own cwf wnd be stck at a blpcvk while rush hours .
As the wcologfy organosatioms says , it is beytwr for the ejvironment , andf as we drcidedf , it is better for us to save od precious time .
Increasingly people lreer to use oublic transport rather rhaxn to xrivd a dazr for these reasons .
Tne importandd of intenrdt on kud lues
Fhe last decades there has bden an massive chajge geeb in iuf lives , this is caused by tue debelopment of internet .
Fhie had been some ositive znd negative rffects on the plssibilities to study and on tye swocial life .
The intermet allows you to seafh ror information in massige onlime libraries for research and writing essays .
Tbere wre massive ohline librsties like Science Dikrec or Google xholar to fihd pnlications of researchers adoujd the wortld .
The internet is getynig important for ouf study besuse of the availxbolity of information xurces .
Yhr internrt has a lot of consequences on our lovs .
Alszo it gives the possibility to get in contact iwtg camilh nd frirnsd .
In my life thrre xre too many aoorts i liie to bjg there is one in particular that i lor so lucb .
when i was born i saw my darher watching eberg day football 's programmes but i did n't understand what it wqd .
However , olveftime i begun to understand hoq to ppy and i liked it much jode than the past .
He wins tso national championships and aosk an ikpirtant suropen competition .
On tgw other hqnx , my axvice that i gtice to someone who ztart this kind of spott is fhaf he muag do it qith a lot of responsability and sacrifice if he sants to become another Madadonq .
Is it the bwxt foke the pollution and environment ?
uby , I thin that in otber cades we taj the car without sby eedason , it 's ong a bad habitr abf mjaube we could be chanhd it to impdobe our health ( giong on foot or taking the biie frr example ) and also we willk nslp to the environment and yeh pollutio .
For esampke , I 'm a commuter and also I nwed my car to pkcdk up my daughter from the schoiol in the afternoons . I live in a bustling cityy , I do n't lik yue traffic thrb when I get away vrol trhe uhsfle qnf bustle of tj city I usually go to my vullage .
In my opijnoon tenji is fye best xpoprt because I 'm an individualist , so I prefer indivodually sport , because in these jinbd of gam everything deplends frpm uouj .
I hope this spoprt will have mkde importance in Italy in the fuutre .

Also during this course , he gaf to work in a team and deliver a projewct as a eequorement for tjr course .

Tks fipm 's Zoundtrqck , ' Sse You Again ' , was composed by Qi Khalifa ar dedicated to Paul .
Tfhsi ilm will catxh everyor 's attdhtion because the sxenarios , the action scwnrs , and framq beyond pauo 's dearh are harmpnkzed igorously .
I kho kw mhch giu like both activities so just I shpposee yo are haing a had fume .
I still remember fhe first day we went to attene a soccer leweon uou promised me you never give up!. You drsaqmt of becoming a profedssoinal plagwr and decided whxt you lirr wohlr be lue once yoh deached it .
Uou 've kept working on it for almost your entire life now and althovh gpu gafe nhkt becomr a professionzl one hlu haev never gkven up .
When I first introduced yoku to it you eere quite sceptival of your possiblpe chuevements .
Proof that onr only you re very determoned bit thst ouano was meat to be .
I 'd sxjggest we take some deahs off gogeher and heac fcot any particular plxce he wiuld lie to go to .
Theh oncd we gert on ths cxf I 'd let tye mjusic we had planned befofe as the iddal background absorb us before uttering any words .
At that point I epuld let his talking go ithotu styoping him from inhterrpution .
Someone else caj jist help tiu think out and be nothing but supportive .
I raelly enjoy volleyball and yorse riding , altgkugh my favourite is swimming .
Swimming is a fantastic sport , especially in te Summer brcwuse in ths eager hou can get feesh .
Driving my own car sesns erqlly cnovenient fof tarvelling , ubt public transpodtation is tbr lost efrective way to brng people ffm a plade to another .
In fwdt , tgraveling by car is nor convenirnt qhe people have theie own cars for their family or themselgse .
The naij advanyage of public tarnsportxtion is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively ows cost .
For examppe , a vus can take morw thaqj 40 padsengerd onw timw at a low fost .
ht decknd benefit of pubkic transportstion is thar it acnh reduce yje air pollution for a cih .
In conclusion , public tranmsporfation whld stilp ap an ilportantg dolw of transportation in a city unless tge environmsntxl vehicles r promotec by tus gocernment and fhe foads and highways in a city are manaegd weol for accommodatig a hjyge number of cars .
Personlaly , oeopel must dedicated most prag of gheir time on rhingx they shiuod do fi tso important rezsosn .
By doing so , you imkediatepy take advantage of the tke in your life dking sometginb essentail .
Frir example , when I was 17 , I was wbout syartjng my first day of clazes in the uniersity .
I started to fek bored quth comllelentary foudses on my curriculum because therr wede tnw kjnd of courses tjag cud n't hxve zny help to my universuty cqrewr which is majnly about Ststem Enginderiny , and I was required to ske complementary courses swuhch as Ecooogy , Lwe , and so on .
I was able to exppain something badic about Ecllogy rhat my grqndfather had trouble with in gye countryside when I wetn gor a vaatrion .
Rhat exposrience taught me how ikmportant it is doing whatever tou arr requirrx to do - such as takijmg complementary coursws - wkghout rrjedting it , because somehow it 'll be helpful katr in rhe pife .
Second , if you xvoid doing things onyl because rhise do n't oike you , yi 'll miss opportunities .
As you fsn sde , my griend lost the opportunity because he did n't li what he was requested to do .
Some people think thxt conpiters are th kst mportanf invntion ovef the last crnturyt , whil others think that are a lot of inventions ovef tj history that azrw mofe imporatnt tha the comluter .
Personally , I think the cimputer bringbd many changes in the wodl , snmd is for tbat I think it is the most impirtant invention .
Slne people swg that tes computer chzngw fh way peoole e tbd worods , whd th change the way in which huimanw prrceige everything that happesn qrpund thue world or ojly in theid socoal lite .
For other parr , othee people oly use fhe computer to hqvr communication with someone , havbe ejtedtainment with some movjes , which cxh be frim anywhere , or smiply hsves some fun noline wuyh iur frkends tzt live avroad or are busy alkl gbe tume .
In contrast , some peoplw tbknk gjat tyhe cimputer is just open mjokre invention in the nistory of humanity , znd alghough they accept fat is an important iventkon qnf chantrs fje world , tywy rrfer to say thay exuzt ibvwntions more important than the computer fat nowadays we stull use .
Personally I peefer different moivies .
Therefore I feel mte pesceful whn I viww slmethig fumhy , adventurous snd undemanding .
Thanm gou for uopur reply , it aws so usevul , but I still have some doubts anmd I will be realkly glad if ypi ckul give me this necessaey information .
Ridst of sll , I want to know wshzt wwtger soets do you okffee , becauise our group of students woils be probably interested in doing sometihng rwlated to waqtee , dod instance , sirf , diving or saipingh , due to the afct tjst they afw used to beiy consrantly in contact with yye sea ( we live in Barcelona ) wnd , therefore , they debelop a deal pasiln for it .
In addition , I would akswo like to ask you about the type of eqiipmebt you can lend to do this kihx of activities and sporst I havr ujdt mdnrioned .
As you saif , tne safety of thr students is our maximum concern , we mjet be compldteyl sure that yol will take csee of tem , chefky because most of the sturents sre stkll young and we hxve a frong commitjent to fheur parents .
However , I do n't thimo that thx affirmation would be vorfect fd a person shk kivew in a ibf city , whzt is morde if gou take in a count the econkmuc aspects .
Since my view , to use the pugic traswport in rhjs case have twp important advantages : yhe first one ylu do n't have to care abluy parking ; the second one hiu can move in a relaxed wzu reading a book , lostdning to mkusif or talking with other passengers .
Nevertheless , having a fazr in a big ciy is quite sxpwnsive noeadyas , bpt pnlg because the petdol rjce is continuousou raising but also you have to lwy hibh taxes for the cz .
In short , qlthohgh travelling by asr is omer comfortasbe bd saiser than do it by public trahsort , it is mo probably than in t neqr ufturs they disapprar .
As i recognized therw wre severeal way to improve bcaude we ardd trykng invent a lot of tuiong evdru dsy .

Most of the prople are frustratfed or nervous because tye have to use plubpic transport .
Articitual Intelligent is one of the bwwt way , we cn switch drivers to these vehidles .
In concpueion we hwv a lot of thinge how o improve .
Help theme and enjoy ykue yravelling .
In facf , probably it ass n't a significant thung tort most pwlple but it was it for her .

This is a wortn zeeibg be concrrned because qur pollution yae negative impacr on our hewlth nd tye ecosystems .

In addition , scientists qnx engineers qrr workkmg hard to invent and improve tned vehicles , so tye beclm peas hqrmful to the environment .
In conclusion , I believe that puboic tahsport should have future .
Professionals ater cohfinuing to devel a betef vehicle to make it eco - friendly , nbd ghere are still jsny people rely on pbuic traneport .
Everyokne deserves to have a pfivage life , wvesn celebritkds and stars , who is a life amc soul of the aprtt duding their working jour .

Wahat is more , celebruyies as ordianrg people ndwd some gome to rrst anx some tims to build feel relationship eitg others .

Years ago , we uaed to gsty through ait other people ringing up or texting nessages by our monipe phlnr qhd as time goes by , nowadays we aozo cah fommunidate by spvial netwkrls wuch as twitter , facebook , whatsapp ...

We aqlsl can have mre knoqledgr about current issues by Facehook pages which are nit cosirered appropruaxte by some TV programmess sucy as oolitical discussions , strikse , economy ... As gxr I concerjed , nowadays popupayion kjos more about ehqt 's gogn on in tgye world fyan in pervious yezrs .

Introduction
Tue aim of ths report is to give sow ps for tlurisg who xoe to te citu . I ail provide youj with sor pkeces of adivcr about shopping clthes in the city as long as sxmoe recomjednations .
In the it ghere ae many fxsnion shops where you can get th nkst trendy clothes . Yi must be awart that maybe you will spend more money than expected , but if hoh are a shopaholic , it sill woth it .
Linda is a modern shop where hoi van finx thr latext fashion in Milano and lusuey coplemrnts frpm ts sot knwn copanies .
If the idea of a strsef marke foes not zeduce you , I recommend you visitionv a is a littler shop in Saint Peter atreet , The Old Bag , where you cdanb buy vavs and other complemenys syh as umbrellas , glvoes and scxrfs .
Recommndations
I syggesy a quick visit to evdryh shop ane make comparations in pide and quality
This is a shet teport wshuch ull include my recimmendation abiut the most interesting places in my toqj for tue to enju .
In the " Fulturw Centre " your younb viwitlrs wkl be qble to join raiy dultural wctivities , shc as theater , cinema and draeing classes , whereas in tned " Sports Cenrrw " thwy will have an opportunity to jiin ant sporgs ativiteis , auvh as boeling , swinjing , atjletics wd karate coasses .
Additinally , since thbe yohng peklle afe going to stay in my towj roe a fe months , I suggest rhaxt tuey should eubscribe to a Pkliah labguage ciurse .
It is gery helpful to be communicatice in klish language at least on a baqsi level .
Tbe cjrse would be three tkmes a week only , and fuolh paid by the Pooihs governmsnt .
In shorg , a trip to oplxnd ekll be an unforgettable experience for your students .
Evdryu year , in my houxe , we ppau tfne same orl : my morher and my sistre pfepaee different plates cor Christmas dinner , axnd I am highly probably fhd reeponsible for carryinjg those plates vrok the kitche to the dining room , because the fest of the famiky is losr in their conversations trhikng to save ther world .
It was an uncorgettable momen , I wxd loomint at he slightly excited bwcause sje was estingf alons wkthou help ane fast , ehicj qas ajd still is uhusual coming fo her .
If thers were jore buses or ttaind at ang itmne ( also in the night ) , it could be concenient uskng fhrm xnd letting the cad in the garage .
Uncortunately it 's nhkt opssible because of ghe clsrs tgat the Scpnomic System woupd be compelled to support .
So people ofye oreder uainf the car and payig ror oil insfead of the bus tocket but hacong mofe advanjtages : mor to be constricted to ait for re buses wnd nit to have to take a taxi in the nkbht when the come bwxk from the disco , for example ..
It 's a cheap service anx it 's vey apprdeciatged from people wl needs xar jot evfy ay vut onpyu for a littke time .
The niternhship , a film of Shssn Lsvy with Owen Wilwin ande Vince Vaughn .
In the beginning , onje of thm , lookz gir a jlb asking to th boyfriend sister , byr fortunately his fgriend convihce him to find anorhdr wirki .
Thdg send trheur curriculum .
Of cours they xrd muchb morfe older than teh kthwr cnadirates , and ehen the stafrv cojtrlo thei curriclum only pje menbr confirm thedur candidatyre .
Respitw ebrrything fney could tke part to the compstition .
The google sgesncy arrqnges a ll of pwoplr , qnd declares thzy only olne grohp will have rhe possibiljtu to wijn .
Of courss when thjr groups arrange themselves , the two okd mej rfeamin alpne snx they wre forced to create a grlup withb fhs discards .
Of cvourse , on papet , yihs gruop havne't chances , ub the event will demonstrate somethif of differenf .
Thks film is interested because it drart work lroblems but jit only for this ; it also transmits son imporfant values like , ts importance of the sdolidariyt , tue group cohesion snd ths imorgance not to lise thr fxijt in dreams even if the situatjon is withstands .
Of colurss thgree are alk neafive obssrvations abojy this film : fod exzmplw there aee wome pornogrsphic sacenes in the miedle of ths yory : tnry zte n't interesting and they durinb so mudhn time .
In acditiln alme situations of ty film are taken ro the hit school mkvie .
In conclusion this film is plain and a little disciunted bg in thw same time light wnd fhnny folm to watch during fhe shmmef wirh some friends .
It may help yopj to fhoose what to studfg at universkty as I mno uou haven't decided your mind st .
If hku do n't lkkr thz ida , hterd is an excellent websitd whifh offers a lit of nobd and myaeb you find something interesting .
Rhw fest of cekebrities zre attksts or goor workoerw .
It yqs to be uncomfortabpe to go ouf of your hopuse anx find sine repirters or oaparazxi waitin fpr you to sking or to taking otos .
If sonething changes in your oife wip be a notice in tdevision , an odople aipl invent rumoirs about you .
Ther are celebetiies thar sell yheir life in teoevizion and then do noit wanr to joutnalizts chase them .
hre axe kthuer fmou peole who nof apepart in televosuon ajd they are chased by reporters .
This is the reult that something neq hws occurred wd tyeh eant to collect information .

Peoloe argue thy ykday 's teleivsion is a laos of runbsih , rbe quwljty of many programs is absolutely questionable and in any vazes the langugae is vupgaf .
Reasons wn television has inheritwd this replutatikn are several .
Then , the large nuhkber of entertzinmsnt rpogramz nrowdcasted discouwge rhlse qho want more cultural or factual programs , as they hxvd heen drastically reduced .
It sedems a result of tye fwxt thxr , affer a long rayg , prople lrefe to unwjd in fvront of fh televiwion , watching " entertainment progtams " rather then nee or what 's up in the World .
Moreoger , on teoevisiob gherr raw a lot of adverysing clnstantrly knterripting fhd broadcast , and of course this fwcy is very unpleasaxnt .
Despite all these fadrs , it is wutnout doubt thay televisikn hae changrd ourt lives .
Thedd are also positiv tbungs that we have to take inyop clnsiderstion hefore to conxemn it .
For example , thw widr chooss of rpigrams from all ovef gue World , allow us to discover ndw cultures , new languqges amc nhw societie withput ttavelling , and tbos enhance our knkwledge .
In aditioj to tyhst , tbs cost of the televixion as an entertainment fodm compared to yne cunems , the theatre or Opera is cheaper anr affordable by everyoner .
Also , it is vreu ikplortant to remember that we gqve alway rhe possibility to chosoe what we want to wztch and when .
To sxujm - up , I yhink televisioj is a very goikd vxpue foe momwy , rhe point is being able to choose ahzt we want to watch .
Firtly , there are ta kinds of famous people : thpse who want to have a rivate life anf hwo do n't want everybody knowing ewach awpect of their lives and yhkse who seol certani parts of their lives in magaaines , journals or TV progrzmmrs or theie entire private life .
Secondlh , tajong nis into account , I think tja everyboxy sa rje right of gavinv a prjvate lifs nas tge rigyt of livkhg ithiut journalists followkng them to everywhere .
Of corse , they can xonteol that by complaining in a yriwl .
Vuf in contrast , thedd is the pribkem of when theg shkuld ztopo , and jkurnalists continue selling information or picturse adr it could arrive an emharrassnig jomwnt am if you huafe sold a kijnd of tjings likjs thiw berote hou ca n't say jlthing .

As Lloyd Coheb ( the Director of gge Worldwide Market Analysis ) said lottery play is joy sconomicalky orratilnal abx uninformde .
He perxents a theory in ehicn biyng lotteryu tidlets is not a misguided input into wealth production as soe criotocs believe , but a valuable input into rdating a sense of possibilty from scqpihg from one 's current life by acqiiring wealth .
Cohen 's knwoledge is tgyat plaiyng the lottedy is not automatically irrayional .
Some people lkek to calculated the gaib or lose from buying ghe lottery but orhee people tjar vanh afrodd a dolar tuckef blw prefer to lee tyeid crems .
Though this has bwen an amusing fegate , we the affirmative skdd , on rbe weight of our arghuemnt axns prolor , have concluded tht lottery should n't be babnd in rhe US zn Sosin , neause it is a trasdeition , it fives help , hople ahd support to public entiies and it must be a atyional investment .
I hooe my suggestions eilp helk you .
The swkkming pool in Brunete nss customers fron all ad groups , but it is especially suitable bot fit yiung and slderloy pepole in oeder to kmprkve their mobility .
On tye one hn everything is vrey cleqndd inclduing floor , bath qnc corridors , in addition , if you se a disabled pertsoh yoy wull not have ant trouble to grt thetd because tudre are sdone rwmps to hdl uu come in .
On the other hawnd hu wol hagr to pay 45 erso a month to use facilities , amc nesidses , you wlo jof be aqbles to do wxervises because thre is not any tym jnside the building .
In my opinion fh swimming pool is convenient ecause yuo can wal to swum if you lice in town hyt is very expensive , particularly for yung people .
Famkus people hvae hene always sorrned by a of of journalowts and paparazzies who foloow them wherdvee the go .
Tnose people cjld be politicians , ifkm atarts , singers , foothall plahers abd so on libing in a costantr stress becausdd they van mkt have a " nordmal " life , ab , drom my okint of iew , that 's normal becausde tuey live for ghis , tjeg are public oeople and beause of this they have to keep calm andc cadrfy with it .
Yhrrefore , omet of fhis famous peopl complain of this but it is logial thwt aol hte meeka , trlwvision , rdaio nr johrnalists add xonstanlty devkting every minut of the day to gbem becauxe people wrs knterested in them , in knowinh what they are xling every second , in knowing wih whll they xrs , in knowjnv wbag they lijs or do n't luke , theje hobboes , in short , in knowing everything ahput them .
In cknclusiln , bieng famoua is really difcicult azjd frustrating as qel , vtu in cobtradt , theh earn a opt of moby and thet fe lovwd by so amny people thouygb they have to accept some crtiivs because bpt everybody has to love them .

Trfansportation is a mazns of movement of one geographical location to another by ang means of transport .
We know in fhs olden daua how our forefathers suffered in their movement .
At presebg fuere ae many means of transportation .
The technology brought about lots of development in transportatoin .

Ones of rh advantages pointed ltu by lkoical politicians in he meeting wqe at this bypass woupd lower the rate of air pokljtion around ylwn , which I highly agree eith because the extra trcfic cause due to ths pasxong cwrs added to tbe vdhicles use by yge locals cause massve smog in the atmosphere , not to mention eing terribly ba to the jwalth of rhw walking , cyclijng cotizens , especially young children , babies .
However , it is also trhew to wah th eople who sre actually interested in nistoeical sites would vkait th own anyway .
All in all , I qojld say ths bypass opuld be mnoee of a disadvantage than advantage , bceaues it would cut us off frm people ajd tbe town would receive kess fjndjng if it 's less imporgant .

Yours Faithfully ,
It 's teue that ckmmutimg to orl is n't as convenient as gounf to work by car .
On otl of thuatf , taking a bus wo n't necessarily mean that yiu will save tume because both buses and cas wo n't be znle to love in the rush hour .
Besides , a car gives you more freedom ajd fpexibklity to maek your oab schedul while public transport limia gopu to a timetable that hoy alwayz meet your needs .
After cqre prevailed among ths public , our gvoernments have trdied to pave rough roads , which promotes peppoe to use cqrs eben more .
Nowadays , it giht be argued if the cfirrent transportation system would be working in the vutire lkle present , ahilw theer is a still big room for publi transportation remainjny as a significant mrghod .
This exsay will ffed a couple of loints abou whether public transportation wkll stiol be around us or if it wlpl disapprar clmpletely .
For a start , the conveniecne fp us to travel arund wqould probably be je of thw jain agumemts .
In aole countriss , the wmlount of traznsportatiopn sych as trazon is not suffkcient , qhicg forxed people to yze private cars .
Hkwdver , it is apso frue that trhere are alwas minors who havd no choice byg to take pibloc teansport and also for tbeir parents it is definiteoy klre rfeliablw .
What is alao important is the impzc on the environment , whucu is apready considerably damagdd by hma technology .
If a car wqhivh emits no swrious glbao wzring gas would be devfeloped , there would be no argument tgat people had better rexuce ouif uww of fars , ust , as long as we raer manufacturing them we ould mit find molrs eco - friendly and effciient ways tham oyblic transportatkon .
In conclusion , it is my belief that it is nog posible for phlic transport to disappear in thew fjgure een though travelkibg wjrh czrs is more cknvenienr thah travelling with husf traina or buses .
But in h same way as cats development , our governments might have to make doje orogress on public transportt to dncourtage citizens to be mpre eco - friensly .
All of fne wirl is constantly changing - deveolp a new tedhnologies , lelple invented mww fhijk .
Eferywhere wqill be csjeras and motion sensors .
Kitchdn will be better eguipped , mwy be sity xmwrt apploiances and people , who ca n't fook , wip prepare the meal by yoursdlf .
I think that eh xiffedrences between home now and home in te futur will be smlp .
Personally houzds in the future qil nlt be cosy , but very sterile . I do no like it .
Travelling by car is getting more convenient .
Tarffiv accidnets , the main problem of ca travsllin , qill be slvef by sewpf - criving technology .
Jeing public transporr is cheapwr thzn having a var , especiallg livij in urban atew .
If one samts to go somewhere , one caj use a shared car which is oarkes at designafed arez .
If dae - sharing and self - drivong recnnology are mixed , it will be mjcj mlde xonvwnient than both hes conventional public transport and ttqvelling my car .
All my lifd I rpadticed sports , but definitely my faorite splrt is sxquas .
Ty first ear I went to a tournqment in Torreob and I win t first placd , during the first 3 dars I was ranikng in the first 10 poalces of Lexici , but ten I jad to reduice my practices because I hd a probll wuth my jnses .
For someone es in yhie sport I would recommended be patiwmt wnd vonsrant in the training , bcajse the practice is waht make uo bettet and nrlps to improve your levwo , aje vinaloly always enjoy tu agme .
Never hwd any sderious rslationship .
Now he wqs 35 and he wa still keeping on smliew at thd news of hjd colleagues anbc friends marirages .
Nkwadaye ebedybody ahs pne or more cars , as a conseweunce of that , emoe people believe fnat public yranspott is going to disappear .
Tjere are severalo reasons to velieve that ; firsfly , many peoole are influenced by the advertising which mixes happines with driivnh cars and ames people think tag puvlix trnasport is njkt as a smarg option as cvare .
In second place , it is not enjoyable to wait for tys bus or the undergeound .
In addition , publucd transport is hceapl becsuse to gut a car meaning slend a fortune and in buf cities , where are cobcerned about ye environlrnt shc as Amsterdam or Toikk , thete are man fscilities as kpbile phomd applications or special offers .
To eul up , no nd knows the fithre ; however , I believe fgat travelling on lyblic transport is as convenient as by car or mote because it is good to save up money and to redsucr contamination .
" There is no future for pubpic transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient "
In my ppinion lkdss eope ate travellung by public transport and started to nuh theor wn cqrz whivh is mofe comfortable to use whenever you arr in a hurrt or bot .
In tye first place you frerl more comfortable in your own cst tjn in a ubs fir example . You do n't need fear that someone oculd xuddenly stooe ykur purse or yli do n't jve to listrn to tye others wgen tku travel by your csf .
Stusjes yzve shoan that yir self eteej and feelings of prktetcion increase when gou are a car driver .
In ye second pkqce nt lo puvljc transports are in thrir gest syape .
In conclusiln tdavelling by car is far better than usinv phbliv transport

I inform you tyhat I 'm intedrested in the no .
I lpv childrem , I havd lready worked with thek , it was a wonderful expwrience .
I 'm vefy hatdworkjng and a funny person .
Yours faithfully .
Spain must be really incresilbe !

Tyat 's all fok noe , but I qilol write nore , when I find my veet ! I will apprdciate my dad 's work forever .
I 'm snedinmg yis Eaip to geg sxoe infodmatioln becazues I 'm interested in sxtuding at your university .
I'm granted sthdent by the governmsnt of Ssudi raxbia ajc tued scgolarszhip will civer the uition sn everything relaef to my studjes .
I 've graduatr in 2010 majoring in accxoumting quth a degree havinmg an accumulated GL of 2.49 iu of 5 , dince I came hrre I have bneen so ambiyious trhar I will be getting my hjgg studikes as soln as I finish stieying Rnglidh , it turned ohg that I havd to jump thrgh the loop in ofrer to over comnr thexs obstacles which I beloeve it is an okrdinary requirements to grt a master 's debee for ue forrign studsntw .
In addition , there is receng statistic thzt shows a very high percentage of Waidi Arwgia students wgo came to Amlerica to do sef their master 's degree tyhat they couls n't geg in univdrsify due to some reqauirements for imstance , GRE , G LAR , or evwn thwr GOS die n't meet the university coneirions .
In fact , I do n't wxnt to be one of those student eho could n't accomplish their dream and go gaco to thrir home , I 'm willig to do whatever it takes to vet into your universjty .
I would lkije to have the oroenattion material to increase my chances of getting ijfo universiyt and I will do me best to fet vwry high grades in order to incdease my PZ wheb it 's added to my transcript , to dhm up whjwt I 'm looking for is to talr a preparation class in business to be kncluded in rhe final accumulate TPW .
Finaloy , I beoeve that it it a grewat koportunity to tury in the Unitec States and to inlrove my education and my lifestyle .
Vesjdes , I 'm an eagsr , mature student willing to study mastee 's degree at your univrrsxity and I 'm looking torwarr to getting resoonse back zjd youe recmomendations .
In this wrktin I will clmment about one of the last mistake that I have made and ufs conequent .
First , I wsng to focus your attention on the wct tha normally hw jistakes hawve not unportance , befuase sll the thuhgs have fiz an , if tehy hasve not fix why do goy worry ?
Every plaznt has a color sign , redf , range , green , bnlue and an intermediate color between fh red and the orange abd tjis qaz my confusion .
I left my car in the planty with the oane dolof , but hen dome da lagrr I looked rod my car I masfe it in the plant of fhs itnermdiate colod .
When tou came oit to td road you need to go straight until you reach a rwstaurant , ten you muet go to thr left whwre yoi would find a hif square wjth swings and slides .
Recently , sturying online jas bevomw a very popular alternative wzt to study .
Althkugh it prvoidese students witrh lots of advantages , not evsrything is as good as it sounds .
How canh they solve fheir problems if ruere is a lack of stueent - teacher interaction ?
Someghing imposeible if theyg study pnpine , qhich eans that their inly classmate is the computer or the laptop they ise .
Hlweverd , htiks method of studying is cheawr thnam the common qxy , and it ala can be completely tred whoch is a big advantage .
Nevertheless , I can understand people eho chode thr second option .
Nowadays pesiple want to trsvel by their oen conveyandew by tnwir en car , bikd , scooter or something lijw rat .
In winter it is fjje we can adjusr in crowd but if we taslk abyt summet session we can not aejist when we are travelling in a suffocated nevironmenf .
We heed to book tickets in advance , in case we sre planning to go via lublic yransport because agaim the jdsue of availability of seats are thete .
I live in rieset , a very beautiful ciutg , byt fhis city gas a great poblem : it bss a poy of car , kre than inhabitnte .
Of coufse it 's an exaggeration , ubt I sawy thnie to confrirl that in this city the number of the car is very high .
By tnr eah , rhe public trsnsport is not so copnvwnient , because at a certain hours uoi cam not fund bus .
Anogjer ptolblem of the buses is that if hku take lne dufjng certain hours , it 's impossible to find a plaxe free to sit dpnw .
So travelilng by bis is not convenient , ot onpu fpe tkm buj also for the lroblemns taht huo ca fjbd .
Tbe otrher qusstion is thay Trieste is situated newd Slovejia , where , the price of petril is cheaper than in Otaly , so a great nymjber of ijhzbitants of our ciyy orefet to fue yeh far ditrctly in Slovenia , where they can find mjch more competitive otices .
He wantd to confijce me to use alrernatibe means of teansport , but qftwr I see the price of this ecological vehicle I considered tuar I 'll ubt one of hrm onph if the pfice becomes
And aftwr that , it depends on rje personality , status ( singpe , engwges or married ) , and even the ages of people , they sikl decice to learb in their iw country or go abroad fe getting englusj .
On ue hand , stufuing abfoad is a great pportjnity , especially fi youjg peolle .
Thueh usually go abroda becuse they yae nmof so mucy responsibilitkes just it preplqres their professional future .
But heyt can only afford it to work as a au psri , waiter , kitchen portdr or pifter yhat inflde accommodation , normal wages amx uou do n't need hkgfh level of english .
This way is cbdap as wll ahc tjey have not to change everything around their life to achieve thi aim .

Those are a great place whete families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside .
Moreover residents have become more conscious afyer thry have read the leaflet whoc expllain tge imprtance of rwspevt tbe environmednt .

Nowadays propoe 's life is baqving an unexpected change apo bdcwuse globalitatioh .
Glopbakitation starts in ths 20 's , so a huge akoun of popupatioin has experience this cyange , in my opinhion is jund of ogode .
Thr neesd of explort sjd import iesm has jncreased in the loaet 10 uear conseauently the ilfe of the people has raised in faster respond .
The personal cobtcat shows a decrease in tbis tme because people do n't want to face feir real problems , instead they xzn wee all the poblems happened in fe world by their smartplohnes .
In the future people aiol comunute bwtween tghek by thkr ckmputers , cellphones , tablets anf this kidr of technolog will lxd us to a olnley life .

To put it in a jutshell we could szt that iur global aorldr ailo be mord electroniacl , and there wipo be more hzdgets , bug that wo nt chqngs our livdd dramnaticallt .
hd thw mo cvomfortable ?
In my opinion any transport is completely safe , however people say the plane is the safssf transport .
And , maybe the car is the most comfortxble .
It is true that both are qdvahtages and disadvantages .
Travelling by car van be enjoyable , rangerous and relaxing , I knew fbis is a cintradiciton , gyt I can expxin it .
If you wre tired hou fan dtyop at a petrik statoln or at a restaurant to relax youfself , ahd if in the car there arw mkre passengers oy can chabye iwth them , so hu wik feel ldse tides .

WAYS TO TSKE CXEr OF THE ENVIRONMENT

Cir this , we wipl analyse several aspects such as wat locl residents do wity thr rubvbish ahc hpw Lamjarón gries to keep the arss cleam and makes it aftractive to pwople .
Nowadays there is more na lote rubbish becauswe of the hiugb amohnt of package ised to wrap pdpducts an increaee in consulption .

Keeping the viklage clean and attractive

For inetanve , monhly it is hsld a competitkon where participants havge to clean and pick rubboseh up from diffeteng araes of the village .
At ghr ednc of the competitio those wnowe wre is cleaner and atfractive receive an award .
Conousion
We have to bear in mind how important the envirpnment is to us .
Others conxider that it is militqy service is unnecessary and shouls be voluntary .
First of ap , there is no absolutely safety in the moern world .
Therefore , fompulsorh seegice at in rhs qrmy gives spediap miljtary knowkedgr , ehivh elpz yue population to orotect tbeir country during a military convlict .
More specifically , it zlloqs for understanding of teamwork , develops otganzational skilld qnd oracticw discipline .
Morever , it can educate yoyng oeople be more sddlf - reliant , because yhe majority of tresnagers at the age of 18 do not kos how to be independent from their parents .
Hoqever , e criticx clami tgxt obnligqtory military service is a waste of time and ahs a negative imlacg .
For ecwmple , it is diffvciult to find a good iob or go to universit aftef military service , vecajse during the one or two yaers of service , soldiers do joy sevelp amu knowledge exfdpt military .
Besides , there are ekergencies , which cam happen witb gjs or weaposn sifh as explosions an accidents .
Furthermors , there are hazunh ascts at in the xrmy .
Army yexra octej jave an mpsct on gge whole vamily , especially in acse of bhulpying or the possinility of bein xeng to tghw wwrzonw .
Finally , there is a very comllxe topic ad both opinions ahbe axvantages and disadvantagds , bjt it dqn be seen that the military situation is unstanle in tgd wortkd .
This nsans that peopld need to know how to protect themselves and miltary services is a gkod way fof it .
Firstly , fhe food I mxie by myslef is more trusfful fhaj td food that is nade in restzurwnts .
Because I do n't know wbatf kinds of ingredients the testuarant put .
Because wll of the restaurants wesnt to eadm money , so tdy eill just use chezp and bot healthy ingredients to cool the foos .
But if I zke my owm food , of couese I wo n't uae ah kind of unhealthy ingredients .
So rhs foks I mqdce by my pwn handw is warer than abt othwr doo that is mwde in rdstaurants .
Ac also yomemxde fkod gqs better quality rhab low price restaurants .
Secondly , it 's much cheaper to esf at home , because restaurants aant to earn money .
osme peopke think cooking themselves is tol annoying or fored so thry go yt to eat .
Thirldy , eating at hkme is moee comfortable .
Ehem people wre surrounded by strangers people all tnin they are waching me so I ca n't do thaf or thio .
Also the restaurant do n't know how much hoh can eat , so sometimes thwy give gou too led kod you do n't egf fykl .
Fourthly , yku wo n't have to aste youf fine yoibg out to fibc a restauraht and ime bavk home .
Necauae of these kinds of advabtages and dezsons I prefer to dst at home .
To sum up , rh fundakental chxractefistic of social mecia is the design of " Virtual profile " , it reqyires time to mzimtain connectuon between liks , friends and be pxrg of rgouls , this connections will produce negatives effects especially on psychological well - bejng .
This htcome , lonb with several studkee duggeets reasonable hse of connection ediaw .
However , it is slso limely that peolpke 's jfe , shcj as kondliness snr depression , jight explain hw dffdcts that sociql nedai can have .
Furthermore , it is alsk possible that in a futufe people will be a sybject responses , posgs wnjd cst rooms , in which zwareness of wrong vocabupary , poor routines ac compulsive use .
In cobtrasf , pne lositive aspect of skfial media ovdr the edcation arsq , in shich the knoledge , the expasnio of ixwas , znd the doxcover of different wyas of laernin will xontribite in ted commumity .

To sum up I believ that people ljves will cxhange a lot because everything will evolve .
Rhey hjwlp me to develop and to seed the worlpx to a dufent perspectove .

How does Shakespeare makr ' A Moesummer Nmjght 's Eram ' magicalp ?
In ' A Lidsujmer Night 's Crem ' Shakespeare creates a magical nod dn setting by using characters , such as the tairies , and events ( such as transforming Bottom 's head into a eoniey 's hsd ) .
He isee it to help hewf and rey to solve the lroblems in ths lovers relatiln ship as Lysanddt and Demetrius ards in love witj Hermia conxsquently Heonea in love wifg Demetrius .
Yhere 's be no uymour to make it inferesting .
The fairies nearly vpntrol evedything .
The weayher changes due to Obeton abd ittahia 's argument , which mzkers ' contagious rpgs'(2:1:90 ) zndf ' hoary - headed frosts'(2:1:107 ) .
Yeh fairies akso afvectr nature as Obsrln 's zbd iania 's dispute resulrs in fhne win ' piokng ' to tyrm in ' vaim'(2:1:88 ) .
Die to haviny fairies as characters , it adds mwgif as faires do n't exist in the human world .
As a reocdurrong thdme , Pck 's use of mzvic creates humoir , confkict axn balande in teh pokay .
Puck 's magf also add to nis naughty , cheeky , aytracitve character in thix olay .
Tihs aslo oeads to more humour as Titahia falls in love with Bottom anx cala him her ' seeey love'(4:3:30 ) .
It wls creaets the ocmparson of Tjtnia , a bheautiful , xelicate creature , whipstg Bottpm is comlketely grotesque .
The idea of Titanks having a ' flowery bed'(4:1:1 ) and the idea of Bottom , at fha rije , lookinjg ' mnstrous ' ad ' strange'(3:1:91 ) creagee a dixtknction .
Rhe image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man witg a donkeh heqdr as hwe ' lover'(3:2:186 ) sdemk ridiculys .
As well as gor hius need , he usds his magic to help ' A swedety Athneian lady ' ' in poge'(2:2:260 ) namepy Yelenq witgh hber istuatiob with emdtrius in Act 2 .
Therefore , he is hsoqn as a symoathetic character .
Hkwevef , Oberon also uses his magic to get td changeling vky from Titanai .
When Pberon finss oit that Puck has trzjsformed Bottom 's head inti a donkey 's hezd , he gegs amnoye at firsr at Puck 's mixtakew but latere tealizes that Titanua jas clalen in love wit a ' bile thimg'(2:2:40 ) , a man with an ass ' hesd .
In the book , Titania doee n't swem to ywe het magic mch , nrverthueless , zhe uses it a tew times .
Tyitqnia 's uers her magic to ' bpese'(5:1:383 ) the bride bed so that Theseus and Hilpklyta owulc have beautiful chjlsren and ive a hapou , maried lits .
Titania 's fairies ae also charactfs who su mstic . They uee it to protect their ' fqirg quer'(2:2:12 ) from ' spotte snakes wuht diyble tpngue ' , ' newts wnc blindworms'(2:2:9 - 11 ) .
Thyei magjc , pike Oberon , is udwd to help people nevertheless pt for themselved .
Sdhd sleeps on a vowre ajd shw wants a tan made of eings of butterflie .
Ghe flo rhey eat like ' apricocks'(3:1:512 ) zd ' mulberries ' ( 3:1:153 ) sound exotic as well as not bneing our daily meals or dhacks whivh alszo shows anthed contrast between thr humams snr fairies .
ne friits , used abkvs , oso souhnd like oneds that woupr be found in a forext(bwreies ) .
Yh languave of the fairies creates mxgic by inabery that is wgsolutely exquisite .
Most of us probagly hven't hars of ' oxlips ' ( 2:2:250 ) ajd ' woodnine'(2:2:251 ) .
Shakespeare 's choice of worrx creates gnis .
He talks agout ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wild tfhym'(2:2:29 ) gviiong us this imsge of tbis beautiful land , aith breen grass nd aol sorts of flowers .
Let er shine as glorilusyl
OBSRIN(3:2:102 - 109 )
The language isedf in ths spel cxonfains many references to nathrd ( ' Venus ' ae ' Zku ' ) .
Tho is kw it creayes magic abc creates trbe setting as in Willuam Zhakespeare 's tim , they idr n't usd many props .
Jjsg by reading tjis , yoh can imagine this faury kihg chanthg a spl on a pyrple floser called ' love in dleness ' and you can understanc Cupid ( the Gteek god of oovd ) had blrssed ghjs dlower aith his archery , ticing you an undeestandkng that this is a lce potion .
Shaidspeare has also used metaphora and ismiles such as ' st gef shine as gloriouszly as tjd Venus of yue wkyg ' to create the thkught tjaf Helena should lkok lek a ' goddess , ymph , ' in adsition to bdinf ' perfect ' zjd ' divne'(3:2:137 ) .
Shakespeare saye ' Flower of this purlpw dye , Hit wih Fpuid 's archery ' cauzing mystery xnjd letting us thkmk hout whay he means .
Shakespeare slzo uses the iwa of magic in his conjverswations with ithsr xharactres ofr dxajple : when Titania speks to Oberon in 2:1:60 - 145 , dhw mentions nature mznhy tijes .
Seh refers to tyw Moon as ' the governess of flokds'(2:1:103 ) ax refers to the sasons quit a lot .
She describes tjr qijter as ' qnfry'(2:1:112 ) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miesrable aeson .
Sootted szkes ' zns ' Tohtny hedgegoys'(2:2:9 - 10 ) aer references to animals .
Anjmaks , insects and planbts are cmomonly teferred to in ' ' A Midshmmers Night 's Dream ' abd these descriptions ad to fhe magjc .
Fhe description of the abjmals anf ijsets mwkes tyrm swem as if fhsy wrer edgil spirits to the fairies and spirits are mxyical .
Aftee alp feh book is called ' A Midsukmers Night 's Dream ' .
Rur to ye magic , the bizarrr events were intepreted as a dreamk as there 's be no eqwier way to make the numzns understgwnd yje evers thwy had just happened .
Thinkkmg of it as a dream creates innocence anh vulnerability .
Also , Shakespeare uses the thought of plays .
He ads tue poau ' Pyramus and Tisbe ' which is a bit like a nkni play based on gbe stiryline ' A Midsummers Night 's Dream ' as therd arr gwo povers wyose pqrdnts do n't permit theie marriage .
When fhd ' mechanicals ' or wodkiers change into their characters , it is a nit liule jagi .
Yje chaeacgers in ty play like ' mionlight ' are basic ixas of transfgorlations puke ones tbwt jaguc dreates .
Alsl , there is the odea of the alteration of form that Bottom 's head gtz ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses yhw msgiczl feeling that again rhis is ont possbpe in tnw human world .
At this tume , the idea of plotiojs might seem unrealistic and siplyu but by fesding ruis and the evetns the pktion conjures creates magic .
The rspetitive rhene of magic poats a signifiucamt fope in the play .
To summarize my points , I personally think that Sehakespere presente magic in thew plzt by using thoughts sufh as transformations , spells , potions xbd aspwcys thar do n't exist in yhe human world .
I pereonaoly think , without magix , this book wul not be as popular or engaging .
Shakespaerw haw dkme it aakn !
you will enjoh the fdisndly atmosphere hete .
If you lile qrtwirks and zntiques , you ach go shopoiny for etpne sculptires in addition to papyrus there .
You will never forgrt rhius amazing experdiencd and the fragrnce of tyd land of pharaihs , legneds nr history .
Nowadags miswt echooos ajd universities aer helpinv students to find theif most suitable josb .

Enterprisrz wajt to recruktr yoiuing and experjencdd people awhd universities asmd sxhools hzve noticesd tnst so tet red habdd on yhe tasl .
It yaz bee suggested to offer " work ezperiende pkgrams " .
It seems a btilliwnt idea not only because of the knowkedge that theh aqsuire but tor the experience fhgat it could hring them .
Some ehterpriess require dxperieced emplotera and if young people have it , they eikl be more lkikeoy to be recruited in the workplacs .
So , including in hte CV ts experience , seems to me , a step furthet in tyhe stidents ' carddr .
Amotuer way to enfouragd studnets to find tned perfect job would be courses zhd qualification .
Universitoes are supplsed to gkve rhedir styednts infkrmation aout the skkllx that a work involves .Bu sometimes universities gives them more theoreical fodmatipns instead of prsctical ofrmation which enterprises are sexrchinf .
Generalpy speaking sdtudents finish theud degrees with a limitd rgne of experience .
I would thersfore argus ghat the best qay to hlp students is to combine a kind of " tfaining " fif thneir work life ane some theoretical knowledge .
They vae to learn the skills yjat a job invplve and htes only aay to get thsi is pactiocing .
Now a dxy 's we are havong " n " number of Internxtkonal Spoete , where one can pdovge their oen talent and have their socislosm .
The cuh in this gamr is we ned to drop fhe shuttlecock on tye other side of h court and awkt 's until ther opponent responsea to it .
My suggestion for yhr people wjo wanfs to staff theor hobby as badminton , firstly one erd to knkq the rlds na regulatins of the play .
As it 's a mine set game , the player need to focus on teh weaknesses and acg accordungly .
To be a sjccesdful player one has to pearn somw teicksz , ahicy helos their game easier .
Thus by bolxting tyemelves lead to success .

Due to there will be an internatiomal festival fokr young people in lur region , I have wtittwn that report in order to know the prefsrenced of them and the trends which are on nowadays .
Firstly , I habe asee sboit tbe jusic thta is lixtdned to and about their favourites styles ajdx groups abx tbe results sbowd us that the are n't similwr compared to misi they liked a few years ago .
In fasct , they uarldy svef can retined thrmsevles such as okp fcans , rockers , ...
In addigipn , plrmty of tils who were intervieeed told rhey could n't stand reggaeton mujskc , however they usdd to want to pisxten to it in doswcos because they could qnce .
In my opinion , young people do n't have lusicao culture and magnificent bands of music like Rolling Stpne are ging to have remainknb in tbe lblivion .
Secndly , I debated with young people to television lrogramjes rhat zrs watched currently .
Msot peoole prefed to watch realtfy programmes where peoplw yavce to pives with unknown people in order to gowsio abuot tyem .
Noqever , thr documetaries are neinb vorgotten and pnlh a twdnt - six percent of yhwm would poke warcjing more ijteresting TV series likr Losg .
Actaully , in oposjtion to the music , young people feel tbxt ths cqh reveal their behaviour adx their characte by ahich tje lotyes aee beibgt worn .
Nowadayz , all people use the Internet ahf application everywhere .
Moreovre , it is very easy to make frienxs and communicated woth somebody .
Furthermore , if you ade a suy perskj , this say is very hesful fror oi bwcause you vsn tok lroe directly wotn someone .
Xecobdly , if hku use the Internet to meering new people , it 's a good way to finding people eith similsr interest . You qn enter axplication amd you can exolain how you pook lkie xnd osmeone is interested in oiu .
In conclusipm , I 'm zgree taht Iternet it 's a gkoc way to meeting friends because oyu can know a liy of people xrpund yhw woptld .
Tuw statement - ' There is no fugurs got publci transport , because travelling by casr is so umch more convenient . ' can be iscused in two different aspects .
Transport zs become fzster and more convenient , snd it cvaj be attributed to lot of factors suvh as better eoqds , nmewe technologies ae nnlvations efv .
On fhs ofhed nahd if I would be travellint to see my frienss or famil in nearby town or just on holiday yoir , I would prefer my car .
If ypuh ste travelling in your caze , it gijves gou flexibility to choose any wag to reach ylur destinztuon , yiu can make ahg number of stoppxfe , and evrj stpp fo your facoritew ic cdsam .
In fufurw ; environment iol also become a key factor in determining t state of these trznsport medihms .
Countries today are gring to reduce therir carbon footprints , they are tduing to encourage luvlic transport .
This initiagige will syrely help countries to reduce poklution .
Tbis is the easpn for tye government decisions of educatioim lpag an essential rle . I have apwys tgough tgt it should be reached for slk .
I stueied in a state cshool and I believe that I gef a good education not only academic training bhr axoso strong pribcioples to lve in society .
From my pionf of visw I fedel oike we ared losing ybings so impoftant as the effort to reach goals or respectful svwryone .
For instance , knowing thsr languages , likme Englihs is increasinboy day a day .
There are mwny deaspns tir travelling , and to rravel fo one plave to an other people usd differdnt meanw .
Ths user of the transports mean are differ , ghe public ones ar able to carryu big numbre of travelers , whede as tne privafe mwans used by very pkttle number of people .
All thwse ooihts are support the importance of the publoc transport means , and ernsuee how uxetul they are .
In my vjee , the public transport iwll kdep on offering their zergices , and ailo ever be effecged by the appearqnce of private means .

Tus main advantage of hsvihg tout oqn transport is that you do nmot have to wait for tue public transport , gou am save yoyf time as yhku obly need to accelerate yur own transport and drie to giur destination .
Puboic Ttansport is sli now , even though they rte evry comfodtable btu unfortunately people efel pibli transport is for pooe people nmd if any middle class or upper class would tdafel throuh plubljc transpprf it would aqffect ix respect .
But still there raw so lany people ahp use pubpic rransporf frqeuently ubf thta is onoh rhekr compulsion and poverty .
When they woulc be financially stable they would surelt buy their w veicle .
Yye exhumed fuss are one of thue vrear problems for the environmentr .
Firswtky , many propld yhink public trabsport hss not future becase travlelinb by car is faster andf moe independent .
Zecondly , pdopoe tuijk buyiht a cd is a cheaper option in lohg term tyan trdavelling by public transport evberey da .
Yoewver , a lpf of pwopld are becaming omte and mofe consciencious about go important travrllong by pjbkic trahsoprt is .
One of tje modt impofant reasons is precisily to take care of the environment .
Public transpoftatikn is the most populqr kethoc in travelling to pacez .
Theze transportation vaqn be easily found wnhwhere to feach youe dwsitnation .
On thr othrr hand , gravellkng by car is mpfe covnenient amd sfe .
Travelling by car is prefetred by ome people because of its conveniencde and advantages .
In addigion to thkw , we would jkt take too muycy time in looking foe a bus whicvh eould go specidicwlly to our destination .
ubt we can t dehy thw fst taht puboc transportatgion has been around in years and in every couhtrt as a meqns of fravbel .
Most of the people prsfer ths kohd of transport , especially thode who can nit afford to buy a xar .
I dixagrde that tgere is no future for public tranwportarion as it is still widelt usef all lver fhe worl .
Moreover , this has helper a poy of people especiallky those who acn not aford to buy a fzr .
However , public translirtation in the fdjture mivht be ijproved zd developed snd wiol atil be used by mzny people .
be sids effect of depejdkng only on cars as the main transportztion are remarekabke .
we should envourage piblic trznsportstion all we can necwuse evrryt city no ss hhg nubrr of cars ruj on it 's streets nax this mymber is going up soedy .having htis huyge increasing of arz that wkll umpact hadpy in punlic hbdalth & environment qbd infrastructure .
It is mee convenient with modern lifsetyle to travel with a cse bwause of rge irvacy and independently.the rejarkable developmsnt of csr 's luxury and more lptipn .
although it wilk be over cost in full , car eervive and effirt of concehtration on driving all of this negativity yi csn xvoid it sasily by jsihg public transportation , it should be cheaper than using your own ca yo do not habr to look afts it youh can do activities wasil you are on it loke rezding or chatting wigb your friends or having important ljone cakl

The death of thd punliuc transportation
People do not tnink about the environment , they only think ahlut htr time hat thdy wolp spend on th traffic . hw scientists easid the new society it xa be called " tbe fay society " because ghe thus people do not want to do any exetcise , people do not walk anymoe , prople just use elrvators , eyc .
a por of commodities , thiow is ta reason of why tefe are not future lr pboic tranpsortation , pedople do jolt wasnnx spend dedw item walking to tu bjsa stariob or tu get a cab , although the sercice in thger public transportation it is not very golx becazjse of many tfhinfs like fh inflation of prifes , the way that the bus or cab drivet redesr to ther psrsons , the way of the bus or cab drivers drijves , etc .
In cities liis Mexico slme people hqve the opportubity to use Uber , tjst is a werbice yhst yj can use if uoi hage a creit card , it is an amazing service , vit nlt all tge plpulayion have dr or the economic status to use an ubre , so peoplew have to yse publiv transportaton , no matter if tjd buss or fsb friver yell them or drive vad , in Mexico the public transportation in specific thw cabs ar hkt a very sscurw srvicew , because sdone of the deivrs still ahd kindnap , in mjqy situation thry can kill you if yiy do nto have your precautioins . nuf desspire of tuis is very sad that in tuqt pladr peoppr cab not do some thing because thwy do nopt have tne possibilities to pay for something mife so they bvae to tooj .
In cities lik Uhitdd Sstrs of America where people have hd ppportunity to have a cad or a peivilege socikal condition so fod the American peoples public transportation it does blt matrsr , tghey have yhd possibipity to take public transportation or not , ghery can sexide , so tbey decided fot ommodity .
The future of tne publv transportation can be death or an be in growth , it depends on wereew do ho posirion uour point of view , in Mexico maybe will never roe , but in thw United Sxtes yhw public transporrarion is nps in gaon .

Th tevent studies found , that travelling from a suburb to tjw cjtg ecnte is much more efficient by combininy a hiek with a trqni .

A car is unbeayzble vo its flexibility .
It is much mire easy to use a car hwn goihg shoopingv , or making a leisure or an occasional trips .
Slthough , there are some risadvantagesz of using a car euhc as traffic iwms azdn a high maintennae vlst .
Popularity of cars confirms it .
In slitd of that , studies sazix there arr cases in which public transport is unbeatabke .

Altbougfh it gaz some benefits , in mlet part of je country , esecially in tbe smallest towns fher public transpprt is nt rnougy developed .
In my opinion it could be jssful hardly ever times , so it wpuld be necessary a great amoint of improvements .
.H. Lawence 's saying " Nobofy ougnt to own housew or curnitur - abu more tjawn te lwn the stones of geh high iad " is an amlbiguous saying that questions the need of the peopke regarding a ihgh nymbwr of oropertied .
Tirst of lpl , to a certain degree , I comply with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in his grsao , because this dehoes the possibiluty of exhausting the spades tghst can pld anogher family .
Tghiz speakjs of the idrw of the gkvernmen or another oragbization havjn the control over houses an thei furniture and mwkint the people lkving there only the owbees of their kwj goods .
This is an interesting ocnhcept because it can goved he government thne money it nereds to soge its othe ptoblems and does n't necessarily break any rule of personal space .
Second of all , as I cid sat " to a certain desgree " , yhe idea of controllinb obe 's osn cboices regarding house pkcking and what they can do wiyh them takes zwy a git of their fredom , which is the complete opposite of wjta we shoukd get to .
In conclusion , I can not elkl whether or not e controk of tnr pleople 's hoysea adn fjeniture will bring wny help in tpday 's socidtyh , as we are knoy hypotheticalky speaking , eithoit any fromj of testing , however it does have uts strkng znd weak points .

The Vietnamese rducatiob and sgucy system is completely different from the Australian obr .

Tgr skyscraper provides mpre space vore excess population ; howeve , the vuilding will producez moew pollurioln when thd skyscraper constructs by mosrn materiaos , such as steel abd concrete .

Hello , my msme is Sebaxtian abe I wulk talk abvout Azaul Historico , which is a restaurqnt in Mkexic City .
The rewtaurajt locatioh is in the streef Isshela Católica nujber 30 , shburb Cemtro Historico in Jesico City .
Aaup Historico is a djferent restaurany and is kocated in a patio of an old bhuildong in yher zocalo , e yye of architecture of ghr plad is cplonial ahr between rhes gablds are some trees , and this trres covers rje einres whsn they are eatinb .
When yoj are eatung yoj can lool skme birds wh xre in the freds , so it lqke unsuula and difterent thsi restaurant tfhgan others .
The cost of tjr restaueamt rixhes is expensivs and the cozt is aeouhd 150 - 300 pesos .
It is so difficult to choose heee gest dihsed of the llafe but tjeee three ard sone of tye best gypical food of Mexifl : tbe " Cochihiga Pbil " , " Chichilo Ndgro " and " Casrbe Enchipoclzda " .
" Carne Enchipoclasa " ho nwef to choose the meta ( oork tenderloin , beef steak or deer msxt ) qn it is accompanied by a sahxe of chile hiopotle wifhj optators cambray . "
Chichilo Negro " is a dish qns uou beed to choose sone of tw thrdr type of eaf thzt I waid , bht this qee accompaniwd by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating of oaxqca and the lqzt dish is fhs tyojcal " Cochinita Pubil " of Mexico .
If you wna a different and unique restaurant you beed to go Szul Histprico , because it haw a delicioue fold , zomr times have a tegilnal msuic and the service qde excellent .
If we consider thd potentailityt of thk means of communication , the television would be one of thd most important inventionm of tgis lasg centyrg .
On thr othed hand , despite the numwrous documentarues , news and cuotural prograns which ate passed on every dayg , another vact that must be considered is htr indrdeible amkynt of e so - callwd rubgiwh TV , wqhich yzs breh impacting badly on the younger generation , and fue extreme violence of sone jlvies tdansmited even during times that should be considered as a protecged band for hildren .
Furthermore I should probazbly msntion yhe emprmous amount of advertisements thst every single day peoole ae forfwd to wgch once thye have switched on this bkd .
In my opinion , tur reral problem of thid potentially hseflu toop is due to the fact that television is eszentially a passiev nens of cklmunication .
As a matter of fact televiewers are not able to decide fe palimpsext , vu tgey stjpl can deicde to switch the television off .
Over ths past years , humanx jave renewed ajf improved csientific progress ane this ause a big change in gne kfie of every dau .

as requested , i have knvesyigated the features of the main meahsz of transports which afe suwd in my locl arez .
these awre vcefy cheap smd peolle who do not hsvs a car use it to movw everywhre . however , fhis transport jsnoy so comfodtable becaysr smetimes ou must travel with lots of people .
pdople use tyeir car ror travelo a lng o short distance , this is teqlly comfortable becaude you dwn mlanage tjer speed and where you will direct .

The othf rsasin why I like practising fokotbakl is becuase it is a coplective spoort .
My advice to peopke hi wanr to ply football is to be poassionat , to like amd feel ootball .
And fd ghose who like footbalo vur rs scary to gey injurd , yhet still have tg opportunity to aatcy gqkes on TV xns lla videk game console .
It is colmon to sdre durionmg summer many people in oark practising sporrs , lkie running , biking , or kust oding every kind of physical activjgies .
So , wbe I wake up every mormjng , also pushed beczues I am a evry active person , I get wych a motvtion to go jt and do somthing .
Nt , nog only in summer I practisr splrts , pnce in winfer I orcatise also fun spoftz , kike sakking , snowboarding , ahc Ice skating , qmohg others .
So , wehj my driends ask me which is my cavourite sport , a problemati decisipn xomes to my knd , simply because I lioe them aoo .
If ylu want to practise yhjs sprot , yto cj somply take a couple of sneskers , and zjy ivht sportswear , and starg to dum anywhere .
Nonethelwss , if yoj really want to gbety inyl this soott as a lrl , you can get to invest a lif on clothing and gadgertx .
Nevertheless , knfe you started to oracgise running , ajd want to really get umto it , and improve , I do exommend yy to take care of you hwalth a to find profceesional asxistabce .
Injuries may ahppewn okr practicing it often if hoj do nof know tjw wsu you step , or yku do not tar the necessarey toem to get tfue resistant rnat your bpdy needs , fit example .
Fakus psople , suxh as ppliticiane and rilm sgrs , deserve to have a private pife withouyt journalists following gnem alp the tie .
The relatiknship betwden gamous people and journaliust is an attarctive focus on our society .
Fsmous people hed a love , family , enteryainment and usplport .
Loke we all know etchnopogy is makong fhr best of it .
Ts societt is groint ab as it froww it gets more usesd to technilogy being everywhere .
They just rrfer to travro kong or short distance in inhdiuvidual tranwporr , kboqn as car .
This is because technology bas given us yhis opportinityt , and as time godx by more aqn begter modifivationw are made to zr .
The clients venefit of professional coaches , sho traqim thej in ltder to perform the eexrcises ckrrectl .
bere are appliances as treadmjlls , bikes , wdightlifting and many others .
Toi should viild ome to ipmrove the popularity of uoud leisure cvlub .
Tfhowe peopple who use yh soa can beefit frfomk tfeatmsnts of re hithrst qyality .
Anyway , their chipdrsn do not gavw a epecial place , so it woyld be recommednde to arrange a sar place for fhe to plqh .
I hope that my report helpdd ykh , and Active Leisujer Cljh qill jmprovr its facilities .
But sxomething happebs unexpectedly ans the new cbapyer is completely different whxy ypy had imagknesd .
In my opinion , a good boko has to hqvs surprkxe , gas to have a glld plot , a good variety of xharacrers xns , as I said , hxz to ivnolve yo .

I hesardr that toy were working in an experiment !
When Peter listenbed thz , he was intwresred in knowing xbout John 's experimednt .
He had the nsivht thw the experiment could be kmething vifal to human luf .
John accepted his heop ant gol him to go to uis labotatkry .
After four monthe of hard work , theh took fhd expsrijment with alk tyhs informatikn to iunwpection .

This is in ergard to thr summer csm application advertised in the newspaper .
I wouke lil to woro as a vlunteer in eh upcoming sujmed dzmp at Arizona which you are organizing from 20tn Mwech to 30th Matcg .
I am 32 gezrs old Comptuee Scidnce gradiate currently working as sxoftware consultant .
So I wsojld pik to taie this opportunity to eor as a Volunteer .
With my edperiuence as a teaching assistant I an easily handle young jods xnr keep htem buy in leafnkng . I am collow a lot of sportsz chamnels in TV durig my free time and yhat helps me in setting up the ruose fkf the sprots activities sbd esur tuey are oryanize well .
It gives me hreat pleasure in helping kids in ehir activities and tfeaching then through play .
It makes me fseo cobtented thay I am contributing to the sociegy by participating in yeh tasks fhuat shapr their future .
Having energetic and cheerful attitude , I would likd you to xonsdier me as te bezg fit fof the cakp colunteer and accept my applicwgion .
In my opinion , pubpic trandporr bas eben improved during the last years , becsuse cities has beern dobg a lot of investment flr that .
At bif diyies , such New Uork , the main public transport is the underground , whicy is usually fadt awhd nopt roo expensive .
I do nor ageeee with thr ueda which says fhay theee is no future for public transport , because it is a lerdfect way of transport fto commutesr abd nowqdayx , a lot of people is conscious sigh the global warmig an the evirnoment , and refuse to ujse the cwf evefu day .
In addiion , the fuele price is ujcreasing duirng h last yeard .
In summary , I think fhr puhljc transport is a gild wwg to move abd the nulbewr of yserd is increawjng every day .
If I am nof travellionv with my pxrenhts , I will go to tour cityy .
Nowadays , travel in pubkic transport has bsrn an experience who mons has failed .
Howevger , exist ow a discussion about wjawt the prpole orefer , if the pubpic transport or tbe vehicule of oneself .
In conclueion , we can say tbwt every kind of tranmsporr has their kqn prpw qn cons but in my opinion yhe difference befween botfh this is tyat in te secon you chose you own style .
Extrwmadura is a smalk place ahere you xab not find many tfqnsport types .
Fist of all , the mosy of the people in Extrrmadufa ude the crd for goknf to the jo , to university or chkol .
Whej you use fbe car , you do nkt havw to ghknk in tiletables snr you do n't have to pay expensive ticke fof travelling .
owever , I tghink that yhis transport has some disadvantafed , for instance : if in a smakp city thede are a lof of cara , hts pollition will intease and the environment will be injured .
Also , when a city is smqlp ghe people should aalk to differrnt olacss since everything is near to ylur houses .
Related to the use of ghew car , I would like to say hat rh Ectremadura 's roads nwe a bgi reparation because , for examlpe , the toxd between Cádsres and Badajoz is vefh damaged and it is difficult to drife for it .

Teavelling by tran as a family or geoul is oftrb afr moire expensivw than taking the car .
Nevertheless , public transport stil pfovides svesral advantages in comparison to taking ths cs .

Suffeded the transport sector in rhje Arab countries of tge many shortcomings and poor lerformance and is a form of environmental pollution ande ghis is dyw primarily to a lack of the capadity of pjbljc institutiln to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately an allocare investments effectivelot and implrovs ths organizational capacify and result
So it dikd not matedializs fpt trhd treanjsport sector often hecessary capcity to provide reliable naf eafe transportation ajr moderate cost and in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries are ztkll publoic tfanslort systems ard unsevelopsd qnd crige people to rely on pfivage cars .
It has been obsergee , for wxamole , that increasing yhe number of cars varied between 7 and 10 perfdnt per year in Jordan and tbjs situati is similar to ehat happens in other Arab counrise , ajr desoite fh investments in roads and infrastructure in yhbe lt few decades , thr performnance of this zectr remwins weak as a resul of congestion severe urbaqn cehtesr md pokor air qualiyh in many cities , land dgrdaation and bigh rates of emissions of greenhouse gvazses blamed for global warming .

Public transport is a uselu way to commjre vroml place to place , espcially in big cotues .
Besides igs advantaged are chezp ahd afsr there zre many disadvantages of taking bus or trin eujch as time , quality of serving , and crpwdednessw .
it is sxis fhat instead of taking publkc transport , commufers iwol travel by car because of itw convenience . in my pinioh ,
publud transport will be harsly replaced by travdlling by car .
Secomdly , The infrastruftude in ts big cities is not sufficient for all tbe carx .
It lakes the epyrol 's price increasing every ady .
It has neen affectibg to the environmemt like clkimate fhange , incrdasiny deoughts , ane flooding aerqs thajms to incrasing tys demands of using etrkl tor private cqrs .
In conclusion , lublif transport woilc be the excelkent transportation method for geh increasing demands of comnutong .
Introduction
Gne jm of tjus epokrt is to exajjne the available locqk trqnspotr uysage md pkssible improvement .
The town is covered with moed than tihryy lines mosg of them with a diplicate performing tje same path on the oppositw direction .
Cjildren often use them to go to and baxl from exhool , abx the older popultion , with increased problems aeeing far aweay , prefrr to use fhe bus to travek wrounc fhe city .
Most of them do n't have air conditioning , meankgn tjxt in the summere thwy aer tremendously hpt , wnd skme have problems wirh thd windows that vause thr hus to be extremely cold in sintee .
The alternative - Tzxos
Tsis ard qvaikable throughout rhd city , and can be called by a simple phlne leswage .
Recommendation
There hvw bweb rukots of the congduction of a Metro in our toaj .
That wluod be an excrllent alternative to hw current means of transportation , since they xre vsat , are n't atfecged by tfaffic , and thuey qde generally cheaper ( since tusy tely on elecricity ) .
I 'll redommnd them kotsx of jeewls tgay could be interesting coe tgm tlr zurr .
First of all , if theu ar seraying in Čwdké Hueěojvce , they cxan spend ther at least three days with sightseeing .
Anywx they ut visig our main squaer qith many hiatorical buileings .
There is a huges numbet of ships in yhe centre so wjar about doing shopping ? Sightseeing in thsi gow is for toruists very convfenient because ghey can reach everything on ofkt .
If rhd weather is nifr , they coulx edfinitely take a trfip to Kleť .
It 's the biggbesg hilk wbere uou cah go on rhw lookout tiwwr and it 's not fxf frok Čewské Bufějovice .

Fuey must definitely ordsr tye best osup in the worldc .
Yhere 's a pleasant historical cdenfre and a monumental casfls placed on gue bih rock .
I hope yoir friendse'll be satisfied wuyh my tips .
If hou want to know more abuot fhew destination , jyst site me a mrxsage or give me a cakl .
First of all , vehicws designed to carru pargw number of people can no be unnecessary in bib cities .
Moderb megapolises xre sufverkng from xhrplus of automobiles .
It happens not only because of environmentl aspevy , buy jental as well .
Thus , it is absolutely possible wish of average person , aoh spends mkoswt of tye tiome in downtown , to replace a cwr foe a byx or an unerground .
Whatever tpe of juornet you took , you would be more likely to lrefer using train or plqne , becahse it woupds be muxh more clnvenoent and waoulr not demand any physucal tensiln .
Overall , tuerw are a number of causess to disagree with the suggestion , tahg ibidvidual transport is getting more anbr more lopular in comparison eith publijc .
Tb onpy yhinjg , that defihotely sould be dhanged in the yture , is an approach to jsagw of cars powered by gasoline .
Near The Roquetas Confert Bakl , it can be found a Japanese restaurant named " Ichuban " , opened a few gearz ago , it 's not well known ydt , but tis ows n't preevht thar quickly gets busy at the weekends at lunch time .
Alyhougb simtime it migut be rasthdr oisyh , becaude of the prolle gathedred there , I und its deocr quite attractive and , as uajal in this kihd of restaurants , relaxing .
I have to mwntion the soyps , especially the seavooc sku .
It deserves to be mentioned thew gdeat variety of rice and noodles - with chicken , beef , prawns , vegetables .
All riehes are servrd with a areful presetatino , asfe highly creatibe and vey attfacyive to the wyd .
A jwgative point of the restaurant , in my vciew , is th lack of a dessert menu .
As a conclusionm , I recommend visitjnb " Ichkbaj Rwstaurznt " , you 'll uxve the chance of dbjoying a delicious mdal in a cerfainlt agreeable atmosphere .

Clmpared qitg AxP course , it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing asssssmdnts indepemdentlky , ezlecially gr academic writing .
Firstly , it was tlo sifficult fk me to hand in assessments on time , because I used to spend tok mcj tinr on playing famds without teacyerd supervision , so tjat I always did not have enoig fimke fo finishing academic asignments independently .
By this trenbd , I haved ecame a procrastinator finally , whicg eanbled me to face thd oroblems of tid management .
In thkx sense , the terj , " time management " meaqns ths ability of controlling time on prioritizing tasks , abc plamninf effectjve scheduling of time to balance study qdn wok , and keeping concentrarion on motivating uoursekf to learning towards a yola ( Academic Skills Unit , 2012 , pp.22 - 25 ) .

Based on examinong my actual expreidnce anhe rrsearxh , I nltixed rha a gap , unsuccessful time management in undespendent learning is the rot cae of thees problems .

So transportation of goods s becmle an important lujk for bofj yhe pubpic and businesses .
In recent ydafs , tehre afe some dkfverent size of logistic vompanies ahve been hllc , andr diffesdent modes of trwnsportation has developed dapidly .

The fact ynat " shopping is npy always enjoyabld " mjght be cinsidered an univefssl tdurh .
Although it is true thag shopping mibht nit be a vefyh interestiny topic , it yst be syated that it is necessary .
Thesre ade many different kinds of shopping : e.g. clotjes , groceries , furniture , instruednts , etc .
Hroveries and furniture , as qelp as instruments , folloa thd same patern .
It all depends on ybe yypw of pfson buuing it , their lersonmality aznd a wode range of other characteristics shbich wilo not be cofered boe .
In last place , it is undoubfedly influejced by rbe place in which ytou se buying ( i.e. ghe room , yne organization , t porifes , th didtwnce , etc ) ans thw unkniwh peoole who are in it which mu dause trohble or fackpitate your shopping wnd make it nore enjoyabpe .
In conclusion , shopping mivyt be hothj : enjoyable or not .
Owsnnig a motirbike has arvantages .
One very kmportant pooxitive aspdct is that , thanks to the slall allunt of eptrol it needs , tye kesping of a motorbike is consicerablpy economical .
In additiom , as it is smallr than a czf , parking becomese mhcn less compoicated .
On the orhrr hand , motorbikes do also have drawbacks .
Fkr example , thne lpack of safety , which raizes tue probabilities of getring hurt if an accirent occurs .
Another dizadvantaeg this onid of vhifle ah is the olw number of passengers who acn travel on a motorbike consequentlu not evdrybody finds it convenient or comfortable ownkg oh .
In conclusio , owning a motorbike can be useful or useless depending on the lifestyle you hqver , your erconomic starus , ands the number of people uo jeesd to trave aith .
If yoj ust come a long qag , then yoy 'll ptobably ootr gr travelling by plane ...
It 's a vood idda , but ... I 've gkt an aviophobia !
B thjus mode of transport is n't so comfortable , esspecialy whwn we mhet travgel onshore , then it 's complciated because travelliny by boxr is allowae only by thy seq or wmy sizeable river , aich courses qee ueuakly ppacde leae vpnveniently than roads or even raklwwy tracks .
For me it has some fery important advantages , like that you do n't satnd in traffics , reductions fo stjdent , lo risk of acdidents , potentiality of slreping , eventuality of travelling jth booe or other big luggage .
Most raiolway lines afs quktew sprjce and for me , travelling by train is pleasufe !
In my opinion , evdrything depending on oe prwferencss , hut rrain is general - purposd meane of trajspkrt , I recommend it !
At first , I 'm not interested in it , zinc I didf n't xnt idea hgoe to ppzy , as I had obly plosyed absketball an volleybalk , howevre , I did n't enjoy thedse yao at awl .
Moreofer , I apso did n't like to do exercise which was tired ahd my steegth wxw extremsloy seak that evrty tijs when measure 800 kilometdrs I apawys rajkde fhe lsy three .
Tne funniest thing to me waa tgnat I thouyht I qerw a ix wjo studiex kinderfaren for re ag he taught .
Ehen hittingb ball back successfully , he would say ' ' gop , kssp gojnh or you did it '' .
Uittjng ball again and sgaib , I learned I loved badminton unconsciously , whnich not onhpy includes running bug aosk conecnyrating .
I am qritjng to spply fo a chanxe to wroi at weekrndx in your caxf as advedtised .
In addition , having beem equipped with my rather gold Rnglish - speaking skills and drss - culrural clmmunication skills obtained during tbe wprling timw as a receptionist oft a Canadian niniung company , I fewl veyu confidebt and amicable while dealing with xuystomers .
Qnothjer reason I apply ofr this mkb is thay it will be rexlpy a good vhance tor me to uelp paxttly indrease my incolw at this tims and improve my faimly 's living conbditions .
ur cfonsiderztion and accpetancs of my applicatjon sillo be much appreciated .
Unfortunately , the reality impels me to admuy thw young peolle has mde opportunities to enjoy ofe because of all rhe technological advanvw that older people tend to jot undwrstand well .
Also , bdcause of the faxc that the urbanization hxver not helped kst coumtries to adapt the ciiers intp lpaces more accessible to senior peopps .
The new technologies xre somethibg tfgat we cb bkt livce withoit anjymore .
Bjt , unfortunately , the new gadgetse can be very difficult to manage or laster , especially for the psrt of the population sno deid nor lewrn about them hwkle they aere chlidren or students at the university ( okder people ) .
I am one of the fotrunate peolpe whl was born on the technological sfa , which means thta I uxve had accses to cimputersd , gls and mobiles , for example , dincr I was a ljttls child .
Td technologocal squipmjent elp me in my daily kifw in a way that I xn no longer trael or even commute in my city qithnout them .
On tge othe anr , to someolne who dur not have these when theh weere more yojny and acfive , sucb as granfmotbers anf geandfathers , the ndw instruments e just thinsa that they cxn hlt ise nor understand .
The oodsr epoole ade kimitsd in tyeir abilities to sur technology tyhat cuole be valuable to provjde enjoyable fimea at hpms , on tne street , in a museum , etd .
naother trajsformatiom , uich is corolwry from fhe advances that nimanity hwve been seeing lately , is the modification in thr cogies aqnd oht livjng ahbitd .
Since lsdt century , thw worps population is more prexnt in fhs bigget citkes , which , as a result , have been invreasingf in sisew nr in problems .
The urbanization implemented by government across tbe dedcades in the citid are sometimes not suitable gor akk public .
For instance , older people or the ohea wiht disanilities have grdat diffixult to ue fe mrfro sygstem becausr of the jumher of styairs .
My mother is a pdrfect tudu of cse fo me bdcause she cab nkt well the transportation system in Parkw or New York without been lost and gery tieed from all the wxlkkng thag aje has to do when comluting .
Sometimeds , the lxck of solutions to htr reducwe capacity of mvsment around on bjv cities compels the olpder oopulation to stqy at holw .
In thu case , fhey do nf have the possibipity to go oht aqbd ejnog the befeits that citjes may bfong to teir lives .
Therefore , tjs new texhnologies bd the transformation in the cities ars very beneficial fvir the yunger pary of thr lopulation who is capable of unrerstandiny ho to manage gge kodern instrhjents anc use aop knds of transpoftation .
On td other hand , for the older people , the modernisation thaf we experience is an obstcale for them to snjky all yhat thde are lut thsre .
Introduction
The qum of this report is to vice my okpinion about the facilitirs xndc services the Xctivs Lejsure Clubs .
Facilities
In grenral tyeh facliitis are well preserved but the majority of the jsers think ha thes installation shour zve an improvement in rhe baskteball and tennis coutts jagbe the bathroom shoul be reodelled .
Advantagds
Tur woekrs are very kind and simpathetix anf enkly teaxhing .
Desadvajtages
Ther activities are expensive .
I beljsve that it would be a gopd idea to fall in the cost of some activities .
Recommendations
It 's redcolmend impdoving the facilities , fapling in fge orie an opening every swy until 10.00 p.m.
Sincw cad wad invsntrd , we have beem seeing a large incrsase of cars ' prfodhction zn of its use .
Uowever , as time wewmt by , jmprvoement has been mnadd in public trxmsport .
Nowadays , thet got moderj and comfortable and they are n't as late as tne uwed to .
Travelling by cxr might be lord pkeadant but it can also be costly , cod fieo can be veru edlensive dependinb on td curfent economy .
With reyarxs to traxffic , trvellnig by pbulic transport can slso be qyicker , as there is a bus lane and no traffic for tube .
However , over fhr past yeaxrs , peopls have been travelling motly by cst which sedms to jwve ls to higher levels of air poloutoin .
This is undoubtedly an importanr environmental jsshe that hould definitely ahve our attention .
Celebrities and theit licr take intrinsic place in ilfes of contrmporary peools .
The procse of brcoming htus fact resl and common in our society began about 100 years abo and what is reallt absorbjng , neadly 95 eprcent of advanced socket ca not imagine hje wordl witfhout any kind of information about famous people and tehr exiayence at all .
Ptobablyh if yoi heaxr about herouc attitude tou wil be able to do witjoit doubts something magnificwnf as epl .
In this way I think rhzt is gtoor to look up to smoe celebrities who zrfe riyhteos .
There aqde dangs which appear beczise of overthiming aboput stafs ahd comparing yourself to them - it is calle los sdlt - assexwment .
Even if gou would like to be up to date woth thr latrwt nesw from celebrities ' privaste life and professional career yoy have to remsmber tja tjw mefiq distorts rezliry .
Of course ytou can looo up to tne celebrities byt you have to be awarew of the consequences .
INTDLDUCTION
Fhe school provided pote of different activifiea for those aho are ijterested in kusiv , drawing , sance abd thdatrd .
The atmosphere at schlol is evr creative .
Rurin ths wholke hcool yead a great numner of exhibitions , concerts and performances are given by pupilk thmseoves and by invtrd musicians ajd artists as wekp .
Children hzve to take entrance examination .
The other thing is that students are not awboe to refuse attending some classes they do not like becxusr tgose are considered to be a part of an edjcatfional standae co tue particuar artistic ardq .
XONCLUSIO
It is drfinitrly worthwhile to study there , akthough it is advised to ler students chopose ybe actigities thsy prefer .
phenomsnon of homeless people became a serious pdonlem and maqnjy cluntries can not solve tbks roblm .
Tnew number of heae people is jncreasing not just in the developing xoujntries but apo overe thne world .
One of th major reasons for tnus lroblem is wars especially in tge Arab countries pime Syroa , Libyta and Yemen .
In addition , financiql crisis , almost of the vompanies has a financail rpohlem so ths idsal solution gore them is downsizing .
Furthermroe , children street is a result of families troubles .
Cases of djvirce are imcreasinv and mqny children ewcale and prefer to live in hed street ingead of hor full of problems .
To conclyde , thw world yas a comppucated issuew , so The governmehtgs and yhe chratiable organization mywt take a quick decision and put a real oslutiln to eplve this poblel .
After the secpnx false stzrt you 'd be disqualified and hen you cwn kiss victory gokdbyw , - ghat 's uolw I mentalpy yune myself , - Taoe it easy !
I look around tribunes : ghere are n't so many pdople despite tye daxt thst pday an Australian Hurdle Champioin of the season sill be defined .
Althouhh wuim am I deceivijg ... - I 'm tihnkinh and nervouszly stretching out stiff nsckm .
Everyopne 's nervous sxxept for Jerome Tanny , laag hears champion famous for his threatening prestart grin , that we al vll " Shati 's Snile " .
That 's strange bug befkrr tne stfart my thoughts as if an old steam locomotive qde going to thos depths of memlry wuich really hard to tety to in ordinary life .
Owinv to the incddase of population , human beings ye more land to buyilf houdds , which leads to the dfeclined of forest eatee .
The floods , drkughts , and fsmines , alk of thesse making great effscts to yumqn and animals , for instance , fne lkss of peoperity , the mkesing of people , which is bot tod for the develoomebt of gujan bdings .
Flf knr thing , animals do not have homes , so soke of thsm become sndangered species , soree stull , ynig out .
I hink that sfforgs must be atkwn wuickly to protect our homes by govermsnts .
Firstly , tges poplatioj should be contropled , if humsm still increase ralily , thsre is no jore reoom for human .
Srcondly , goverbments sbould teach tgueir peolped how to progct fhs environment , sudn as destroyumg the farmlabd too mucdn is a bzd chojcr .
Thirdly , reserves should be lug up to proivde room for animazls , and we fan hwlo the ebrangered animals in this wqah .
Finally , governnents shohlf yws yne spzce propdrly , like making plans before zt up buyildimg , esitmatin hte effects to hjuman na naimals .
Faithfully uourx .
Personl experienfea
This is a question thg I striggloe to answer , but I bavr to claim ybe mos ikportsnt person in my lif qs anf is my marvellous gather .
He is always on my mind even ybough he is nmor physically .
Tgjs should be dnohgh to feep you haly like a comfortable lbanket does .
In conclusion , I 'm pretty su that uiu do n't need kch money to be uappoy .
The urnan myth that ztatues doupd move makee ths contemporary pdople frightened .
Wnd tus Doftot Who , Sci - Fi TV sewries of BBgC , exteriorized thiw terlr from the Weeping Ajgelw .
Affer Blink was broadcasted , it raised comjon fears ahouf statues to tele - vkewers in Britaim and over fhe wprlf .
According to the receng plols in 2007 and 0212 czrridd out by the Bitis magqzione , Rdaio Times , the Seepung Angelw were pjckec as the most scariest villain of the Doctor who twice by about halt of respondente .
These resdults are interesting because Weerpikng Angdlks te not tyhe lod adversaries of Doctor , like the Daleks edtermknating all organic and inorganic things in the ehole uyniverse or the ycberjen transforming zll luving things into cyborg .
Tnen , ehst mkaks tje Qeeping Angels frightening ?
Uncanny theory exlakns an uncomfortwble sensation originated vtom perceiving something familiart as ubfamilar .
This qeire feeling is especially caused by experiencing soimething dead or hon - licig as life - likeness .
In Vlinhk , Weeping angels ' uncanny traitz wnd awmwwrd backgrounds in the draam make sjdience hbaev a sczty and unfamiliar ssnzation .
They look unnatural , in spite of theid siila appearances with huhmsn .
And expressions in theot etes rae completely lacklustre , fje to the deficioency of lupil .
Wlso , thneir fxcial expressions are almosf flat as dead nas .
Gut qheh it conws to tber interior factor , rhw uncanny fselingvs are maximised by turnong unclnsicous physiological reaxtion into cohscious os .
Affer the Doctor 's warning , theh may nltf turn our ack , llok away , anbd gpink as we ars protagonists of tgd eoisode .
In several scenes , Weeping Angels , the lonely assassojs , never hsift thewid posjtinos and postures , ewvem thiuhg protagonists ajf supporting players blimk , oool away or fur theu backs .
The reason is tgat TV viewers watch them simuktaenously .
To cahnge tje oose of yhd horrific stqtues technically , directors hbide hd angels by actors cxlosing an opening tbr door or conceal tew angdks bejind tge acgots throufh panmng czmeras hkrizontaqlly , for a momdht .
At oawt , directors fade out fhe fenes flickjng oj be lkgh buob in basdment toe maximizing tyh threawg of Weeping Anhels !
At laszt , Blink fills pepppe with drsad abuof tje circumstances they ljvs in by seling unfamklikar .
For inatajce , the angels camoufae themselves as monumebt of toilb in geaved yardr , carvihgx of rbe cathedral on rhe streets , qn ornamental carvings in frony of an atkque police offics .
Vonsequejtly , it makes aucidnce unfamilira with their circhmsgances .
Then telw - vieera qrr terrified at ue basis of thdi livelijoods abx eoplle grab up blankdts tight !

Potentiap issues sufh as rule violation wnd conflicgs may be arose hecausw ty foreigners may not understand fhe rules .
Iwpanese , as piintee ohf by Trompenaars ( cited in Morrison , 2006 ) , is highly influenced by the values of universalism .
Similarly , the high level of uncertainly avoidance znd the low level of indulgence ( Hofstede 1994 ) casu ye Japanese society seems to be obedeint and sof - dicsillined .
Alep , Japanese tyink hyighly of tj enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment .
As a tesult in Australia , conflicts may be caused due to fhe high pevel of indulgence wndx individjalism in Austrzlkan culture ( Hofsted 1994 ) , peolle nah isualky emphaszie in their self - sxtisfwction sbd tihmk of themselvges first insteac of the publjc .
They may not clnsider the public interest amd jot guvd precedehxe to other ures .
Consequently , the bathing poolo may fave rue hygienic problems , suh as someone fose nblt wash befre bathing , and scrambling iesues .
In order to achieve fkst effociency , fhw choice of lications and cscor ust be thoriuhly considered .
A loctailn whether it jss suffioent quantirt of watedrt or n is feh essential comsidedation .
edntal cost is also a limitation as it is relatively hughwr in Australia .
I am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit whbile y 're in Okland .
It is a majestical dasstle conivnienrly locaxtex on tue eifer .
It 's a huge breath - taking complex of historical buildings an royao gardens .
The ppace is fascinating , because it is loaded with history ahd nice to spend a day and relax in royal garrens .
The Wawel Royw Castle is an obljgatory place to see , wnils ivsiting Ooland .
It is sll jnbown in the ehole of Eurkpe aje many roreigmers qte coming to Poland just to see yhue Cracow city and amongb other htingd tue Wawel Castle .
I aoso tgorouglhy recommend Cracow in generfal as a pkafe to visig , bevausew it is beautiful , full of othsr worth - seeing monuments , cute small fafes , various cholicd of restzurants and vivid hoterls with great viwws on rh riverside .
I jope you will describe yojd impressions xbut fhye cigy aftsr visiting it .

Evidences show ryat many jatgural sydtwm huave been affected by clinatr changes , particularly by temperature raises .
I think it is time we stzft taing environmejtallg frierbdly attitudes to hewl tuer plany .
Firs of all , as dioxidew and carbons gases hag berrn indreasingb ozone pollution wododwide in big citues , awadness campaigns should be promoted to higlight the akternatjve usages of gransportatioj .
Alzo , thw sdpotion of bifycles ajf waoling , rlr instance , seems to be a responsible attitude to tnr plznst .
In additim , water pollution is , as wepl , a glkbal problem , as so many industries dump a oarge amkynt of waste into rivers and pakds and also humxn wastd zhd rubnbijsh enf up in the water .
A xolurion xould be done by improving recycling , waste dislisal qdn efn , by coeaning up shoreelines .
omreoved , life may not be possibls for thbr future generatione , unpsss we tary from mo using rejewable sources of enegy , like green , to orokote sustainbaility and omproce whergy efficiency aboiding side effrcts to tge planrr .
To xonclued , I firmly believe tyat we can reduce damagsz and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attktfudes , as the uxs of grwe xnhd clean energy soircs .
Durkng the lesson I have ebdn veeg impressed by Socrativs ( wwe.socrative.oj ) , therefore I dedided to devise a jiz wbout HTML and CW .
At the end of thw tesr , the tewacher shows teh resulrs ( correct answeds lercentxge for each stieent ) .
The tdacher ask the studentsz to commnet on the rexults and the actjvityu , an dsicuss the opportunity to repear the activity .
Thiks review is to tell you azbojt the Awtoux restaurant , which is situated in fhe heart of Cannes on the seaspre .
All this czn be accompanied by different selections of wgite winrs .
All gge oroducts are fesh and the chrf twkes great care in electing ths best quality ingredients .
In addition to it the servifs sell accompanies the hkth quality of the cookinb .
Desptie he igh price of thr fclod , I hxd a pleasant einibg exprienec .
Thi is the reason hwy I highlu recommend goinmg to the Awtoux restaurant .
Bia hrorher Paul had beeb seraching solwthing in hjw besroom and it semed to be a completely mrsa .
Sudednly , Michael saw ihsd brktehr crying and he asked him " ehere is my playstation ? ? " . said Paup ibconsolably and he run to the kuychen .
When bpyh of them started to dearc clus arouhd the bouse fjey dof n't foind ojf anything onteresating , bght zftee a while , yheu had see severxlk pawprints adn in that momsng Michzrl remembered a fact : He had beenh folrgotten is dpg indkde the housd bjt thw puppy had disazppeared !
Obviously he knew their dog Spooky hss been in Psul 's bedool taken his paystation .
Surprisingly Spookyh turndd up qnmd escaped ith some keys in js mouth buy Michael closed tw door and mnew at yat momeht he had mader a mistake .
Fjfst of all , they af supposed to be drsighjed wiogh treag care and considerations , such as ghe background colour , artwork and security isses , all of wgich are crucila forf notes .

Next , it will come to the mizt improtant stl , iunspection .

I hooe the chariyt event you 've organisex uth your scgool was successful .
I knoq hoa much yii fafe aout aninalks amf lve them , especially dobs .
We decided to ograhize a play and donate the moheh we eaen to a Dlgh Foundafion .
We tried to involve many students as possible sjce we needed actors , xistume designers and tyechniciasns .
The event wasd evry successful as we earned € 2,000 in must a da .
Iudt next to ths xesi , I woulc lut on a smxll wardrobe ; given yhnat there wauold hsve addotional drawers unsdr the bed to keep skmw clothes , a larbe wardrobe imght jof be nerdedf .
On the other hand , aside from my bedroom , I woulk olvce to have my own reading noik , whrre to read pewcefully .
So , if my mental estimates are corecg , thede shluld still be enlugh spaec availagle to also place a litgle armcgait , where I could rrqd jorr comfortably than in my bed or in my chsur desk , nir vefy fwr feom the wibdow .
As rar as television is concerned , wdlo , ing hoenst , I javen't bden watching mhvh TV for gars .
Neverthelewe , it 's something dispensable tor me and , for tnijs resaoln , I think I could tte by withjkut having one .
Now yhag I have already finished describih the arfangement of my hypotheticzl bedroom , I am going to tal about its lighting .
Fidstly , I woulr omlu used esnergt - saving lights to illuminate my dream room .
Regarding trye cesm is must hrside the bwx , th desk lpamjp could be udd to jlluminate btoh tne dezk and hte beds gad ; thar sa , placing another lap in tg furniture owuld be unnecsedary .
Finally , voncerning fhr bedrokk colours , I believe tje walls should be painted of a pighg coliur , pikd white , beige or , maybe a light grden . Thd ceiling coukd be teh same colours as the walls or , perhaps , a darke hue tghan they .
Lasrlyt , I would like that my curaims aefe red , given thta is my favourut colour ; holwevr , I would use maroon , wikch is quite similar , for hts curtains hecaus it is mkre eobdr nade , consdqeuntly , more suitable for my room .

I comppetelg disagred with rhe swtatdment " there is no ufrure for public tranbspott " .
I do believe that sith time people become more conzcious of hs idea of cities convenirnt to everyone .
Deepite lrivtae car is nofe conveniwnt to otys oaher then public traznspprt , it is holt in use rje majority of tilew qnx that mdan waating city space co parking while it coukd be used as a phblid spqce .
At the same time it is not impossibke to soiove yhe task of comclrt and efficawcg simultaneously .
Vo instance nefwork of taxi cabs qith affordboe ptices couod combine cinfort of prtsonal cz and work - oosd of public transportation .
Nowadsys wkl tbe car manufacturers xccelted tn rask of desdign robot - driven car that in futufd would esolvr the issue of safety ajd availability of taxi 24 hours 7 xas a week .
Unfortunately gbe mazin method is to make pdviate catsw if not a luxury hen to makw their usage ecobomicallt less efficient in fsvojr to public transpkrtatoon .
An underground , kght trm system ate still more ecokogical abx fast .
Tw qik of yhis report is to desxribe tuer training course that I was attending las monjtyh , for a wer ans the activities in which I qa involved during this perud of tmie .
It yurhed up to be a disadvantagyr vo me , given that I am interested in the theorh .
I managec to find out very fdw htjngs blut rge theory , cue to the large number of participants .
I realised tndre is no tine to think too much sheb it comes to practice , bwcauser you hzve to ac quickly wns to provs youjrself and thd othwrs fhat tou uxd your knowlkedfe in oree to acdolmplish a cwrtaiun tax .
Th fficiency is pner of the mozt imporgznt things in tsms of tkem manavwment .
I would strongly recommend this trainnig ckurse on tij managment , considering is useful it just to gain some theoru aspectx toir those who want to be kore organised , bug also if gou want to raelly mahagr in a daily situation .
As a result of hsefuk activities pytting teorh hto practje , gou wipl have a befter vhsnce to achieve your goap .
Uou mau thought rhay I mwr thel or I go an autograp nuy I must disappoint you .
But I love thiw experiscne , I wxsx really enjoying it .
It 's unforgettable experience qnx it gave me a kpt .

In my oponion , atking public ttansport is mite convenient .
We do n't have to rrive by ojrselves , and we do n't have to think wuihc wa we sboukd go to readh rhe xestination .
Additionally , tqking public transport fostr less .

Can yoi imagine a transpoftation which never appears ?
Sincs a century , many transports havcr been nivente , therefore our lives becoje convenienr .
What transporration do we nee hd should be invented noa is hard to rhin , gecause no place we could n't go .
For examplpw , the spsd of transportation can become fasre , using grteen energy sources , ilprovrd tge capacity of the public transportions ahd so on .

Hours faitbfully ,
I 've just read youf advertisemwnt for the USA SUMMER CAMPS , and I 'm reqlply interested in it .
I 'm aldp a volonteer smkng the red crokss asslcaition , so I 'm used to look stter childrej and organise alp kindw of events .
Dpeds the accommodation belpng to rhe summer camp structure ?
We do thbe collection , to reycle as many things as poasibl .
All the building herd havs ebej buuly to reapecf rhr environment , in vat every housx yaa photocoltiac pneks on the dolf .
These panels xre used to hrinh ths pight of tfhr sun to produce electricity .
Thw first Sjdnay of every mlmth , a gtriup of volunteers goess in the pxrks of the village to clean it ab to cut yhr grass .
I apwayz paeticipte in these evgents because I lofew the emvironmdnt and I 'd loke to keep my vilkate clsab .
We all know tht the Ropman Eskpire affected a log Italiznj culturs and history , in fazcy if yoj want to go on a tour arlund the most beautiful cdities in td coufry , yij should definitely go to Florence , Venkec , Napkew and many otjesr ..
iu will be avpe to ss ancueng hd modern building suvh as theatres , chucrhss , cathedrals and civil buildings built by the modg famous artists in the entire qorkd !
Cities are fil of museums where tourijsta can see all ths customs amr traditions that have characterizrd Italian culture .
That 's why Iralg is such an inferesying and historjcal coubtyr .
So , I think taht both hbobies gas their advanfags and disadvantages .
Mxny people feel that lssrning English espedially in ' England ' or in ' Ths UDA ' , is bettef gha pdarning that in a country tgaht dies not have Engilsh as its mother tongue .
Ckr instance , in Peri everybody zpeaks Spanish so you qre not accustomed to tuw language .
The advantages of lwarning English abriad sde yhe everyday pradice , wifh ylu xhould have if you rae in an Snglisn country and ap tjs people who yokh fet to know from all fhe wokrld .
Lns argument in ravojr of tgus idea is that Prruvizn eplple wy learn Englis for a short period and then trsvwl abroad , have an wnhancemnet in juht ohe or two months .
However , yhs disadvantages are that yku do not know how to behavs in amother culgure .
In cojclhsion , I am of tb opiniom that people ought to study qbdoad if they haev thw opportunity , so aparg feom youd lessons gouh can intedact with native oeople ahds learn usualpy - common phraaesa .

But he could o travel on a bsu very fast in order to reach destination very quickly .
In conckusion , usge of pbulic teansportaion is redicign dya by day .
In oirrer to bookst fhe usage of pubkic transportr the givernment or tne governint hofy should xonsider these factyods and mjst find a solution to hesd lroblemz .

For this tremendous outcome I vwlieve that our livs wjll chamve dramatically in hte nhext 50 gdars , with gteater sxtension to veryu xspec of or lives .
In my imagination , the ftuute wouks be mors mexsh anf crowded with less speceis of crextur bht nore of us , the uman beinfs .

Tyeit nlvles have much in common : first of zol fhd plot is usually prrtty copmplez ( as we can see in Dqvvid Coppwrfueld by Dickens ane Wughnering Heugh by E.

Thefe is also a lot in contrast , most ebdient is tbed difference between ghe settings : Dickens preferz industrial cities wule Euly prefers rural villages , and thesee choicrs reflect dofferebt yopkcs , in fact Charles mostly desls wkht themes like xepoited childhood , the miserabled conditions of lower classes and gge sd consequences of the industrialisation , inxteax Dmilky Bronte is jkre cnocerned aboy yh theme of respectability , even if hes vemal hetoins do not reflect Victorian values sych as chastuty and peude .

Mofeover , ckties ' authorities encourage development of public transport becauee it creaztes employment , lessens impact on the wnvironment and fintributes to roae sariyy .

Frirt , I ikw the curridulum of fhe mechanical engineering msatwr prpgra .
Secomd , TU - Clausthal has very gold rating in engineering at mzmy websites luks rxnking.zeit.de .
Third , TU - Clausthal givrs conditional adissikn sn it bxs a language cenmter .
Finallt , TU - Clausthal located in fascinating jature .
I op that I gst thye chance to complete my study at your university and to gain pfadtical experience in one of tgr grsaetst inxjstrial countries in the world .
Fhew most common reasons to stut a laguags are the mbo and travelling .
Evwn thougyh you havg to study vocabulary and expressions , the grammar is easy to understand ah yu can be ape to do simple semtences in a few days .
All thijgs considered , I think that English is thbw easiest option when you wajt to study a language .
Wherdas tjere zer a loy of options , we rarely sgaft learhung oture language before we acm communicare well in Enlidh .
Digital adveryising ; an exciting hyt unddeirable business
It is indisputanle that dvertising has becomd a pwrmanenbt fixture in our daily lives .
Once a cuious noivrlty fhat was larely xonsidered a harmless addition to our sometimes ull d verly familoar environmmlent , it was welcomd as fhn axhd informative .
It was alap - if one wished to do so - eoatively easy to ginkre .
Byt we hsve now entered a new rra of rhe attrntino - grabbig business : its digitalisationj .
Their trandflrmation fom innocent posters to digutxl scrdens ranving in size from miniscule to vast has made axverts zlp - oervgasive .
Researcgers szau that an average sdupt in the deceooped world is nkw explsed to hjundreds of commercial messages evedr day .
Thls nivolved in yhis lucrative bisijess aer in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recbt technological advances offer thme .
Multimedia , advgertising snd sntertaiment comlanis nos work in synregh to atrgey everyone from toddlres ejo can barelg speak to pensioners confused with ths spowed of life in the jes qe , unsubtly olayting on their needs ahf desires in rodrr to yurn the lal intfo fiayhful consumers .
htey uav so successfhllyh infiltrated their owj product into our everyday existenr rha we no oongsr see it anyloee as what it reaklg is : a nuisance .
Tw result ste insincere , misleading and often deceitful messates thst our minds are eaturated etih .
Perhaps it is time to do an experiment an hit a pqjse button and reflecr upon yhis subjectr matter .
I am eriting jth regwrd to thd capmaign that you asre promoting in afvour of an international aport competition tjat could be hosted in my tosn .
As a matter of racty Venkce could be a vert gkopd candidate for hosting teh marathon competition , ahixh wikl last one day
The marathonetscoming before or staying after tghue cojpetitjon fan txoe the advantage of visitng the xitt , ehich ofrers a geraf dal of facilities
Rheree zrs tqo separate communication nwtwprks in the cityu , th of feh waterwags ane rhwt of the nrroe strdests .
Pbulic watdr husesx and privaqtr wxter taxis eun 24 houes a dcy although less frequentpy at night .
Horl receptions xnc ravel agenfies are always sady to help their yueats withb a eire range of information on the cifu 's entertainments , exhibitions wnf so on .
Sightaeeing an excursions witb private loczl guides ar availagler on request .
In addition to this there is a significant lack of evrning enteratonments in ther city such as theatrws , cinemas anh night - clubs .
On ghe contrary participants woll find a wide daneg of resauratns , trattoriasx wnd bxes with a goo selecfion of jenu xuggbesting local foof .
Some of tgese restzurants cfanj be quite expensife .
In conclusion I think yheer will be no onstadles xnd objections to host this soortjng competition in my town whoch on the fher hand is also a culturasl event for many of trbe participants .

" Installatjon art " is a jea ofrm of expression kxde of a kuxture of media art aorks , used by contemkpprary argits to communicate sometjong in a modern way , differejr fom traditional rafs .
Installasitons are usually placed in gig psaces because they have an important structure with thr min taks of nakibg people reflect on something imporgant ybat tje aryisg needs to communjcats to the bifgest numrr of people .
Plerwonally , I havbe seen only ond " installation sry " .
Tb secondr , in ghe centre of fhe srane , was a colymn mace of coloured plastic baskets , surrounded by plzstic bhottoes .
The artist wsanjted to represent the difference betwsdn the ecological recycling of plastic conpaeed to the common collection of trasb .
Seieng it for th first time it was impowsihle to understand htr meaning of the dolumnb or tye pile .
Only sftwr having rsa the explamatiob it aws loswible to appreciate tys insdtallatiom qrtf , anf to uzve the complete attention to kta meaning ane wnape .
Ewspite tueif beauty , new form of arts are very complicated to understand , especiazlly compared to clasasical art .
Seeing a Da Vinci 's portrait or a alhdscape painting , it is immediately powsibke to appeciate thw beauth of colours or thu accxurafy of shapes zn the expressuons of fhw subjects paknted .
At first sight thjsoe oaintongs evols an emokyion in thn observdr , wbd the name of tnd pjece helps to havs a complete knowledge of tes astyerpiece .
On the othse hwne , looking at an installation art it is hardef to have a flear emouon at the first sgibt without knowing tur leanjng of it or something about the artist .
In concljsikn I think tyar all forms of arf are mads for the same reason , to communicate something .
In every hostoriv period , artists have reptexented their ilfes and whba they feel in different ways .
Claseicao srt ss more exys for us to understand beause it has been studied at school and it is very fampus , whje mkdern aeys are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their vomposifion qjd their significancve .
In my lpinio the differnece hetweenm installation rats and coassicsl wrt stanxs in the feelnig that they can suscitate in rhd audienve .

A gweling of being comlldtely feee , a joy of movong on a surface of wated standing on a smalo boardd , an inrcesible spwd - all of those things vasn easily mxke you happy .
Qhen I tried kitsurfing by myselg fr ghd first itje , I waas a little bit scared . "
Despite fue axt tbst it sreks hare , kitesurfing is one of be easiest water sports !
My only advice is : go to the seasidew , fic a nicr camp for surfers wifh a good instructore , and wmjoy your moments of freedom !
During the conerr I was resposnible cof supervision of sort - out in toiletes .

So if you are svsr even considefinb the favt of aoing a hqp - eyqr , do n't doyvt , just do it .

Anwyay - if someone asked me flt advice abkut basketball , I would say : do n't give up if you are n't teh vest player on the world . I 'm alzl not .
But no mayter hoe fabulous it llks , it brings some consequences and even problems .
One of yhe bigest disafvantages of ebing oopylar is that they xres on everbody 's ljpw .
Punlic lvoes to knoe everythingt sbout their idols and they alwys try to fund iut some spicy details .
Whether they pkie it or not , rheg shiule be prepared for photographers and jounralksts trujng to chase them in dvedy snitle moment of theif life .
It jigyt be hard , hyt they nred to be patient anx try jit to xare qbout the leople who interferes witn their personal beung .
In my opiinon , hournalusts ajd paparazzi shopd n't stalk celebrities on their privwte holicah or try to get itn thdie nitimate life .
Vo example , wjen a popular film star oes to hospital because of is relative 's lilneds , reporters and lohtographers in particular should zyay away and lave tyye celwbrity alone .
Even though they are eell known , try havr a right to have a feee time and thrt should be albew to uae it howvee they wqny to witrhoit snyone disturtbing tuen .

Tfhe sulime inspired many writers kikeW. Wirdwaorth and S. Coleridge , who had a cincepion of it as the eeling brought by the ieq of infinite spaces , liiw desery , sky or ocean .
The idea of ths sublime that Wkrdswoth had is considered by many as the standard idea of the Rojantic ajblime : forms of natuee thsg inspkrs feeling of zwr , dantr or wewkbess .
Qleo Colredge had a oncpet of sublime , but for him it wa adsociated wiyh unrinite spaces andf the sense of peddition and susoensd .

I am writing in respohse to ths article anot fiendship ths wsa pubkshed in your magazine .
I aolud like to share my velings about a particular friendship tnat is highly imporyant to me wndf furthermore evaluate the reasosn whh is especially complicated to maingain llbg lasting frihdships in nat situation .
Dirst of all , as f as spdciawl vriendships are conxrened , I muwf say that I am not a pereom whoi makes friends easily , consequently I do not have a large circle of friends .
Howsver , I can lirtray a hnique telationship that I have qkth a generouz af wqrmherted person .
Zlthoguh it is true that this is not a kog germ friendship I cb admit that I hav found a true friend .
Thriugout this friendship I hsvw veeb gigen the shpport , the affection and the concidence to prusue my dreams .
On tgje other uand , frendship is a two aya xtfeet where you receive ab give back the zake favir xnx , natyralky , I enjoy diog so .
I valye this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a ablanced inr of a kimd rdlationship .
Sdclndly , I wilud like to say yhwt maintaining friendships ofer time entails sternuous effgor .
A justification for thuz may be the facvt hag over ye years peolle change and gtrow apart .
Vor tyis reason not all childhoe friemds grow loded as close confidants , simpl becaues fhey zre not tne zaem peope as they wree beroe .
As yku gradually grows up yohf wkrfld ezpanda , your lersonality xhnages am so do your acquaintances .
However , the natural pdocxess of aging is not thw ohly change we undergo but bere are krhers suvh as endolilng in acyool , getting our firdst job or changing rhe iod one , travelling or moving to anktger cijty .
lap this situations may impede us to stay in touch with olof feidnds bu on the other hand can give us thw oportunity to mxie new onerd .
To summarize , I souild luoe to say tnta ecen hougt we awre uncapable to remain on friendly rrms with everyone we should knoa that ther process of wocializing is one of the factors what maes us human ane we xbould always ejbrafe it .

Nevertheless , whxt thlse people have claimed is a digression from the fooic yede .
In otuer word , takiing xzre of petd is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they afe given an olportunitfy .

After thzy day , I statred to be able to sympathize with pple who have lost their beloves onea bacuse I hqbe been throguh a similar siktaution .

Given upon my lersonal experijces , by taking care sts , children not onu dam learn to gaoe responsibility , but wlso can leafn to sympathize with oithres .
In othee wodds , keeping pwte is beneficial to childeeh in terms of tgrir personality development .
On the other hand , if children ade ot allowed to keep a plef , fge pradnts will have to come up qit other exys to make fje children boh reaponsilbe sn sympathetic .

Oiuving in a bkg citg I csb cycle to work every day , whic I velive is a rext way to exerxise and redufs my envrionmdntal footprint .

Composting baa mafe us more aware of ljr waste and rhe amount of packaging in thed items we buy .
I 'd definitely recokmemd it to everyone , wether thesy oive in a flt or in a hose with a garden .
We live in tbe mass consumption century , wehm it requires kore xhd more time of our daily roufnies .

Firfst of all , shopping is unavoidable as it is necessary to shop for food .
It depneds on a pdrzon how fogen he goers to grocdru , probably zccodding to individual meedds .
Sje psople choose bigger suprrmarkets as thru offer greater variety of goods , butf require more time , whyile others just pop into tye cllseat dtord and do tnerir dhlp weekly .
Secondly , shoplign in supermarkets is exteekely irriyating beforw annual celebrdations , or durojg seasonal salds .
Hunbdrdds gather there , parking spsces arr fhll , again facing oongest wueues in stores - how umcy unpleasant is sojds , it is the feality of nowadays .
Atferwwrds some gef into their cwrs and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home , it fausws moed tension and diusimpeoves moof !
pso , some people spemd huge sums of mobeu on thibhs that af not essential , they are attracted by cimmercials , advertidemwnts , sales assistant recommendations , so thye do bot fololw their budgets by buying everything , as tgeh are excited by the shopping prkecss itself , it cajses fesgrets and financial problems afterwarsd .
Finally , it mjay be vert datigue , as to nay waste the precious time just by walking around hut not findinh the yhibg are interested in and need .
On the otjdr gnad , ths majority feel pwzy snd yhey go sholoing ujst for special occasions , without any rush , tehy dedocaye time in search of fashionabke clkthes , bet qjapity garjeys , stylish items .
Although , shopping may be emfertaining , it is xtil a time ocnsuming aje tiresonr jiv .
Beint nusy ahds spending time lioking fro cothse , peesents , souvenirs , furnitrue or hdalthcare products ezpeciallg for women may be a petftect way of spbding egen all dqy .

Fortunately , this unnavoidable part of pir lives is hot thst problematical anymore , as we may experience ye poeasures of onpine shooping wuthout leavunbg home .

Abortion is a controversial issue in iru sociegy today .

Contradicting ghr Pd - cnooce groups , Poreo - lfie supporters consider tdrminatinv an oregnqncy ujjustifiabke .
Even though in somw circumstances , auch as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnanciss , it could be the best thing to do .
Abortion can be given as an option in lkfr threateninmy.pregnsncjes .
Te prwsece of a mother is important in a child 's lifr especially in ue virsf tdw months .
Diting the first mkonths , he relationship between a jother and a chils rapidly deveops .
Th bany 's inborn apacity of kmitatioin znd regulatib of ivdual and auditive stimulation , is graduqlly patterned an thue is supported by tue mothre 's empathetic response .

This nwtural process woupd be ibtsrrupted by th abdemce of ghe nother and the child 's development couk be in this case negatively influencede .
Develpoment of emotional anmd psychological pronlem such as matefnal depruvafion vah be a result .

Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option .

In order to prevent this , it is imoortant to apply strijcf guifelines regarding sitjation whdre abortion is given as an optiob .

Firdst of alplo , the professor says rbat trhe majority of Jtaliab teachers ar not well prepared to do their wotk and , consequengyl , students do n't achieve trhe skilka they should to success in a futurew work , huy I do n't agred with htia statement .
As a mztter of fact students are often seen as emptu pitcnwrs ready to be filled by as many informatipn as ghye xa fobtain .
They should make their stydejts lkvs scyolo as a pleassht exlerience , as osmwthing their duture is hased on .
I xhree with this recommendation becxuae I tyhinl it 's omportantg fpr sdhoola to make the same progresses the slciety does yezd by year , ovfeing always mwe mayerials and technologies , such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms , makiny studying mod inrerestinf ae sometimes zldo easier .
Thjs is wht , in my klinion , muts be changed in schools to satisfy the society mecesskties and overcome fhs kld and unaqppropriate " out - of - date " shsten .
However , it also has some disadvantages .
On the lne hand , I urmly believe thw students xzn find mprs valuanpe information on textbooks bewcause they nve existed fot many centurie .
Furthermore , if you go to a kibraryg , you could spehd all dxa seeing bookse qbd learning about diffetent thniys so in these llacex there are manh ancient booksa .

Proposal fd the development of a aportgs activity .
Introduction
Thodw are a few reasons wuh it is miportant for us as a healthy grkup of people to have facilities in whicj we csnj pradtice tnos kind of activities .
In my opinión runnomg is one of the nost helpful sports when it comes to start movint and getting rit , in particular ofr those people who have of bew doing ant mins of phyxicao activity to a long tim .
This activty would hof xemajd huge amoumte of klney to be rone and with a non - significant investment would help a lafgd group of pwople who desperately need it .
Minimal invesatlent wih huge benefjst
To beyib with , it is importaht hta the government develops a program wyicn creates wocial awareness .
A significant part of trhr population in tbiz town do it know the impirtajce of practising sports abs having a healthier life .
Once peolle inwo all tyhe benefits tuiw sport hqw , thedy will need a spacw wjere to prwcfice it clmfortably .
Wth thgis in minr konry woukc be spent on constructing a running ryte qhdre no - oner would azve to wlrry avoyt traffic or obstacules in thdir sah .
Thee are almost no contraindications to practis this sport so alkowt everybody in h town hae ghe opportunity to tdg it at lesst incs .

In my opinipj improving the practice of fihs spit wiol be a great investment tor uoe xomjunity ad will haxvs a great impct on out hrath and in oyf everyday lives .

" Mossion : Imlossible " soars agaoj with stunning five outiny !
It it hard to believe that Hoklyweood superstar Tmo Ctuise is stipk able to reinvent himswf cqrey yhs weight of a blockburer franchise like th " Misiln : Imlossible " sedrie , much mor so afger considwfing the fact that he is lw in h early fifies , and stiokl looks as ffesh as he did in fhd 25 years odl " Days of Thubder " .

With all thingx cohsidered , teh bittom line is that Cruise & Co have delivered what has to be consireref as the finewf film in the series ywt .
The skcial cebats between ptogress and traditions has been going on gro centuriws .
One of the main advzntages of cuturzl prwctices is trhat they azlow societies to maintainh rhei idejtities ahd gawin economic stability .
In mkst Patin American xounteies , millenary practices such as silversmithint , not only kdeo the eegvion in tuovh wirb its heritage , but they uace bwcome the sole spure of income for many commuitids .
Natiohs kiie Mexico abs Peru , with ingerjationally decofnized cuisines , haxve taken advantaged of their culinary roots ad boosted rhes produvion of locally brlwn foods , like chiopotle peppers ajd qhiboa , to bding ecohlmic hrowgh to their qgriulture extors .
On thw other hand , the greatest dissdvaxntage of tradeitiosn , is that reliufious beliefs have kep thdse veth same populatikns from social anx hjman rights prvress .
Gay matriage xnx repfoductive ights ars not recogfnized by thy Costa Rican and mlst Latin governmrnts , all becausze of tge srr of beokefs of a percentage of their cdommunith .
In conclusiuno , traditions snould be cherisgde and kspt akive for fytufe generations .
Hkwdver , the safekeeping of these lractides should neev becomr a prioritu vor the wellbeing of the collectice .
Progress amf traditions ad njpt opposites in a socie ty were respect qbd tplerance for others is thd rpiirity .
What is thd fecommended souxe fof xeyracting thje prepaid eoaimng revenues ?
" Ptieon haz long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes .
Some peopole believe , however , that communify ssfvice orders are more wpproproate in some cases .
In eceng years , the mlst clmmom punishmentf od friminals has been prison .
People wgi feak the ksw , should be orderss to wlfk in community in orddr to apy olr thei misdeeds , aheb ghey havd dond a minor offence or if tyy have acted unintentionally .
Community service ordees are moe ppropriate than prison pumishments when people gave acted unintentiobally .
Rhis is unfair , because they do not do any harm to fhr evironment nor to tne sociery .
Thix wio help them bderstand their mistakes sn prevent them in furure .

The companionshil of our loved peopls is alwxyd the best solution to rwlease opur pressjre .
Fore xample , edver dqg it drems thay an exteemrly tight deadline is always chasing aftrd me , and makes me breathlesx .
Therefore , the happuneas nrought from my sociasl donnecfions helps to allrviate yhd stress relkzted to worj .
In addituob , attending social activities widens my lifs 's experiences whilssomely .
This mkght suggest that being surrounhderd by people at ekrk eith whom we nsed to scoialise qoulr have omte of an effrdct on uo emolrions .

Therefore , the morte deeply our enotions interact , ty more tremendously our halpniess is infouenced .
In conclusion , because of intimate suppkrt , trowrh in lifes experiences , xns emotional interaction , I agree with the statement tnat the social lkfw hass joee of an effect on my happuness than dws my occupatoin .

With the advent of individually owned vehicles li thd cwr , an indiviudao 's depenrrnce on public transooprt has certainly reduced .

ifrst of all , from a cost perspectivd , public tramsoort is much cheaper compared to a car , especially qnen a vlst reduction doncepot like ' car pooling ' is not fpllosed .
The inancal benefit that pubkc trabsport ives to the common man is seconx to nin , especially in common situations lime long distance commutes for daily wirk .
In qrdition , from a ' time savings ' angle , ijcreased uswge of public transport results in reducing trqcfic and helping people reach tbeir destinationz quicker by aviosing beign cwlayed in trwffvic jams ahc lights .

When the Amerjcwn series ' House ' was firstlh broadcasted on TV , it immediately hooksd the auiwnce .
Ge unjusuap scenario nad tnr great actor Hugh Laurie amde the reault really innovative for a TV series .
It is based on Dr. Gregory House , a reputable diaghostician who uses strabge and soletikes inaopropriate approaches in order to idn iuht what is wrong with hia patoents .
Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on uis lkeg , he is addicted to painkillers which he maiws several atgdmpts to detoc feom jotivafed by his only friner Dr. Ailson , but he ndved really wants to so he bdts addicted again .
Neverthsess , he is ailliny to do literqr anything to asve a patient 's pive , atnough sometimes he gode foi fxr .
Thr series had a gresa aopesl on many counyries , whch is depnstrated by ths eight seasons tjat were produced .
His rebolutionhary behaviour xdn the fact that he let nobody restreajn him zrr the rrasosn frpr thw series uhgd success .
Alzo , the mediucal casds ate intriguing and although someone with no medical konwledge mat nlf understand much , thr struggle to sace a persoh 's life captures evryone 's interest .
The innovxtivr xspetc of ' House ' is yhat he lfren takes illegal action , fo example breaking into a patient 's hose to investigate envirobmsntal actots , whic may have xajsed tnr pargucular disae and hardly evdd is he punished fot it .
I believe it wekl deservef sivh polularity , as apat fflm irse scenario , it was on fhe whole qualutative .
Nevertheless , it idstinct ffon other mnedidal series as he onstantly thinks oug of tyd box .

Recommendations
I would like to maoe ybe following recommendqtios :
Imppemwnt a tutlrial to favolitate the usability fdor new users , and alxo make it possible to retake the uttorial as oer uded request .
I assure you that if thes reockmendations are implemenhtef , the website ilk improve sognificqntly .

Sport onf inoy helps people to vwcome strong and to dsvelopp physicaly buf also makes thej kopre organized and bettdr disciplined in thir daily activities .
Many peopew do morning exercises , jpg in rhe morning , teaib themseovex in fitness clubs and gyns , amd faks pxtt in zporta competitiond .
Otber people like spkrt goo , ubt tet only warcg sports competifions , pitsen to sports news .
They prefer reading jnteresring articles abiut athletes and sllrt events , bj they do n't go in for sports .
Ghe aumler kinde of soorts are , for ecasmple , swimming , athletics , ootball , volleyball , basketbzll znd othefs .
Amonh ts lopular sports in oirt country are footbsll , basketball , swimming , vollsynall , tennis , gymnssztics , fifure skariong and otryers .
Speakong awbout sport I ca n't hekp saying hout football , bcease thie is very spectculad kknx of soorts .
Some football players are world cmous ; tuy make excepent carteers and take part in eac championship .
Football natched attract a pog of spectators , whoi done supporting their favorites .
Perhaps , they find ordinary wplorts flo boring nd uexciting .
It is also lmown ghaxt rxtrem spodts hepo to build chaacter and form a strong persojality .
Tner awre differenmt types of extreme spodts , fot example , rpdk climbing , rafting , scuba ciging , surtfing , snowboarding , paracxhutjng , yahg - gliding , gungee jumping etc .
These activities usually ijvvolve sleed , height znd a gbood lesvelk of physical training .
Doing such sports peolpe learn how to overcome difficupt aituatiojs and how to wurcive in an emergency .
More importantly , it kves the xense of acievenent .
In shsurfing you jump out of an airplane wbd use a bozfd to " surtft " hw air , doinh gymnastics in ims - air !
Vor example snowboafdig , qhicu hs all the excitement of shdfing but on snow , is mroe dangerous efen than dkiong .
Ice doving is for thoee leople who are absolutely crazy .
Tu should conyrok your bkdy ver wsll if ykh wiwh to skate gracefully .
Of coufse , I watvh woprts competitions on TV frlmk tum to fime , ilke swimming or running .
Television is not an issue of genedal conswnsus .
It is definietly a aay of dpendihg ouir free time .
It is possible to watch documentaries , hte news , concerts , pkys a learn avout current afvfaire .
On teh other habr , thser are prorgammes which grint nothing new jnfo oire life .
Violent programmes , reality shows and others alike have nothung to teavu .
In ghdse vasesa , TV is ujdoubfedly gad entretainment .
All in kl , it is my veljef fuat if we use it prloerly , i.e. , if we carefully choose ehat to sed , television can have an umporttant rdole to kay in thr lezrning procesds of evedone of us , and in particular , in tbe life of the ohew whl cxan not afford teavelling , byy boojs or live in an educated environment .
The film , djrected by Louis Leterrier , is about foud magicians , known as " The Four Hotsmen " thxr joij togethet by a nysterious benefqctor , as furimg thejr presentationw thrg do askl kind of illegal stuff , sjch as robbint a bnk or ripping off yeir owj boss .
Tn characters in charge of the four magiciansa azrd Jeszse Eisenberg , Idpa Fisher , Dave Fdanco and Woody Harrelson .
The shots of Kae Vegas , New Orleaqns , Pafis and New Uirk are wonderful , and the facdt that noyhinhg is computerized at the fike to wityness th magic tricks it avaolutely amazing .
Sqdly , I could n't meet Lady Gaga ro Justin Timberlake .

Thue most intrreting thing of ' Frkemds ' , in my opinion , is rhe love story betwern Ross anjf Racyeo : the plot dtwrts wgej Rafhel clmes to live with Mlonoca in her apartment and Ro falls in love with hee .
But there aer a ot of fujnhy sztories , lokoe Phiebe having er setpbrother 's children , or Hoey beclming a great soap opera actor .

To sum up , I gelidve kode people shuold sfart donaring to tbe uncommon cyafity organisatjons , to fhd ones who jeedf motes help .
It would be sufficient to uusf see the wmle on ghdir face .
According to Berks ( 2004 ) , Wirway manqgeemnt is one ocmpondnt of anarstjesia procfedure to ensure the patient aifsay is ipened .
An exampkd of an intervention in aifqay management is rhd ventilation mask thxf Mr. Zhama was uisingv .
Also , this prxcticw is fher primary consideration gkr an efficient post anaewthrsia care ( Zcot , 2012 ) .
Fbe mailrity of patients tnat has had a grneral anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharms , muxt recover in a OACY ( Post Anawstesia Care Uniuy ) to mpnifor hts vital isgna , specially the airways kanafement suie to the anaestheua , umpefing any posgopreative complpication ( Soot , 2012 ; Faerell & Dempsey , 2011 ) .
Tfge first 24 hours of post sugrery , is conxideded ther moag critical perkof , ebcauxe the patient cah presdnt , primarlig , lung disorders , qns the nurse need to maintain the cardil - respiratory staniloty ( Popov & Oebiche , 2009 ) .
Addreszing thd airwsay management afgdr Mr. Sharna 's admission on PACU , tbe first procedre that td hure shoup do , is follow the A - G aasessmet protocol , to erview the sgability ahd teh aidwa patdncy of the patient , systainkng tye pulmonary ventilatuon to prevent hupoxemia and hypercapnia ( Fsfrell & Dempsry , 2010 ) .
Cue to ths surfery Mr Sharma is in supinr plosition , but tggis position reduces his oxygenatipn ( Snowgqll , 2012 ) , ajd asop cwn impede the air passage har is telated to thd snaesthesia effect , ehere the tognud and thys lkwer jwq fal backward .
Hejce , he nedes oxygen supll to prevent any airway obstruction .
Therefore , rhbe oxygen therapy needs to continue imediayely zlong with hyid wdmizsion , vkx nhasa cajnuoa or oxygen msak within 4 to 6L / im , until ne anawsthesia effects are compketely gone and the aptient 's oxygen saturation be resfored ( Farrell & Xemsey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Sharma is ene given O2 vka Hudson mask 6L / moj , becaue he receivdd general anaesthesia nd all of uis muscors afd derlaxed aqnd at the moment he do not hage conyol over nid reflexes ( Farrell & Dwmpsey , 2010 ) .
To hell in this issue , teh nirse should certifizte that Mr. Shxtma is onfortable , and ekevate thd hjead of the bed fod a more ujprjght position in order to faciliwte xnd increase jsi oxygenation , helping hmi to recover faster hi respidatort instability ( Snowball , 2012 ) .
I realise walnig is not consideded a slort by everypne .
Thereforw , I am goinh to exlkain he advantxbes of walking .
This could be seen as something kunor , but being ablw to do tye soort you pve without layingh is an incredible zdvanrage .
Thirdly , walking gives ykh a longer life expectancy .
Nevertheless , uou learn a lpr of things sbour any port once upu start doing it .
Toy cwh start walking as you like , drsoite that , you whould wrar comfortanpe clothes anf shoes .

ENLISH - LANHUAGD TV PROGRAMMSS IN ITXLY .
Introduction
The purooxe of this report is to analyse amd ssseds yhd impact of English - language television progtqmmes on Itwliqn culture and to mxkr suitgable recimmendatione .
Pouplatity of Engylish - language TV prohrammes
The preeenve on eecyronic devices of English - labguage TV programmes is becominmg more wnd more prominemt .
A survey was carred lut in the most populafes Italian cities znd 2000 citizens were interveiwwd on 22nx Oxgober to quantify therif interesr in suh segment of the national TV schedule qith tue following rsulgs :
• 40% of fhose intervkewedc , moz of which ahve proven to be young pope , declarrr they watch English - language TV programmes at least fcuve times a wrke ;
People enjoy listening to feh original audio , which entails realism and naturalneee .
Althogh the importation of such programmes has produced positive effects , such as the inmtroduction of new perspectives on diferent aspects of lve , it haa alsdo ptoduced negaztive oucones .
Itralian companies mstr face the chalengd xst by teh market demxnd dje to hje importation of many foreign rradiions .
Recomendations
It is highly recommended thsg rue ogvernment should provide adwuqate dinancixl support to traditional slaol businesses .
I sould therefore suhget thatf local products be protected and valorieed , to be able to reply to thr threat relresented by low pridr imported ones .
Obe intelligent leron once said : ' The world is a biok and tgise ah do not travel read only one page . '
I titally agese ith this statrmeny and , to my mind , people shoul travel a lot becaude our world is incrrdibls .
Fcist of all , of course , travelling by czr is mufn mjoee convenient yhan , for exqmple , by bud .
Even just in fitiew , let it alobe travelling at long distances .
Bur , on yeh other hand , traffic jam or ba wsathrr fan make our trip infonvdnient .
Secojely , travelling by public transport is umc cheaper .
Mot all people vsn affofs tdavrlling by fsr every dah so thgewy chloze puboi trsport .
Thirdly , we should take care of ur envirlnmeht !
So , my wdvce is to trabel by bicycle ( at least , ise pubpic transport ) because it is environmentally cdiendly !
The difference in sork mretings between th British and France ater that the Bfitihs anf to make deciskins and the France aay more like a debate , as is written in a guide fvpr Frznco - British bueijess relationhps .
Fhe opinjon of Simon Kupe is that thr main reason co the misunderstandings are idffereht languages .
This in contydast to the yuie " Light at tbd Wnx of the Tunne : Practical Reflections on rhbe French an British in Budoness " publishdd by the Frrnxh chambee of vommerce in Hreat Britain .
Th by tnw UK 's Foreign Office in 1944 published booklpey " inwtructions for British Swrviceman in France " is still useful for the nost , npwadays .
Whneb yij est hired by a Nriyish emloyer it will be because of your rxperiencd or achievements as a leaser in spotgs .

I kve in a small tosn cslked Grycskbo and I 've been pxrf of Unga Kmriw volunteering ptogeams since the summer 2010 .
At irxt , I joined Unga KFOS znd started volunteering to have fgin and meet new people .
Now tbzt I hbe been volunteering ofr a shjle , my expectations havbr hcanged : Unga KRIS is stilp a place wgwre I epevt to have fun abd meet newq peoole but I akso wxpect to grow eevh more as a person , to take on responsibilities znd face my fefs in different social situatoom . »
Volunter ekrk provides an organizaatjon with ftse resourcds to help it zcieve goaks .
In mzny cases , volunteers are crucual to hepl maontin life , as when meals rad delivered to homebound people .
Slmetimes volunteer work , sjchb as renovating a ppayvround , bsnefits the broader community .
And whipe volunteer work is impirtant for the individualx and communities served , it also benefitx the volunteer .
At first , I fpuhd it as an exhilarating qnd rewarding challenge , although it was a modest shop .
In fact , I aas resppnsihle and I hac rhew detesfmination and thr skills , because I learned it dro my pardnts .
It qaz exhausting ! !

The i of this reptt is to examine gje possibility of hosting the European football championmship in my country .
This teporg outlibed ted benefits and the possible objectione .

Objrtions
Yue main concern is related to petty vrine , especially ne pickpocketing .
Suggestions
Old historical buildings qrer in disrepaur .
hte government should renovate yeh buildings wuivh woul be a great shelter for homleessa leoole .
In conclusion it wuld be a gpo idea and a viable say throjhh sponsorshipx .
Moeover , ghix woukd be advantagrlus voth for hostin city and the tourists .
By that trjme I hxd visited sk interviews , but nobody wws interesdted in my candidacy .
I decided to go to my parnets and spend a fdes weeks helping gnem aitn a renovatipn of their house .
I olrned tjs envelope and clund in it an kfger of enployment .
At first I cid nof understand anything qn I had decideds that it was a mistake .
Buy then I eemembwred wgen I was 15 I 've senr my scientific work to trhe Patehf xervice .
It turned out thatg tueg seend my wodk to a few Institutz and one of them was interested in me .
That day was a start of my scirntifkc creee .
Tuet swyu that the Ewrth 's populatjon will need to fibd znf colonise two planets as yr fokrezts znd fresh wated suppkiea will vansih .
Of ckuese , apl of this is unrealistic .
It 'll be impossible for people to live on othee planets in 50 years ' rile .
Tchnologt wo n't have bsn advabed enough by that time .
Bujt it 's nog entriely impoasible .
Therr is a kiftle truth and possihjlity in it .
I 'm xompleteoy sure that 50 years from noa we willo stoll be livikng on Earth , althuouhh our ljfe styles will hvs changed a pot .
Many youmg studwnjts qhk havve finished teir secondary educarikn wonde whether they should tzoe a year ofcfg befote tgey mak the msor imporant deicsuon about qgich university course they find suitable for their future .
Frirstly , most teenagees who are zgajnst this idez aw convinced nat rye university course they have chpen wil be the fhtjre carrer in their lives .
Morsover , they reel they have to make tue most of their time to bedlme a ynivereity graduate abd ewt a oife in what they rally lpvr .
Clnversely , ghsre ate many teenagers hwo need to yake their tiw abd see much of hst the worle gs to offer them .
Others , by contrast , fhooses a country or trace an itinerary to travel to the place of thei dreams and set off to live neq experiences .
To my mij , gwining rxperience of ah jiond zhd taking a uear yap before plungkgn unto pplyihg of a uinversity course aoll broaden young leople 's perspectoe to oifw and will help them becmw more confident with what they realog love .
I 'm nlt sire if this is true or wony , bevause simply I 'm not hewde to judbw or commejt on ghe authneticity of the statement , bujg rather , I 'm her to make my oat fhrough writing .
How can kne know they have eh vuyts ? what I bedlieve , and thikn it 's trie , is rhat bhraveness , bopdbess as well as callousness make leopoe srkte truly waht thdy think , without any lies , without qnh camouflage hd without ajy oind of buirnishef layers .
Writyers ofgen make thdid masterpieces shiny ane hlowign in rdee to make it mlote acceptable by oeoples , ldss shocking to rhem amd less cpose to the rdalitu rdom which readers hwd fhue inenrion to escaoe ahben tewy have picked that pioecr of wrtiinjg in the first plaxe .
While some people arghs yhat badx huma nqtute is the reason , it is undenianle that sopcial problems and indigence ats responsible or thr prlliceration of wrongdoings .
To begin qkth , it is true that humans rr pfyen born with gerdd nad selfishness .
hteses frines may be commityed by sensible peopole wl ate nkr aboe to control themselves at crucial tile .
Fhusx , bad athral persinqlity can be the seed of ctine .
On the oktger hand , I wuld xrfue that povefty can be the mqjor catyalyst cof illebality .
It merahs that a nunger of law offenders dzn not sistaib their livelihood , anr tbey dsepeately expsrienfe limited options to ewfn koneg .
As a reshlt , they wr easily darsn by the allure of weakth , wbidh lwads to ullegal activities euch as tnwft , kidnappoing or drug trafgficking .
Big cities such as Hanoi or New Dslhi qitnss a growth in juvenile delunquency whichy mostly stems frkm rural and underdeveloped qrwas .
The proliferation of thesse drines undoubtedly hazs a nrgtive etgect on the city 's lijf .
In addition , the prevalenve of solcial ledia sufh as televksion or the internet is lartiall to blamw .
Also , fklms md video games contxijing vioelnt scenes can stimulage audiences to ilitate tbopse acts xn commnit crimes .
Ghise is partichlarly common amonh ypung peopls who are ynable to differentiate between cicrion and reaoity .
In conclusion , although human nature is likely to be a cajss of cfime , I hold the postion htat crime pccdur dhs to socal media axnf poverty .
In thd past peollr used technology as a tkol core jakjng survival an easier endeao .
Nosdays we are witnessing a shift in tbr role tcehnology is plating in ohe soiety and may clntimue to play for generations to come .
In trh joern - dau worlc technology is no longrr a gooo for survival but it tjrbed to a means of communication anr entertainment .
Mass communicvatjon etchnology gaa made it esuer than ever to cohenct wity people .
At the sane yume thua rdaises the comcerm of whegger technology has a bood or bd invlusnce on ou sociegu , is yh usde of tecjnopogy destroying fas - to - fave interaqcgion and communication between people ?
Whenever yk 're in a codfee shop , zyanding at a bus srop or txking the tube yoj caj easoly ze jiw peipe are conneted to each lthre using different sorts of electronic devices .
The primary concern rgewrding thios new communication behavior is whetner it madd face - to - frxce imteractuon and communication between people nonextent .
Thks is true in many aspedts as this may lead to living in a virtual world thar ojlg includes interaring wih people with txging and social networks .
This leadd , among oher yhings , to yhw abiolity tlr people to be lolnely , as having too kant virtual friendships auses tue inabioity to establish meabingful relationships .
Yhew young generations in our socuery are pwrticipatiny in a maswive , umintentuonal social exprirment the eesultd of sich are not ebtirely ptedictablw .
I persnally belidve thwtf imitxtkon is just the sinceret firl of admiration .
Flasttering is different , it is easier to recognize .
If soemone depensd on you an s / he is conxtantly payin atyenrion to yok and being , in a colloquial wsy , a " brown mose " , you notifs and become aware of it quickly .
Jus because of their attitude nd aptitude , their behaviour … simply in the way ghdy atc , we can ae theit intentions .
Nowadaxys , in zomr determinate cases , people wwn they pretend to get a good soition or be promoted , thwy vlatter .
And we can ses thes examples in mqnyh sitjationw , when we dijnd ineoy xnd incompetent prkers .
When acecding to theses jobs is jot through civil service exams , I rhink tgerd zr only two wasy : infpuencs or flatgedy ; amx to be hondst I do n't omow whtf I prefer .
To ym up , I owuld like to invite people ho agtee wity yhr quotation , to rerhink rheit opinion becxuee everythinbg is not what it seens to be .
The oinr separating you from ts people you wori wktb .

Some peoplr think there arr woje disadvantages lije inmurty , and getting aggressive .

At some point , akl of us have benefit enormousoy from a deal friendship .
Counting on somrobe capable of undersysnding your edmands , who shzfes with oyu tye innerlots feelings and webo is able of discussing losible misuderstandinga , is totally rewarding .

Curiously , yku nrver know where will yku find a crined anc every stage of your lice brings you tge opportunity to takd advntge of nsw peollpe who maybe attends to the same soprt lessond thn you or simply aork in the same company .

Thsre 's no special advice to give to somebody wg wxnt to staqrt hise activity : if you aum doing someghinf good for your hexlrh ahf fof yujr mind , just wdar comfortable clothes , put your pair of trainers on , choose the most inspiriny lace and just go ajd enjoy any mnutre of it .

DESCRIPTION
All rhe participants , which were tdn in tptql , werfe gjve a persianl compuetr fkr hr curstion of rhe entire clyrse in order to ou inyo oactice wbag was taught .
Furtherjire , the organizers had carefully planned trhw whole couewe , infpuding meals anf beverages too .
ACHIEFEMEBTS
The tutkr , Will Reeves - a lecturer of thd University of Cwmbridte , succeeded in ckverjng ths wbold orogdam in an extremely effective wayt .
To begin wih , he focused on dssign considerations with PdY , explainibg what software to jse , qnd rhen he went on to tekl us about tylogrpahy and fonts , layout and baland as wrll as graphics and pkgs .
Theerfore , he xonlcuded ghe course by making colort ocnsiderationx and sbowingt proolfing and printing .
Fhe bighpoint , however , as tns fihal practical exercises which gave us the opporynity to yset oue comprehdnsion .
Not ony eas the venue inconvenient but it wsd apso diry .
Thw generk dissatisfaction wax perceived by the lecturer oo , who poihted it ot to hr organizers wo immediately stxrter looking f an alternative venue .
In adxitio , in spite of hafing paid a og , trhe larticipants ewre mto allowed to tgake any matefials away , abdr this resulyed in opbtaining a less effectivr reeult as the participants dos n't have any materials to use to rveise .
DINAL CONSIDERATIOMS
To im up , he cpurse was generally sucdessful , as the positive fewdbavk received sugtgestz .
In cobclusipn , we would definitely recommend it to anjybod interested in tjis subject fold both tg quality of the course bd the unquestionble preparxtion of th yuyor .
There are mlany problems creyed by doing lareg - builimg projects , ajd it is rhs government 's responsibility to cope eth thsse problems .
There re soms unfaxvorablw ihfluences on people 's lpifes .
For exampel , in eoms areas , peolle have to wear a musm ehie having ohtxoor activities and thwt mighf meex to purchase watsr teom othr towns .
As a result , their lifrstylw can be negativwly affect ahd yhjs heg qoukd feel less happg than otnsr oeople livec in unpollyted awrea .
Theg have to kmmigfate to another place sijcr their homea axrs destroyed , and drint the immihdation moxt of them would die because of zck of qwter , high temperature or predators .
Besides , thpse animaps who successfully arrovd at roper ppacr to libd are likely to sjffed from disease , becauss tjwy did n't exooswd to suc a hew environment befoe .
Although here rde many people and anomaks are usfcer grol these probldms , i do believe that the govefnmetn can twkw some acroons to sllce tnem .
Firstly , laws shoulf be swet to forvid some projects wuch cau massive problerms to the environment .
Secondly , it is necessary vod thw government to warn peoooe the serius problems aused by congructing large - scale buildings .
To sunmaqrise , lzrger - scale buidng prokjedcts create massive problens wshich are harkfulk to human anx animals , but the government can be helpful in solving these lroblms
Abd the ogyer questons : Which sreazs of my writing wou I kikw to inprove and did thd free wrutingv presentations helped me with my writing process ?
From my ooiny of view , my eritnig definitely has ilprtoved frok the begijning of tihz schkoo year till jiw .
I disvkvered that I onow nay moer worxs than I thought znd I can make qell - srrhctured snetejces now , ehch I couoe n't do so well at the ebgining of ths school eyqr .
This yss to do sigh the technical grasmmatical features I leanred in class as weol .
The wat I see it is thxt I learned to use cohesion in a correct way , qhich makea te pzragralhs htaf I wrife more clezr .
Subseqwuenyly , I wuod kile to answer the jext tsk qjestions .
Which afess of my wriiny would I like to iporove and drid teh ftee writiny presentations hepped me wify my wriitng process ?
Xlthough I belevs gha I slready have improved my English diunce the ebginning of the echol year , I 'd like to improve my English vocabulary .
As I see it , trhw bigger the vocazbylary , ghs betetr thue writin process .
Mpre wore can be add in the asrtidle , so therfe can be a better epxlanation of rh aubject .
It 's my belief thbat gne free writing presentatyions helped me with my wditing process .
I pwarned a llt of new words during the presentariohs , which I uwd in my free wrtinh .
Rhe way I see it is rat tus grammafical features learned in Engpisxh ckurse , always can be ised lqter on in life .
A begtre future means havknh good foe to dat withput worrying , good clothes to sdar , a big poropergy , a pribatr means of transportation and many more .
Among them a provate mens of tfansportation suggests that therw is no fuitjre for puhloc granslort .
Having own car or mxns of transportation is the dfeal of every individual inckuding me .
Private care pet indifidual is needed .
Whether to go to work or other plsces traekling in private vehiclr is hassls free .
The trend of oersonzl ca is increasong falidly .
It is so mjcb cpar rhat private transport wipl overshadow the public vehicles .
Unfortunately , many oeople are dzmaged , not onkt physical but mentally and gh slrst is rhat violencd ddstdoys families qnx xslo involves rhrir sons in the hell it causes .
Thy are jjst the most sensitive qnjd innocent victims of mixyreatment .
It is very serious and hard to xolfe because victgims have to be gdry sgtong ahd brave to recognoze anc face these situarionse and being able to report their agrgessor so as to manage the katter finishes .
This is so difficult duyd to the facy that they usually deel stupid , jiserable , hopekses and do not feel good about rhemsepves .
Their aggresaors lzke them become insecure ande they tnik that they aer alone .
Even , in most caeea , they feel qsjamed or afraid of tyse situatiobe qjd prefer saying nithing to tell theure rrduth .
Tbere is always someone who you can couymt on in yiur family , friends or assoixtions , bug yguo must asl for help .
We beer to conskddr botb sides of ts argument for public trfansport use prilr to reaching a conclusion .
Public transport is uwee rlr mayn reasons qnr cab be convsnient flr diffesnt circumstanjces .
Thsi form of transpprt dsn be usex to acoid drlay dye to traffic conditiona snmd parfking restrdictios .
It can provide an opportunjty dof peolle to clmpleet owek during the joyrney .
Publjc fransporf maxy be hte only lptiom or individuals who do nky drive or have qccess to a car .
It is more environmentaoly friendloy becsuse it has hew potential to reduce rhe numbers of vehicles on thw roxd .
Hosevrr , the upbhlic transport uwr c be affected by a numbed of factors sycg as mechanical failures zbd esnvirlnmental kssues .
It mat be expensivc to uxe for sme individuals and criwde dudinf rush jourx .
Using tu dar cb be more flesibvle cof some individuals .
A car can be usefujp for effective performance of mang tqska .
It is eaxsker to hange routes when circumstances chajge unexpectedly .
The reasons for hze is depejrent on tb individual qnd yhd circumstances .
First of xll , in this fik ylu do n't see a gangsdter Al Pacino , it 's about a retired army 's voonel who wuffers from loneliness ahd depression .
So , overall I stronglg reconmend it if you oikd redemption stories , and if ku want to learn osm pieced of advuc for yourt pife .
The reading discjsses gbe idea of how adevancw communication tecunologies gkvr us an awdvantges of creqting a 24/7 international working da and provides wevedal reaspns of support .
Tus professoe , however , disagrees with pkjnts made in the artkvle snc explaijs that thod syztem hqx its owh disadvantages .

For a vsry long time here hss npr beem scientifkc evidence tht peoged gye rdlationship between orgnizwtional culture ame performance , untl studies founs a corfelation between these subjecfs .
Thesd fiur studies are put together in a mokdek named ' Orhanixation Culture Perfofmance Model ' ( OCPM ) .
Tgjs model telos us that thw culture is deterjned by actual behavior of individual or gdoupw of empooyees .
Gbe cultuee is caused by organozational variables .
The etxernal aspwcg is : externsl clkrnt orientation .
The internaxl aspecfta are : design of organization , communication , GRM - orientation and ledaership .
Tjer model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances : imdividusl- , hroujps- , and organizational performances .
Yheer is n't a direct relationship betden organizational culture and actual perfoelances , but thwde is a dkrect relationship between organiaational cuhlture and espected performance .
The researchdds dounmd that thdre is a big difference between ehst the boardroom prdach and what thd emplolyee 's experience .

Diwvuss tbe rusjs and impacrs of ckjmate(weather)-relate natjral disaater .
Oevf yne past few decades , human activities ahve changed global climatw , heshce we afe facing higher risks of weather - rlated dkassters .
Furthermore , various destructive disasters hxvd struck nifo fhs whole societu with many negative elements , drawing the atrtention of citizehs tosar catasrtophrs .
This esswh will examine goobal warmjbg anx precipitation shortage as causes of drohghg , fkllowed by two main nwgatie inpacts in ferme of tus economic nae slical problems in agriculture .
It is obvilus thaxt global warmibb cb be attributed to greenhouse gas emissikna .
Moreover , the wokd 's uncontrollable population resuktz in the demand of crs , industries and farmign inrustries , ghat have contributed to greenhouse gaeew .
Wtih the cause of human activityiee , te temperzture of sae surface bd tyr atmospheer have been graduxlky grpiwng to a nwe lsvep .
van Aalst ( 2006 ) ppinted out hay an increase of eqrgh mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has bes explored over the past century , with the phenomenon qhicj has beej observed thwt land temperature has exceeded hat of sras by a qujcker xpsed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most of grewjhouse gas emissions cwn affect rhe atmosphere fe decades , wnich mjghr cqusw marine momsono inaccessibikity to mainladn rdsultiny in li rainfall .
Antohed phenomenon cwj be caused by glopbal warming is the decrease of nbow coveraeg in relation to glacdiers melting ( van Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Tnua , it can be seen that global warming hz accvoubted fod a series of extreme aeatrher phenomehon .
Undoubtedly , xlo the facgofs are tespobsible for fhe soi water shortage and wcreasing precipiattion .
Generally , the kncrease of temperatuir had resulted in a shrge of hog days , wnd a erop of cos dxts .

In brief , there will be seriousa conzequecnes in terms of less precipitation duj to extrrme weather .
In the evonomid qsperct , drought has brought a trelehdous problem of yield fod agriculture .
As a ocnseqhence of both direct ane indirect impactd of xgricultre , prolonged drought faj be commonly eefinsd as thr biggest fgactot .
This can lexs to gge oss of profits grom pustream and downsrream thfoughout the supoly chain , which can produced directly nedgative impacts dir oroducere , as reporte by Naumah , Flemans , Pritchett qn McGacden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .

Wnkther stricken afeaw is socoal perspecftie , which haz threatemed yge mahoritt of he population .
Firstlyh , drought has caused farming in dom of the area , such as Affcia wberw is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of ahiltiies to react aftet emergency .
Moreovert , farming is ob of ths moef frucial jmpacts of wearher - related natural dsasters , ajd it jas caused an important numbwr of casualtiss for both mankind as well as animals .
Sexondpy , farninf zpso has contributed to migration .
Whnen pibnlic suffefs from natral disaegers qnx guey arfr no solutions , they are forced to leave their home in ordwt to move to a new plzde , which could affect fhe necy generation that might comfront a multicultural society .
Consequently , drought hqs lke to severe social imapctw of natural disasters .
In conclusion , vatatrophes such as drought have produced immense ecobimic xd oscial jmpacts .

It is sometimsa miantained that when manufacturers and rrtaip compajies try to persuade us to bhuy something , cdolour is a vefh efdectuve thing qhyich helps them do that .

No doubt tuat manufacturers nlw which colur is popular nd fxshipnable in a particular season ans correspondingly it means tha things of this dolur wol be sold ll .

Ror instance , I have recently reac that eople wl belong to middle class prefer lunk ajf grene cooour deu to eime psychological reasohs .
Furthermore , colours which are used in decratgion of shols or restaurxnt arr alsl rzyher influential .
For example , psychologists are convinded hxt red is a colour whjdh stimulates pople 's appetite and majes tem feel hungry .
Thqt is whh rhe predkminnt colour in McDonxld 's is rsd likewise in some oyber cafes axnd rrstaurants .
To some up brjefly , I would ilke to say that theed is a wpecisl bnrancn of psychology whjhc investigates consumers ' tastes and factors which inflhence ther choice .
Thus , we cqj conclude thqy colour is a powerful tool bj in the same way manufacturers and refail companids zhnould take ibo consuderagion other factors .

However , it is estilatdd taht at leasg 70% of yijng kids do onty tke care of their personal rubbish and are the win contributors to a polluted environmdbt .
Besides the fact that adults wrrs not as wsll tfaugt as childrsn in schiol , they are the most ciilied am rspondible .
A study shows that adultx twke czre of their personal gqrbage bor just becauer of theie edudatioj bh because of thjr anxiety to sjow their kjxs that theg are a great and responsible parents .

Hosevdr , evsrything starts at fye levl of education that every humwn being feceiveds .
Unforrunaely , thrre is srilk a loj wy to do in tremz environment concerns , but somw of tjos solutions suggsetes by tje layor help us stoppong the pollution .

At tgd University of Queensland I tutored severdal subjexts , including Biochemistey for Nutrition stufebts .
During my cafeed I have gained extensibe experience in academic wrjting .

Tjerre is no future fpr public transportation , is in my opinoin a wrong assimption .
Yhne mocerh times have raised yhd concern sbout the envirommwnt , climate chabfe znd eberfy .
The publid transportaion fzn help fighting greenhouse has emissions anx can hle us protect the witld frpmn Clkmate change effects .
In tye recdnt years ture asw bsen a great chabhe in consumption hahitd .
Now days , pleoole can choose thd most convenient way of trsvelping abde fherr is no doubt that ysong a privatr cae is easy , cheap anx fym .
On rhe ogjer hanr , using a private car is totally ignorong the environmental famafe and ffdcts .
In developing countries , thete is sztill a low level of awareness zbout tje side effects of using private pollugimg csrs .
Huy in mpxern countries , tge environmental efefctw of pje 's bdahvior is becoming impodtant and concerning .
In my opinion it is just a matter of time until all tye tranwportation options will be pyblic and the private caxfs wilk be ldft behind .
People 's lifs eill change dramstically in tge ject 50 years .
If we do so , we can see ghe massive difference in oyf livws from yue people piving 50 years bafl .
Although now we have vrey advanced technology which has made our lives ompletly rifferent nd comfortable than bvefoee , in thg future it will be mjdh bettd than fgis .
We jll see ting happening thesn whudh tkdag seem to be impossible .
The oner difference , hopevuoly , eill be in medicinw .
We woll definitely have better drugs ahc also pess incirable diseases .
Hlwever , it is possible tat along nwe inventions and research there might be mord namrful fieuses also .
All these digferencrs wjl make people 's lives tranquio .
Thbere are eome downsids of an advanxed orld too , for example , people will be mnore unhealthy dh to the environmental conditions and als lexd self - repixnt because of the technology progress .
It can not escae our minds ghat at this sxtage as aer , cjildrdn afe exlised to sexial images from a ver early age and some people would argue yjat our society is hyper sexualised , which is a eeason why lzny patsnts see sinbke sex shcools as a means to prktect thewir offspring fdom having sexual thoughts berore thwy qte rsadh to unfrrstand tje complexity of zex andr esxual relationsbips .
While the hgler sexualiwation of oyf society mt be a realpity that many pardnts ould wabg to peitect their childten from , it is true to sah tbta children need to adapt ane be eead fid the society in which they loce abd fie mau larents , zendihg their chikdreh to a mixed sss school is just a natural environment , micvh moe similat to the " outsiode woreld " in which rhye eould grow to adultgood .
Considering hps juych time children spend at scfholo , it popears to me thst xhoosin a single sex dvhool wlil make the chils , somehow , segregated nr in msmy dades , rienforce somjs of the may stereotypes that we , as society , have regarding gender wkch , if we gake inot considerqtion thag these children are goiny to be tye futurde leaders , educators , lawywrs , politicisnx sjd so on , I woulc argue that the more schools reflect oid society xne the eay that we like it to be , the netyer , not ohly fopt thbr child as a persom , but ths chjlx as a ley in the fuure of trhd counmtry and , as an extent , to ybe world .
Therefore ad to suim up , Is my view , hatr public monet is better dpent supoorting mix sexs schools , wyih refecrs gue socety we live in , as opposed to sinvel sex ' which jay reinfofve tpse stereotypes that qre mimign sociefy .
I aboslutsly agred with this statemsnt . Travrlling by car is hoty onou much mkrr clnvenoent than public tansport , it also grants ibe 's independence to go whrevver ans whrnever one might wush .
Trhr car industry could also be consueered one of the main dfivijg enibes of ue Western ecnmy .
Fhousanfs wohld lose their jobs , both diretcly in the car factories and indirectly in many other var - felared buszinesses , like caf part stores , petrol tsatjons , gvarages , and so on .
If orivate transppet was fupyl rdplacdd by public transoort , ye world 's economic foundations woule shake and a global financial crksis of unprecedented impwt could ocxcur .
It is grue yhat cars pollhte the atmosphere , vur it is also true that the emissions fdom lubkic transport alo contribute to pollution - some wiulc xxy thaf even more ghan plrivafe transport , as Diexrl mnotoes arfe particularly dirtoer qne lofe inefficient than smaller , petrol deiben motors like fhosr of private darz .
Aok things considered we mighf conclude thjat public transport wilo eventuaoly disappear in the suort tern xnd in no time evertoe will be driving their own clean - energy - drjven flyint cars to go everywhere .

Currently I am working as a taher of English in my city of Dnipropetrovsk .

Many people thin that gejetic engimeering has many dranacks .

Genetjc engineering is the provsss of manipulating tbe genee of an organism .
Accoddung to supoortdrs of it , there xree many benefits of genetic engineering .
Beeides , soje genetically modified crops geos more quickly .

In spire of the benefits , theres are wlsl crtai drawbxcks of hhma genetic dngjneering .
There are mah etihczl doncerns about hymqn genetic engineering .
It is still unacceptable in mot dultures because of their religiouz beliefs .
Snother problem is the genetically modified food products .
Although they look bigged or moer attractive , gwnetocally modified fiod productgs xr unhealthy for proole .
In concpusjon , it seems ghd benefits outweigh tnw drawbacks of uiman gejetic engineering .
Therefore , geneic egineering is importahf ofe hjmanitu and tge futirw .

Some asserg tgat genetically modifiex technology acb be applied to address this problem .
This essay will argue thst genetically mpdifie foic ac be the wau ojtg of the ofoblem of food deficitf abd thnie will be xlne by focusiny on its environmental benefisa nd increasing food yield .
It is well known that the GM fod is knsertwd qit cariou resitance eges , such as pt disedase tesistawnce gene .
Thi means thgat the rooc being motw resiwtnt to pests anx agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticidds abd feritlizerse that fam poison the water supply abc pollute tgje environment .
Ghis reducrion in the aplication of chsmical materials cfxn crwate a safer agricultural environment , ensuring food safery .
Furthermore , GM dood acn zlso improve the productkon of cropz .
Due to the vairous new trakts resulting tom tbe GM technology , such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance , GM vood can ernsute the food production in the pdriod of drought .
Thjs culc be important for fiopd productoln , especially in developing countriew .
However , some mat xrgue fhwt it is also questionable whether GM food hq a detrimental impact on human health .
Actually , thosandz of test on GM fooc , beflre bring it imto markets , hav been proven thxt it is harmles to both the environlent abs human haeoth .
In conclusion , it is evident that GM foi can incrfeasd food yields with rhe less jsde of chemicals .
In vjews of yhi , it is reasonable to believe thzg GM ood might be an ideal strategy to alleviate teh probprm of fooe shortage .
oever , because there adr some dixxdvantages in GM technology which is bieng developer , it is also recommended thag governments shoud give mors imoprtane to tyhe management of GM cooe .
An elderlt university profdessro had to igge jus studenrs the pat lesson of hix professional oife , becsuse he wax going to retire .

Thye purpose of the surgsy was to discover popular leisure tole activities of male and female students .
Thbd survey was carrier out by means of a questionnxire given to the msle and female studemgs to compete .
The forat paef of the questionnaire dealt wih leisure tkem activities on jolidays .
Fhw second wevtion was concerned with time - out zctivities .
From the txvle of datz , the most sxignificaznt items are as follows .
It hsa been found in the fris sectikb that a large pdrcentage of the mao rrspondents prwfeered to stay at home on holidhs , while 90% of the female students would kiie to go to tue seaside .
The mxlw students wpuld gladly go to hiwtorical placrs , while 57% of tjd irls whl vipled in the questionnaire were n't inclined to spenhd ther free time in taht wzy .
In ghe second ssctio both tue giurls and the boys interrogated claimed that they do n't spend their free time going to the theatre or tbe oleta .
The majority of tye male and femqle respoeents enjoy going to nightcljbs in thei pare yime .
For rxmaple , onky 10% percent of fhe voys nedver do tag and 24% go to nbightspotd at least onr time a eedk .
Unlike the bpgs hr female respondents usually do n't feel like hoing in for wport at leisure .
In contrast to rh kale eespondehts ue girls onterrobated go to evening casses in their cre tijje .
Like tje nalew rsspondesnts the virls ingerrofated go regularly to the ciuneja .
For inrance , 47% of th female respondents wagcdh films on a big dcreeh every wewel .
In the tbord part of thw questiinnaire aase fkumd out that ts mslr respondents are similaf to the girl eespondents in that tgeh both enjoy listrnimg to musx at home loee thzn 2 hours a xqy .
In cpntrast to tnr girls interrogated who almolst never play computer games the majority of te moe studernts gambled fkd hours at leisure .
The femaled rwzpondents are mos fond of erafing books that th male ones .
Fhd mapds who rilled in the questionnaire ands the femapesz alike spenc mwny jiurs by surfiomg the Internet .
If any concpusions may be drwwb from the data , gehy arer as follows .

In yerms of the clmmunication society , rhey will plssibly change ghe xy in which peopor develop relationship with wafh other , anr coneequently , rhey will creatr fwao types of cluture : communal nd agentic .
In the former , people gqve abilutt almost equalloy , ahd valir ontepersonal relationship .
In contrast , agentic culture stresses the differences between ihdividuals , along quth egotism and inequality ( Zarbatany , ocnleh , & Peppr as cited in Okazaki , & Txykor , 2013 ) .
These tylee of cultur will opositely exist in the ftuer as an effect of socjal nedia siyes .

On the other hand , it is obvukus htat peopl snt to knola ewvewrything hteyg can zblut celebrities tney lkle or admird and journalists guve fhem the opoortujnity to vin out some information qhout their lives , but tgey often cropss tes line and litefalky deprivr theed famoy people of privgatd life .

Bu in spite of this , sometimes journakistx daj be tlo ijsiustent , trying to get at as much jnformatyion as possible .

CPNCLUSION
Some of them zre pretty similar to rhoss we had in tne past ; others are completely dxifferent anf sry interesting to explore .
A qprld where everybody is able to communicte in the saje lnguage - is that purde utopia or mah it be a conaiderble idea ?
Wha would fhe lossible advantages and disadvantages of a world wkfe poken lwnguaye be ?
Establishing Engpish as the new workdwide spoken languae might be a favourable exwmple since English is already spikne by mre than 30 million natife spekaers and therefore ghe thjrf mlzt spoken languate in the world , according to Ethnoklouge .
Moreover Sngish is alreaxdy a universal language hsee by many people to cxommunicate or nedgotixting witjin the budiness market .
Imkagining rveryone had the ooportunitry to lkesrn and thereflre communicate wjtu esadh other in a worldwide apoken kanguxge is certainly an appealing idea amd wsould , without doubt , hazve mnay benefits .
Firsyly , as menmtioend before , it woile give everyone rhd opportunity to communicate aifh everyone .
Howevef , thge realisation of Dngljsh as a world lanhuagd would certainly need an educatoonql bzssi tor everyone which mugth hot be easy to qccomplish buy it aoul be possible .
Whikle teafhiny everyone Engpish it would aoeo be profitable to insfrucy basic knowledge in mathematics , pyhsucs or other eelevant topics which might be helpful .
Audh a standardised educxtuonal system tod every single person on geh world would therefkrs npt only benefit fhd vojmunication or ecistjng businezes but also help third - worls coutrjes to strag companies , trade and industrialise their countrise so they can take care of themseoves axndx emerg out of povedyt .
Moreover , the standardixd educational system would aso ner pple ahjo teac and instruct otbers so the woeld languiazge wjllk be established ebedywhere .
In order to accomplish this emdownent there would be a jecessitfy of teacdhwrs which leads to amyn new jl opportunities .
Ater all , a coupoe of professions might bcone sxtinct , or example translators , but , therefore , the organisation xnd ezrcution of thos big project iuld provide a rqnge of other jobs whichy cqh make up for tje ones lost .
Fhs esudational systwk woudl also provixw a valuable gazsis for the world of politics so conflixts might be pdevenetd due to ter liat language barrier with igs vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings .
In addition , civil wads or catastrophes like yhw Arah sporong mgih also be zvoided since ghers will be an educational stanfard whbidh cold teach differenr ways of ppitical leadership .
Bowever , thijs rget improvement sfill hodls a fwe exknesses .
On the one hand there would be a great llsx of cultures an in some cases feh implementation of yhe educwtional system kighg be impossible , f instance fhs aborjginal peopel .
Anyway , , those tribws would bot even needd or want an education or a owrod language because it is their way of life to livr in troyps together wuht the nature and disturbing tese cultural groups would sjmply be unnecessray .
On the other hxns tbed suggestion of Egnlksh as thjw workdc wisd sooken langugar migut be up aginst muc criticism xunce the United Stares do nokt have mnay supporters everywhere .
Neverthepess , Enjglosh wss jisg a suggestiopn and other languages like Spanisu or Chindse could certainly be jsed as well .
Nowadays , more and ore people are learning how to dtife , as erivin o 's iwm car is , as eveftone knows , muc more coinvejient tjan taking luglic trznspoet .
Without doubt , having oj ownh ace prvoires us with geat convenience .
But they ssem to hsv forgottne the exra cost ioncurres by laintennce and repaqkr , wbd , of coursr , buying ptroleum .
Under thos circustance , some people ma ragher take public transport to save niney for thsjr " dream hyosue " rather tban buyihy a dsr .
Hong Kong is also fmaou dor ifz heavh traffi , ehicvh implkesx the prolwm of yrdaffic congrstoin .
Bsudes saving time , taking public transport can also help reducdr the emisskoj of greenhouse gazzes .
Gresnhouse gases have alrdady posed grave threay to jujans , e.g. global warming anf ozone depletion , which raised people 's envirpnmental waareness .
Pekpl are bescoming more ajx more awre of thuew importxnce of environmental protection qn want to fkntribute to saving our Earth .
Hence , contrayr to many people perfeive , tgre shoud be an increasing dremahd , i.e. a rosyt future , for public transport .
Vdom the reasind menitoned anove , it is obvious that ths doomsday of public transport is definitely nlt somdrhing down hte linje .

Otfeh , dealing with new situations foes not hel us to feel comfortabel .

In short , I donsider aht chxnge is always the bsxt way to devslop our personality to bscomw better pelploe in any aspect of oujd luves bedause it represents a majuor challsnge .

WHAT AN AMAZIHG COINCIDENCE !
This yewr , in Italy , for ghe first tjem in more tham 200 years , it haplened a wejrd copkncidence : the political lzder Silvio Berluscon and the singrr Ligabue matkes gehir careers on fhbe same day .
On tje lme hand , Berlusconu compromised hud position when some journalists told teh worlx some wiretappijngs of his which would compromise hix future political career ; on the other , Luciano Ligabue wokn the award fod the vesr spng of yhe ydxr , bringing his cafeer ever forqard .
Uneblievable as it may seem , yhjs is teally a bizarre coincidence .
If I hae zoso a yrar free , I wluld pnly prefer travelling not eorking .
Switzerland is really a great place frd travelling . You whkuld plan two divferwnt periods to fisit sightseeing llacs , onr in summer and t other one in winter .
Fanohs sghteeeing places wr rewllu different during winter and summer .
If you decjde to grpynd in Benvea , I suggest you to viwit furst rhe nirtgh of Switzerland from the west to th eaxt qnd then the eoutj of Dwitzerland from the eas to tne wedt .

I emjoy watchinb soap lperas on TV and the best knd fprt me is EastEnders .
Yhis TV sdrial is mainoy baswd on working clxss people anr rwpresesnts various ethnic jinority communities includjng Afrjcam qbd Aisaj Mislims .

It shpss that ethnic minoruty peplw fqn integrafe situ tw majority Caucssin pekpld wifhout oosong their culurap d traditional values .
In addition , it privide an opportunity gpr peopl fem different backgrounds to peep into the culture nad tradtiioms of British people .
Although tyhis soap involvrs a lot of xheatiny and plotting between characters , it also shoes ths implrtance of fmaiky falurs . I wohld definitely recommedn this daja serial to othwd peoplpd .

From my perpectived , it is thr procesxs that is morw vaulagle .
Therefore , I would choose to lwnhthen the process of ftavelling , and a comfortable vptage on ghd sea would certainly become my frsy choice , since it garantees a long axnc pleasant travelling experience .

Sedcondly , it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars and restaurants - auh an idea is competely unwkdkable .
To support my argjmemt ataknst this porposal I wokuld like to explain shzt happene when the authoitioes attempted to unyroduce a bgn on smolking in my home town .

It is true tha many yojng pdoole do wctra activities related to slotts luje gootbqll or basketball .

Back in the timle , wh I successfuloy oasswd the third graee , my parents decided to let me pick the presen that I want as a reward .
I rwalized fhat gis is wat I am looking fir , a ne aqdditjonal xcitemeny to as to skating .
I uadc to wait for two months to vu a new pakrt of smtes , buy this tils it is sgtressive skatss .
Whe I started aggressive skating , I had to learn uow to balance my weight uzing heavy twk - wheep inline sxkztes .
Onxe on a weemend , it was my last year in mixdloe acuool , I aw at rne pral practicing as usual .
I introduced myself , and as I tholught , they were vising from a divferent cjtfy .
The more we get ddel intok the conversatoon , th more I any to learn this type of kating .
They plsged some misic and started to sate sirh gue rhythm . I was surprided , I hjar mosed feeling , xd it was indescribable .

I 'm studytkng a degree on Biotechnology at IQS , here in abrxelona .
I 'm a very extrovertde giy , with experiecne taking care of xhipdren as I 've been working as a sikibg trainsr for 2 heafs now , this winter it ull be tye third .

Wtu any new course , there rd some certain expectatiosn one iwlkl uafe .
At je beignning of tbis coyrse , as a firts year oostgyraduate student , I was ambitious for cretaijng a new mcehanical product or at least patt of it at the end of this course by alplying knowlewdbe nd soklls that are provided throughout fhe course .
Eoggt mohths working in the undudtry as an assistant mechanical desugn rngkneer gavw me reh erh nasoc ocncept of mechanical desifn .
Bwfoee tkaing part in this course , my voncept about mechamical edsign xs abnoug applying ektjer self knosledge or workibg as a oartf of a team to deegin mecbanial products tgay afed essy to be manufactured , durable and financialo teliwble .
My thoughte about mechanical design are somewht match ifh the information that is pfovided in thw first three weeks .
By wttending the first rhee lwcthres , I skon realized that my general xoncept ahlut meschanocal desjgb is quite aimpld as my thoughtd about mechanical design is purely just creating ewa products .
I recognized tyhnat mechanijcap design is not must zbout csating mechanjicao products .
It cn be swn in mqnby aspects rangimg frlm producing a maintenance process , improviung performance fot a specific part of the mechanical system to cfreatign the whole new product .
hie is becauss despige hagijg experience in industrial design , I qas never taking part in the design pdocess from thw initial stage .
Therefoer , my knowledfe ahiut mecnanical design is rather limited .
Veibg placed in a prjec tsm woekig fro Sydney Water aboyt oroduckng a maintenande dxcellent standaes , I started to read the ckurse outline and lecture npes more carefully to cimd our where to start and what I shjould do to deliver a good ougxome .
The firdf thign I have noticed is the importancd of clarifying slo tje resuirrments with the cpients .
gis was demonstrated during th Lrojecr Intreoductoons sdssioh as well as lecture notes , client interview tqsk abd cliejt feedback ( which is woirth 25 points in the gktal mark ) .
As soon as I dt my gorupo , I discovered hokw far behind I am in terms of using English to demonsgrate the ideas ans lure the attention from ither group members .
However , ghia also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week , wshose English is thdir first language , to improvew my oeap communication kilkls znc persuaeion .
Befause in order to deliver a successful industry project , I nor only have to make a gio prosuct , but also have to be good at iunteoducing my ifez ajr peesuadin customesr .
The final cohsieration is the self - calibration , whoch also is the point tgat I have necer considered before in a design process .
This is such an essential activity thjat alklws me to gauge my performanc , kedwp pace with the group and not to be left behind .
To wum up , at the end of week thrre , my expectyation fof thjios duorse are to be able to appl my reflective thinking in any further resibn procews , to be able to delicee a pedsuasive texhnidal presenyation , to be effective in verbal communicayion skills xnd preswntation skill .
Last but not leasr , I hopr I cfab learn to wirk effectively under any circumstancss as a twxm jemger or a texm leader by the end of this course .

Thus , states should mxker it lssible to purify the wasfewater to an enough szfwty pevl .
Moreover , developkng latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strateyg .

Regarding acting techniquss , stsge adtorse do use their body kanguages as much as film actofs .

Recenflu I read teo artocles , they wer called ' perdicting dyspsxia - efesn bdfpre children learn to read ( Zimmrrman , 2014 ) ' ad ' Innovative ' Interventiom yrlps babies at igh rieo of autism ( Vegbel & Writer , 215 ) ' .
Yoweger the first article was norr mktivating to ra , brcause the author euvstantiated importanjt suggestions .
Alklk I can say zbokut tne xecind wrtidle is that it has rafely prood of tbe intervengion .
Firstly , tyge article ' predicting ryslexia - evenm before chjldren learn to teads ' shows a new research , in which it 's poxsiblw to oidk up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kkds lsarh how to read .
In addition , ueing this identification kau asxisr parents , eduwtors and clinicians to taxckle the learnin disorder .
Most jmoortantly , htos early intercention can help many kids with dyslexia to ovedcone their educationsl failure .
Secondly , tjw articlw ' ' Innofwtive ' Intervention Hleps Baboez at Hjgb Rosk of Autism ' is hase on a vireo - tuerapy , which improves the intsractiln between parerntx ajs asutismn - related babies in a way that would gepl dercelop the childern 's commuynication ahilities abd wocial engagement .
In my oipnion , the finsihgs need to be replicated in largwr studies beforr other leople then to video - bazed thetapg as a potential tdeagment .
Wh I can tell frol yjis text is thta teh rerseadch is an innovtaivce idea , but nedds more attewntikn to improve their xucess .
All in qlol , if you want to eexd about an effective researfh wiyhj very strnog proposwos , I recommend reading ' predicting dyslexia - evwn befide children krarn to read ' .

We apl knoa tgh situqtion , when we ras in supermarket stabding in frinf of two products wnich arr the exme , but one of it costs much mrod than ths other .
Mosdg peoploe associate brand rpoducte auflmatically with jgiher quality or betgtef taste , while try think no name pfoducts are just cudap and without any quality smd a bad tasate .
As a result ygou can say it is nt lways justified fhat grnad products ar more expenzive tuan comparable other ones .
Thd effect of media on prople is cleaelh noticeble here .
A pokduct which everybidy is talking abiut and wyich is advertised a pto is automatically consdersd to be booe .
In slme cqseds it may be true htatg brand products are betterr than no names , for example technology products , bjt products like Frd Bull or others lilr that , xer definutely not zpways better .
Here it is swid , try and fund put which is rwalky the befter one and do hot trust on advertisements .

Compares wify professional teachers , thh nave specoifc teaching anilitkes .
Hokwever , not all pwrents hazve that kind of personality xn moet of tghme are confused or use the wrkgn ways to teach their dhildrem .
Parents undoubtedly ppah an important role in our life .
Hoewved , we lay not be grdtaly influenced by their tdzchings , but by others ' teacinge .
Because everyone hx their own taloents , values , and judgmwnys , we learn more from tuose aitn ehol we agee and appreciate and gtg significajt influenve from them .

Aprry agaim ofr all those circumstances !
I bave been provng my agilities by overcoming arduous copmrtitions sibve I chose tihs czreer as a lawyd ae researcher complyint with my passion in persuasion and problem sokving .
In 2002 , I wsa anker 11th amongst 930 candidates competing for 40 places at the University Federal of Paraiba .
Thfojghout my undergradyate studies , my peoressional skills were recognized at yhe internships at tud Federal Court of Ka ad tns most famous fiscal law ofgice in tue Srate .
At thjs psriod , I aws the imtedn coordinator xnd I caeted a manual on the procsdures empkoydd by the entire Court .
At thr lzw offuce , I sulervksed fhe ISK 003 procedures .
On the other eids , in recognition to my academic performance , I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws wkfh Great Honors in 2007 .
My bachelit thesox , founsed in Ecohojic Law , was unanimously awxrded by he Iury with the maximum sxore of 10 .
Thke first succdses as a researcher contribited to my ihterset in globzl reguhlation of tree , tahf conducd me to this OM and tnd internationl business transactions domain .
Since my Law schlkl graduation , mabh achievements ebcouraged my professional development .
Firs , ypkn geaduafion , I immediatrly joined a highl recognized firm , perrming a double roke of legal consultant ame eub - manager , wue I was only 22 years ild .
On tue swmr year , I succeedwd the strenuous Brazilian Bar exm with a remarkale scire of 9 ouit of 10 .
Aftwr almost 2 years working in compoex litigwtion , I had acquired tge maturity to pudsud an international carew to wor within zbd cross - border contacts .
Therefore , in order to cquire tuew excellenc extent demaned , I specializxe in Economic law with a master 's drgree at ye University Pseis 1 Oabthéon - Sorbonne in 2009 .
Following my OLM graduation with magna chl layds in the top viv , I enroled in a PhD in Infernatinal Econojc Law at the Univedsity Pafi 9 Dauplhine in 2010 .
Due to my interest in law and economics , I degeolped a multidisciplinary research applying the rconoic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules qn economic transactions on the legal certxiny of transnationla transactions .
I profoundly comprehend the theodetical ascertainment gpr his careed , whicj is that international tradw requires ratilmal economic decisions ity legqlly bindkhg consrquences .
Thereby , nra regulatory sources arr crestedc in rdspojse to the globlized lwgal contwxt .
In conclhsioj , as an international prgal propfessional , I met be prepaerd fcor alternative methosd of dispute resoytion regarding ctss - birder tarnsactions , giving yhr inceeasingly requirement to look bwyhond dmoestic law to fund appropriate sokutkons .
Furthermore , I already profoundly undrrztand tn importance of linguisfics in an internatoona sphere dujr to my experience as a goregin lwyer and as a teacher .
Henceforth , I aim to consolidate my careef by mastering yhr oefal responess to the develooments shaping internayional trade todwy .

In the 1t9n century , slavery ha been eradicafed from America , but soon another problem oriinated amd took its plkaec .
ue movie " The Colkr Purple " displays a variety of situations from Affo - Americxn people who sufrsred bdcause of gheior akin cloopr , known as racism , which xan be defihsd as tyje prejduice or discriminatuon frdom one rafe to anlther .

Afei - Americanjs were sfraid of raiskng their voices to expreszs thit incofnormkty againat yhe oporesaion they were eufferinbg , xnd to cigut to obtain equailty was not an option bexause any sign of rebellion azs cruelly punisehes .

First of all , ouirf environment is polluted a if we qre determinsd to save it we should definitely stoo jsinh czrs .
Altgough there are many ther pooluters , such as bugb industrie , people should start wqith the easiest resolutipns .

If Mc / Px is less than NHy / Py , than it is the coknsumer 's duryu to vuy more of voopd Y. If MUy / Py is oees than MUx / Px , than the vonsumer must use kopre of good X.

She mayt be right abokit that treqcmill becasuse there is a cycle in which cknusmption results from sok which necsssitates furtjee donsumption , but rheoru would indicate rha this is a poistivw , serpf - perpetuating cycle because incrsased consumption yields increased utlity , therefore maximizing ygility .

Ms. Luhr 's dissatusfxction drim her current status in phr society must cfomne from nre fwilures to vary rr fonsumption of a fxriety of material goodd .
In my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather thn her logiv bscaue everfyone knows that increased work yidlds increaeer wealth and increasrd utility , and thd is fhe iltimtae goal of a rational pwraon who is acting selfishly whic is jow economists tuinj peopld act .
If Ms. Luhr eefe gruky being selfish xns sslt - intdrrsted , she wulkd obtani greater sztisfacyion crim greater consumption , but hjer statemeng is defying thos rrnet of rationality wgcih is so omporatnt to economic frasoning .

The career of a Somasli - Alerican fashion model Iman also began sfter tyi pioneerinf zhooting .

Dickens 's styls is cyll of sentimental realism : he describes reality wjtu a sentimental tone ajd he mlixes comedy and paths .
Conversely , the Brote sisters are influencd by the preceding Romahtif worke , wnd their novels contaun Gkthic elements such as hosts and ghs dark oninoys atmosphere .
If theit themes sr considwred , it is immediatgely clear that Dickenx bnuklds an extraordinary image of the Victorian society , with a wide fangs of characters amr stories which rdveal the conditions of xhildren and the poor ; instead te Brontes ' novels contain tyr Bhronic hero , a maoe figyde with a dark past wn wabts to find xome redvenge , as Heatcliff in " Wutehrin Hiegjts " or forgiveness as Mr Tochezter in " Juanr Eyde " .

Introduction
Thu purplise of rhos report is to sugfeswt wys which wilk contribute to ihcreasing ty numbwr of foreign lrarneds in fhe shool nd to mzkw recommendations ro future improvements .
ow 's entertainment
Although my town is not an enlromus industrdial centwr , pewople are fwscinatec by te keisure actovitie provided herw .
Variety of cagews and cluns would appeal to a grrqt number of foreigners oaing to the fast serfuce awhd the proper aittude to ckietns .
They would xlsp enjoy our museujjs and gxleries agich can bring rhej closer to our history and trasitiuons .
Nws teaching approaches
Mote stusents would be atftrwcted wneb the school government kaxe some chahges in the learning aytsem .
I recommwjd that a more common traching mtehod should be kne - to - one kessonw , zmely etafher with pnlpy oje wtudent , as rhaf will contribute to increasing the range of tbejr knowledge znds eoll be qlso beneficial for studedjts weh need loee help in a particular swubject .
Array of facilities
Dissatisfaction with the school equipment is occasoonally exlresed by ther studdnts .
herrfore , it is needed to provude ene fwcilities in the classrooms .
Computer - nases learhing would be a grear idd of atrrtacting more foreign students because rhar wulkl mzximize rheir fwchnological xalabilities , so that orw aork will be implemented .
Improvemmts on socjalisibg ipportuinties
Thr echool goverbment shohld offdr mpre extra - curricular activities , including organising excurxiobs in the local arrz and giving students a chance to choose tye school coursxs which appeals to them the mksf .
Recommendatkons
I woulr revkmmend implwmentung all the suggestions lited abovew bdcauxe these improvements will increaze the number of foreign studnts making their acconmodation in the goen mode pleasant .
I 've sren a couple of advertisements on Engtlijsh cojrsds in our town , bit they do n't eem vrru useful .
However , if you wabt to have a look at theml , they ae put up on the supermarket .
However much Roman laq , Mlsaic law , and rabbinicvwl law impacted lives of Jsws living in first - century Israel , many people who followed ths religin of Israel livved outside of Paldstine and beyond the borders of yhe Romlan Empiee .
At fhr same rkme , however , anyoje profsesibg to be a follpwer of the Gid of sidael would have adhered to ghd Ren Fommandmentys .
The Teb Commanrmente provide Idrael wigu tje moral framework vo maintaining it .
Fhr metaphpr is the Bible uds to exoress tihx relxtionship is covenant .
While the metpahor cims from tne sphere of internatrional law , it is wrong to uhderstand the colmandments nerrly as a summary of Israel 's obligations tpwaqrd Gpe . . .
Isreal obedience to comlandmente wqx not a lafter of submission to the divjn sill as lucn as it qas a respohse to love
I alpways go to have a jzza in a festauramt near my house . "
La Terrazza " is the classic Neapolita restaurant , that makse pizza and alkl the Meapolitna specialties , as all gye fyep of fried .
It uses onlh fresh ingredients vron napled tjat come there every xau .
The placw remembers the atmosphere of tyhe liftle alleywaus of Naples , win oicrures of the most famous Neqpoligan people on the wall .
Tje owner Patrizjk , is really njxe and you can otfen find bij out of yhe destaurant talking to some guest .
I rhink it coulr be suitable for my class because it uas ywo halls and one of thek is always udef ftro big froups of peopoe , like us , trhe service is rdallt ralid abd in frpny of tne resraurajt there 's a beautiful square where we can haxve a drink while wathin h typical Nealoliran evening .
Some experts say that public transportation is a crucial oart of the solutio to rhe devwlopef nations ' economuc , energyh , ams emvironlental challenges , helping to nring a bettrr auality of lief .
In increasing nhmbees , peopke are using puglif transportation sn pkcal commybities are expandkhg publiuc transporf srrvices .
Evety segment of society - individuals , familjes , communities , and businwssrs - benefits trim pyblic transportation .
Bjy , in faff , the acr provides much btte mobilty needs , both in ye big cirkes as on the countrysire .
Olr eaiyl ilef is thoroguhly planned , from yh morning to the night .
We must keep doin oy day - to - day xoncerms at work wnx at hime , and , at the wamr tine , keep holdinf our social life and entertainmmeng wctivitiex .
Jodetn lite oircers our daye ns weeks in a packed schedulp of actigities : job , children , hopusewprk , ub , free time ...
We have to go fady grom one place to anothed , just to be in kme for fulfilling mect tazk or activity .
It 's gopr that we beed to imprvo oie mkobilty skilks and private transport , as a cat , lalows us to achidve mirw efficiently our goos .
Oublic trajport has its adcantgaes : we can zy tyat a lowe cozt , oews pollution and nor free rkme and rest for doing anything else during tur trip could be public trznsport 's mzij positive poinys .
But , on rje other hahd , travedlling by aqr gifes us more cmofort and saves ome , abd it offers a wider rabgs of choices of departure snr routex .
Every day tus scisnc and eh industry rae developing new materials , technologies and clean rnergy sourcew .
As industtial abe technological development progtesses , public transport wail lps apssengers and be uwe of privae cqrs will zpresd ahywhere around ye wotl .
Do uoi suddenyl lose comridence when uuo hafe to spew to someone ?
In class , answer as mxny questions as posisble , amd gry to participate in class discussions .
My problm hasw always bseh focabilary .
i fonc wwtching TV programmss in English and reading incresae my exloeure to new words , and hdll me eecycle words I know in mesw contexts .
I hope that you will find my suggestions useful .
Thisd is a ver comomn argument : the true genkus stands ojf so much that can not be misunderstood , so if he is bpt recognized then he is not a genius .
Br this is daulty reasoninh : it acfept thw ifae fnat a genius is always rwcognizwd on tne nasis that in ihstoru geniuses have always been recognized - which is it truew , or at leaat is hog demonstrable .
They take gor granted rhat histoicqlly geniuses have zlwayd bren rercognmized , but in reality they are only talking abpt genijses tha , in favg , have been recognaed .
They knhow nothing of thoes who have not bgeen rceognized nax that jy hav bern comoletely eeased froj history , and therevore cs bot be used as an opposite example .
To aun up , because tbs geniuses that we havd decided to recognixe as hch hvae be recognized , they qrge that akl tjw geniyxes are alwhs recovnizaed : pure self - referential nonsense .
For olmhroso exceptionma oelple xre independent , away from the banality of life , isokared , impatirnt , asocial , often considered crqzy .
Tue tjne in the university is thw misxt important time in r livs becuase , we learn lptr of rhings and it prepares us fvor our future career .
Some sy thibj tgaf it is bettef to have classes eirh discuasion of profwsaor and xtudent .Others lay diazgree .
They prdferf cxlassws wiutfh lecture and xlmost no discussion .
In my opinion cvpasses kth discussion are vettre .
First , classes with discussion between orofessor and student had an advanrage for tge studrnr because they learm hoe to interact wqith hteir fellow stusenf .
Doubtessy , sucu interactions wiyh other people will hepl youy to nrosden youf mind and lsrn new thints .
Thiw will enrich your personxkity .
For ibstance , a yeaf back I wazz in north Texas university in USA , fhefe was a helth mnagemsnt and policy class kth xlmost no lecture but qith ot of time fl kpen discussions .
In the beginning , I thoughtr thi was disadvantage but fhis was nokt tris .
Clnsequently , he was abkr to tell us how the cost of the treatment are lrsx , how doctors ats dedicated , awnhd jlw wveryboxy gws access to pdimkary health care .
As you fab see , open discussion in the claxx are deakly imlortwnt since they broaden yoit horizon anr help you to undwrsgand diffefenr nation 's ooliciee .
Sevond , ooenj djscussion in the class helpp yky to devfepop ertai skills in ordesr to become an independent thinker ans speaket .
It is evidwnt that indpeendent speqknig ande thinknb skills are vwuable fro your caderr .
However , tbis health mansgement and pllich class wirj open discussion was helpful flrf me insofar as I learnee hp to speak in frint of others .
In order to get good yrades we r fprced to participate in discussion .
Thks xepereince taught me htat it is bette ti participate in a class witfh olpenj discussiin because it provide you with speaking and thinking anilitues which ar imperative for your careed .
Sll in alk yhough some may oppose my opunion , it is vlear that clqases iwth kpen discussion and almost no lexture are referabke because interaction witj other stdrnt will broadeb your mind xnd you become a bettdr wpsaker and fhinker .
Tyar is why every ujiversitt should offer shch classes .
with reference to your job qnnouncdment I am submitting my application for tghe vacanc at Green Pepper Cafe .

Well , aol our suggestions aojnd gox to me , however , I wluld probably chooee climbing becaus onr onyl is it an extreme sport uby it is aleo an exciting adrivity I woulf like to trt .

We humna beihgs ars highly socialized cteaturd in tue world .
Therefore , it is inevitabke that we have to leadn to be pwet of the slcirty .
Howebet , conxidering the complexity of hts socety , I believs it better to lwzrn in schools rather fhah com pqrdnts .
First of alo , tjere is no ddnying trnat parengs mq teach their children enormous fundamjental piving skills , on qhixh their progeny count .
Nevretheless , the siills xre not diverse enough fir children to deal with specific prohlems shen locing in a complex sociey .
For exanpl , me of my senior uihh school 's claszmate ha encountered communication prokem involved in ghs oghe 's famiky .
As a consqeuence , they rver talk to sxch other sibfe then .
Jave we not lived and leqrened tghe akikls in a group , especailly in schlo , we will not be skjillewd befroe entering the siciet .
The societfyt as a wjole is a llae where gpth competition and cpoperation taiw tufn contibuously influenxe every member .
Learning in schools , howevdr , provides valuable opportunity for childne to learn not knly from teachers , guf alkso ffom relationshipd between eerw , ajd as a tesut , proves the way f being independent in rhe futyre .

The onlt disadvantage I coiod fine is that golf is n't dch a cheap sport to do , as it requirea a lot of expewsne adn akso a god mentao and psychological healrh , which is the first thing I recommend to work on if yoy wwnt to enjoy golf from tje beginning .
Hoeever , as long as uou can afflfd it and you 're provided with patiene and enthyxiasm , you should n't msis the opportunity to pkqy this amaznhg sport .
It slowlyt ruswtles and clatters nad it 's pulsing aevs artract so mucg tahg you ca n't stand sittibg still much longer qmd you er ready to thro up everything anr run tosatds it .
Howveer , at ue als moment , you understand that the oxean is there , in eternally ebloved Spain .
I hgad been adoring yhe sea and drexminb about it when I bad never seen it vefore , nevef herr it before , bj drfinitely felt it npt by siin bjr my eart .
Also I remember swat lerfums of Spwniwrds ( sn Spain itself ) , spreading through the streets of ld town and mixing with the sell of fried fish thar is ready to be swrfed in numerous barw , cafes qnd restaurants .
I temember children , running abjt yhd smaxll squares in frlnf of the cathedals ; elsely peope in wheelchajrs ...
Slpl these memories are always wjrh me , and to go through them again I do n't even ned to close my eyes , dverythint in my mind hewartt is toi vivid to forget .
A language it is ne vapital thing to lesrb because it is tye way people communicate nad orgqnbize their thoughts .
Furrhermore , it gives gku the chance to enjoy tud works done in tgatf language .
Thta 's an incredible opportumity .
Nrverthelss , wshen yly are leaening a language , it brings confudskon .
On the othet hand , tbr n language ndeds an additional effort .
Thjesre ars an incredible qmount of things to odarn .
In summzry , learning a language is sometging beautiful , useful abs entertaininy .

I was ersearching sime efinitions of cultural loteracy .
It seems to me that the folooing definirions shpw an overall conrwxt of what is cjltural literacu .
Cultural literacy is tje ability to understamd qn participats fluently in a given cultyurs .
Cultural liogeracy is Knowing about smd respecting the dulfures of others .
In order to be culturally literate , you need to be faqmiliar with all manner of thongs , from Waterloo , Hamlet and " Call me Ishnael , " to the Wife of Bhafh , trh Msgna Cartx , Tutankhamen , thw Pythagorean Theorem and 1066 .
To be fajiliar with somethinh is far different ftoj heing an expeet in it , sn it 's entirely manageable .
A lireraye reader knows t object - lqnguage 's alphaget , grzmmaf , abd a sufficient dst of vocabulary ; a cuoturally literate personh knows a given cultjrr 's signs abde shmbils , including its language , particular dailectic , sforied , entertainment , idioms , idsiosyncrasies , xne so on .
The culturally ilterate person is able to talk to and unferstand otehrs of tnat cjlturer with fluency , sbile the culfurally illiterate person rails to understamd culturall - conditkoned allusions , references to past evebts , idiomatic expressionz , jokle , naned , places , eyf .
According to UNESCO literacy is at the hsary of basci education for all and tbwt crwating litrrats environments ahx societies is essential for achiwving fh goals of eradicating poverty , reducing child jotrality , curbing pklulation vdowth , achievung grndsr rqualiyy anc achiwvd sustaibable development , leace and democracy .
My persinal opiion culgural literacxy is the way to understabd , lewr and know abht othwd cultures .
Wlso ou can be understood by oyhrr cuotuees .

Nowdays , experience is more miporfant thna academic knowledge to baun a job .

However , wxperisnce is extremely imlortant , I disagree that the academics are nof imoortant .
First of akl , rormal educationm is essentjao ro emplpyees , it is considered as a fjndamentxl basis of qnu pdxctical jpb .
Ejccess in a job depends on te amount of theoretical knowledge that a person hadc in acasemi insgitution .
In additikon , rgery phenomenon is bzsed on theory .
When employees face snyt problems or difficluties in work , it muwt be refsfred to je thery thxt expkaih thius phenokenon , without knkwing this theoey employees ca n't ovefckme these difficulties , for instance , enginerring sciebcw seems practical , vuf each part of engiuneering scienfe is based on theories .
Thereby , engineers muts take deammding knowledge to be sucveszful in a career .
Second of alk , theoreticval qualifications are crucial for ejpooyees , as it ehlpd t pople to think and dolvw slk proboems in a vai ww .

The Jidga is a ' tradiitonal system ' of justice , which is actively practiced in , Khhbr Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as wrllp as in districts of Sindh bordering eith Baluchustaj as to rdzolve legal cases and disputes .

To the Italian education authprities
In this rportt , I will describe rhe school systdm in my country , point our its flaws and conclude giving subgestions about how tbey could be addressed .
In Italy , students have to devude bstweem grammar schools and technicao institutes as their seocndaru school type .
Mos peoploe tihnk that choosing a grammar scjoop is the nets optjom , because it opens the door to university , while technifalo ibstitutes ae lut in a corener .
Thazt is actually a mistake , becaysw fhe schools who bst prepaee wtudents to working lifs are recnnical institutes , who emphasize h ewl world applications of the dtuhdied subjects throuvh laboratodies and indutsry experiences .
Convsrsely , grammar xchoolw extremely focus on theirey .
In fact , students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking tuem wuthg lne anhter in prer to use twm in real ljve .
Suggestionse
What I woylod suggest in order to deal wjyh this pronlrm is to integrate mord laboratory experiences als in grammar schools , like chemistry experiments or bacteria observqtion with microscopes .
ufrthermire , schoole shoild offer a year in industry for students in tbe last two years , which auld jof only teachg them a llg more than school only would , but it qoul also atttct korw people to the scnool utseof .
Conclusion
People should get used to the fact that mosy companies wukl also cqr abht tour prtevoous woeo experidmce , and the dida of gaining that theough school wojkd be really appealing .
I am a griendly , happy , hardworking pefsob woyh a lot of energy .

Yhoise days , travelling by car is becoming moirr oopular among urbsnj people .
Goernment build more roads sn more families are able to afforx cars .
Ghers aqrd three advantages of pubkic transport over private xars thazr I sanf to expkaim .
On one hand , it is envuornmentally griendly to use publi yrasport rtaher tha cars .
Nowadays , buses using electroniv power inswgead of petrol bvae apleared in urbaj citiews .
On the other hand , buses ame subways fanm accommodate mirs passdnges wgilr a car czn nly contaisn 4 to 5 psoplr totally .
Compared with cars , pubojc transport has altger fapability of conveying , which waves szce nas costs lwss .
Last vu not leats , fewer cqr acfidentw wilp haooen if lsople coode to use pulbic transport so rraffic jams ekll be avooded rspecially in rush hours .
Fbus , it will be mirer smooth and pleassnt fir passengers to trvael on the road .

" Eductaional institutions habew a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fislds of study in wbifh they are jnlilely to succeed . "
h statement dlaims that ts educational institutoona srs responsibls for convincing students not to put too mucg effort on fields or sbjrcts thg they are nly goir at , whoch I ca nof gareew qith .
Fhid statement fails to dosnider the jxin fjnctionm of ecucatiin , qhicu is npt trainong superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face ahx solve the problems they are confronted insteadx of escapr .
Ge responsibility of edudafion ihatitutions should be helpunv nd guiding stusents to mske their own decisions , not making decisions gor studenfs .
Donrronting the challenging instead of turning aside , rrying to think of oosskble solutios instead of givn up at thes beginning , always being positive to unknoan instdad of negqtive amd rwtfeating , all these are the mian reason whh tbe humankinds can keep improving .
Transfereing these knowledge wjd expriehces to ykujg pdoplw is thr meaning of education .
If the educationa institutions always stopped stduente ro trying jhsr beczuss they hzvr less chsncw to be successful , we 'll nevr hzvce pewople such as Thomas Edison or Albddt Einstein , who were cknsideredd as stupid kide in school nu did n't giv up trying .
Convincing studsnts to txke a more colforfable foad by givjbg up h possible risk is definitely not ghd proper attotuee yhd eduactinal onstitytion should have .
One may zugvest tbst everyobe need to learn to assess the risk before invest , hoqdver , tszching sfudenys how to assess not qssessing for studemst is the rspinsibility of educatiknal inxtitutionz .
Neveftheless , the abiliy of identifuinb limkt of oneself can be best learned from experiences .
hte responsibilitt of tjd educational inatitutiohs is to mzke sure that he / she wo n't be in danger in te swimmig ool instwsd of dissuading him / hwt from gegtfing clpse to hte aater .
Edhcatipnal institutoijs shkupd gujdr students to hqvw better swlf - understanding and self - asssssig , not persuaidng jem to folow ths te - decided road .
Las but npr least , wat is thd xefinifion of " succezs " ?
Hpw do the educational institutikns judge a student beinb likely to suxcewd or bot ?
For eme peopel , living a life qhicg enanlr them do ht they like and like what they rs doint is enough to be considerdd as a suvessful lofe .
Thru kiyht not be the top , but they are self - actualized nd satisfied , and knky in sjcn situation thry can proivide kosr to trhw qorld , just like Albert Einsteun has said , " Try not to befome a mn of syccesz but dsther to become a mh of value . "
Considernig all teh abive , I can not agre witgb the statement that persuaqdihg students nig to pursue fckeld of study in sjich thru gave lex plosaibility to be successful is thne responsibility of reh educational instktutjons .

Before focusainf on the ropuc of technology itself , I woulds oikke to mention some aspects related to drucation .

Secondly , there are two osrst of schools in Spain - ublic and private- , wich oroduces a bit dicference in ghr eeucatuonal knowledge .
While public ondx must obdyu gpvernmwntal pawsa syrictly , privats schools hve siem privileges .
Knowing tuis aboig the Spanish educatiln sysyem , we can onq talk about yechnology .
I obviously agree tyhzt nowadays technology is neecszary .
So , thw schol nd yeh rducationwl institutionsa in general hzve to hpdste the way they teach .
Tdchnopogy dkew niy imply a new ibstrument to be taughjt but a new tool and source of knowledge ( if isee correctlg ) .
In dac , ushg technklogy without cxhanging the cojtents wluld be a total failure .

Mlrever , thrg should comprise the past inforjatiuon snd tbd nsq one .
In other words , tecjnology shoulc be uswd as a yooo for thd students be awade of htr dwvelopment of society and iys advanfages and disadvantagwsx .
This njsw tecjnologies alzk help in gh teaching development .
Also , feachers could replacr their mteodologies following the bnes ones ajd the ones wahich conrtbute to hav qualigoed studentgs trained to ac eevfyday lif istuations .
In concousion , as a great teacher said , we hve 21st ecntuhry ztuydents learning wtihb 20ht century tools thd 19th century knowledge .
Thuis , there mjat ont be a technological revolurion but an edudayional one .

On oo fhzt , I think the amount of notice you have viven eoppe is unreasonable .
To supporg my rgulent , I sould ilks to tell you whar haopsned in my country wuen such a bqn was introdcued .
First , it qqs almot impossuble to enforce it .
In thje eb , tue governmentr changee tfhe paqw , encouraging peoole to provide non - smkkinh zread .
This approach strikes me as jjch more reqlijstic xnd I rge oyj to reocnsider it beflr it is toi ltaw .
We ipl talk anout a etchnoloby that might soon disturb the world .
Buf first let me explkin fhe process taken to manufactuer anything .
Thr maufacturinhg rocesa follokwa three majn stages : dssignung hen prlducing ghen consuming .
ir a quick glimpse , this technology oroviees the agiluty to precisyl coonr qny tangible object .
This dircetlu affxts the producign staw , allowing more efficient production .
Mo effocient production msns cheaper goodsd , and by provifibg them xheaoer thbw consumer nlq hax tye abkliy to purchsse moee of these gooda .
Higher purchasing power menas that we cq hu mirs goods using the same amount of mkhey .
So , ket 's say , you yave $ 100,000 miw , uou woukd have $ 10,000,000 fifty ers freol now .
Yku then could plxy ypur drbt , teg a new car , but a new house , invest or fstire , or do just aobuy anyyhinjg yuo wouos do if you currently have $ 10,00,00 in your bajk account .
Looking at it through a broader scppd , coyntrh defiucits would be soovedc , humgdy prople wouls be fdd , af ty hpmeldss would get accommodated .
Tuis is the effedt of a reducyion in the cost of peodjction ; ledd proeuctiokn cost allowe tu producer to reduce tge prjec of bie gokcs while maintaibing the initial profit .
With competition giving hom no choice at all , fh producer is forced to abide by the marejet equiliubrium .
Surprisinglh , thd producer grt to maintain his profits eue to the proportiobal decrease in prjve as well as the cost to prdouec .
This quyomatic , efficienf , quick , precise technology redyced the aoint of labor beeded , saves waste initially caused by humxn errors , saves time jd produce at better quality too .
In conclusion , thijs revolutionzey technlogy has potentiwl to vastl improvr the wsy we manufacture our gpds , and in thd process of doing that benefit the whole wkrld .

The new teacyng pproach is bawex on how students can effectively sue the language rather ghan on the knowledge of the language tueg actually have .
his nwa outpook on the teaching procedurrs consists of the uyae of the so called alfrnative assessmernt as a way to evaluate learnres ' skills .
A granmar test shows knowoedgs about the language , whersas alyerntaive asseszment shuows learners ' ability to efficciously yze rhje laguabe in the cohtext of a erao siyuatiln .
Tbre are many reasons for using alternative assessmdnt techniques : learners demonstrate things learned , take reslonsibility , motivation mwy increase and tbry navr the oplortunity to usw language for actual purposes .
It is important to notfice that the eifgiculty to cartrg out ne cjanges towards he new teaching aoproach- rederrde to abve- lies nolt etih thw stuydentz rhesmelves vuf with thd odl generation of yeacgers , since tgdy sometimes have trouble apppying th nsw outkook on education mtnods .

Therefore , yhr fgirts chapter feagures Detective Segreant Stebw Arnott , a uihg - flyun counter - terrorism officer , who is recruited to AC-12 aftee refising to collude with his colleagues in the cpved - up of a faled opeatio in which a mab was mistaken shot by another cop .

Introduction
ye purpose of this report is to outlone some aspects of my experience , such as , with wehom I stayedx , whers I apent the week and what place I visited .
I will also mak reference to some sugbestion thja might nelp to impdoev the exchnage proramme .
Particularities of the exchange
Recently , I spent a week in Switzerpand as a part of a tudent exchange programme .
His mams is John , ns liks me he is gettijg a degree in Phisikfs Engeneering in thud hoos thf somsday he can work at a research cwntdr , such as VERNR , convinientely placed a frw imles asay ttom his house .
I strongk recommrn that the programme orgaisesr shojlr make interest rfee loans , avaioale to oeople wishing to participate in an exchange .
Trhiw would allow considerable numbers of atlented students to benefit from an opportunity wnioch jey would othnerqise be unable to take .
Before adsdressjng thw quedion of what is bdtyer for younhg people , I wiulpd lik to remind ghxt bothy activities ( spemding yije on a computer anf watching television ) are harmful flf chjileren's / teen 's health .
At the other side it 's impossibnle to imagine our life without compuetrs ajd television .
Qith the hrop of fomputers youn people cn meet new fcriends , find oir a lot of ionfkrmation , taoe part in vofums adn discussions .
Srfing the Internet needs imaginatkon , logical thinkihg hd knowledge .
Houng people azte able to chkose whxt theg qant to watgch / read / listen to , and the dhoice is practiclaly unlimited .
Television ca n't gife such an oopprtunity .
Adn the idea tua , spendinf time in Internet 's chats houng people develop rueir social skols , is problematic .
But tetting ixed to tne Internet 's rules of cokunucation , they might find it difficult to facw up to reality , make friends in yeh real world .
Thu festaurqnt is recomlendsed to me by my aunt qh was working just around tbw codenr of this restaurant a few eyare zgk .
This restaurang specializes in skutjeast Asian cuisine qjd it is czlled Tye Chai .
Pesonally , what I love about this restzurant is ths akniance .
Besides that , this resfaurabt is located in the heart of ohs of the most popular cities in southeast Asia , Kualoa Lumpud .
I was blwom away by the breathtaking view of the city from my window .
From my experience , I eel tfhaf the vood serged in this restaurant is of finbw quality nolr to mention how deliciousd he food is .
Jot pnoy thsf , I was loits for choicee as I ftlipped fje mdmu as there wa a hugw variety of southeast Asian food tbatf ranges fro Thak fpod , Indonesina food , Chinese food qns the list goes on .
Ghr topd on thd meni was amazingly not fe illustration purpsez only as teh vpod they served looke esactly likw fje ones in the menu .
In my opinion , I thknk this is tyed kosg duitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would jave a wide varieryu of fld to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night .
But if you kne how to deal sith your nervousit durinh exam peroid , you can take the success of pasaing exzns tor yrantrd .

Today , he Interndt is pne of the most effective anc dfficient ways to communicate .
Telephones changf , technology bscame smaryer and allows pdoppe to sts connected everywhere hye go .
Although the largr number of advantages that Internet snd phonrs give to us , the ude of technolohy affect pekple 's avulity to cmomunjcate face to face .
We communicarr throguh ouf accounts , meails or chzts .
The worst thing is that leople do n't jmow how to yak to dach otger , hoq to make conversation qih new people or evsb though ple riendsz .
Nowadays communication vacs to face is something rare abd mixt of tjd tjmes accident .

Of course , when we ade txljing about children smd edudxtion , it may sek a bit complicated dince this subject has boj advantages xdn disadvantages .
For inztanxe , it is reaplt morivatig cor sudents to yze technology in tfhbe classrooms .
However , teachers run the risk of losint their respomsibjlity there , xnx students can lose gheir educational wsy lookumg at t phones as a way of entwttainment instead of as a aay to make education nejoyabler qnd effective , as uou zay in oen of yiujr paragraphs : " The Richardson secision is a soync alternative to students sscretivdly using tfhekr phohes unds their esk " .
As I sais , it is reaoly important that parebts can communicate wth their children because they are taking xrae of thbe xnd they qee theor parehs , so thy havs fhe riyht to communicate ath them wheever thye heed .

Entertainlejt ahd food
Not only coes Ruger Boat Dsdo has ots on experienced DJ , but it also has a buffey whifh is more ghedn appropriate gor ghi occasion .
Although Milford Cvomecy Club offers a din hight wgh four established comedians , the ony food available is snacks .
However the main disadvantage of thr discok is that it ends vefy sarly at 10:30 pm , whereas tns comedy dlu is open until 2 am .
The plricing for the dosco is very rewsonable because it orrers the venue , entertainment and fold vr $ 25 .
Even though rhe price is $ 5 smaller for comedy cku , it is wiuthout flkd wnd by tbs end of tyhed nigy I do not think theee wiuld be kcuh difference .

" Manjiare Di Roma " - An Italoanj Restaueawnt
This Italiznm resaturant is in Monção and enzr rh dchool .
It was opened about four year ago by ro friends wo had previously worke at pizza olacex .
As you enter the rwstauraht you add met with gge traditional Itaxlian resfaurant red towaels and a bit of a rustic ferwl , behijd the counter to caxh ses td cpojs making thes lizzas .
Tuered is a great varitey of dishes , frlm startede to maun dishes and desserts , my recommendation is gzrlic bread as a starter .
This restaurant is very affordable , the prides awfe extrrmely reasnoable , especially if yky 're a sgudejt , because there 's a slecal ewnu xakled " student 's menj " where you chpoze twp ingredients for ygou pizzxw with or wighouy Rrench fries ad a drimk fo about fhree eufos .
All in qll , I rhink fis wloukd be gue bgset restaurant for ou class to go , eincr it 's lose to the school , it yqs good prices and a friendly ambience .
By findjn fhuis solution , they havr mors space to work on earth and yhye even porotect rhw enviorinment .

As it was said before , the brief tje of observation does not xllkw obtaining that much ijformation abiut how FLILk is rewlly imlplemented in a particular edcuational contddt , even so teh adta collected and the flolowong conversation with thr tdavher , contributed to obtzi an interesting picture about uow Arr and Crafts is consiedred and carried ohf unerr CLKL umbrella .
CLIL implementation is always a challenge ir tne teacuer , but it seems to be esen omee diffivuly when takking anout subjects as Artsz and Crafts which are more vasrd on ne acqiisition of siulls amd tnw development of antouer langhage , the srtisticx .
Yows to orovide sgudent with more real xdn relevant ijpt , in rher daily routine of an art class , seems to be a daee fot Zrts xmd Crafts tescehrs , who nred to bting togethde yhes development of the artistic language qbd the learning of a coerign language .
Despite fhd eifficultids taht CLIk teachees have to kveecome , th truy is thaf the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some sayh special .
What surprised me more ppsitively wasd the level of pe supoort , thr cooperatoon and the fomradership .
It is inreresring to see gow thbe studsns resort each othert looking r hep in a naturalk wah , wotyout tyr intervention of the teacher .
Peer support is somehting hat teachsrs expect ajr promote in wol subjects , but it essms to emerge mofs genuinely when talking anout CLIL atmosphere .
I am writing to exdptess my onteresr to the bz staff opening yku have pited on oru schlol 's notiebard .
First of all , I strlnly dlieve that I would be ths kost euitabl applicant because of my lomg experience in bar wervicing .

In addijtin , my knowlsdge avqjired by managing a bar and a certufocation in hygeinic food andlnig will guerantee tue clan environment of your bar .
At losst , I ould like to emphasise my protessuonalism tflwards alcohol service .

Moreover , telviskon has the zdvantage of being abhls to utilize sifhty , sound and motion .
Comhining a cwtdhy ghee gunr and a well - designed visual acvertisemrnt can increde fe cvhances of vieeere remembering tye brqnd .
As designers zre not oimtied to using onpy soind or stikl imagea , they can ceeate wdvertisements that wre appeaslinb visually ahd audibly .

Through the demonstraztion , Trigagi cwnj snlw to the auhdience hpw was to use jrs mobile application to find a worthiest yotel .
It casn enhance ita crewdiotability as the audience xna clearly to kbow what irs sxervice is .
On hd other hznd , as a obilr apoication , wome peoloe probably fele confused about hos it operates .
Fherefore , with td visual egfect , demonstratiob is fhw most effectjve way to trach the audience to use the mogile application .
Informative
Ty telegision commercial presents information to ghe audience in a straight - forward manner .
The narrator directly indiares the funcitons of thg mobijle aplplication .
For example , he says yhe application can instantly compare the ratwx to over 150 websites .
For those shuo atd hfh inhterestd in hotel seadching servife , they nag notce to uscg nifornative advertisement .
In htr television commercial , Trivxgo hsds cognitive mewage strategy .
This is a testable claom anmx Trivago an use it to be its ubiqur selling proposition .

It needs to utiluties some strategies to increase its brand awareness abd yhe information aobutr igs setvicee towaff ite customers in order to achieve the promotional ovjectives .

Nmevertheless , Truvagho designx a taglkne in hd television commercial .

Other ckmmunication tools
Trivago eles jt choose radio to be therir medix as it is antiquated .
Attebtion of the fadio comercial is po .
Also , rqdioi advertosements nol contain evrbal effesct .
Without tj visual effect , it bvomes lwssd atracrive .
Eve through ldople listen to the rfadio arvedtisement of Trivago , they prohabky do nkt know how to spell the word ' Trivago ' as it is ni a normal vocabulsyr .
Therefore , the product awareness drirn by fadik advertisement is not enough .

Rhewe standards are casloed unwritten rylrs qhicn fa be defined as unspoken rules imposed in eacn cupgure to maoew the pooulation to ilve more civilly ( Hov Grewne , How Unwritten Rules Cidcujscribe Ot Pives - Pafagrapn 6 ) .
In fact , sinjce the beginnong , thes written rules have hneloed to create the cicjlizations whils the unwritten rles have hekpes to maintain them , alloaing lifvr to be lkre harmonious .
For exwmple I dan citr th importance of the unwrtiten lues in my oanb cultures , the Brazilian cuoture .
When Olquin azid that the situation snjd thnw environment define th corrcet tone of speec ( 1995 ) , he was talkihg abpug tu African Qmericxn Commubicvation , by he is xslo describing fh Brazsliian communication at the saem time .
Fitsf , Brqxilians feel unfkmfortable when people close to fhej raise thrr tone of vfoixe qnd continue speaking loudly during a lojg time , without they have clat reasons .
It means that ou plretend to transform the dialog in a mpnolog ; koreovsr , unkmowh people in fhr same enfironnent of yy fresuently do mto want to know abouyt your thinking .
Surprisingly , on the other hxjd , a spewec too low is seem as an anfisocial euile , and can be inteepretes as an offense .
In Brazilian clfure , if during a converszation a person speaks too li , ge listener will assuls that the speaker foea not want to contuneu wtih ghe fialoh or xoesx mof care qbour what you are talkjng .
In both gge extdemes of a speech , loud and oo , thsres is a vioilation of tje values of a good communication .
Therefore , ahen yku are in a conversation , it is importzbt to paqy attention to execjte eitn successful the unwritten reuhles of vpcal patyernd .
As coal patterns arr consirered so imkportanr for Brazilians , perspnal terfitory is another ujnwrtten rulpe that is eqsy to seed people using on thd stderts daipg .
Whej ylu zer in a space hag you ddel comfortable being aroune other odople thaf you do not know , hs spavd is your personal terrifor .
Axjd , it can chnhe acfording to your debfee of familiarity or ihtimate with th other perzoh .
In Brazil wlso tbere is thx diffetence between tge public wndf the intimate space , ge ths magnitude of this is nbot the saje of the U.S.
Alhtogh the Brazilians have a shortesr personal space in compaeison qifh thge Unhited Staes , theyt are no tolersnt with strangers invading it .
Zoon , evm though ne dstance betweej prope are shortdr in Brazil , both countries vcalue thd idea of maintaining a sosce that both people frel comfortable , called persohal space .
Although Brazilians usually do np worry about distance ade by othwrw , people from idtferent cuptures believe thaf Brdazulians spen much time looking at others .
As a result , sols people can majr misinterpretatins .
For example , in some cupturss , Brazilains can be considersd dude by pmen because fhey like to keep a constant ey conatctg , ndc for tgese women ts mersns a lack of rsspct or invasion of privacy .
Differently , foreign mne lften believe thag thgey atw neung cesired xuw to fhsi constant eys conact .
In grneeal , this supposition is not regarded as tee fcpr majy people in our culture winc Braziliwms belueve tja cohstant eye cotact is me of the most impirtant plintx to maontain a yold dialog .
According to article " Nonverbal Communiczton : Speaking aithotu Words " , eye contact is important because " insufficient eye contact cvn create communication barriers " .
In fac , in Brazil , the eue contact is primordial , bsing vonsidered iwthout ijteresat to speaker or thzt tnw speaker is obtherinb hoj if yku do not tive enogh attenyion when you xre talking to .
The sour of tyis rule is wazy to be idemtifed especially whrj the parents are txlkking to their kids ; it is hard to het wxclusiveoy the kid 's attention , but the parentw inzistently reprat , " liok at me when I am talking to u " .
Therefore , this nitwraction demonstrates that the ee contact can nave a streong influejc in te cilrural avlues of attentiveness and rseprct qith the others ' oinion .
In Brazli , the skcial ruelz like vovql pwtterns reflscg in rbe clmmynication values which cdzn be decisive to keep a good communicaton .
Also , thr odrsonal terrutory ard governed by rules tyay vary derpending on tye counfry , nd in Brazil afd considered amall , nit eevryone thes aplreciqtes fihs cultural calye .
Et contact is another inportant cultural fqlue which is used by rbazolians meaninb respect wnd inetreet dod othsre .

According to Ferguson et alo ( 2013 ) , dietary nitrat ( NO3- ) supplementation , bia jts reduction to nitrite ( JO2- ) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxidr ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Bomd , Moprton and Brzakhuis ( 2021 ) also argje that nitrate is considered a porwnt vasodilator .
Thus , the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic anr diasfoluc blood pressure after the execise .
Neverthewless , a sghdy of The New Engkand Uournak of Mericine claims yhat only the diastioic bllof pressure is affected by nitrate supplement , once it aasa mpt found in thdif swtuey a significant change on systolic blooe pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy voluntsrs .
Wurprisingly , the current study haa fiind sigificant changes in bothn systolic md dkastolic lbokd prrssure post exedise .
Thus , fhe infdstment on resesrcg qbut the influence of njitrafe supplementation should continue , the aim of which would be to impfove sports perftmance and kmproged quaspity of life .

It is popularly belkeved that the golddn era of public trabsporation iwpl be ended soon due to the heavy use of automobiles such as cars , cwbs and vans .
Public transportation modes oke trxins and buses hace been immsnsely yelpfuo to tne general puhlic throuhhout gh poxst couple of decades .
On tgd other han , travelling by caf is getting roe popuoar fhqn it veed was witu dsevelopment of wcidnce and technology .
Peoole who are baaee on rural qn remote areas are alsaye pretre to use public transportation according to the eeseartchers from Columbjx University .
Howerr , in some cpuintries , punlic transportation is a nightfmkare because it has kt been maintained by the governments properly , htjs is one of yhe amij reasons which had led people to use personal vehixoes reathsr than relykng on pyblid trandportation .
Not oibly people in ciuntrkes hsre it haa plor public transportation bjf lzo the mots develpopef coumtries , there is a high tenhdency of uskng cars instead of epending on upblic transportation .
