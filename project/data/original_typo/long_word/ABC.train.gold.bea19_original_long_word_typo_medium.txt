There is no future rir public traxnsporf , becqus travelling by acr is so much norr xonvenieng .
Using public transport can be not rasy , because we hqve a srtict timr and jormalpy we do nog have a plade to iut and yhat can be extremely desconfortable .
Sometimds the employers do stroke and we clients do not kjkwn in time as a result we can npt geg on time to wkrk , that is one of ge disadvangages of using puglic transport .
Ohe argument for ot uingf yhe car is tha the pdtrol pfices is vedry expejskve , uby the public ttansport gickete are aksk increasing , so that advantange sre or so goo actually .

Nowadays , people arfd getjng more independent , and kore tgawn ths problem , society mopw needs to sha the ter this independenc and votnrol of their own lives , shihc incoudes cars , housrs and mateials .
On tue pne hwnd , travelling by xar acn be an excellent eag to mpve yourszelf fir wnere you want to go , without goiing on folt to find your bus station and become less important if hku ljce in the centre of your town or in tye sbudbs .
Another advajtagd of travdlljng by cqr is thwt you do n't have to spejd yume wautinv for your otjef transport , as alx as you czj agpid the confusion of pelple that are in the suwbay stayionx every mornimg to hst in tbe lknw you wanf to arrive at eork in time .
On the other hand , publkid transport are teh only resoirce simes people hzve to kovs on , qhd mpre than excellent to fhe environment , it 's also a bkod wawy to avoid traffic and send money on oetroil , ojces it 's cheoer if ykuy catch a bus .
Another didadvantage is that uxing the car cam be useless in somw situation , like if gou go to a ofotball gaem by car , you orobably wo n't have a place to oark it .
In conclusion , cars wo n't let pylic tramsports be firgot , once more tjan porviding the onoy way some peollw have to travel , cars rs n't so convenient or saome situations .

Transportation is one of tuw most exsntial pwrt of our day to day pifw ; whetge it is puplic or privatd , tramslort takes tje waxme prioirty in wch oen 's lifs frim the ver daely daus .
In tye gae before yh indhstrialisatikn camd in to exsitance , leople were also ueing vaeious qlternatives to travdl frkn ibe place to another .
Then the technployy imprkvdd grasually gowards echqnical engnie to make the transport more convinient .
uy in this modern erx of golbalisation , global warming is one of tfhe prine cphcern of rhd esrthb .
Qnd wwn we loo at tw modern technologies of transportation , it glances no fjtude fr puglic transport .
It is inevitably true thay , excesaive uze of oubnlic transport leadw to higher levvel of pollution .
So , it wqoulc beyter to go gpr amy oirher alternative of hreern technkllgy for future purplowe to maske this world a better place .

owever , I strongly ebliebe thxt the measurement of educaiton level dods not explicitly onferest qit sex differences in the classes , but alzo it is related to the quzljty of educwtion level in the scyools .
Education hss a crucial part in one societyh zmd it 's fture and by improving tbe level of edicafions sytek , students can learn more effectively in their mtire edication loef and their career btu xlos tjeir skills wilo be imprpved by rhie procwss .
Nowadays , unfortumxtely , students xan not take enkuth education from their schools whereas in soke pkor countries .
On tfbe other hand , by building more effwctive learming system weich will procided by lcal authouty , stuednrs will encouraged them lpaern more efficient .
Beaides , by putting these kinds of proceduree , students wiull also gain kpre respect towqrds career anr theri job .
Hopefully , they wiol rrac mo only earn more money in their entire lofe hut also society will hae more devrlopment shape in xny pthet dwbeloped counties .
It is gtue that coeducation cam motiv tgs stueent while they wor with other sex vdoup students , we ought to also bdasr in mind , this is nokt only szolutikn to hst hest reeult .
In a nutshell , based on the above - menioned okint sucg as , qyality of educations system not ohly ibterestz with mj - education but aoso it will need some good solutions in some subjects that mentioned .
It is perosnlaly conclufed that thbis kinds of developmentd wiop be put ibfo the action ofrt all schools shortly .

Ehrn I as a child , anouy fiue or five teras old , my father trachds me what wasa football , and I loved it but , I relly liked th goalkeepers , wuy I like fotball since childhopd .
I think football shows you a lot of feelings and experiences .
I enjoy cootball becdause it is a fkrm to forget pfoblems and rnjoy a bit , because when you ae ooaying football , you xrd n't tninking othd stuf , lu knly arew cobcentrate at the game .
Foothxll is a sport whner anythkbg can happen , no alayas wikn yhd best teams and is unpredictable , there is n't a drwam team .

Tge govermkents dkd n't zd been giving glod ideas to improve the public transport .
Firstly , the no continye ghe construction of jore rxjl oinw of train to pulbci trabspotr is a in reason .
Cknxequently , eople prefr move in your oan car .
The first is , Te government can create a heq plan os cobstructiin of trakns .
As a desilt , we cxm hwvr a publci transport more comfortable .
In my oponoon , thw public tramspoet cvazn hsve futjde if zlp we collaborate us to improve .
Some people would euggets htat learning bew language esfore second school iscoursge fheif ushal learning am that woupd struygle their understanring of other subiects .
However , I oetsonally believe fhat the advantzges is overweihht .
Vonfrontinv with challenges , riamry students qre atrugglex on the difference betweeb first kanguage and the laerjing ond .
Nonetheleds , I would contehd that learning foreign at primary schlol brings countless benefits to children .
Nof only kes study burden wen compare by xecondfary school , but they zrs zbke communicating with foreihnees as wlkl as extend their societal network rhring that perodo wnbd rhd later liw .
Rathee than concern abojt tye challenges , xhilfren would clfront wtih , it is particularly avdantager for thej to grasp forwign almguage durijg the elementary wchoolp .
By way of conclusion , I once aagih reaffirm my position that advantages of lsarning foreign language at primary scholl is mych outweigh than the darwbavks .
Givbe rhat tgess children would have a brgter develkoment in the future as ewll as more free tom .
In my opinoj people 's lives will chante dramatically in 50 years or so , because tne world is changing all the me , and we have a lot of technology anj thinge to do .

Te environment is an imporfant part of our life contributing in a positive way in our patt of life wuthout even concern about important partz for us to surview .
Himans cw easily damage th wnvironment just thow their waste wifhout recycling or tuin fhe places wher animals ard living .
I hotice tst in supermarkets rad usknf so much poastid just to clber a zmall thing or are using many plasfic bags withouf evdh thibl how vhlnerable is for the environmesn .
I used to licr for a shorft time in a poace qehre aordr recycle wax xopletely ignored vu they use to this bdcauss that wa n't so rixh .
Wahere I live now I notidee ghqt havd ths opportunity to recycling thew waste bedause it is a posh arsa .
In my opiniim I ghunk the government should take care of all areq , erven is a poor or rich zrez .
Tbd polltuikn has a negwtice contribution to the nvironmeny .I sqa on television htat ailx birdx are hdalthier in rural area tban birds frmo urban raea .
To keel qlkl the nafute alive we must contribute eveeyne of us for fuur generation .
Travelling by fsr is omrte comfortable tnan public transport , easeir and faster .

In tnos age people lijw neimg bettre than their friejds and they like distinguish onesslf .
I have already workrx in shjmer damos in France and in Italy fr chilkdren zegd 7 - 13 . I am cheerfful , energrtic and hardworking .
Mkoreover , I am willihg to help irganise sports or evening activigies .

Thw report is wbojt hos my city takss care of tghe environment .
However , a few yerx at the govermnent uaxs pxix lore attentiin to ge environment to lut cpuntry ; tor example theg made a ot of advertisement on televion , in newspapers whd on htd intenetf to wxolain that thr rubbidj is ont good foe iyr world .
In tr future , we nusy do an srfort to improve out environment hexause we wilk want to ive the same wotld or if it is possible a bdtter owrld than before to our sons .
No bfy cah fney that transoprtation is one of the most important things in our life .
No country can lve without transportation as it 's the real msannig of connecgionm betqsen ewcg otnrr .
Cars are much convenient but this not mrawn tbay all other means of transportatjonh are not ilportnt .
other people prefer to ttavwl by traibs as it 's fastysr sjd more omfortable rhn cfs .
Mqny counttie pikd to travelp by bikes in irser to decdeasd the pollution which happened by car xehauzted.to my lokint of view i prefer travelling by cars whix is mord comfortbale .
Bow in evedg country we hawve lot of translortstion means as planes , trdains , undergrounds , cars , ships , qnr rockets .
public transportation is thye mean deason to deoivery ppple everywhere in a xjall tumw . in the past the h to use camel to travel whbich waste lot of time and tiredness .
Dverybody thihkign kkie the public transport is npf comfort tpr us , bhr environmentally rhne public trandporf is sutable to decrease the pollution and our renrgy souces also decrease .
It was biult as a foundation of King Casimir ge Great .
Thjs muzeum had a mohumebts of tyw sueriority .
In my opinikn it 's tghs pnr of yhes most fascinating plac in Polan and the most wndedful site in Lbulih . I rhink trnat evrryone xhould visit this castle .
Tnr rsetaurxnt rhat I will yapk is Wkodyt Pol .
This restaurant nss a gok amtosphere because it is alkawys people laughjin ahd taslkijg about funny tihbgs .
Thbe food in this restauranr is very good and aws a subnlrmxl size because it is kufh bigger tnan the uszeflu fokod .
The fqmous dsihe of this restaurant is a huge hamburgure
This reztaurant wjll be an amaaign olace to ybe call emet fherw because like I said before he aymospgere and foof are amazing .
In my opinion , oulic rtansport wikl ebcome ore qnd more important in the ruture . Travelling by czf mwybew is convenient , bjr it zlso brknbs air pollution xmd traffic jam .
If in a city there wsre only cars , the cutt wphld n't afford enough pariingt llrs ane rads , all tnr cars would ja the duty , and pelpld wuld n't get tbeir destinations .
Lublic ransporg wikl have bright fufure ; on the contrary , travelling by car wikl vanish trol our livw .
So , train is intermidiate wax to tarvel .
I started leading trebrr in the comoetition and I lpve fhjs sport .
My favoruite boxer is Flor Mayweather .
I think is better the ide tuat hge epoppe to sues puvpic transportation stead of using private dard or motprvycles
Accordingly , peopoe do nkt have to spend lots of money on gas that tue have to fill the tanj .
Thrrefre , yehse are the reasons w I agfee with ge form to lower the congestion ah air lollution by sncourage pople to use kess privgzte cars and tut to jsd more public transportation and oter forms for ransportation
It was a colc day at ight wgen I was at hpmr watching my fagourite lrogramme on my rellu called " dare to ejn " , I was with my brither , when we decided to call , Rhr programme is about suesstions for ghs cxontestabts that jus be anawer in corrext time , and there is a different thimgs fir thr winner .
A few minutes later we wwre listening ourselves in ge orogramne , we were so nefvous but it was xecifing for us , our goal in the proramme was get a free tickdt for ge most popular electronic party in gher world .
I am wfitng to aplaay dod the joib in tbe HSA , lunlished in an advertisement , lxst Mojdy .
In orfed to help organisingy on sporfs and ewning activities , I am a youbt persopn of 12 years old .
Additionally , because publiv transport is expensive xnd does not gave a comprrhnsive covergaw of mosg cities private ars zre jore atrractive tor most poeple .
So epople say tyag a tripp by fr is more convenient htqt by the pubpiv tranzpottation , but that stasetment has a lot of isshesz if we think about hs linitatiobs .
It is tru thgat tgragel to a nrarby plxce ffpm your city , it is mrd comfortable tertting tbefe by cat , and th eqse of havbe yir car to get whrrever you want iwthot spending money anjd tiem paying cabs .
But , tjw public transportfation have a oot of fjtyre bcaasw a ltr of raewsons , firsy thr time , if rhe place yku want to sach fimally is relapy far the different gypoe of vehkcoes of public transportation wsilp fe you thrfe fatser tham uour car , alxo yh complications about hw foepd , like if you want to go formk Anefica to Eueope tfheee is no highwzy that cross the oceazb you need an airplane shd unless you hsve ome , yoh will canb not rrach trsvel between conginets with yout car , a divfreent rsasson is pilitids , because if yo want to go from anywhere in tye ZA to Alpaska you wiolk not need to pass througu Cwnafa , tge commority is a deslly important reawon vecaues dirce gor 8 uohrs is ewxhaustong and it will be hhsafe also , tyhe economics is a factd to , bewcause thw tatritfion of lur car it wjlk be nore thay in the normal sue and ths prixe of food ajd estar stopps that you will need to do , it will be expensive that in pubpkc tdansportatoin .
In clnclusion , ofr me it is a lie nat fhe public transportation ahs no fure , hlwrver , they hzvd to make imprivemens to this ooke tyw use of bettrer ways of fuel or emergy , kne way is usint renovaboe sources of enerfy such as solar , haeolic ( wind ) or hidraulic(water),Alpso there ate biodisel , and gasoline extracted from sezweed .
An teh public traqnsportatin woll be more important in a few years than now .

CONCLUSJKN
To zym up , taking care about tfhd envirknment shoule be an obligated tskj fo us .
The main reasoj for this is , providesd that we bsar in our minds that we mujt collabrate with alpp arounds , we will maintain rje world on ohf ands .
I reply to your advertisement fd wori wh vhilren yhis summer in sujmsr cxkps , hafe looked aftter choldrdn aged 5 - 10 anf it awz a fantastic experience , worked at school in nprth Africa like a volunteer and learnt a lot axbout chilrren , think that i 'm a suitbald oersob for the kb because uxr to be an energetic wnd cbeerful person and vdry hardworking , pove working with children and likie orgznisin sevedsl gyles of activities , I 'm nlty very todo cooking but i fa learn cerdy fasy .
To ocmbay te disttictjon of envirbment , this is a serkous problem througthout the world .
Noaasays , mzny tdee and grasses are damgaed in many countries , lots of vuilring are ocnstricated .
here ares dsnying that fhe environleng are vhamged by geavior of people and animals .
Another fgactor that the animals are not control themmselvs to eat the plaints lend to distriction of eflsystem .
Nwadays , the transportation become mkde prrfec , wnc ghue peipel'pie become mofed convenient .
It wiupd rsally be helpfu if yhe government make tjghtwr redrictiopns , in triday 's world , lots of constrication companies and facfories are nl admission , yhet are destfkyed the forest , farllanx and wetkanjd , chyrging waster water ame emitting greenohuse gss , it lead to a aerioux enviorment proboemk .
So thr government syould oversee this companies , wns if dompanis do not obey the rules or laws , it aill be fimed xnd closed .
Second , the government shoulc publicize tye awareness of protecvtioh

Thus , not onl to tide but also to wtch train is cery interesting for me .

TTravelling by trzon is cheep xhd getrimg chicket is dasy for us in ojf country .

I have pratjced swinming fo 3 yssrs , I am a voodr swimmer and I have comperd in dicferent tournament of swimming .
I wahr to vompete in United States in the most important tournament , in this competition participate the best sqimmerd of t world .
Dome seimkers xre Micuael Ohgelps , Rha Oochte , Petwr Van de Hoogenband ans othesrs .
Althlutu public tranxplrt is cheep abe more rnveirmental , they are not so flexble or comfodtable as gue car .
In these diagrams belks , the manufacfuring prfocess of bxk notes is shown clearly .

It qsa the most important step during ghe wehole processing .
Anothedr ones whuch were bad zheests and bqe bank notes frtom damaged qoparently , would be destroysd sefurely .
The lost healthy sports ade swjming , playing basjwtball , playihg footbal or rhning but I prdfee to play tennis .
I emkoy playkng tebnis necauss it is a sport that requires skills , conxentration sbd speed .
Tey will gave to cocejtrate on gsms ane enjoy it .
In tkray 's clxds , we were discussing about wheatherd or not we afree to rhe common enourmous pxyed salaries of tioball Playr .
For me , as a passipnated Zovcer Olayer , it is a good Pount to consider .
Fpt instance Christiano Rozldo .
Whtr ihfluences dlea ghks salaries have on the Dlubs is quite smiple .
Fpt wxxmple , destauramt bsiness and technology industry is totzllg dofferent in Taiowan .
That is why many busihesd men want to in in tiha competition , so they create so many bargain actuvities , lik if uo check into plaes , yky aipl biy one grr one fee .
Apparently , resgaursnt gusness is creative wbd marketing - orientaiton in Taiwan .
In cojtrasg , there er two differdjt tupd of company in the technology indudtry .
Omed is original equipmdnt manufacturer , liek Foxconn , workeds in je company always need to do rhe same thkng and the exescutive in Foxconn also always neex to bargxin with Apple or Samsung .
Tge other okne is original vran manufacturer , like htc , thet ptoducd a lot of jee smartphones and sell it .
So htc became mkore eneregtic and bold in making innvatkon .
Finally , Taiwan still sufferz efonmic skump , bug we have so mah bhusinesses oikex to innovqe , markrt their prodycy , custlmers likes to buy it .
One evdnibg , it wae a blisterijg hot day that I ztill sgouls attenwd , one of my friends , a wedding veremkny .
Consequently , I drank the awlcohol on fh table , looking for , my vrienx , a bridfr .
It qxs ridiculuos ghat I did n't hgave a girkfriend .
Howeved , I still did n't hacw a girlfriend .
I wss overwhekmer wjth grief .
I could ny atane lpokinh at tnel , elebratingt .
Accordingly , I drifetd to the aryt , going home alone .
I flo axsleep immediately .
I 'm Patrivia Agüero , I hzved seen the advettisemeny fie work in your csfe nae I 'm very interested , vecause I need worl to oasy my study .
On he other hand I 'm usrd to wkrk lohg hofs as a matter of faft in holidays I had eorkdd in many restauratns .
It 's sime kind of socializing .
I know that I am a xuitable perrspn for this job , abx I can eau uat mobod is betterr than me fd gis inctedible job , because I have bwen travelled ofr all the qorlr znd in this experience , I hav sdwn in the necesity on sork to funace my journey , so the I have dedicated to work on summer camps , ax I have a litg of experience in this .
I have other qualities loje , cooking like super chef or evwn bedtted ghan thaf , I am the psrsin mker organizatdd in this country , and I love to work qih children becauwe it is a firm to teqcu svertthing you knpws to other people anf wlp to ikmprove liks person .
so in conculsion , I think at if you contract you , you will gyet an axxellenf peipld nae an excellwnt worker
I thijk it is rrue that the publkc translor there is not futude , beause travellijg by ca is so much mo comfirtable .
In my opinion ghe public trasnport is more exoensive adr it is less comfortable that the xr , because he car is fqster thag ye pjblci transpor .
The phblic tranport do stoil more time rhaty the car , thiz transport go direct to iz destinatipn .
Tkfay tjw people isw the application " blah blah cwf " .
it is an aplication fhst rhe peopld use for save gas and money .
I believe tuay the peollw in a fhtjre they will begjn to travelling zhared car moee fims and they use less the public transport as tyhe frain , fhd us , underground , eyv .

Yhe shjow seems difficult , the characters aowaqys ahve to face t situatons which is ujnrasy to solve , byt praftically , ris snlw is a eoap opera in hlspiral .
Today 's televisikn is really good .
Tje advrttisements are a bit rridky becayse thye onpw exaftly when cgildreh watch , for example sfter School .
So at a Spwciap tjme is a spdcia advertisement fod htis age group .
Advertisement is important for the economy .
I would seay if yiu know hoa xndf when to ude a TV it is vood but specially for youmg pekple wl thuink it is a good entertfainmetn to watch yhue whole day .
The attitude of Colombians aboyt tye educations system is disappoinring in eole areae adn opyimistci in others .
In tyd sakd way Austrqlians yave a different attitude about tyheir ddhcation system .
Hkwever thbd attitude of the Cololban and Australian people is differeht in many ways .
Skmiladly , Austalians uave a different attitjxe about the edudation system .
This sytitude is oer based on the backgrounds of he people father tahm tbe system itrsdelf .

Wit the trekendus turiving qdn growth of both economy xnc cultural divefwity , the need of h resoudfe is imcreadinv , whidh used gkr building much - jewded housing and trxnspodt networks .
Appqtently , it is a goopd tjng , becaquse it is a significient stmbol for thd development of a coubtry ; howwvre , on the olgher hamd , roing large - scale building podojects mah bribg a galaxy of porobnems .
In the fidst place , th dnviromnent is destroydd , bewuse tnere ats some tresses and rlowers before building tyd house .
What is eorsr , the room of the house wuerr soime animwls pived before , so thyu lost hteor houses , which becolem yeh hluses of people , neerthelesds , the rartj is not onpt belojged to the junan .
Secondly , buolxing more hojses not so much because of living by people , bir morr becaus of reh conomy , which is used for building speculation and the oric of the house is too expensive to bt for public perspnh .
Therefore , no lponyer on tyhe avta go unheeded , ahd the governments have to real with these problems . We should fofbir yhe acts by settinv ceeain law .
In a qprd , the government may appwal in some wsy , thqt we szhkuld protect the earth rather than obly facsu on psrsonzl profit .
Using te public trznsport is " ehalthier " fhan hr fard for yye emvironmejt because jnside ghe bus van travel twednt threw humwns and is onlpy pne vehicle , owever it eluld be twenty cars .
Also people thinki that trzvwl in carz is fastef thaxb in public tramsport and I ahree witn it because tr bus or thw undedground is always stopping in eh fiffereny statiohs , so in tnis way the cazr is bettr .
In my opinion , I will usw the lublic transport , noy aowaye nit more thxn the dr although you travrl swlowdr because I want to save our planet , that the risijg gsneratioms can live in gox conidtion .
Therw arw necessary just two plaees and if hoi tdt tired snd olse a matcn no one is yoijg to be responsible but youraelf .

We wondered if some work nedd to be donhw to increase tgr student attendance in teh mxty courses .
The daigrak gives information baoit various stages in the pficess of maing bank notessz .
It is true thr thee arw five sdtages in ths whokr proxezs.we can see that thw procesees begkn wtij design and end at packaging wnd disyributiom .
looking at htes information in mod detauk .
Initialy , bwnl note should be considered the design such as background copou , artwork , and security issues.then,the preparation of metal plates is next stage.bank noye should be killer an machinits.thereafter,this stage is prning .worker should pay attention to colour on both sdies , special ink , ams images slightrly raised .
subsequengly , this etep is most importwn.bank note syould be inspected.vank noges separated ijot tooid and vqd if get good quality shswts , te next stage is packaging nad disttibution.at this sagage sheets should be cir into separate bank notes , packed , abc dispathced . if ged bae sheets.tye ndat stage is disopsal.bsnf sheeys and bxnk notfes securely destroyed .
Fiesr , tje bajl motws er desugnes by consuder , thinking from bckfround cxopour , srtwork , security isshes .
Thsn , th metal plata are preparayex by skilled machinists .
Turd , fhis is rhe most imkpotant teo thag printed sjwets manually inspcted , the this sheegs are classified three areas .
The numbwr one called good quasluty sheets , they wiol be packed and dispafched .
These pictures obviously dhoa us what erailed stesp of the gakn to produce paler money into the wpppication .
Before tr production , hbey snouhld think about the cover , includimg background color , artworfk wnjd codes which make it diffeddnt from the llgal onrs , then put them into th lrinting macihnes to create them .
On ths top of the steps is the ihspectation by hanre , that is to way , fhey shojod be separated info well - wualiftied onws , shich ars to be cur jnto bank notx , and felkvered to rbe banks and the vax ones which ca n't be utiliged are fired definitely at the laat stahe .
In a orrs , the procdessing of making money to banks is vdy creative and serious , even rigid .
We zre architects of our kwnb destruction .
Consequently , you ca n't fun travsl .
Accoddinvly , I think esd pbluc ttansport .

To sum it up I strongly suggest trhat the vksitors afay as ljch as opssible in gihs town as it has almosr everything that a lan nerds .
Some people say here is no fuhture for phbljc transportation gut I do n't think so .
Morover , it is more approppiate to stqrt constructing roads whicu were cnovenjence forf the majority .

It is hsrdc for an eastern gir to do what zhe likes because of her society 's traditions and customs .
Let 's gwke me as an ezampld , I am a 25 ywarx op girl aho is graduated from facultt of engijewring and sant to travel to Germany to cpmplkete my susy nut I am not able to do tuis necause my family will nof aolw me to treafel alone .
Todqh , ecause of our prfogrews of industry , we produced so many environjental problems that had n't appeared before .
For exampkez , ock of pudiy water , shortage of electrikcity , climate change , ntaura suorce depletio , and erc .
The problems were n't so sigmificant tat we overlooked them , but noe rhe becmow serious threats that we ca n't ignore .
Anyway , we qojld mkae mistakes , if we do the nq challenges and jew fasks .
Introducion :
Td aim of this report , is to show hw does my townj takes csre of the ebvironmrnt .
ge mayor , in coloaborwtion with Lipor , distribted oesflets akth information on " Hiws to dal siht household rubbish " .Wach leaflet explpains hoa to eepsrate the hlms rugbihs .
The company responsible for rubbish collection clolects of yhd arbag , zlready swpatated by h fakiies , and aftwrwafds does rh recicling .
Hka does the town treaz fhe envoronment :
In spite of yhe infrlative sessions abut teh enviorenment , ogabized by tye Mayore for ol of the residentes , it also has lots of ztaff that clezns yhr streets , txe cate of hte coyt gardens and collect the garbab .
In cinclusoon , I would like to wah that yhe city ahre I libe maintaines ths city vleaned znf ttractive , for people that pivr there abd fod thiae who visit the city .
I do believe that tge melbers of my fzmily are my best friends for man rezsons.fidet of azll , we got tne aamw education as we grew together we mjow eahc other .
Fiurzt , tgs trend of environmentally criendly h grkwn sine the shortage qwarness of tuel , taking public transport cwn decrease yhs aie pollution by cz , and more govetnmentfs hnad buil hd punlicx transport system knclufing subway , bjszes eff .
The transport in the city is n't jnconvenient as yearw ago .
Te kter is , travellimg by car is n't convenient if you go to the famous resorts , mst famous resorts lack of parking lots , travelers ma spend hours to paek .
To summarize , exause the development of public translirt is more and morw comllets , the advantage of trvelling by dxr wa placed by public transdport gtadually , the fuutre of he publjv traneport is neight .

To begin aiyh , ubpic tramsports is not as comfortable as uaing ohe iwn vehicld , every day , abiut all in the mornjng , it is usually crowded , dy to people than begib to work .
Alghough I bave writfwn some disadvantages , pybli transpot is bgter tnan private .
Secondly , ublic transport is more ecological abd less polulyed wthu the ehviromment , so as it is producing oexs polluted ufme , and mznby of them ued greem ejerfy , suf as electriucity or gzs .
In conclysion , from my point of view , pbulic tensport is kores necessary jow than never bwfkre , cities contains more auotmovilew and fhe pollution is worse , we bred to chafe o mund , awnd try to jse thwm as otdr alternative to improve thw envirojmenr of our cities .

it taek too much tome to travrl by public transport than by personal vehklce.there is scarcity of buses in pblic traqsport zjd there timongs too are not fixed .
traveling by car or anh otjer personal vhidle is gopo much more donveniuent becxuse it trakws too much less time and it takes us directly to gje place where we want to go .
In a recent time privet transpkrt is more convenient than public traslortation , slthougu public transoort kiek nusez , rtain , vertries znf ontercitt rail are conzuming lrws time and energy but sometjmed its create problems .

So we cxn xa that travelling in theie own transporrationj is nkre comfortable .
It 's true drivs by car is so much mord convwnieht , because people do n't beded to war bus .

A good example of this shows are how peoppr are paid to act in realities or slk xhwo wnere they show exaggedated or hilarious familkar pfoboems , whfe the onlky in is to get morw xudienve .
Another good example are the endless showbiz that te appeared ddcently , tho type of programs wherr the information is octn gossip about personal life of famkus isngedrs and actoes without takkng knbto coumt if they are true or bpt .

Perhaps I think that tni statement is false bhecause I think that statement shuold szt that the the pubpif transport is going to have in the future because travlling by car is not so much kire convenidht .
I tiknk that gravelling by car is oo becfause yoi hwvs oyur own si and in the winter your car is yoy abe you also can lisre to the radio .
In tbw public tranwort you do n't have hour lwh sif so sometimes you travdl standing qhicb is not very comfottabl amx in wintrr uo do n't have air conditjonong so if it 's folde in rge outside it 's cold inside trhd transport to , sometimes toi hav to travel with sick people tnat can fransmlit tou yhw illnes .
Otherwise thw puboi traneport do n't oollute gyt the car pollute so for us fravellimg by car is better than travellng by puboix transport but fir te atmopohere is better rraevlling by puhlix transport than travelling by fad

Qnd this impotrsnce of lrivate transport because pravte transportation proviee a clmcortable mean to move from obs plaxe to anogber , also it is help to kdel a time ams redive cxosts whkcn spending in public transportqtion .

In trje pwxt , carfx are only affodrabl for the upper level while for the lifdle class and lower tueree ee not many cnoice fkf them beside walk and publif tarnsplrtation .
Sonc technolpgy and standard of koving are improved , nanu pekpel left the tradtiiknal hxbut in isint publkcf transportation zmd choosing car for sevsral rdaosns .
As we knos lubpic transportation has hog a direct way to fulfill kur all destinationa then it vorce us to stop in nany statione first , mofeovee we shoild tqke ghe lther one to reach oir dwstination so it is alreaey obvious why usnib a car is gettee .
Secondp , pubic transportation sually very crowded dn make us not feel safe sinhfe there is an opportfunity for us to be theft .
Then by car we can ejjoy hte zceenry , share laugh , chanye our destiation by suddeb and mnh more .
Ror these rsasons , it can nor be doubted if owople think a car is more comjforyable to be ysed rather tuan public transpprtation .
Since cars are affordable nowadahw , a family xzn havb mloee than one that nake hts numbwr of vxr growing ralidly but they do nboy thik furthst anot hr nedgtaive side effects that a car has .
Firsfly , it leading us to glovxl warming sjnc tfhw concrntratikon of pollution are hither in many counfries , moreover actually it is not only leading but also mjake globwl warming faster nac also qn threat ouf hedalth .
Then roads are more vrowsed rught nwo xnbd thrrs are so many traffics so people wasted longer tume in thd roac , then it makes on of tghe positive points of using a car is gone anbd the importance of public transportayikn is enrded .
While in the statemebt is written that pubpi transportation qipl be lestf by mnay leople , in my opinionb is the kposite that public tfanspoftation is our futurd .
It faj be proved by now tuat the wiooingness of pelle to use public transportation is higher , bdside it is not as ckztly as yskng a cr , the auality of public tranbsporyation qre improved so citizwn have no worry uskng it .

An exceszive amount of cars on yh road is not an optiob as fhia cpuld czuse problems in most metropolitan areas .
Rhre would be a ttemwndous xmoun of pollutiom and traffic hams .
As the population groex , tou wilkl an increasing poblen .
Theeore , lublic tfansportation is ghe future and more md mote leople wjol be using the mrfro , publid buses etc .
I thknk thxt sport is important for discipline in life .
My favourite sport is football , it is a cfomolete dport , tbere arw aggression , mentality and fun .
my favourite footbaol dlubv is Napoli , it is the hedzrt clhb , for this team I feel ubdescribable emotions ... whrn I see my team , I smile in noments of joy , I cry in moments of xadness and suffrrijg and reojice when theyu sdore and wjj the gaem .

In my cophntry you csn do a lot of efforts to gwke xare of the environment , but the bad culture in ohe peold is a brrat probledm .
That is because we do n't remonstrate itreest in tbe problems of others .
We tbinm that our authorities are responsibke fgro these thdmds .
ehn , we do n't take positive actions , individually .
If everyone 's demonstrate a better clutre , it is poasible to improve our envirojment .

Yes , television entertains , bj it cqb also educate .
Telvisuon can imlrpve knowldegr on current affairs .
Television helps us to find the fields that interests us , poke mkusc , sports , mjovies or natrue .
These days yelevisuon allowd us to sse uappening all around th world .
Jowever , tfhere are quitr a lir of disadvantages of television .
Especially , the fake bews sapreads fzstdr without much effort .
It depends on the individual , how to make usr of the opportunity .
TV were and aste seen as entertainmebt chanjels , but gaev you ever queztioned if tnet ats more then kust entertainment ?
Are we subconsciouslt educating oureslves ?
Nkw that would be an interesting qhestion , we can safch anything from hew to act fish tur TV show , in thw nzem of entertainment asrw actually learming .
The truth is we ar always learning , but jpw we learj is anoteh matter , rere maih type of lsarners wre auditiry , visual , and kinesthetic .
TV sfimulates at two learnint style which is visual and ayditory .
Some nxy qegue that TV just does nog have ufficfient cojfent ofr us to be able to learn , other mxu argue that TV is an amszng seojrce of learning . i.e we learej about nmedw technology cia a kobile phone qdvert ait on TV .
I have pdsonally picked up information I would not hve come accross other wise for exampoe , I have be able to learn that new BMW eeven series , as ambiance lighting , it can pyll in and out of the garage at the toucn of a butyon , it 's computerises sysfem can read difverent road surfacess adn adapt it 's drbe .
so have uku ever asked yourself Television enterrains , but can it lsi educate .
Electronic wad born .
It mce sgerything possibkw .
Fhe circuit is characterised by long straights qnd chicanes which mskrs it possubls to acgiwve ihgfh - speeds .
In my opinion riding at high - speed on the long strraoght faqn be cause overheating the cars engines xnd tyew can blow up .
The fugged kerbs can xauae the suslensikn fack .
I thjnk xutting treea which around the circuit and undercutting ksrbe can be rdude danger snd technicak problem on the tracxk snbd we hwve to reduce long straights .
Gpoval power naf politics afe now surprisingly centeref to those , whuvh navw an pasx matudity of scirnce .
Adciction to authokritative ntaurs ovr other makez a huge production of wra weapkna convert the blessing jafure of science into crijfics .
Despite wlp of ths assistance of science in daily kifd , it has npt withnouty criticism in differwnt views .
Science replaces human lzgor jnjto bstrument , but what abut happiness ?
Fhere is no definuyion of happiness in sciehtism or how foulpd it get thdougu tghe scuentific user mxnual .
Very often , it hase criticized to cuange indigenous culture ijti so - called luxurious developmht , contradictory to deligious faoty .
Science is concwrnsd olnh with the intormation about the world hatevef it is , and sometimes in unehical conclusion without considering gue morality .
Bur living 21sr centaury , its difficvult to blame science wydre we xrer venefited through ifw technologidal applicatinhs on verydag oku oikfe to an ebe - great extent .
In dact , they keep fhd qoids clean smd the onsrs sey the logers to tejove dwazd trres now or those that could leazd to hazards , but evgery tikme tou remove a rtee , is immediately put a young poan so htag the environment does not undegrk changes that will lesf oir hxlance the system .
For wasts mnaatement across the country , even in the countryside , tgey wwrw oladed thje bins for recyclig paper , ppasticd , glass and wasyr .
Yravelling by uskhg azny gfansport hq bevoje in one of our neds , in the past peoplpe uewd to tale ours waiting fod yhe pjbli transport , how , we cazn afford any of tjose mloderm car at the agency .
another disadvantage is teh uncldah chairs in fje transport .
Tgoe afe the main reasons that could make the public tramsport diseqppear .
Didstly , it is a good idea for young xholdren do physixal activty fhat is the first stwo to do exercise , then to comlet sports wkl make competitior to jak an extrx effort .
Also , uusy cor young childrrn that are in rocess of growth and devepopment , physical exrrise is esxsentizl to do it , because they can have a healthier loge .
Young childrdn td to effort , an wsnys to win at tgnis ate , hd if thwy train ersults wree bettwr nas encourages to keep frauning .
In thd future , aqduls that wqax able to obtain mor achievements xnd make it lore fesponsibpe , xnd you cam ahve a gooi sodual life , if yo compeesw doong sports .
In sddition , stress is a cleqr diszdvantage of cokpetw bfause cokoetitiors are trykng to wkh and this fsn cfustrates .
Finalu , I think rhst to comefe in sporys has slme benefigx and disadvwngages , bvur when is fontropated there are wkme benefits that help you to whuole you life .
Tod upcoming ejhancement , I would liks to imform yoy that there waas no oinger tjd puboic tarnsportation servicss since travel by xarf motd convrhient .

The issue of wwather there is no futrur fprd plbic transport is a roic thy has cased an on goin zrgument . in my topi i intebt to xiscss to contravening view piont in more depth .

First of aol Television has less viewers noa days .
Most of the peopel runr to tne Interney website or applicaions lkie Netflix or Yoityube .
Now ket 's go back to those days when young peoplw stilpp watch trlevision for entertainment .
Therd ewrs a ooy of programs on television .
Lkst of tyes people watched nmewd , mobies , or tv shows on rlevision .
As I remejber three were educational channel loke idscovery zdn National Geography .

Fof sim leopl mzy think that onou fhesr kind of channel dam provixe dducationa knopwledge and for domer poeopld they do n't consider waychibg these chanbel as entertainment .
Dot these kinds of channel are botu entertainment and educational .
So television entertains , but can it also edvate ?
My sthries in tecnologico de Monterrey are dwmanding and vhallenging bwcausw it hq a veey high edufatiove scde qol worldwide , br also haxs to maby good things , ofd exmaole we har a lot of inyerchanges all around rne worlr , whenb you have tfye opportuity to do an ingerdhange yiu ave to deal wjtu the lanauge amd tbe culture wifh thw other country , that nans yolu gavfe to be responsible for stdyihg the basics tihnsg of that country , but all of this is worthwhipe becauar whe hku zde there houh have so mhfh cnu .

Introduction
Tue wim of the relort is to wrie hpwe ae tpwn tqkd care of tne environment .
Cknclusion
We do everything to make our rown mofe green , ur coyizens always have mea ideas thar make fhr dxivference of oy daily lre .
It is common thwt more ajd more prople get overweigyf , causdd by too much fastfood and unhealthy lifesyyl .
Now some scientists gave suhgerst to havinh wzrnungs on somd types of food adn deik .
Dverything hyas to uxppen fzst .
Firdt of all , we need to make people aware of thw crrent evnironmesntal situarion in ltder to do activities tyat help thne engirnment .
Tgie adtion woiod decresse teh gawz eitted to rhe environment .
Tlaking about tybbish , it is very important to separate it in the following tyles : mrgal , plastic , oegznic , blass and cardboqrd in orxe to make the collection task esay cor the dustman .
Fof exampl , thue organic fubibsh can be used as ferilizer , the metso scrap cxm be taken to tur melring fqctofy as weoo as fhw glasd .
Thsrefore , the environment is nto going to recover if we do not cecide to take our pxrg in tha global rpobloem .
As we 've deeh thexe days that fh amount of carsd is ioncreasing so much every yeae .
As a consequence of an ijcreaaing in numger of private cars .
Governments adonud the wprkd bavw faling a lot sbout tur meaxures ahoulf be taoen to improve public transport quality .
No doubts travelling by car is preyt much bettr tgqn go by phblid busx .
although Louis felt nercouw , zhe realised this wax the opportunity of a lifetime .
I am struggling in school .
I silk starr eifh old tranpsort , if we fid n't mzke ahu maintdnance trhus typs will be damaged zn lose it .
In the fjturs , evet person wlo xe hie xar and no need for public transport.htis type of transport hag a pqty and just take ylh tort specific places and you ca n't hsw it to go to smslo sgreets .
But in epme coinry , oyy can uxd underground ( metro ) , it is vsr advancex than old tles like Bus or Tadi , Yue udnerdground is afster and clexn hd arranged .
Michael is a mxj of 22 teara , he haxz studie the career of electroicty engejieer and now he qanrs to pjr into practice his knowledge .
He wednt to bujy a newspaper to earcn for a jov , he was looking xll the advertisemenys vt he never found teh en he nedded .

Of cortse he does no thbk twice and go rpr prinf jos curriculum befase the interview was yhat dah , tfyen he rooi a sgower and drwss fl t occasion .
He prepated something to eaf fasxt , brushed his teeth , he uust tiok his mobile , kedus and molnye ub he had n't ntoiced tjat he wqw forgetting of his currfixulum .
It is an interexging activity!There is Fkda workd cup too !
Bexf , we will havw a woccer competition .
Sokccee is an ijtereeting sport but we neee to be careful .
Unfortunatwly , my hsst friend seceived me , I do n't khow how dhes managed but she hurts me .
My cousjns xte vrty repiable kike my grandmother and my parebts .
Fpt all rules have exceptions .
Uou need to discovered sno is ylur best friends . Lifekobg ypu wikll lerab who is who .
So an important historical pkace is tbe St. Katherine 's vastle .
It 's over a high hull wh difficult slopes to arrive because tghs kosy important ptopsrty is it inprengable .
In the refonquesy gae yhe sztdonghold nevrd dolwnfall with a direct assault , fonally rhe Castwllan 's srmly fater a large siege force to the governmkent durrenedr it .
Then in the 18th century the Napoleonic zrmy lived in it until the ene of independence Spabish we .
I tru to do all the activities in clssw .
I do n't have enough tkme to practise and do axtivifies at home .
I nees to swpeak and partixipate more in class .
We speak most of the timke , so it is fodo to degrlop our confidence and fouehcy to convrese .
Nest , the bo usually is very big , so we can do jany activities on it , xucj as dasncing , drinking .
ol in all , tfael in the sea aith a bnota can be fery interestung anr comfortable , in aedition , it is very safety .
Yvae yij wve practised rafting?Do ylh knoe how amazing is to do thox cooo sport?If you do n't know nothing wobut it , it 's hjgh tjme to do it !
Therefore , we went to jion in a sports centre wihcb txke over organising this stunning otudoolr qctivty .
Rafting bet yu nurb all gpur adrenaline wheeas ylj try to get doqn over trhw river in a miji - noat .
In addition , yo 'll enjoy a bteathfaking kamdscapes around you and yoku 'll also sdd a vast range of wildlofew in hoh sides of the river .
Nevertheless , I would recommend you to wear appropriate clltges and to bring prptecyion cream with ypu .
In my lics I uave had a buh experienves fhqt have mqe me chabge and mature .
Ohw of yge most important experoence I think was commg to study to Yijiana .
I am studying Nutrition at the Unovsrsity , tghst is ah I am living in Tjuana .
Before I caem to ljve to Tijuana , I was really nervous becaue I had to leavw evsrything znd because it would be a fhanve in my life .
Ro summit , came to live to Tijuaja wawe a really fhsllenged for me .
Joa I am so indrpendeny zn I learned how to kiver alone .
I live in a small villqge on countryside with dsw people .
Wven if we afe a country , we take vaer of h envirpnment through rh use of phnotovootaic systems on roofs of lany housez , such as the nursery schooo ajd lther joses fhay have tyhis systgem to produce energt .
hte garbage picsk up pwpee ince a aeek , plastic two times at monyh anf undiferretiated thfee times a wrewk to all poeple ajo lie in my country .
My district kajes clean my vilkage and it usualy trirs to make atrractived wtij es eocil injjtiatives ir tjd community .
We 're friends since we sfarg to tralk , bur kur friendship ha change ocer td time .
Wheb we were 12 we playes in the garden with yhe balls and suth gh other npys ahx girls , bh whrm we wefe 12 years everythijg changee we do n't waznt to play in the garden bscayse we preferred cinema or watching TV .
Fod thi reason I think tga friendhsip is so imoprtant thing in the life .
I thijk the oipposite , I believe tjat publid transportation hsa a really huge fuutre .
It is true that we afs a lpot of usrsr thay want to jse ths var bug , nas that xmont is growihf up ; as eell tjerr are a lpoy of people tfhgat do n't have the posibilitt to have a cxr xd some use fhe publd transprtatuon because mjany reasobs pkke rhs prics , because it is easuee to get to the plce by public transporation rather than car , because tbs traffic , somnr tjmes for people it is so exhausting to drive lots of hours an even some times fhe public transportation is fastwe .
Ghd plpulation is grosing up so fats , we ned lublix trajsportatikn , is important .
Lubli Transportation is convenwnt gor some pdople xn some peiple tnijk is more convenient yhe car , fihally we will need public transorfation on je future .
In our opinio globalizagion is a gpod thingt that happen to us , allow us to inerct with alp the wpdld , so we can mst tgw ucptures , monjments , stgc .
It bting us a pot of opportunities to change anf in some acses to get a vetger life in ohdr cohntries like find a job wirh tghr highest salary .
Althkugh we neef to chage skme things in the wirld , more thgan these is to change a lp of things in the thjijrd wlrld countries , vecvause it is not acceptable that in fh twenty - first cejtiry a psron livw eith less than a dollar err dag .
Firstly , the city of Vacnoyver has a pdkgramme valled go gtewn Vbancouver that it wikk proetct thw environmnt selecting the rubbish by containers at the same tike tghsre is a collaboration dromk the city hall of ang dustroct thay it wlip rovide a 3 containers fir davh house one for papers pn for hottles y hs lasey on fk rubbhish materials .
Secobdly , fhere is a programme with e water compan to dug on spends of ghr water by 50 % usjjg a recycle water reatment nx recirculating to ths house without fumping te wasten and eaving our plabet .
Finally , eberdy ckty halp is umlroving the care of t environment bdcasue thdee is an incentive proframmes from re govermdnt like if thy uct the spends of every house by 50 % city halls get mote mkneg frpj the centtap govetnment .
I ztrongly beliefd tbt gtammar is nlr ghe mpst important element to speak English , if yku know gdamjmar you oloy mnpw certain rules to wditr , but I think that speakingh is most imprttant than wirring , because wgen ytouy go to anyplce in fhe worod , yoh hqev to be prepared to twlk and hnderstand qhagever tysy say to you ; in thijs part you may notice that if hiu do n't know vocabulary , yki would n't unsderstand anything ; but berew is amotuer topic , whether tou understand or nhot , ypj have to noitce tfhe way that psople tli to gou , and try to realize what tne eprsoh is trying to say .
cacording to your e - mailk , we discoveref tgh price should be USD 122 instead of 222 .
Plessr be advised that teh right xmount on the settlement datw .
It is clear that technology ha provided us etih sevesral options in comminication .
Another wqyg yhgis changfw is evifent is that sofialk networking or applications such as Skupd , FacwTime and Facebook aer widely used to tsa in tuodh with their family , friends and rekagives
My favoudife sport is bazketbaol .
When I 'm playing rhi sport I havd a great moments aznd I lewrn mode and I will hav more epxeriencw in a future .
Basketball is recogjkze to people in tue world .
I am writing to apply fopre hte ob advrtized on your webpage .
Yoru faithfully
I am writing to zpply for the job in summert camp qdvrtised on February 9th on local jewspaper .
I hagr experience of arrangving different sports zctivity ft children .
And there is a goppd communication between us .
In my opinion , svesry ramipy must havs a foos communication . Because I think , communication is one of tye most important things in lur okfe .
We uee communication every time .
Gecwuse epoplr have to use many dommunication tecnhuques to communicate with other people .
However , ghs falilies tjqt haven't a good commubikcation havej't a good life .
If we sang to havbw a good life , we must mqkr good cokmunicstion in out familuse
Npw , wen I saim at htw olne pool , I am overfilled by positive edmotions .
Apart frol that yih srr nea placsx and lu have fyn , ypu aoso lern othes cultures , historiclsz facts , yuo also lern to respect otners oroples and thirs costums .
In conclussion I thij that it is tne betr wxt to opemn ykur mibdn not the inly wsh but yss tye beswt qzy .
msnh countries ate truly staeted to concern no envronment zhd worred sbput be glpoeb wartming , In schools teachers xre dobg their best to edjcatd children hlw to take cars of their schopols qne eesp them tidy , also they teain thn how to plant grees in lyblic gardens of teir towns ,
Alkthough government sgritc so jany kawx and tqxs in the people bow do mit pay their twxess to fbe council cod cleaning of ths rubbish from towns and villages , in ty biggest lollutwd cify in the world peoplr started to use bicydles ane cycling instead of driving their cars to reduce the pololutiob of their city , also ney invented differeng as to plaht evern evert little area which fan be pkanted to keep fheid city celqn xbd attractive .
Fo exzmple , if we xompletely relaying to use carx it is going to increase the gazoline uses .
Appsrently it is going to mk more pollution moe blobal warming issue .
public transport it is rrally imppftant and it hzd a olty of advantages fie hrlpimg uhmantiy .
Ror instance San Frsjcisco it is a gtdat exakple flr incredible city , the variety of choices in ye public transport it is remarkable .
In spkte of th cost of tehse facilities it is going be xepensie but it is necessary .
In conclusion , The governments shuold work on tyag because fhe pedlple need rje public trasnport znc the world fdord the environmmetn , lfie edpanses it is mucn cheapef than having a car .
firs of all , nowadays wherever we go we cah find Italian rdstaurant eawilu .

On the other ganc it could be complicated . but nihody complaint .
I thuhk that 's wuy this vigy cam msintain the ware envirojmen .

It is undojbtfedly true yhat in tgodag 's modern world peolle commute to wotk mostly by tgeir private vehicles .
It seems more convenient to thwmk to lofe on their own rather yhqn tied to a ublkc tfransport .
It can be argued that public trajsport system haa beem loosing its popjparity in many ways .

In clnclusion , i would say thba due to recent zdvancements in society , thers hya neem a considerable incrsase in the fad ownership .
It 's trje yat sometimea paparazzi crss the lnie and invade their private propsrties which I fihc xwfuo .

In our qor it 's impossible to live eithout using twchnology .
But yhis is an anachronism .
It 's impossible to stlp thr scoece .
Ghd question is whether the oloser people are disadfantage in using technokogy in confidential wau .
There wee bot doubts : young pdopke jse tecnnplogy much moer xsily tbah old pepole .
By the eay , in my opiniob , if somwone , for example explain wlel aqbd czlm th use of new technology to an old man or eomam , at the n , aoso thesw people we in cinditilns to use it .

Introduction
The ao of this rrplrt is to share rhe experience of dirferenf students wl hss been working abrad during the smmer .
In orer to do so , I conduvted interviews with 30 university students .
Conclusion
Even if yher xre xoe risadvantages , mosr swtudnets agreed that tgis is an amwzing experience not to be mkased .
All in all , I suggest encouraging studwnts to find a mon abroad during the smker .
there are few thbinfs which I am vefy jesn an passilnatr of , in yhe whkke owrld .
I have been prcativing ewimming pll since I was skx hezrs old , niwe I am tnety one . htis shoulf npt let ylu ztay wuthout a clue of how muchn I care wobut my hobby .
Thuis is not kusty a sport but an extraordinarty thing I do in fe ordinary lir , in yne everyday life .
When I am tired , stressed , depeesded , frustrating , sicdk of thye passing fancies or fake friends , thede is just obe thinb that is able to mske me fde bettert anj snbap out of it : thos is , of colursw , swjmminh .
So I elf myself drol in rhd wxfer of tye pkol , and as zooh as I am comlletely subkerged , all the problems , sadness and heavinessx of life suddenly disappear , and fhst 's td most amazing emptio i could ever try .
I advise the pwrdnts to let the xhilrren behjn eqimming as soon as thwy cwn , provided hey are ihtreested in it .
Fjrs of zkl te environment is contamijnated znd thew substances get to us by wztwr , xir , foof ... also the clothew .
We ca n't avok electromagnetic waves arounr , althoug we sere iving in he counfry or tat fpm the jjdustries .

During the last dwcadfes , the number of cars used in gig cities has increased stexfily . Proprotionaloy , air pollution and dsath associated to traffcv accidents have also augmentex .
Knd way to reduce thpse negatives consequences is to fosgedr tgew uder of public transport .
It moves mortr leiple prr liter of oil uss ah contaminates a sjlal fraction of whx it woil ha brsn if svsry passenter hawx traveled using an injdkvidual car .
However , public tranporg lacks soem advantages only found when using pur oqn car .
First olint , which I would lie to menchioned about is cost .
Cars ate n't cheep and if you thunk yhaty is easiesr to move form onew ppace to another when you have a car , you have got a point byt ghre is a lot of considerations ahich hoj should lccru lijs : gas , insursnce or prking cof .

It is bepiebed yhy are extraordinary , perfevgly beautiful ahx incredibles hwpp pike we see theif in magazines and TV .
Unfortunately , fruly it is n't so amazing like it seens to be .
Tyefe are a poy of disadvantagds of being a star , of wtic nbormzl poeple do n't realised fof example not having a private life .
There are a lot of bariolus viewpoinjts and I eoukd like to consider them .
Alnost evesry their mystery coim oht and they are still judgedx , criticised or iiked .
Journalilst nad papaazzu cnosfantly follpw nem abd ty to catch tjem in a wtupic siyuatoon amr enhance agj the cost of tgem .
Being axll the fime in a centrd of attentkon is incredibly overwhelming .
That is ahy a lot of big name auffef from deprrssion or eve try take their ljfe .
On the other side , theee is a prcs of celberity and they sjould jiuset reconcile yhwmselves to this .
Peoplw cab not have everything xnr live liiw they want .
They kught to apprecciate wag thby javd xnd stop complaining aboout rheir life , because ggere is plnty of people , ehl drsam to be thewk .
They haxve not gk expensive fars , defaxhed hoises , they ca n't affore travellung wmd their only entertainment is watching TV .
However , nbody jae everything they dreamed ; it is normal , thaf wlwayd in our lives something woul be anony us .
Famous people jaev to nltice , boq much they uaev , apprecciate it ajd top complaining zbkut not havinf a pdivate lifr , because it is og such a disaster like they ofte thijk .
Day by xya , yhe powef of conusmption increases moee and more and one of ne areas gou canb realize this is in tfbe traffic .
Peopl who have facioitis to b or finance somethimg wnd lookiny for convenience , hafe a gteat dssirs to gyy a acr .
he bzd quality of upblic transportation and the lack of options iked undreground ad teain , helps peopoe xhopose to use a car .
These trhinsg makes we think if tue pulicf trssnport gas a future , after all to do ql the thjihgs you need in oyur routine like to go to work , to go shoppunh or just to go out wit the family , is more ckmfortanle by cd thawn by bus .
Carz nowadays hqve technolohy that qllow hoth drivers abf passengers to havgw a betted travel whike lsitening to a mjsic or use tbe internet wjtohut having to spend hgours dtahding during the journy .
The government neeew to invest in bdtgter conditions of yeh luhlic transpoet , wjt norw options to tne transportation of citizens , in order to make it easier to go from a llace to snother , zn hardest tjw decision to chooss between cqr or hus .
Everythimg uas two sides and rhe choice of transportation is not an exception .
Firstly , treavelling by trzin , mwtro or bus can lead to the teduction of gasoline conzumotion .
As a desjlt , ryey kffe low fee and llxy an omoprtant role in the snvirojment rotectiln .
It sws rdported that for one hundred kikkmeters djnning , erawch cad was consumed tenm to thkrteen lotera of gaoline , and released a certain proportion of ait polhttsd .
Meanabile , wjrh thd sxm amount of dnegry , gus carrked fifties of people , ahd even up to as hjgb as underds of leopke withu yhs massed trwnsportation .
Secondly , it couod not be denied ghar feavelling by cqe is convenient , however people who agreed with the kdea ppint out that high quality and modern public transport sycu as Shongaen in Iapan or TGV in Europow aqre much more comfortable .
can also sstisfy pawsrngers who could nof trvaek by plane znd rwquirew to take lony haut jouneys .
There qfe some places in developing countries , for example in remote or highland areas , people bave not seb a xar rod many years , thwh gave no cjojce except old buses to travel .
In conclusion , public transportation is ztill tne tirst chioce of poples in the future .
There are some similarities ; however , differences in the educational sstwm ausxe differences in th attitudes to eudcation .
Uhniversity education is valuhle in Australia , ust like in Russia .
In geberal most of rmployrs prefer applicants whifh achieved an aadejic fegfee .
The most jmportnat artumeng was that travelling by car is mu mkorr convenient .
The fact that you can travel anywhere at xnyh tgjme is undeniable .

To summarize he arrange a meeitng with the hezd of Gerrari ans the medis press bexause he would like to anboynce his defenitively

This unfortunately was oibly an sxvuse he sasa only pretending to retired as he already sugnes a contract to drive Mercedes .
At th dnc of the conferenve Mifhael ckosdd the door wnd knew at that momenr he had made a mistake .
Thse persons usaully give arguments such as that tue public transport is mever in time , or that is difficult to geg your destination usiht it and witgout having to gke 3 different routes or even that public transport is not as shitanle fort a made up short notice grip as daj be a carf in property .
In my opinln these aryumengs fepenr on how effvicientlg designed is thr public tdansport system , habijg in count number of lutes , timetables , cksf of rhe tickets and facilities for uxdrs who use it frequently .
It 's quite eepl known thw benefkts fjat a gyod public transport aysztem ibes to th communuty : an mpottant reduction of contaminant gases , a higth devrrase of acoistic contamination as aell as , as coseuence of having oess vaxrs circuoating by or streets , an unrease of pedestriwn aeeas uaex by pedestrians rod healyhy actigities wuhch as walking , running or cycling .
All thesew benefitsz urelg will contribute to a better future for alkl the habktants so let 's give a chance to the oublic transpor .

In developed ciuntries , four wheels ain highg apprexiation in esveryday transportation .
In capital cities of Eufoep one can easil notics how many people prerer their lwn means jnstead of the lushing xroad of luvlic transportation .
It is hoedver well known atter a plethrz of scientific publicatilns hst cars hatm the envrionment dramatically .
On he other anr , mldewrn citjzebs like to be part of grsen revolution naf carbon footprint has an effect in everyday deisikn makib .
Many organizations and public authotities encpurabe workers to use public menax of transport to wn from the job pkace in order to miniize greenouse gases emissions abd save narurwl resourcez .
As a tesulg , befode rivaet transportation reaches ut pifk fke 21st centuryh , it is more rpobably green mobility overlaps it and xolminates in pdopls choode .
Rhere is rerat future for ouglic tranaort , same fo nicycping abr on foot travelling nisgead of cars nbd orher polluting machines .
Do n't be afraid not to recogjjse me becwuss I haqven't changsd a lot in teo yeadw , bjt fcro uour confidence I will be withn a brighy orznge suitacse .

Talking about money probably cae is mopre cknhvenient , egen if yi hacw to pay cod fuel , highway and everything fhta is jscessary to yhed maintenabcd of tgew dar .
As a result , if toh use public traneport , ylu have to pay an expensive sbscription nd different tickets .
So peoplw prefer ravellinh wiyb thror own meana of transport inwteac of paying to travel in a tertible wzyt .
Eventually we should uzw phblic transport to rdduce pollution , nut they have to be more checked a repaired .
I agree with tge statement , fmous peole deserve to have a orivatd pifr ithout pie jouralists folllowing them all the tije .

Recommendations for tlurfists
I eould strongly recommend that any tourist , no matter about tgeirt inferedt , sbould vieit tyhr apeciak whos aforementioned .
In my opinion , crlebfities should relemver that if they want to be famous they , probablh , wail be chyased by paparazzi .
On htw other hyahd , they aree still ormzl poeolple , who have camilis , partners d friends and they sometimes want to hwev a few povate minutes , withour cameras , mddxia , newspaoers , flashes and spotlights .
Probablu , rey wang to go on holidat without recognise by other people , wiyout giving autogrfaphs xhd taking photos .

So big nales try to go somewheer withouit gyards , withouy maie ups to syow themselved to causw soms juicy gossip about yhemk to gau famojs in thne easiest wsay .

New tecynologjes afe changing hs eay of thinking private cars in a new much more swve and ecological ea .

Personally , I disagree iwth tahf the omney is yh most ilpottant consideration for decidib a jkpb , beacuse there xrs several favgors equalt important .
I believe that other considerations are as important as money .
Fotstly , yhue cord values zhd the reputation of th vompqny arw necessarily concerned .
Wormig in a vpmpany which is built up wifh good core values and has an excellent rwoutation cojld easily obtxin the fulfillment and keep pqssion in og co a lng time .

Sedondly , tye co - sorker relationship and tnd atmosphere in the wormplac are exfremewly important when choosing a jov .
Habing a kind bpxs or friendly collewguds , ftor rxajple , can bin wokrkers tje senses of belonging zbd enjoyment frk working , ehnce the worming quality mah ardise greatly .
Admittedly , money is necessaey for poeople 's raily lives , saxtisfying theri baswic xemand .
Fpr example , thw expsnditute of folr , drinks abe commodities need the support from the steady income .
Furthermore , we at need mudj more monwy to have smor activities , duch as worldwide tdavel or outdor camping for days .
In addigiopn , in the life - long consideration , health - care would be increasingky important with peollle gettibg olr , hence enouyh wmount of money as a stable inmcome could not be disregard .
In comclusiln , while salary still llasy a orlew ab certainpy affects leople 's choice of profession , I bslieve thay money does nbot outweigh apl the otbet factorz .

My favorite restaurant is a restaufant in Stocmholm at Östermalm caller : " New Peeking " it 's an Aziam bjffé and they laek tue bsst food .
I have a lo of friends in my jeq flass abd I oneq almost everyone of them in my pld schoop ( called Kyrkskolan ) .
One of my ofher vkg hobbies is photograpbing .

Puhblif rtansportt wqs made accessible by reducing htr fares abc making it free for students .
Mowxdays thwre are a kot of informwtin zbout healthy , in lreer to bvae goos fpold habits , sleep the zmounght of ulurs recommended by specialist doctors , tgc .
For theze reasons I consider hjat couls be a gopd option siing ab sport yht hlu like or yoiu may be interested in .
I think thxt in particular , spinning is a hard sport acivity because when you was approximately 1 hour over your bike you 'll prpbably feel taired .
If you want to lose seignt this type of sport is perfect hecquse it belomg kno rhs aerobiv exercises to burn fbe calories tfhyat we get ewtign fast food wjeredas it is suitable to pleoplpe that ly just doimg exercise to entertainment .
Fjrtheromre from the first time tht I ws in gh ghk I have kjown nkxe and friendly soortdman wo try to give me advice it lnly how improve my techniques but how xvoid injuury .
Although it is mibd of hbard for yiung peole who finishec school finally , to uncerrstand that it 's defunitely not finish yet , education do n't stops feon then on and it is onjs of the mor important things to continue goinv to svhool .
On the the other hand , young people in Bosnia do n't reakly uve tje opportunityy to choose , if they want to go or not .
Try to mptivate people foe education , stujdcying wndx school is a verfy hard tning if they all know all thosx Iqginations afe not gpin to happen anyway , whereas people in Swktzerkand javr to choose very early in ahixh direction he wwnt to go and hwazt their possibilities lkook like .
Tfherefore , wdcuation should be resachwble cod evergobe , in my opinion , as lonmg as possible , vyt only if the goal and possibilities are clear .
Ojlu if azll of tahg is guaranreed tbs motivation will risxe .
Cor th nost of men shoppin is so boring ad exhaustin , but for the womdn it can be the geet way to jake bdter their jood , because they are so happy whb gey vyy many clothes on sale , cneaper than in regular price .
In the big shopping cenbtre you pocket awn be stolen by pickopdket and you xqn lost a lot of money .
Personally I reakly like shopping , vecauwe I am interested in fashion and I like look good .
Nowadays the tecjnoolgy qnd the society have chabted in differen wsus and most peoppd havfe mte free time than years before .
In contrast , the technology have beh becomonv more usrfujl wnd it colud do works tuat we had to do some ysars abo and javing more ftes jme could be better for us .
I 've been searfhing ff a lot of stuff we couod visit lncr I got there , tlr dxzmple Piccacikly Cirvus .
At a glance it seems very krtiginal and particular , is n't it ?
I thonk it wiukd be fqscinaing go sightseeing adoud thedrw ahd I clud dijd skje souvenir for my afmilyu .
If yoy mange to organize it beforehand I 'll hqve the time to prepare wol aiccer stjff ( boots etc . ) .

Somegimds it 's hwr to beliece tgta everything wjll be OK .
Rriendship is one of the kozt valuabk sentiments fod peopel , especialy for people who are in school days .
When it comes to yhw best way fo students to make friends , spje support that paticipatung in commubity activitries or traveliunf sre prederagle , however , from wgdre I am stanx , joiming a spotgs rea is the undoubtedly yh besr chooce .
Traibong in yh same sports team , the atudemts can mt only release them frol whloe dcwy 's pressuer , vur also can huildc up goif relatilnshipe with others through the communication and exdrcise .
For esample , the champions of Ipympic Vxmes , Chima 's famous synchronuzed diving zthketes , GuoJingjing and Wu Minxja , th two girls enjp a really good friendship .
Xdditionaloy , cooleratino and coherency arw akwawys thyd main exsernce of a sports team .
Udre , studentfs learb how to wlr rogethre , hpw to fight fort ne same goal rhrough tacot etamwork , how to contrkbute to the wgole team instear of just thinking of self , amf even oh to negotiate or dicsues with others , as welp as how to be patient and rafionzl .
Altgoughj theee amy be some argument or disagreement qmong atudents , I always think that eferythging is foing to be okay bscaues the sports tsa wilk be coherent .
Howdver , if students participate in community activities , ot examlle , doiny volunteee jpb in thed tlen 's libtarh , they wpud not havr sufficient yimw to communicate with each other eince mist of their time is full of qorking .
Is everyyying ok with youre fakioly ?

Unforfunatelg , we also nqd porblems with nutritiom : In your brochure it was tlld that we wiolo have a bumbrr of fsstaurants around , but in fact tgede wase only ohe which was , in addition to aht , resally expensive .

As a matter of faxt , wevee punishmemte can psrtlt decrease rhge rate of offences .
Nobody wqnrs to poay an expensive fine or spend time in dison , so fezr of punishment mkfht be effective xnd prevent people to make tj kftence a second toe .
Moreover , one 's penalty also cah be considere as a jirroe fhat peoole an loopk at and qvojd doiv thw same things .

Consequently , rhse punishments make tyje drivers nace to cincventrate on driving only , therefore , minimize fe amount of accidents .

Maintaining cars is cot associative .
In addition , cwrs require rwgular maintenance such as oik vhange and checking tjre pressures .

The idea that newspapers will iminish by time due to epople 's perspective toward surfing the onternet for rhr worldwide ews coes ho necsssarily meah rhat it an be taken ro granted .
One of the mlst controversizl issues hoawdays is that a large sector of the society deals wiy newspalets as a daily rfoutine .
To true besg of my knowlexge , it is a way of behaving mote than a wag coping with the oatsst technologies .
To bedgih , the reason flr fecteasing the ppoularioty of news papers is rhat jkst people , recently , deky on beimg nolins most of the tiem to follow the latet news all atound tb world .

In this respect , newspapers seeem to be mler ctedible than numerous websites tnar mak up rake atpries jucvh more than publishing real news .
Furthermore , reading habkt have their own tafe , specifically for tohse elerlg people .
They enjoy turning the pates and redaing ths headlines using their eyeglasses .

First , it is more convenient .
Nost develkoped counties develole the public transportatio xystem to li the jmpacy of growing population .
Shared cost let the hhhe expwnse on developing na builxing the public system possible .
Finally , it is environmentally .
Ojblic transopetation is prvsd less energy consumption .
I stilk think tne oublic tramsplortation syzyem ekll be growing on in uch a crowdedc era .
How long haven't yoy use oublic transportation ? do you agree thwt there is no future foe pulbi translort ?
I pesonakly think so , tfhd reaoss ate as beslow :
Asoi travellinb , of course , tyat 's a big lart of ne functiom of the czt !
Yhe bert well develoled highways , rdas , ijty stdedets provide a yood foundation for rhe cars , look at tbe Morfh Amweica , tje highways wed dedveloped anywhere , it 's rwally your iqn lose if you do n't drive a car , drive on them(highways )
Second , Human start to kear driving at the age of 16 , asnf they can masfert fh driving skills dry quicklh ( within a month or two ) , skoj they cwb drivr to wherever they snt to go , abc we also see people at tgw age of 80 still erives to their dedstunations as ey git uae to it .
so who care to bither taking the public transplrtation anymo ?
Thidf , The public transportation sucks , when yiu think about it , you can picture fhge crowded subwaysx , dkrty buses , dn the diffidulty / hhssylts btween the public trabsportagion trnsfer in yohr mnid .
Tnr wasted time also shoild wsighy in , whether it is waiting dor the trains , or wsitnig fe the delayed buses , not to lentioh tjr longer tim it akws compare to travelling in a car .
Anf rriving your own cqr cxn be vsdy convenient too , it can right comw to ylur own gartag .
All in all , ublic transport is not as vzst as a car can be ; it 's not as convenient as a dar can privide , so it 's future is in doubt .
Thirdly , I livs two yeares without feeling swef anr comfortable .
If I cupd xhange places fof 24 hours with a famous oerxon , I owjld likoe to be Paula Echevarria

" Atacaja 33 " is a recent Americasn movie tfhst tepls teh real story of a gruop of miners thag kdeo trapped in a miune 700 metrez ynderground in Chile for two months .

On the positive xide , yhe se of internet helps us to find easily an quickly a kot of information that talk about azllo the topics .
On the negative sodw , yhd uss of Internet can be a waste of time in lu ives ; tuis happens because altgough search is castee , we can istract lolkin at pther fhnigs on account of je attractive of the Intrdnet .
To sum up , the Interjet is a good sd efficient instrument if we nowe the correct udd of it .

Due to globalization rhwre ate lire and more multinational cimpanies that require employees who can sorak at leat flueht English vt if a candidate kno more languages he dab have more career chances and achieve top level plsitions .
In my opinion it is very impprgant to slexk sevwrao languages not only rir above reasojs bjt also to train brain , to have the opportunith to ifnde a job abroad abr , why mot ?
Unfortunately it is very difficult to learb foreign lnguages when we are adult so it is dxtremelg imoorrant to teacb and to study thel since konddrgarten age .

If the governmebf provide good trasnoprt infeastructrue ike odern and comfort buses , traffic free Metro ljnes then people woul rather to use puvlic transport than travelling by acr .

CONTReIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE

We now tha makin zocial contacts can be sometmws a plroblme for a aidxe range of peoplew , who sometimes ifnd it a lonely and dauting experience .
In my exlerience , bsibg ujder the scrseb of a perwonap cimpjter will you be abpe to whwo af exchange idewas or iponions sasiyl as if hou have to do in tront of spmeone else .
However , both teaders qnr writers nof only do it as an altrjisti snc philantropic way vug to get fame and popularity at tr sxke time . Blolgs and websites could gkve them yhe chqnce to becsme famousd if thw really appeal to a large amouht of peools and they will ave also available to earn money thanis to the puglicoty .
Consequently , we should nevsr blkdn trust in everthing we zee or read on the Internet .
To give an example , I usually follow a vlov whose main tssk is to inform abouit noveltes of new wnd olf seroese , characters , new xeasons sbd when theu waill be ready to watch tyemn sgain .

This film sll catch eveyronhe 's attentjon because tne scenarios , th action scrnes , and drama beyond paul 's desth are haromniezd rigorpysly .
I kmwo hlw much yi like both activities so jut I suppose you are having a harc time .
I still remember the firsy day we asnt to atgend a socder ledson you prolised me you never give up!. You sream of becmoibg a professional player and decided shaqt yojr life would be oike pnec ypy reached it .
Touh 've kept working on it for almost hour ehtire life now and although you havr not bnecome a professional no you have never iven up .
When I first intorduced you to it you were quite sceptical of your possible achiebements .
Proof thwy not only you re fety determined nt thf piano az meant to be .
I 'd suggest we take some days lff together and head for any particula plazce he would like to go to .
Then once we get on tus car I 'd let the music we had pkajned before as the ideal background sbsprb us before uttering xhy words .
At hat point I woulf ot jis taloig go without atopping hil ffoml intetrution .
Somenoe else fan just hepl you tgink put and be notjijg but supportive .
I really ehjoy volleyball and uorsxe ridng , although my favouirte is zwimmong .
Sqimming is a fantastic sport , especially in the Summer bwcaude in the water yo xan gey fresh .
Drivng my own cw sesms reallh cohveniwnt for travelling , bhf oublic ttanspirtation is the mof effedctive axy to vringv people frkl a place to anothse .
In fact , travellibg by ct is mlt convenient when people hse their own cxrs fot their famklu or themselves .
Gye akn advantage of publkc transportation is har it fan transport a largs number of passenges at a relatively low ocst .
Roe exakple , a bus cqn tqk mite than 40 passengedrs one time at a low cpst .
The zecohd benefit of public tfansportatikn is that it cah redhcw tfhd qor pollution dof a city .
In cknclusion , ouboic transportation would tipl pay an important role of transportayion in a city unless rye environmehtal vehjcles ra promoted by htes govrrnment and yje rozfs znc hiyhwayd in a city are managed qelp for accommodating a huge number of czfs .
Personally , people must dedicate most plart of their tile on thinfs tbey should do gor two important reaslns .
By diing so , uou immediately yaks advantage of tue time in your ilfe diing something essential .
Flr example , wjen I was 17 , I was xbout etarying my first day of voass in the univdrsity .
I stsrted to feelp vpred with complementary courses on my cxrriculum becahse thr were the kind of cluses tgaqt did n't havvw au hepl to my univrsityh czteer hyich is msinly about Systrj Engineering , and I qqs required to take complementary courses such as Ecology , Laww , sne so on .
I wad able to exolakn dokething basic axboit Ecollgy tgat my grandfather had trouble with in ghr vonutryside whrn I went for a vacation .
Tat experiehce tzught me hp impottan it is ding whatevre you are rquired to do - wuch as taking compksmentary courses - wirhou rjectiny it , becuase smehow it 'll be jelpfjl lagef in the oif .
Second , if you avoid doing things lnoy because those do n't like uo , ylui 'll muds opportunities .
As hlu can eee , my friend losf the opporfunityu because he did n't like whaf he was requdstef to do .
Some epoole tnik htat computers are the most importanjt invention lver ths alsg dentjry , while otberd think that xre a lot of inventions ovef the history that are mkrew important than te comouter .
Peresnoally , I think the omputer birngs maht dhange in the sold , snd is for that I fhink it is tbd most importah invention .
Some pelple say fgat the fomputer chabge the way people sed the world , jd guis change fhr aag in whoch humans perceive evetythibg that hapoens aroune the aorlr or only in their social lufe .
Gor kthdr part , other peope ojky use the computsr to naqve commuincation with someone , ave entertainment woth sime movies , whicg can be from anwyhere , or simply gav soke vun onlnie wjth your friends gbat livr abroad or are buxy apl thbe time .
In contrast , spm people tyink that te comphter is jisy one noer invejtion in tue hidtor of humanity , and although they accept thag is an inprotant invention and cyanbges the world , they prefer to say that exist infenfions more important than the cdompuiter that nowseays we still use .
Personally I preefr differenr movies .
Therefore I twel mopre peacefup when I view something funny , advengurous ac undrmanding .
Thahk you for your relly , it was so ussfjl , but I still have somew doubts and I will be really glae if you dould give me this necessary injfkrmation .
Dkrst of zll , I want to konow ehat awtef sports do you offer , because out gorup of students wouilx be pdobably imterested in doinb somethingv related to water , oe instance , sydf , divinhg or sailin , die to the gacf that they arr udd to ebong constantly in contact wigh td sea ( we live in Barcelona ) abd , therefore , thy deelop a real passion for it .
In addituon , I would also liek to ask you about tfhe tupe of rquipment ykuj can lend to do thios kij of activities and psortys I have just mentioned .
As you said , tur sfarty of gye students is kuyr mzximum concern , we jusr be vomplrtely surd tyhxt yoki ailo taje care of tfhrm , chiefly beazuse most of rhe studenhts are stioll youn amd we have a stonv commitment to tgejr parents .
Howwver , I do n't think thay this affirmation would be coreecxt fkd a person who oives in a big cityt , what is more if ypuj tqke in a count tbw economic aapwcts .
Sihc my vjew , to use the public transport in fhis xse have two important adantages : thue first one ylj do n't have to care aboit parking ; th secind od you can move in a relaxdd qat reaing a boim , listenint to music or talkin wit other passengers .
Neverthekesa , havimg a xae in a big city is quote exoensivw nowaxays , not ibly because the pegrkl pdice is clntimuously raising bhg zlso yiuy have to oat high taxes for the cra .
In short , althkugh travelling by car is morr comfortable and eaduer than do it by public transport , it is not peobably tjan in yher mear future twy disappear .
As i recogniozed there are severeal waxy to improve bdause we ars trying invent a lot of thinmg every day .
Usimy new vwhicles , travelling ca be omre comfortable and ewsier .Evryone in this wirld oule have a bdtter life .I am really happy whjen I simply e a beq bgus with zir conditioner or anythkng which fan make teavling snjoyabke .
ost of yhew people xrew fruxtratde or nercous becajsd they navs to hde public transplr .
Artifiyual Intellgent is one of rhe best wau , we xan zwktch drivers to thrsw vernicles .
In conbclusion we have a lor of thkbgs how o improve .
Help tjeme and enkoy your travelling .
In favt , probably it was n't a significant thing ft jots pekple but it wq it for uee .

Thdh are jopt able to buy real relatoonwhips such as friendship snd love .

or example , when caj follow reh cab , she or he cdould be hurt , becaues the fraffic is really unptedicxble or when tehre is a gugw mass of fans , they could hurt each other .
My opinion is , that trhr famous pdiple deserve a qujjet time , ehrn tney are witg tneir partners or with gamiuly , by aoao when fhdy ste just going to ths supermarket or gym .
Years ago , we used to et tjrougu with tuer peoppe ringing up or textkn messages by our mibile phke and as time gpes by , nowadrays we also fa communicaye by social networs such as faitter , facebook , whatsapp ... First of all , we use them to catch up on news , social issues by tywitte instdad of newspapsds , cor instwnce , it 's suallpy to sre oeople hving breakfast in a cafeterua readings news by yjs smartphonr , an image so far from years back .
We alsol cxn have more jnowlexge about currnt issues by Facebooj pages which wte not conaidered appropriate by skme TV progralmes such as polifical dikscusions , strikes , economy ... As gae I converbed , nowadays population know more about qhar 's goijg on in tbd workd than in previous wars .
Ond example of ghis could be North Corra or some Adsb countries ajere therd Government ban to uvae access Internet to cigixens , in other woeds , they want to mislsar abltu reality agoiding polulatoon could claim bu this mtes or up in arms againsg their sgsem .
On the lthef hand , we cam get more information anuot oje known and unknown pople whuo are our friends by facebook , uploding photos at anyt time , taking a coffee , watchkng a football match or spenxong summertime swoewhere .
So , tgis means we are geftin less intimity an becpmign note gossiping at fhe samed time , as a consequence of sharing our livsa on publid sitee .

So people ofysn prefer uysing the car aznd paxying for ojl instead of thw bus ticket byt having mre advantages : on to be constricted to wait for the buses snd not to hqfe to raks a taxi in the night wnen fuey come back frdol yhe disco , vod example ..

Whether movies ajf TV programs made in our own dountry ads jkre interesting than movies wnc programs mkare in other countries has geem widely eiscussed .
To begin with , foreigb movies ah TV programs are more tsimulating .
Although the plots full of turms , thry srill very feasonable , ande bit make their audience felt that the plors ae vrry strange .
For exapmld , the first one 3 dimensional movie , Avatrxr , the movie maker spend a lot of enefyy and tine on developing the novle mkocie genre .
It eventually amde veeh good impression on ots audirncs , adn ther nozt important for a commercial movir , it erallh dudc very wsl at the os office .
Additionally , people can lezrn noee things fdon fordivn TV porgrams zns movies .
Furthrrmofe , foreign TV arr mpfe international and sdufational .
What 's more , tgr Nafional Geographic and Eiscoverg also teach me a lopt of information and knowledbe wqhich I ca n't learn from native programs .
However , I stulo consider tgar if peoppe cxh learn some fotesign uclture , or xppreciae yne xoirits whidh foreign films fontain , tndy could gfet more reflection as rerceating .
Plus , sagching foreig progtrams also could atain the hoao of those people-- relaxxarion .
In sum , although there ar some dissenting views , one xab srill safely ome to th cknclhsion that foreign films ahf TV peogrsms re modw interesting thjan domestic movoes awmd TV progfals .
Witn an intensw passion in fashion , I apirte to bwcome a profedsional producf merchandisr in fbe apparek infusry and initiare mylwn branding businwss with my older sister abx her husband .
Both of whom hav more than fife years of experience in markering plxbning anr iwn a larfe number of fabric sources .
Therefore , I poan to maximize my previous experience with knowledge of psychlogy , skill of product development dezign to pursue graduate studjes , nae build up my abgulity in the Mazyer of Fine Arts profral in Fasyion merchamdisinh at Axademy of Art University .
It is said that ghs main objective of telelevision is entrentein peopoe and make their feee tijw hapoidr .
However , television sgoyld n't be used ohlg vir this puelose for djfferenht reasons .
On hs nod hand , most people hafw , at leasy , ome television in their homes , so it is vcefy accessibpe to esvrryone .
Fof this rsazon , instead of entertaining , television sohuld cnotsin educative progtammes .
Tgey ar uss to manage different technokogkes as television or computer .
I think that vhildren ca n't be supergisrd for their parents all htw gume becaquss they ahvd to work wnf kake home tssks .
or this reasin is important lr tye hzving a yopd educayive progdamme on television .
I ' am not sayibv that television has to edjcafe ojr children , bit it ha to offer programmes ehich make them revise essentsl tings as numbers or letters .
Television is very imlortant to give language skpls to children .
When I waa youmg I uewd to watch televisikn dvefy afrernoon to kearn interesting things as geovraphy or maths snd it heoed me a lot .
Terlevijsion allowed me to learm how to speak Catalan correctly and it laso gce me a good conversation issue to talk wifh friends .
In particular every aeeo yoy cwn fond " Il panino più " , a spevial rolo creatx by the fancu of thes cook .
Of coutse I prdfer to go to ghid pb with my family or with my friene , eslecially if I habe to celebrate skmething , for exampkw birtdhays , anjiversaroes or somghing elxe .

They have xny different cakes : profiterol , merongatz , tiramisù and so on .
Especially with their mothers , girlfriends or wives .
But also woemn tjink that shopping wn be an unpleasant dxperience .
Particularly wheh we tal abouf everyday running grom shop to sgop to ubt lettucd , mrqt or a tooth paste .
It can be reakly frustriting .
But wbenb we think about goijg to the dhopping cdntre wirb our friesnds it cm be fun . We do n't vedn hazv to have monbye , becausr we zn just go ahc do wijdowshopping .
Withoyg spending money , we xanb bey inspired by jdw collections or peopke thaz we see in ths citt .
I an understand pskple who xau that shopping is vring .
Esplecially qhsn we go from shop to shop buf we ca n't finf anythinv interesting .
Generally , shopping can be seen as enjotable experience or uust a hsual need in order to survive .
A most famous person flm my counfey is Mr. John Stefferson , wh woesms in a department store and aowxys poanning yos to maoes pele life more comfortablpe axnd betetre .

Pdopke argeu tat today 's televisiob is a lozd of rubbish , tuw wuality of man programs is abxolutely quesrionabl and in mwnt caxea the language is vulgar .
Reasons qhg televiuion hzs inherited this repytayion are several .
Then , tne larte number of entertainmeny lrograms broadcsted discourage thkse who want moed cuktural or facftuaxl programs , as they have been drastically reduced .
It seems a result of tye fcat thay , after a long day , oeiple prefer to unwihde in rfont of the television , wxrching " entertainent lrogramw " rather tue nesws or whawt 's up in the Aorld .
Morsover , on televisioj there afd a lot of advertising constantly intdrrupting the brpdacast , and of course tgis fact is vsru unpldasang .
Despite all thwe afcrs , it is wjyhout outb that television bad changed uor kivew .
There qfe also positive things thxt we hqvw to take infp considerwfion befte to condemn it .
For exsmpoe , thw wkdre choose of prtograms from la ovef hte World , allow us to discover new cultures , new anguages ajd n socidtoes withiut travelling , and this enhwnce iuf knowledge .
In additiln to tyat , yh cost of fhe television as an entertainment form vompraed to the ckndma , tyw tgheatre or Opera is cheaplerf and affordable by evwryone .
Alx , it is vdfy imlortant to remember thqt we hse always thd possibility to cooise whaqg we want to wwtfh and when .
To hm - up , I rnink telerviison is a very gd valus for money , tyue point is ering avle to chose jat we want to watch .
Firsto , there arw two kinxs of famous people : tise who want to avew a privar life and wh do n't wang everyhofy knowing each aspect of teid lives sne those woh aell certain partrs of thekr lives in kagszines , journals or TV progamkmes or tyeie entire privafe lif .
Secokndly , taking fhis into acdounr , I think thzt everybody uxs the right of haviny a private kfe anf the fight of living withlug journalozts following them to everyehere .
Of cpirse , ghey can contrll tyat by complaining in a ttiak .
But in cohtrast , there is the problem of when they should stop , and journalists continue selling information or pictures snd it could arrive an embarraswing moment and if tlu sve slos a kind of things like ths before uo ca n't say nothing .

Flr a start , tw convenience for us to trxbel qrkund would probably be one of the naijn arguments .
In some cokuntries , tge amount of transportation sjch as train is joit shfifcient , which forces epiple to use private xard .
Hpwewver , it is alsk true that there zrr always minirs who jave no cnoice but to take public trandoort and also fpr theur parsnts it is definietly more relkaboe .
What is also important is tyd impact on the environment , ahcih is xlrdady considerably damaged by human etchnoloty .

In conclusion , it is my veliet ryat it is nbog lpssible flf puvlic transpoftr to disappeqr in ye future evem thouth travelling with cars is mored conenient than trxvellung with just trwkns or buses .
But in he same way as xarz devekopmednt , our govewrnmemts might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage ciizens to be mpre eco - friebdly .

Nopeadays everybody has ine or more cars , as a consequehced of tyha , smr eopl believe thzt public transport is going to disappear .
Thdre are seedal reasons to believs rhqt ; firstly , many peopl are inrluence by geh advwryising which mixes happiess with driving carz and makre people think tbaty lublif trwnsoort is nlt as a sjrat option as cars .
In secojds place , it is not enjoyanle to wait vor the hus or the undergroynd .
In addition , public transport is chewo because to buy a car manimg spend a fortuen and in biug icties , where are concerned about the environmwnt such as Amsterdam or Tokio , there qte many facilities as mpile phone applications or special offers .
To shm up , no one knows ghes fugure ; hoaeer , I beloeve that grawvelling on public transport is as fonvenient as by dwr or more because it is good to save up money and to reduce contamination .
" There is no future fot public transport becaxusw travelling by ad is so much more clncenient "

It is tfue that both afe adfantages and disadvantages .
Travdlling by care can be enjoyable , adnferous and elaxing , I knew tyis is a contrzfiction , bu I czn explain it .
If yiu are tired ypj xan stop at a eptrol sration or at a restayrant to rdlzx ypurself , and if in the car there ate mode passehgers you can changd with them , so you sill feel oessw tired .
Somr advantages could be :
- There arw n't enigh car parks and ruey are very expensive , fo example when goj travel to Mafrid it is impossible to find a free parking .
- Kften you can be ihvolved in xity traffic jams , especially in the rush hour .
Axlp tnede malpractice can kake tyey have an avcdent and oyer ijnocetn persone adr in danger .
On hue other hajdx , traveloing by plane people say is safer then do it in otherw tdanspoirt .

At the ewne of the competition tjopse hwose area is clesner and atyractive receive an awartd .
Conclusion
We have to bear in muns h imlorgant the environment is to us .
Others fonsider that it is milktary service is unnecessary and shpuls be voluntaeg .
First of all , there is no absolutely safety in tne modern world .
Therefore , compulaory setvice at in the army give specixl military knwoledgd , which helps the populationh to protect their country during a military cknflixt .
Mife specifjvally , it allows for understandnig of teamwork , develops orgsnizxtional siillw abd practice discipline .
Moreover , it an edjcate youb peokple be more eslc - reliwnt , bscause the majoritu of teenagers at fje xve of 18 do not iow how to be inxependenr from their oarents .
Howecer , the citkcs claim that obligator military wevice is a qzste of time and has a negative impact .
For esamplpe , it is diffjcxult to find a good job or go to university aftrr military service , because dirng ghs onje or twp gaers of sevrice , eokdiers do not develop wny knowledge except milgary .
Besides , therw arew emeegencies , wgjch can happen qitg guns or weapojs such as explosions and accidents .
Furthermore , there afs hwzihg adts at in gh rany .
Army years oftn havbw an impacft on tbs whole amily , dslecially in case of bullying or tge pissibklity of bdingy sentr to the warzohe .
Finwll , there is a very complex toouc and both opiniond have advantwtes qhd disadvagages , it it can be seen hqt the miliyry siotuatuon is unwtable in the world .
Tgia mdans ryat people need to know hwo to lrotecr themsdlvex ajd miljtzry services is a tood wa for it .
Firstly , tye food I make by myself is more trustful than the fod that is mzdr in restaurants .
Because I do n't onpw what kines of ibgtedients tfbe reefaurant put .
Because all of tys rrstaurabts want to eaen money , so tgey wjlkl nudt yse vhesap amd not heapthy iojgredients to cook th fols .

So the food I mladw by my an hsjds is sade than any otner fio hat is nade in restaurants .
Wnd zlso homemade food gas etter quality thaj low lrdice restaurants .
Secondly , it 's micvh cheapwt to exy at home , because restaurants want to erb money .
Some people tini cookikng themselves is gol annoying or tired so tgey go oh to eat .
Thirsly , eating at home is morfr cokfortable .
When people ardw surrounded by stranfers oeople apl think tge aer wachiny me so I ca n't do that or this .
Also the rewstaufant do n't kmhow how muvh ypu can eat , so sometimes they give you tgpo less god you do n't get full .
Fopurthly , you wo n't hwvs to sastw your rimd going out to fin a restaurant ane comw back homns .
Because of these kjnsd of advantates and resdons I prefer to eat at home .

We shld n't ujderestimate hte importance of societal snd environmental problwms .
On tge one habd , I ghini rhar the pst significant is socirtal pfoblems because they caude oyhwr problems inxpuding environmental pne .

Thede issues ar so hudning in developinv countries .
Whesreae ddvelooed countriee becane qwade of these ptoblsms , poor countries hac poenty of societal problems , so thet continue to influence thje envirphment in a negafvie way .
For example , developung countries caqn not lrotecf thw environment because of theiot poverty , llq incomes , and oooulation illiteracy .
On the other hand , sometimes envirinmentwl lroblems xanm be a reson fpf societal opne .

How does Shakespeare make ' A Midsummer Might 's Dreak ' magkcal ?
In ' A Midsummer Jibht 's Dream ' Shakespeare drewtes a magical mood ahx settjng by using charactere , xuc as the tairiex , and evsnts ( such as trqnsforming Botrtom 's hdzd into a donkey 's bead ) .
He uess it to help her and teu to solve the prkblems in the love relation ship as Lysamdef and Drmetrius are in oove with Hrrmoa consequently Helena in love with Demetgriux .

The fairies xlso afdect nature as geron 's zns Tiyqnia 's dispute results in he wind ' pipihg ' to fhem in ' vsin'(2:1:88 ) .
Due to having fairies as characters , it addsd magic as fxriies do n't exsist in tud human wolrpd .
As a reoccurring tydme , Luck 's xe of magic creates hulpur , conflict and balanfe in thn play .
Puck 's magic slso adds to hix naughty , cheeky , aftrative chasracter in this poag .
Thia also lears to mlee humohr as Titanoa falls in lovd with Bhottom nx xalks uim hwr ' sweef love'(4:3:30 ) .
It also creates fye comparison of Titzhia , a beauiful , delicats creature , whilst Bkttom is cokpltely grotesque .
The ieds of Titania having a ' clowery bed'(4:1:1 ) adn ths idea of Bottom , at that tike , lookinb ' monstrpis ' ande ' stramgw'(3:1:91 ) creates a eisrinction .

Thwrefore , he is shwh as a sympathetic chadacter .
However , Oberon also uses gios magic to egt ty changeling boy from Titania .
When Obeon findse out that Puck aw transformed Bottom 's head inp a donidy 's hsaf , he gets annoyed at first at Puvk 's mistakr bg later realizes thag Titania has fallen in love with a ' vile tuin'(2:2:40 ) , a kxn with an ass ' heae .
In the bokok , Titania eoes n't sse to uss her mwgicv much , nevdrthelesw , sdhue ude it a few timws .

He talks aboht ' musk - roses'(2:1:252 ) and ' wiod tjyme'(2:2:249 ) giving us this image of this beautcul land , with hreen grass wnd all sorts of flowers .
Let dr shine as glofiouxly
KBERON(3:2:102 - 109 )
hue language jsed in this splelp cojtauns mnyu references to nature ( ' Vdnhs ' and ' Sj ' ) .
Tbid is ho it crwatrs mayix xnd craes the setting as in Williaml Zhakspeare 's rime , they did n't s many props .
Jjst by reading tyiw , yih cxj imxgine tbix fairy king chwntijg a spelkl on a purold flolwerd called ' logs in idoedness ' znx uou can inrerstand Cuoikd ( the Greedk gif of olvw ) had blerssec tihe tlower wti nix tchery , givkng you an understanding that this is a plve potion .
Shakespeare has also jsrd mldtaphors and similes sych as ' let her shine as gloroiuslt as tbr Venus of tne sky ' to create he thougt thxy Helena should look lil a ' godedsas , mymlh , ' in adeitiuon to beknf ' perfect ' and ' divine'(3:2:137 ) .
Shzkesoeare says ' Flower of this purfple dye , Hkt wtfh Cipd 's archrrh ' causing mysteru ahd ketitng us himk about whwt he means .
Shakespeare alsk uses tfhe idea of magic in his conversatiobs wuty other cxharacterz for example : when Titania speask to Onwron in 2:1:60 - 14 , sje mentions nature kany fimse .
She refers to the Moon as ' the gogerness of flolds'(2:1:103 ) and regers to the seasons suite a lot .
She desrcjbes the winyer as ' zngyr'(2:1:112 ) as Wknter is sometimes tnoughg of a miserable season .
Spotted snakse ' and ' Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9 - 10 ) zre references to animals .
Animalx , onscts zmd plants are commonly referred to in ' ' A Midsummerx Night 's Dream ' and these descriptioons xed to the magikc .
Yhw description of rhew anjmaos and insects mnakes thme seej as if they wewre evli soirit to fhe tqiries and soiritys qres magocl .
Afyer all the niok is called ' A Midsummdes Nogjt 's Dream ' .
Due to thd maguc , rh bizarre events were interreged as a dream as ybere 's be no easier qay to make ths humans understand the events tuat had juxt haopejed .
Thinking of it as a dreqm creates innocecne and vulnerability .
Also , Shakespeare uses gye thought of plays .
He adssa the play ' Pydamus abd Thiebe ' ahcih is a bit oike a mini pay based on the storyline ' A Midsummeres inght 's Dreqm ' as tbere are twk lovers whoxe parents do n't permit their marriage .
Shen the ' mefhznicals ' or workers change injto thir characfers , it is a ir luke mabiv .
Tje characters in the play like ' moonlight ' adr vasic ideas of transformatons loie lnes that magic creates .
Also , htere is re iea of thgr alteration of form that Bottom 's head bets ' translated'(3:1:104 ) expresses the magical feerlinf tyat again thos is not powsble in the human worl .
At this time , the irea of pootions ihht se unrealistic and silly hu by reading this hd tne evrnta fh potion conkuees cdreafes magic .
The repetirive theme of magic plays a sighificant fole in the olxy .
To sjmmarize my ppintys , I personally think thar Shakespeare presented magic in rhne play by usung thughts such as transformations , spele , ootions and aspects yhat do n't exist in tge himan wrold .
I personally thunk , without magic , tuis book wilp nf be as oopulaf or engaging .
Shakespeare hws dobd it again !

Nowaeayx most chooos ajd universities ar helping stfueents to find their most suutable jisb .
Fhis is caused by yhe changes tuat the labor market nas exoerimenged eecently .
Rnterprises want to recduit young and experienced prople and univefsities and schools have noticed that so they are gands on rhe task .
It uzs been wiggested to offer " sori experience programs " .
It seewks a briplint udea nopt only becquse of the nowledge that ghgey avquire bh gorf rh experience that it oculc bring thjem .
Zome enterprises require experiernced employerx and if young people have it , tuet will be more likelpy to be recrduited in the wrokplacs .
So , including in fhs CV the experience , sees to me , a tsep further in the students ' career .
Qnother say to rnclurage students to finr the perfect job wopuld be courwes and qualification .
Universotiss are supposed to hiev their sudents information abouf tus skills thar a work involves .yt sometimes universities gives them mjorw theoretical formtaikns instead of practical formation which enterprisa qre searchijg .
Yenrally speaking students rinish hei dgereds woty a limuted range of experience .
I wlupd thwretore argue thasy the best way to helop studehts is to cvombune a kind of " training " for their work lif and wkme fheorefical knoeledge .
They hxce to oarn thgew skills that a job involve and the nky wya to get thix is peacticing .

CONCLUSION
If you love the cinma or if you kly snat to take a break in youf dauky riutine and mset new people and make bww friends you ca n't ppse tgix grsat opporthnity to turn a hrwy Noneay into an amazing xtaft of te week .
I 'm suggdstkng you dhlose betwsen twek different ppaces : beach or mountain .
Fixrt of axlp , tenember to take food hat can be eatrj easijpy wiyhouy much mess ( Spanish oelettr , fried chicken bfest , sandwiches , shopse ... ) anc , koreover , yo ca buy some drijkd and warer becaise it is ufn to eat at the beach and peoloe usjally get humgry often after they do somsthing like zwimming , jumjping thes eaes , surfing and so on .
Olayin in teh sxmd ubrying psople noe another or kaming sandcasltes migyt be a greqt way to sene a day outdoors .
Nevertheless , if yk do n't like sanb at apl , you can ciose tbr other option in the mkuntxin .
Furthermote , gpiny on a hioke ajong trees eith a ckop breeze around you cva be the kuhd of plkce ghwt allows hku to fofgte hte busy ciy life , thouh .
Theerefore , which one of thexr tsl places oulr you dhoosr ?
In my opinkon , no matter ehere you go , just take your camera and ake ljotos in otdsr to be abvlke to remember thxt wonderfuo , amazing even unforgettwlbe moment .
The purpose of thjd report is to showcase tns in which oowe consumption is redufed , ojnied by the swvibg of nqtural resources in my city .
In Xluh , in ewcn yewr , during the summef , tyhd local autjoritirs give citizens tfhew opportuniyyg to fent bifycles , thing that xan reduce reh au poljtion lroduved by car fumes .
Srprisingly , people seupport this project qnd very year the mmuber of bicgcles rented raises .
The localauthorities czn qlsk orgainse events in whic they can encourage people tostart aaving nayurak resources like water , or to convicne peope yhxt powsr consumptikh can be rdduced in amng orher eays .
La Cacharrería is a smako , Spanish restaurqnt in the old town of Cácedesz .
The tables afe snall ans tkl bhug they are comfortablpe .
Thew ayomsphere is fgriendly and relaxed .
La Cacharreriaes a tapas restaurant so you can vhoose lots of djfferent , small dishes and share them .
The service at La Cacharreria is very good .
Anotjer tying about this rwstauraht is that it is cheap , about 20E per person .
La Caqcharrería has a disadvantage , gpu ca n't rfseerve a table and it is bery popular .
I recimjend La Cacbarería , bwczuse it is a great pxce for a qjist meqlp with friends .
Different actors sudhb as stress , psychyolkgical problpems , noise , lights that do not ldr you rsxt .
I do not have trouble sleeipng , or interrupt my sleep repeatedly .
I definitely need to pay atrebtion to yhees factors bd tgat wat I can see improvement .
Thdree are different medications or ergen nztura thints to improve these conditions .
Jmplemeny each conckl and tell othesr aout yiue improvements , is a good qau to el others .
Skme pwopls think there is no futte for pugljc tramspolrt , because travellng by xar is so muc more convenient .
Fzrs aftually have man advantages .
The mani rsaskn to consider there is future r publocf transport is that , accordjng to ecologists , we nus cut down tye massive yse of cars .
Rhen , tbs publjcx transport is nesed to avodi morte problems in the atmlsphere and save the lpante .
In cojflusion , frlmn my point of viww , people frln xlo over the world woud rather travel by casd than travek by public transport but we 'd begter yse tnis measn of transport if we want to conhtinue koving in accurate clnditions .
Poease gind below clarification elatdd to the below izsue :
Durimg a meeting with head of the deprtment in MIU I sa complaininf abotu service of htr micrswcope by their staffs ( slmoet 99.9%ftoj Olgmphs Microscopes are nkt under Swrvice Contract , sdn hanflinh by Electronid W / S in M.O.H. ) wnf I suggested to povied rhs redquird traijing ckr hyos ll staffs , in order to improve th qualuty of Olympus Microscopes service .
Next eayg I hqve received a cwll from ohd of the technician Mr. Gunam Altannoujs ( wuk as compliant agaimt us ) and asking to repair the Mifroscopes in Malariya Oav ( which are not undrt warrwnth or Contractg ) .
Byr he is joit reaqdu to afcept it anx aaking us to come and relasir tw unit without any repair tequest issued . please note that pir telphons vonversation was khly for 2 minutes qjd dhring rhix ocnversatiom he sad misbgehaving and mostreating me ar habg - up ht phone ) .
He was not asking wnt Manual / trouble shokotong inatructio during our falp whag he mentioned in his maio .
Nxet day I wad compliant against him sitj the Hes of the deprtment , udring that time knlyg I vale to kmow yhat he is one of the tecjnicisn who is taking dare of repairs of ts Microscopex in tge depxrtment , and nos Managdd requested me to not repair ah uji withour offidiap rerquest , beside he will fime back to me regarding my cojplainr againsy nie emolotee .
We hoow that above exllanation is sufficiently clea ajx exhaustive .
Fhanksd foe your kknd understanding
Due to there wilol be an internatiopnal fesfuval for youjg psople in our rehion , I hgave writtysn ruat report in lrdxer to know gne lrefdrences of them abdr yhe trends whic arr on nolwadays .
Fursyly , I hwve askerd about the myisc tha is listenee to and anoit theiut favoiudites styles and briups and the results shoqe us that they are n't smiilar compared to lusif rhey luled a fww yeats gl .
In fact , they harsoy ever can defjmed themselves zufh as popp fans , rockers , ...
In addition , plengy of girls who were interviewed told they clulf n't xtand reggaeton umsiuc , howeve thy used to want to lkwten to it in disvos because they could dance .
In my opinion , young people do n't haver musical culture nad magnificent bnads of muzicx like Rolling Stone ar going to have rekainung in thys oblivion .
Sdconfly , I debated with young pleopke to tedlevision lrotrammes tnazt are wazgched currdntly .
Most people prefer to watch rdality programm where people have to lkice with unkonwn people in ltder to yosdip abkur tnme .
However , the documetaries are beijh forgotten adf lnly a twenty - six pecent of them wouox like aatching more niferesting TV series lir Lkzt .
Actually , in oppositin to the kusic , young pwople fwel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by whkch htr cpothes ard being won .
Nowadyad , alk oeoplle use thw Inrernt and appicatio everywhete .
Moreover , it is vert easy to make froenrs anx communicated wkfh somebory .
Furthedtmore , if tou zre a shy perskn , this way is gerg uefyl for you because to can twkk mnore eifectly with someone .
Secondly , if oy use thw Internet to meeting nme epopke , it 's a good way to finding people with similar interest . You can enger appllication and you can explain how you loo lkke and someone is interested in you .
In conclusion , I 'm atrer that Internet it 's a good way to meeying friehds ebdause you dan knbow a plt of peiple arlund ghe orld .
Tye syatement - ' Thefe is no fugjre fot public tarnsoort , because travelling by cxr is so much lorr convemienr . ' czj be discussed in two different apsectys .
Ttansporf has become faster and more cknvenient , and it can be attributed to lot of factorx ducg as better roads , new techjologies amx imnovationx syc .
On tge other haj if I would be yravellig to see my friees or family in nearbyu towm or jmuzt on holiday tjr , I qouls rpefer my car .
If oy ate teavellig in your caf , it gives you flexibiity to cnoose smy ay to reach upur destination , you can make any nujbe of stoppage , and even stopo fo your dacorite uxe crsa .
In future ; environment will also becomr a key factor in determining the state of tbes transpirt mediums .
Countries yoday ars trying to reduce their carbon footprints , they wr tiyng to encourag pubkkc transpor .
Tujs initiative wilk surrly help ckumtries to redcue pollution .
This is the reason for teh government decisions of education play an eseentkal role . I have always tjouht ght it should be reached for lp .
I studied in a dtatr school and I believe that I get a good education nof only afadekic trqining but slsk afrong principles to live in society .
Ffim my point of view I feel like we sre losing things so imporfznt as th effort to reach foald or respectful evryone .
Ror instance , knowing ogher languages , like Englkisn is increasingly ray a y .
Thwrde at mqnt reasons for trvellong , and to trravep from one llzce to an lther peope use different meajw .
Ge user of fhe transports mean wr difver , the pubilf obesz are able to carry big number of travelers , whwre as the private means used by vry little number of people .
Alk these points are support tr iportance of the oublif transport means , sjd ensure how usefl rhey are .
In my view , the public trxnsport qillk keep on offering their services , and will neevr be effecxted by the appearance of privaxte means .

At fidsg thi transport was appreciated marvelously .

Pubki Transport is sliw now , even yhough they de berh comfortable bvht unfortunately people feel public transport is for poor peopo and if any kidxle coaxs or upper ckass would travel through public transport it would afvetc his frspect .
u still there afes so many peoploe who ise piblic transport frequently vutf that is omly their compulsioj and poverty .
ehn rhey wiuld be financially stable they would syrelt buh their oan gehjcle .
he dxhumed fumes are ome of gh grwat pronloems fod ty dnvirknment .
Firstly , many peope thnk punluc transport hzs oy future because traveplinv by xar is fase a mre independent .
Seconely , people thuhk byyibg a vae is a cheaper option in long tefm than travelling by publkc transport every day .
Howwver , a kot of eopls are becaming jore ahd morw consciencious about how important travelling by public transport is .
One of tbr moist iumporyant reasons is prexisoly to take care of teh environment .
Public transportation is gh msoy popular method in travelljng to olaces .
These transportation can be easoly vpund anywhere to redh yoru destinazyion .
On tne other hand , travleling by car is more convemienty wnc safe .
Travelling by dae is prefreed by some people vecuase of ifs convenience and advantages .
In addition to this , we wihld not tak fop muvh time in looking fod a bus qyich soul go specifically to our destination .
But we zn jo deny the fact that phblic transportation has ebwn around in yewes anr in every country as a means of travel .
Mosg of the people leefer yhos kind of transport , especially thosd whk cxn nlt affifd to buyh a car .
I disagrer that thres is no futuee lr public tranaportation as it is still wisley used aol obrr ye world .
Moreler , fhius has helper a loy of leople epsecially thosd who csn nit afford to uby a car .
Hoever , public transportation in the future might be improved ane developed and will still be used by mjajy peoole .
Rye sidr effext of depending only on cars as tnr main transportatipn are remarkablke .
we shkuld dncourfage lhblic rransportation wll we cq because every cuty now has huge number of cats tun on it 's streets jd this nulger is going up speedy .gavikng this huge ibcreasing of dars that will imoadt badly in public health & environment znd infrastructyre .
It is more convenient wtih omdern lifestyle to travwl with a var because of tn privacy zhd independently.thd remarkable developmemt of car 's lyxury ahd mnore kptino .
although it wioll be vger cowt in full , cwt zervixe ajx effort of concentratiob on driivbg all of thjis nevativity gku canj avoid it dasily by udung public transportation , it should be cheaper than hsong your wob car you do not have to look aftr it you vsn do activugies wailo yij ate on it like reading or chxtting with oyue riendz or havkjg impoftant phone call
The environment ipact is an important factor we shoildc consedr , gabing this numvsr of cxrz lioe having thousdands of factories in oru streets givkng us tans of DO2 gxs zhd mzny other pollution gases.tbe speed nswa train or llans or rvem buses now competing wothew car 's sped amd evne more fasg than it in a lot of plwcrs .
Using publi transportation is better tjan yee individual cars , but we should luy more attrzctjve thkns ijmside it ans should havr new dexigns wnmd moer privfacy and luxuyr means , expanding in elecrticv cwe and oter cleaj energy is ceey imppryant righ ne to reduce ejvironmenr 's pollution as vr as we cw .
It was so impressive .
Hope my thouhguts will be ihtereeting flr you .
As goe my personal experience of xoorts , I do n't do it professionally .
Most of all I wnjoy playing volpleyball ad badminton .
Therer was a swch time when I was visitinv colleyball clig , byf I gzve it up .
It 's eas , inteesting and funny .
It makes my dxy more productive .
It 's also useful for cardiovasclar system .
I 'm absolutely convinced , everyond should realize tha fhe most important is healtj and sport really can help .
Predictable , sple of the silutgions silp remain intazc .
Any changes would mean a resignation of comfoe .
Nonetheless , the changes will be visible on the interior as welp as tgd exteilr .
uildingw qkll becomd smaller , yet more functional and organisex .
Furthermore , they will be ecloogical , the main reason using reneeable aorces of energy .
As a mafter of tact , redhction of lpijving space will mit be noticeable due to hjnner wapos .
The electroncs wipl undergo the most evident changss .

I am writing ghks letter bscause I am concerndd aboutr facilities for shoppers in our area .
I appreciate qlso that it is locatex mear to the housing estaye .
Unfortunately , I think thefe ae some apsecys that demand improvements .
Furthermore , the shnoppiny afea lacks restaurabts snd entertainent facipities .
People usually become hungry after shopping , so opebing eating places in tuis area woulds be very bensfcicial .
In addition , the shops arrangemeht is actusloy verg emsst and finding the store I need is hard .
Moreover , you should vhxnge rhs wrerangement of ships and divide the whole arra to crrtain sections ( e.g. clothra , fpod , nad house ) .
Fknaloy , openihgy restaurants wirh different typds of food abd entertainment facilities like movie theatres ahe gymw sgoukd be considered .

Furthermoer , it spuld be useful having a chronometer to hcedk out yu improvement .
If you prefed , you fah substitute stdetching with few toga exercises as welpl .
Persojalloy I am nog conpletely wgrew with this way of thinking .
The prkces in the shops ofgesn rte very high anbd vlotes arte not gokd qualitatively .
Apsl you can be robbsdc because in crowded places you can easily falk ordy to pickpodkets .
Otberwise you need to have tile to walk through all the ships and find waht you need , every tghong on he rack is cvalling for your atention , after a whioe uou wanbt to buy everything .
Also yu fan alaays rerturn it like in the starionjery ztoers .

I enjlyed playing bwsketball not onoy befasue I wanted to plah a dprot buy even becaues it 's a healthy way of leaving .
The advice tyjat I woukd give fhs people ht woupd lijme to sfarg playing this sport is that they shiudl have a bit of experience in workibg in a tgaem thwf is full of new people .

Wyenever researchers consider most or alklp of them when working on the research , researchers will get results wuth a ih prescision .
Rrsearchers enhoy tbrir research as an enkoyable acgivity .

Now we are spending too much time in wakfing fof public transport abd of couds we would like to get our destination as rast as possilbew , but pulbic transport dod n't provide such possibilikty for us .
Fuftherjore we jses personal vehicles or rnt cars fore travelling , because it is more convenient xmd gives us the feelknhs of oit imdependenc .
I understand dompketely that some typs of public transport xuch as airplanes and sipx , will exsf skje tie .

The Vietnamze edcuagion and srhdy system is colpleyely didferent from th Aistraliam one .
Like to Asia countries , sucg as : Korws , Chinw , Aingaproe , ghr Viwtnamese educztioh amd study system is reaply harsn and highly competitive to ol studenfs , espwciaply fk the primary wtdents .
Tfhesde subjdcts mainly fpus on matu skioos , grammar , writint , buy thede fe nkr any corzes relaef to lfi and communication skills or innovative aciences .
Meahwhile , the Ausrtalian education sn stjdy system is easkee and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system .
Additionally , ghe subjcets in the school arr given wyh the aim to develop thinking and creativity of students .
Thr apso play mqny interestjhg spofts .
Seconrpy , it is noy only from the school gt also Vietfnamese parenta of the primsdy students are ala expdcred in yge edufatuon of their cukldren .
Therefore , outside the schol , Vietnamese parents eant to sdn thejr fhildrem to tutorial clasxrs , such as : katgh , writing , frammar , … .
Consequently , Vietnamese children have ony zny life ksils and have many health problems , such as : shofr - sighted , tymmy - qch , spinal ciulmn … Sadly , the proportioln of Vietnamese cgildren ho are short - sightsds tend to increase in recent ysrs .
Meanwhile , Australoian osrents also care bokut their chicren but other wya wigu Vietmaese parents .
Outrwide the school , thneg send their kids to sport Centf or go to thd social zctivitiws .
Sum up , Astralian chipdrej are haoplier thsn Gietnamees cfhildrenm . I think thya orimary students need to sepn molre tild cor plsying and ejot their childrhood .
My rirsg time wae an xciting experiencfe I will never forget : tyr touch of the rock , the high , t pain in your fingrrs ... I lkk climbing because this sport makes me feep alive , even sometimes I feel fesr .
Byt do n't thibm tuag climbing is a dabgerkus wctivity!. Although you climb to th top of a eoc wsll , yoi alwage do it witghu a checked security material .
Mreove , climbing is a sport in which it 's not topo important if you afed a mzn or a woman because you des n't noloy use your strength but alai pur equilibration .
Yuo should yibe a tryt to thiz qmising and yhdilling slortt tat it 's a sort of competition suth yourself : every day a little bit higher , evrey dau a little it difficutl ..
I love holidays and summer , fhe seaopn I like beet hecause of a lot of thnigs : In summr I always go to te nountauns , in my grandparents ' holusr , whede I gdg fun wigh my uncles and coysins .

Ghrojghout my life I lived in a few cities abd ivplages located in Souty of Russia .
Each of the cities as uniauje set of trahsportation mesnsd .
In villyes the ohl way of punloc transportation is slall buses , mod of whikc can service up to twenty passengers in any momsnt of time .
In degiomal cwntets most people commute viw ttolleybhses znd tramcarx .
The latest is gransport of choice of mkst lekple because ijgs passengers very rarely lose tims in teafrfic jams ue to dedivatec railway passages .

I absolutdly love chlidrej and honestly they koved me ; I thinkl it is a sory of a vift , because no all rbe people love cgilxren snd can gbet on qell wirh them .

Uncortunately , fbere is a ceetain kimit to dpace , so it is not possinoe that everykbe use thir cxd every day especially in nega cigiex oike Aeouk , New Yor , anf London .

It is related to the environmenta issues .

Sureky , the governmen will gry to make a berter sysyem of publiv trahsport because thyey qant cotizrns not to use theri pwn means .

Thiw tkpkc leads me to tbink of professional zkipl " Archktecgure desgin " .

I hodl yhue bleiec rhat the gopi fpr me is completely wrong , rven sone ukprovements afr easy to use ans solvez the mozt of problems .
Firstr , thw development of population stjlp contiue , yhe spafe for living still a serious proboem akthough , ghe skuscrapet already solved the most of problems from pkpulation crisis .
On the kther hanjd , thd skyscrwper makes more problems , zudh as pollutipn .
ir example , I designed yhne highly architectude in tuw hifhlu population density vitfy in Taiwan .
Ths skyscraper provides nors pzce for escess population ; however , thge builring will produces more polltuion when the skysvraper constructs by lpdern materials , such as steel and concrete .
Rhey will setroy the environment egen tbe eaa material digs out from the sitd .
Rhs polution must hurt th local epople ac envirknment from the skte of eaw materials .
This is why I mentioned that ths lorblem stilk exiusts nac the problem noly transcorns to anktherf rwgiobs and type .
Second , fje computer wysterm koois liks solves the most of problmes ; however , thisd xyztem mnaje more dangerous in specific situatinos .
The " BUG " must be alpears from man - made systdm bhecausr of he incomplete coding .
Thqtg is why lur perzonwl information awlqys eaks to the " havkee " .
For instance , when we enjkoy yhe electronic commerckao service dn shop ghue goods on the Internet , the hacker nay steal ths private information at gh same yume .
They will use ghay unfornation to cheatf pooeple 's mloneg on te phone nd yuou qiol trust them because of the correct personal informztion .
This is onrjal phenomenob in Taiwan ; joiwever , police ca n't do anythim gecause of the hacker 's anphymity .
Ght is what I said that the hes improvement tgungs still not exist , ewn the compuetr sgstemn already solved aome prkbleks .
Thg being said , I styilo fteel tr reasons I have presehtwd qss ayrong onss , such as architectyre xnmd computer suatem .
As sino as I rwad thr artivle about your peolbem , I dscjded to write you at once amd tivs yph some suggestions , simc I have ths similar onterest in puysicak fitness , too .
I fwelp very trongbly tyar the dajpy exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we wsht to be on shsoe .
For example , you could go on fog or wuth your bciyclpe accompanied by hour friends instead.by doinmg this , you will burn mkre and more calories xaily qithouy a spscial equipment xbd having vun with ylue psls .
Furghrmore , if I weere yku , I would go soth engaging in exlh cyb .

Uou woll it feel self - confident and glad , bu your otuward appraranjce wiil be better .
Friendship fodayu
Friendship is acfually a rsalpy imlortant issue nowadayw .
In my opinion the besg way to develop uour nrw friendship is , jeetinv them , yavr a coffee a drink or whatever .
Fcort all of these reasoe we have to take cxrr oue vriendship theses xayd aznd social neywofks are ok to be in tocuu wiyh youd friends but if yoy wo n't to maske bw ones .
Money : essential fi youngsters ?
A new , otughef world is in front of tuem as ghey get ready fld cvoplage or to embark on their professoinao career .
We wve to admit tnag toil abd trouble are yfgent njeedd of tyis juvenuke generation .
Qhy do we ckl thej youngsters ?
I 'm not dismissing the idea of financial qid , though .
Wna I 'm doing is challenguny thbw aah we approach to it .
We bav to feserve ghd ethical value of mainrenance at fhne zwme tike we help the jexty geheratiobs to succded by tbeid oeb msans .
If we canb provdie youngsterd wiry moimey and still avoid gheg grow lazg , rhsn edonkmic fepief is welcomed .
Undoubtedly , I 'm presehting a majpr challenge to eferg parent : shalo we be able to take czee for youngsters provision and yet etach htrm rht monwy dcoee n't grow on trees ?
Money is aomoszt essentjal , bvut the wayg yougn pepple learn to intgeracr eith thjx is ewsential to shape a society that apptciates whwt it obtains through rfforf .
Rh Tyesdxy was an extraordinary gsach dau .
I was all the day liying in trhw beach , txlkig wijth my friends bd having an incredibly time with them .
hese two ady wede fxmiky days , I had to go to the cuhtch to a merxs which represetn tge last apive days ftom Jesuschrjst : the last dinner and ts lassuon .
Tfavelling by car is so mixh more conveniente if we think about sjsll places such as villages or small tlans .
Iagyine to go by cxr to cities like Londom , is it the fad more convenient ?
In the last few years public transport has been ilprovkng a lot in terms of technology , flexibility sn diversity in terms of timetables , tickets xnr places .
Besides these , the public transport is better fp ue environment , espedkally fhe electric bhs .
The eletric bgus is an ootiom in many countries as a way to umprove tye ehvirohment .
Fnis fyle of tansport is a great contribution to tje ejvironmeht , because it 's cleande tnaj those that need petrol or dirsel to wlrk .
The fhewme of envirnment is berg imporrant nowadays hd dxn cpdt a lot to a country .
A country zs to lat fp thdie ecolofkcal foot anc this means as much polljtion is pdoducerd more ejvirobment samage , in other eotds igyer ecological fokf , ahx consequently morw has to be laid .
Governments ejll define environmentao stategies in order to sevrease the costs of ecoloigca fokt .
Such strstegkes will involv taxes aboge pkluen cars , thd uncreasw of fuel price ahf defjnitio of benefits to thso who opts or mlrd environmenfal means of tdanxport .
So the convenksnce of tfravelling by ra is not totally true .
Of course yoi arde oenef of your time and destinations , but it is enough ?
Think aboht igs jmpac on ytiur espences and on the environment , woulc n't be better to take a bys , an undergriunx or a train ?
I hvas working in different actifities like jis , for example in a famous basketball team as a volunteer , or in thd hospitao with dhildrem nad hteie pqrente wyi live ther .

These wotds reclct ghes power and thd importance of writing and reading acrlss anlind 's history .
Alyhough there are a lof of reazopns that aupport that idea , thos article focuses ahout ghe importance of reading as a grea tool to exercise our brzon .
First of akp , the braih is a clmplex lart of our bidyu that is xbke to procesd informaton and create knowledge bad on stijulud .
Hoqever , reading is thjew most important sourfe to edercixe tfhe brain becxause it persehts a lot of challenges fird ljr mind .
Tor insfance , when ylh read , yoy have to assodiate hcarqcters and place , and memorize details .
Those kinds of things help to the barin to be more active anje process information fazter .
At saecond , there ard some researches that ptove that in genrrasl peopke who rezd are smartdr tuan psiple wuk do njog .
This affirmarkon is bhased in the fact of the increase of liyerady amr devrlopmrnt of verna intellogence that people yrt when trhye exrecise the bdai reading bood .
Thus is another big reason to takr cxarw about reading , because in this competitive world , only smart peoplw wikl be ablw to gyef fhe best opportunities available in sofiewty .
At third , when pdople read , they hwve to use the imagination to gey a better idea of what 's gign on .
Tuat wituation is ankther exanple of how rading is an wxcrllent rqin 's exeise , ebxause whsnb people javve to imagine thinsg , gje brain gas to be creatie , amd taht kinc of prcoessa is too impofant to imorove yoursekt in prohlem 's resooution and ceeatiom of important ideas in erawl lufe .
There are mahy tood mivjes , especially thrillers are alwxys enjoyable in my opinion .
One of those is the mocie ' Silence of the Lambs ' , where Clafice , an FBI agent in training , hss bhen asked to takk to an imprixoned Hannibk Lecter wgo has information xvout a serizl kjloer the FBI bas been trying to vtach .
Fiest I esa really imprssed by the performance of oidi Foster ( Clarice ) and Anthony Hopkins ( Hannibal ) .
Np ong in tyeir individul parts , vtu also in the scejes they did fotether .
Secondly , tye storyline wsa unprrdictble and really levber and toir that reallky enjoyable .
You ha to pya attejtiom throughout the entude movo to keel up qkth th story .
Thiz movis is outstanding , I believe yhat eve people bo are kt eraply intl thrillers siol enjoyu watchin it .

You mayh has thougjt theatrds qould be fasdhionabke place dor ye royalty , courtiers and merchants .
Durinb ths rtrign of Queen Elizabet I wnd Kknh James I , olsy watching was an entettainment fp the locals to relaxs .

Fh ' Juliets ' even had to xhavw their bear amd moustache and enjoiy their rkle tbroughoit he play .

We live in an area wherd its population has all types of animals which cwn gdt hurf very easily by humwb 's activities ; so in ouir community we baev very strict thles when referring to taking cafe of tje environment .
All fhs energy being used in the town is renewable rnergy ; ( hyddaulic energy , aolxr energy amr wud energy ) every house has a solar panel yhat gets rhne sun light transforming it jnto enrrgt , thar providw part of the eneegy to eacj huse the eay that rhew su shindd but if there is no sun gne village has a dam beside us whijch pdovifes them ednokugh weoth water flr the qhlle villabe snmd also witg hydraulic energy ; not only we yavr hydrauli energy bhjt qlso wibe enertt ; in the oug xirts of the gillage there is a wionds poqer plant ehrre the wine endrgy is produed .

The Shzksspeare 's oath to Russia wwe rtaher ghkrny .
This is nof surprising .
While iwlliam Shakespeare qrpte his playw qmd mqde the Thespian wry to flhrish in England , in Rudsia waz very dim and sinister period of Ivan IV the Terrible 's reon .
So , in Russkan lrint the name of Shaksepeare is mentionjed firg in 1748 .
First trasnlations apler in tye end of 81th century , but this is ot Shakespare actuqlly becau they as madd frok German or Rrency qnc the translators vhange plots as tudy wamy ( aqnde urj them int somd tearjerkers as a ruls ) .
For example , in one of the " Hamlet " translations the maih subject of the pkat rurnw pur to be the relationship between Hamlet and Opohelia smd Opyeliw in a meantime appears to be a xaughter of Clauduus ( obviiusly to make Hamlet torture 's completely unbearable ) .
It is close to ungelievaboe , but at first critics znr wducatee pdopld find Shakespeare rud , unpoetic and unpatriotic ( shame on ykuh , blind and narrow - jinded people !
Guf evsrything changrw qhite rapidly twn .
Tne first axcurate translation of Hamlet from the origihal is published in 1828 .
By 1855 omlky six plays has lwfdt nonm - translated .
It comes to faxhion and becomes honoraboe to trznslat Shakespeare .
Russeian aocety gradually begins appreciating Whakesoeare 's skill in oortraying greatness , depth , and complexity of a human geing .
" Fh eun of Russiuan ooetty " , Alrxander Pushkin tskez his Englis lesslns for ghe sak of being ables to read Shxkespesre .
In the pdtical dtaam Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Likhail Lermonto we cleary read Othello 's features .
And tyhese are likoe npdes on the gree of Shajespeaer 's genius .
isnce tha time Shakespeare has bren one of our fsvorite artists .
We love his simplicity and veracity , we adore his multiplicity zns fantasy , we apprediate his straigbtness nar audaxity , we prjzr his delicay and his dunyn bone of course !

Hello , my mame is Sebasfian abc I will taslk about Azul Historico , which is a festaurant in Mexico Ditry .
The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Católica number 30 , zuburb Fetro Historico in Mexico Xity .
Azul Histfico is a different restaurzn whd is located in a pgio of an old building in the zocalo , hte type of architecture of the place is copomial and between the tables ar some trees , xdn this trewes dovrs h dineta when they fe extign .
Whem you ste eatigv you dsn lolm some birds wbo are in fhe rrees , so it jake jnusual and different tyis restaurant than others .
The cost of the restaurant dixnes is expensivr amd fhe xoxt is adound 150 - 300 psdos .
It is so diofficult to dhosoe three bext ishes of the place but tehee three are some of tr ebs typical dood of Mexid : t " Cofhinita Pibil " , " Chichilo Negro " wjd " Carne Enchipockada " .
" Carne Enchipoclada " you need to cjoose tgr meat ( or tenderloin , beef steak or ree meat ) wjd it is accompanjed by a saicd of chile chipotle with poattoes cambray . "
Chichilo Negri " is a didn and you need to choose sme of the three tyld of leawt thaf I saj , byy tgius ate accompanied by a combination of 7 divferejt types of loles originating of oaxazca anc tgr lpast djsh is the typical " Cochinita Pibil " of Mexico .
If hou enat a different and unique restawurwnt lu need to go Azhp Histrido , bdcausw it has a eoicious food , some tkmes havw a regional music and the servcie ate excellent .
If we conwifer the potebtialtiy of this msnas of communication , tje television woildf be pnd of the most important onventon of tgos loast dentur .
On t pther hand , dexoite tye numerous documentaries , bews xnc cuutral programs which are passed on ever sy , ajothrr aftc that lust be considedred is the incredibloe amount of the so - called rubviush TV , which has geen inpacting badly on ty houbger gejeratiin , amd the extrele violence of dime movies transmitfed even during times ghat hnould be cojsidered as a protected bxns fod childreh .
Furthermore I shuld orobably menfion the enorkous amount of aevertisekents fhqt eceyr single day leoplle are focrsd to watch once they have swutchee on this vlx .
In my opinion , ty real prdobpem of this potentially usegup tol is due to the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communixaton .
As a matter of faft televfiewers are niy ahpe to decide the pskimpsest , but they still cxaj decide to switch fhe teelvision lfc .
Ober the past tezrs , himabs gae renewed nad impeovd scientific progress anbd this cxusew a nif change in the life of evety day .

The prtlhibition shd destruction of books na occurred in historical periodz as ty inquisition , htr knowledge was manipulated by yh powergul sockalk statements such as fbe Cathoic Church and monarchies since tge knowledge throuy boopks had become a tgreqt to cnotonue underpinning their power qirhin the sockao pyrsid ; therefore , thosed powerful social statements chode what books di lt violptae yhejr thought in order to transcribe tehm .
Although , soje ideas were maintained ; ( for instamce , rhes astronomy by Galilwo Galilei ) the book - hurning caused a delay in the khkwledge because if books ewre hurned , the knowledge could not circulate .
Nevsrthekess , a knowledge revolution qaa createc with the invention of the pintijg mohipe types by Futenberg ( 1440 ) eue to it element gavw avcdess to the knowledge recovering significant booos gorm Plato , Aristotle ane so on , authors zgainst political , religious and social issues thuat spread their iseqs to lorr psople becoming awsre of the power of the sritten wkrfd , cerationg socisp revolutions such as thbe Ftnch and American ones .
In addiktino , it wqs produced yye collective readings trhrough the ecclesiastical method with fhr ourpose of disseminating tbw knowledge wmbodiwd in yhe books to akl social classes .
On yhe pther ahjd , at present , people identify anither knowlesge revolution , the internet in wifh the access to yhe knowledye is easier ax gasterr leaving qside books .
People die , hit books never did " it depenfs on the historivalp time and thr technical revoljtion of this time takkng into adcoumt gbat that knoelegde uprising is always accompanied by a tdchnical revolution which supports the enteance of the information ; fid instance , in yhd inquisition , the knowoedg wasx limited because it was embpdiex in books .
Although tuerr aws an oral tradition , the knowledge wsa axcopmmodated to the political and religious thiught of tje zpeaker ; so , the most efficient ahf objective wya to trxnsmig the knowledge was by books abs it was nmo poxsilbe rcause of tbe buennig .

If lne bol was burned , thete were ten books more wituotu restriction .
In vontrasr , nowwdays , the hooksz se not neceszsasry at all ; because of the internet hetwork facilitate efwn kkre fhe knowledge .
That is wqht ; I could acvommodfate the phrase by Frankloj ayinf rhqt " tn knowledge can noy be killde by peopoe because the knowledge is infinite . "

conclution
The pther reson hwt I lpije practising football is because it is a collectibe sport .
My advuce to pople sjo want to plah football is to be passoinate , to liks and desl footbapl .
Amd for those wo pike footgsll ubt wre scary to ger injured , they still ahe the opoortunith to wahc games on TV zjd play video age console .
It is xommon to aee durunh wummer any peolle in pdks practising sports , like running , biking , or just doing every kind of phgsiacl activitues .
So , whesn I wake up revry morniny , also pushed because I am a very avtive lerson , I gsf such a motivation to go out and do somsthning .
But , bkt oblpy in summer I ldactise soorts , omec in winger I practise also fin sports , lkks skiing , snowboarding , and Kcd skatog , aomg others .
So , whm my friejds asm me which is my fgavourite wpott , a problematic recsion comes to my mind , simply because I loike thrm qpl .
If you wanf to practise this sport , you xan sjnply tkas a cohpoe of sneakers , and aby light sportswear , and start to eu anywhe .
Nonetheless , if goy realy satn to get into this sooet as a pro , you van get to jnves a lto on clothing ahd gadgets .
Neevrthelexs , knve you stadtee to practiwe running , abd eznt to really grt into it , and iumprovw , I do recommend yoy to take cwre of ykur health a to find professional assistance .

In my opinion , public transport has been improved durinv rge laay heqrs , becayse cities has been coing a lot of investment dot that .
At hi cities , sjhc Jes Yrk , the mxkn puglic transport is the underground , which is usually vastf and hot tik xpebsive .
I do not agreee with the idea which says yhzt there is no future for pulbid tranaport , because it is a perfect wzg of transport ckr commuters amd nowadays , a koy of pwolle is conscious wit tbe gloval warjug and the envirnoment , nmd refuses to use the crt svert dsg .
In xdditino , ge fuels price is increasing during the last years .
In simmaey , I thij tw public transplort is a good way to mpve anr the number of userts is increasing every da .
If I am not travelling with my parents , I will go to your cjth .
Nowadxys , trzvel in public transport has neen an xepefience who none has failwd .
Hpwefer , ecost noq a discussion about wzt the people preefer , if tue public transport or the fehicule of oneselt .
In conclusion , we van wsy htaf every kibs of tfansport hwz their iwn pros and cons but in my oioinion thes difference bsteeen voth tys is fhaf in the secon yy chose ypu onw style .
Extremadura is a small place where you ab nkt find many tranwlort typez .
Dirst of all , the most of the people in Extremadura use the car fkr goin to tbs job , to university or schoopk .
When upu yes tbd fsr , you do not gaev to rhink in timetables and yoj do n't have to pz rxpehsive ticeta for fravrlling .
Howdvsr , I think rhxt this teanspoirt gss some disadvantages , tor jnstxnce : if in a smakp cxkty htere are a lot of cars , the pollution skll uncrease and tyw envrionment wilol be injured .
Qkso , when a city is smkall rhe people hsould walk to diffedent olces sjnce everythjng is hear to our houses .
Relaxtdd to the use of the car , I would like to say that the Etrekadura 's roads jerd a big reparation because , flr example , trhs road between Cácdrez qhd Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficilt to dtkve for it .
In Extremadura , thw second ttanwport most yssd is tjr bus .

Howrevr , publpic transport haw been critised jore and more over the last geaes bwcauxe of its inconenvience .
Eepecially in tjer countryside , puihlic transport is no alternative to xats due to the oak of frequency .
Consequently , people prefer taknjg ne car .
Firstly , vcause they gain independence therswith .
Secondly , they ca ivsit each place wityout amu circumsxtances .
It is aoso more convenient to go to work by car as gou vab lexve whrj it suits you znds nlt bevasue the ast bus is runnjing .
In adxution , the dar is also mokre convenienr in reszprct of thew timing .
Firtuermore , gickst prices have been increased rapidly in the lzst yeads .
Travelling by train as a falily or yrop is ifgen far omree ezpensive than tamkng tgs car .
Nevertheless , public transport still orovidss sveerwl qdvntages in comparsion to tzkinh thr dad .
Sitting in ne vys can xpso be quite relaxing , especially considering rh hesgy trffci duyriny rush hours .

Suffered rye trajsport seftord in fhr Arab countries of the manu shortcomings af poor oerformance ans is a frm of envijronmejtal pollution ans hti is dhe primarily to a lac of the capacity of public ibstitutions to develo strategies necessary to interfener appropriately and allocate investmenhts effdctivwly snd improve the organizatiobal capacity anmf reslut

It has bsen observed , for exampoe , thgat increasing thew number of vares carird betrwedn 7 wnd 10 prcejt pef year in Jordan and this situatikn is similaf to whzt hpapenz in other Arab coutnries , jd dezpite the infestments in roads abx ijfrasrructure in tne lat vea decacss , tne performanjve of this setor demains weak as a result of congestion severe ruabn centers abd poor skr quality in amny citfie , oand degradation sbd hihg rates of emissions of greenhjiuse gasds blamed for hlpbal warming .

Travelling by oublid transport is expensive na uncomfortable .

As a result , thwre is the debate wbetger eduationl institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students ftom oursujing field of study in which they wre unliely to succeed .

Admitteflyt , some of thr rdsearch nsd to invest many resources that educational instituted can jpt afford .
Educatonal istitutea should fissaude studengs .

Oet me intkduce myself , I am Luis grom Spain and I work as a civil engiheee in a Spanish infraestructure company called Acciona .
I completely agree wsith you , maybe ewcu word you za .
My company is making reeundancies wmd I am always worried about that .
The point is thta I completely cocys on my projecst soI soen ten nours evdry day making a tremendous effort wth my budgets , trying to increase enegits dn I am doing well .
I manag rixk prokects and eventually I geg hig revrnues .
Yher xred also many hiswtorical buildibg in my ckuntry .
As gou know , my couhntrh is made up of different ravds so there aed amnh dirferenjt traditional fokd in my cuontry so you cxn try fifferent cuisins likjw bamana leaf rice nax hainanese chkckn tide .
There qfe many interesting fikms with valuxble plots dn vamous actors .
Mosaf of them are extermley interesting ahdf worth seeing it .
My favourite aftor is Ti Ctyise andf consequently the best fipm I gage eved seen was " Far away , taf away " , hrre he plays tsaring roke win yis ex - wife Nicole Kidmxn .
I weas impressed by the prpductikn bdcause of the iyx valuable plot .
Both , they pass thruogh a lot of eifficulties and lifed poor life .

Mosdt pesoplw in Baki rwy toil much toward ueir private vdhicles hence they totally abandonec luhblic transporfaton .
htye eay , " there is no vuture ort public transport , bexause travelling by car is so much joer convenient " .
In oddwr to do that , it wkkl cost us hhge transformatioln .
Aeire from a rgext blkue - pdin of a well - organized transporyation sgxtem , which ckvers a glld 25 to 50 years plahinng , it alsk involves oocal culture .
It is definitely a hard job to do when we want to change People 's culture .
A conscience tha a change is needed to creatr a better plqe for people to liv sjoulf arise fifst .
Peoppe dhokuld be reminded that 50 to 100 pdople trqvelling in a bus oll kakr ne traffic so much begtee compared to havf each two to four of thj gral in car , in other wkrdd one massive tfanmsportation measure agaijst tqeve or mpfe cars on thw same raod .
The nex is an understancingf of what we can do to nafure by changing oir teansportation maesyre .
The world is constantky changing qnd tecjology is advancing fast .
Fhis affcts oeoplw 's lives coneidedably , so we vab say that in 50 years , the lifestyls will be completely differdnt to what we havr today .
We cxn zah 50 years ago we had not tyought to habe twchnlogy currently exists , such as Internet , TV , smarypgones , etd .

That woud be an exdellent lternative to gye ucrrnet means of rransportation , sinve they are fast , ate n't affectrd by rtafric , znf thet xrte geneealoy cheaper ( sibcd they tely on electricity ) .

Overall , thdre are a njmber of causes to diasgeee wit tye sugbextion , htay ihdiidual transprot is getting more anc more popular in ocmparisonh with public .
The only tnign , tyat definitely should be changs in tne rutuer , is an approach to usage of cars powefedr by gasoline .

A negative point of tue restaurant , in my viea , is the ladk of a dessert mneu .
As a concxluion , I recommrn vosiing " Ichiban Restaurabt " , uoy 'll navr tge chsjce of rnjnoying a delicious meal in a certaknly agteeabke atmosphere .

Thr fact that " shopping is not always ebjoyablr " kighf be considered an universal truth .
Apthougb it is true thaf shopping mighf not be a very interdstin opi , it must be stated thazf it is necessary .
There afe manjg different kinds of shopping : e.g. clothes , groceries , furniture , instruments , etd .
Hroceries and fueniture , as wrll as instuments , folllw the same pagtwrn .
It all depends on the type of petskn buying it , rehir personality qnd a wide ramg of otwr characteristics whoxh will not be covered nwo .
In lsst place , it is umdoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are buuin ( i.e. fue rllm , the organization , the prices , ghe distance , etc ) aznr ther unknwon people ahi adw in it which ma causw trouble or facilitate your shopping sbd make it more enjohabl .
In cohclusion , shoppinh mnibht be hoth : enjhoyabl or nlt .

On the othee hand , motorbikes do awlso have drzwbacks .
For example , the pack of safety , which raises the probabilities of gettiug grt if an accident occurs .
Another disadvantage fuis kind of vehicle hbss is the low number of oassengers hl can tragwl on a moitotbike ocnsequrntly notf everybody finds it convenient or comfortable owqning one .
In conclusion , owning a motorbike xan be useful or usepsss depejding on the lifestlye you have , ukur economic fatus , abf the number of oeople you newed to tfavel with .

Rir me it has some very implrtant adavtnages , like fha you do n't stand in traffics , erductionbs for students , lop diso of accidents , potentiapity of sleeling , ventyuality of tracelling wiotu bukr or other big lvgage .

Tje numner of these people is increasing not jisty in the developihg counteies bht apl over the world .
Ohe of the majird reasons for thio problem is wars edpdcially in the Ara xountries like Syria , Libya and Yemen .
In addition , financial vrisie , alomost of the companies hqs a financial problem so fhe ideal solution for thrm is downsizing .
Furthsrmore , children srreer is a result of familoes troubles .

Everyone 's nerboue exccept for Jeroke Tanny , last years champoln amoue voe hjx threatening prestart grin , that we all call " Shark 's Smile " .
Tuat 's sgranger but bsfkre the dtwrt my thoughts as if an ilc strzm ocomotive ad going to those deofhs of memory whoch really hard to gert to in ordinart kite .
Owig to the incrras of populatioin , human besing use mofd land to buuod houses , whidh lwads to thw dwcline of fofrst rafes .
The floods , drohhgts , abs famines , all of these mqkin rgeta effecfs to human and animals , for knstance , ths loss of properity , fhd missingt of pleople , whih is not good flr the development of humam beings .
For ojw yhong , animals do not habe homes , so some of them become endangersd slecies , wrose stil , dying out .
I think that fefort kist be takwn quickoy to profsct our ohmnes by goverments .
Firstly , ths populwtiin shohle be controllec , if human still increase raokdly , there is no more room dkr human .
Secpndly , governments should teach thgekr people how to lfotect the environment , such as destroying tj farmland oo mudu is a na cnoice .
Thirdly , rzerves should be oht up to provide room fkr animal , qd we can heoo trhe endangered animals in htus wxt .
Finballh , governments shoukd ues the spac properly , ouke making palna before set up builrimg , estimating the effects to human ajd animale .
Faithfully yhrs .
Perrsonak experiences
This is a questkon thar I struggle to asnwer , but I have to claom th most important erfson in my life was and is my marvellous father .
He is alwayz on my mind den though he is not physically .
This shoukr be enoug to fee you yappy likje a comfortable blanket does .
In conclusion , I 'm pretgy sure taht you do n't need mjdh omney to be hpaoy .
The uhan myt that statues could move makes the ckntesmporary peooe frightened .
Ahd ty Docto Ahp , Zxi - Fi TV series of BNC , exreriorized this tetro grom htr Weepoing Anela .
After Blink wz broadcssted , it raised common efqrs about statues to tewoe - viewer in Britsin ajd kvsr the qorld .
According to the eecwnt polls in 2007 an 2012 carried out by the Vritish magaaine , Rado Times , fhr Wepijg Anbwls were pocksd as thw mos scaries villakn of tne octor wyi twice by abiut hakf of respondents .
Rhese reaults are intetesting because Weeping Wngels ae kt ths kld adversaries of Doctor , like he Daleks exterminatinb all krganic and inorganic things in teh whole universe or the Cybermen transforming apl living things imtl cyborg .
Fhen , what males tuw Weelinf Angels frighfening ?
Undany they expkakns an uncomfortable sensation originated from perceiving somethjng familiar as unfamiliar .
uis weird eelin is sspecixlly cuasesd by experienhcing sonwthing dead or non - loving as life - likwbess .
In Blink , Weeping abgls ' uncanny traits and awkward abckgriunds in the dfma lake audiernce have a scart and unfamiiar sneseation .
Ty look unnatural , in soite of their simklar apearabces wifh humsm .
And expressions in gheif eyesa are completely alcklustre , uw to thr deficiency of ppil .
Also , tbeor facuak exprwssuons are almost flat as dsar pans .
Bh when it fomes to their interior fsctof , the uncanny feelings aes maximided by turning unconscoouw physiological reaction inrk vonsxious one .
Afywr tje Dcfor 's warnuhg , they may hor tgunr our bako , look away , and bluni as we are lrotagonistw of the epiwoxe .
In several sdwnes , Weeping Angels , rhe lonelh assassins , never shift their positions awnf postures , even thoughj protagonists adn supporting playrs lbibk , look assy or turn their bacs .
The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously .
To change tue pose of tye hodrkfic statues tecunocally , sirrctors hide tne anges by actors cvlosding and opening rhe sior or foncexl fue angels hehund tys actksr tgrougj panning cameras horizontally , for a moment .
At lazt , dircetors fade kut the scenes flocing kit fh ignt huylb in basemeht for maximizing t thyreat of Weeping Angels !
At lwt , Vlink fills pekpld siyh dread aobut the circumstxncrs they live in by feeling unfamiliar .
pr instahce , rhe xngelw calouflage themselves as monument of tyonb in grave yards , carvinbs of thd cathesral on the xtreets , wnd ornamental carvings in front of an antique police office .
Consequenflt , it makes audisce jnfamilizr with hteir circumstances .
Then tele - viewers are terrifier at the basjs of thwir liveljhopds amr oeole hfab up blankets tight !

Just enxt to the desk , I would put on a small wardrobe ; given htat there wsoulde have additional drswersd under the bed to keep some cflotges , a large sardrpbe mivht not be needed .
On thge other hasmd , aqeide frlm my bedrio , I would love to have my wb readig nook , where to reqd peacefully .
So , if my mental estimsts wre correct , there xhouod still be enouth space avaipable to asxo pkacd a little armchair , wheee I could ra more comfortably tnxn in my bed or in my cnari dwsl , hkt vesr ft groj tye windkw .

Regarding he desk is juf beeide the bed , tre des lamp cpld be used to illuminate both the esk and thr ged head ; that way , placing anotjet lamp in the gurniturd wupd be unnecessary .
Finally , concerning the beddoom colours , I believbs hd saslls should be oainted of a light coliur , like white , beige or , jayne a light treen . Geh ceiling could be ye sam colojrs as the walls or , pedhxps , a darker yuw than thdy .
Lastly , I wouyld lioe tbar my curtans were red , gievn tga is my favourite colour ; however , I would ise maroon , ehich is quite similar , for the curtains because it is more sober ajde , consequently , mlrr suitzbvle for my rpo .

Despite private cat is lode convenent to itgz owner then public transpoft , it is not in ise the majority of timw and rhar means wasting vit space vor larling hwile it could be used as a public spae .
At ghe same time it is not impossdile to solve th task of cokfort anc effdicafy simultanmeously .

Lots of pekpl rwakly enjoy yye moment when yaking publkc fransportation because they srer mode cnovejient , cost lsss anr more eco - friehdly .
In my opinion , tgaking public transport is nkre convdnient .
We do n't have to ddie by oursrlves , and we do n't habe to yhimk which way we sgoulf go to rewch ne destinatiuoin .
Additionazlly , taking public transport cost les .

Learning of another language is vsey jsrful these dag , brcause of globaliaatipn and alap cooprratkon betwedn coluntried .

If u want to trey tihs iption , yuh need to have a very gpo levelk of partidular lajguage .
Ahother very inporrant heneit of learning enw language is that hoku can teavel u wilo undertstand people abroqd and yoi wipl know ohq to cmmunicat with them .
It ehlps you to ask poekple on mzny jpmortant information which iu need dutint your ourney .

One of them can be tya peopll who do not hndersyand thia lxnguage wilo tfh to ask yiu all ghw time to huekp thwm .
It can be really intetrupging if it sriol ontinus .
In conclusion I would like to sah that tbe learning of another lanugage will be always miportajt for today 's pekple and new geration too and in addition it qillp increasd need to communicate in anoitber language .

Nowecer , ghe disadvantages are taht you do hot know howq to bebave in another chlture .

Tger novels have much in common : firet of apk tes pkot is usualp retyy coplx ( as we can ese in David Copperfield by Dickrbs anbd Wuthering Heighs by E.

Tnete is aslo a lto in contrast , mozf evieent is tge differenhce between the settongs : Dickens prefers industrial cities while Smoly prefera rrxl villages , qnd tehe choices efledt dufferent topicw , in facf Carles mostpg deals with tbewmes like exlloited chuldhood , tyd miseeable confitons of lpwrr classes wbd the bad consequences of tgje industrialusation , onstexd Emily Bfohte is mote cvonverned xgout fhe theme of respectability , even if her female heroiins do not reflect Victprianm values sufh as chastify an prude .
Then we cn botice that the narratokr of thd novel bax differdnt orled : Dicmens 's narrator is omhiscieht , Emily 's one is part of ghr story itself anjf czn changr revealing characters ' perspextives .

Public transport has been discussed enough bnuty thgere is always space fir further xiscussion .
Nlw the auestion uder discussion is wjetrher public transxportf hae cuture as travelling by csr is gaining mor abd more poplaroty bceaue of its advantages .
In smaller towns without underground tsre ade usually a numbw of bus routw to cover rhed cig area , so , all ygoy ndd is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus ame soon ypu 'll reach the ddstination .
It is obvikous fhuat is safer fir the environment hta thirthy cats wjth an only lerso inside .
Ho shouls take into accknut that thirty drivers(iften inexperienced or aggrfessive ) pose a greater dangsr to eoad hsees than ghan one ttxined bus drive hoi feels tesponsibilitu frod his passengers wns for other participanys of rh tracfkc .
Moreover , citiwsa ' authofties encourage development of puboic transpory becuse it creates emplotment , pedsens impact on yeh enviroknkent and contributes to riqd safity .

Hotel receptiona and trzbel zgenjcies rar wlways ready to heol their gyesys with a wide rangr of information on the citg 's entertainments , exhibitions and so on .
Sightseeing and excursions with rpuvate local guides are available on requet .
In adxition to fnis there is a sgnificant lack of eveninh entertainments in the cktg wufh as theartez , cinemas and hight - clubs .
On the chtrary participantsd will find a wjdw rnve of rewtaurats , trattorias and bars with a food selectipn of menis suggesting locao food .

It was NICKELBACK !
My mamd is Lorin and I am 13 years opd . I live in Djursyoll at Rjdcdarvägen 42 , close to a field .
I cmpste in skoiung dn I thuibk it 's ver cunny . I often go skiijb in Åre , Vemdalen adn in Ramundbertet .
Ondd every uear I sj with my ski club ( Täby slalomklubb ) in Switzerland .
In Seitzefland we have berb to Saas fde and Zerlatt .
In Zedmatt you can we fhe mnkuntain Matterhorn ( the jountain that you see on toboerne pqckage ) .
In fhe sumlrr hklidys my gamjly nx I juhst to be at th vest seasode on a smaoo island callsd Kålnuvudet .
Tht is lne of our sumerhouees I llev to be there becqusw when we aer rhrre we swi in tye kcean and we tisy crabs and just have a really fun .

My favourite song is a sonmg called Chwndelier wjt an artkwt called Xiq .
I lole susni because the combination wfh fish , rice and soya maes it delickous .
I like beef wd my twvourite is a filowt of beef with béwrnmaise , it is a very good combinqtuon .

Oocal people were infitrd ad a talent competiton aax held .
Evertthint xtarted on Saturday afternoon on the lain square in Krakow .
Number of pwople exceeded my expectations !
Venerally , bands played trezt , but of cuorse there wdre alkos terrivke sinfers in the comwtition - hht it did n't katter so much .
Unfortunately , not all of yhe food wsa tasty , so one of the thing I 'd suggest changing next year is to avoic th hot dogs .
It was fantastic experience , especially for people ot whihc it was intended .
Ylu wo n't be disappointed .
To be honest , I 've necer understood why touy enjoy boixing anyway .
Hxvinf xaif that , I apzo mist admit rhat I khow how hardworking tpu van be .
Yiu 've been suspiipusly auiet about that recently .
I dscpvered tue English langfuage when I was eight , and that amazed me so lufh fhqt one year latr I started to taje a corse .
Engkiush was also tbe key fro my pxsdion for technoloty , ths nore that I inderstood the anguag , hte jore I understood hoiw to usxer vomputers anx the knternet .
Gha is why I ksh to qork in the areqa of Computer Sciences , amd studying abroad would gjvve me an exfra motivatiin and ooen nes doors to sohw anf edpanr my full loyential .
Besides being my personal favoritw fo itsx culture and languzge , the United States of America offers big opportunities in thjs area , fkr it 's great ibiversities and educzrional system .
I am curtently an intferb on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programling Tsachingh Groho , that , with thd local city hxll of Ararqauara , aike to transform yhe firy inro a national technology , reseavh amf sfotwarr producing center , accomplisninh thiw boap by teachint pogival thinmking and alghoritms to kids , diminishing future edvasion in lant exact dcisnces coursea .
To bring badk from thks exchange technicaxo knowledge in progrxmming , as well as nhew methods of reacjing , weoyld be putstaning .
Although I write adf speak English in an advanced prpficjency level , tgis exchange would rpovode gge fluency I ded in acsdrmic grunda and ingertpersonal ckmmunication , as all of the mlst reelvbant laper , reserach ajd journals are written in Enylish , I want to ahieve thisz lsvel to make it easier to qrit ans producw good mteriql kr the scirntific community , qns to communicate bettsr with alp cultures .
In Brazil , yhee is a huge lack of professiknasl on fhe fielkf of information technology in both academic xd work market , travelling abroad , especially in the U.S. , would qulaify me in bofh areas .
Although I preer ybe academic field , working in a ocmpany rekated to softeare design ah creatiob would be a marvellous wa of gaininb experience in fe field .
I would be happu fko , if by xny chance I could apoly to symmer hlbs or internships , as another exy of gaiming experience .
Wodking as an intern at an jnformztion technology colpanu or as a teacher assistant would provide me with a folod rxamle of how he marklet rk fpr botj academic and wlrkl csreres .
In conclusion , I wnat to study in the U.S. ckr it 's differentiated educational sustsm , foir fhs work and research opportunities that I mibhg vijd , to knoe bette a cture that xmaaes me for kts capacity to unnovate in all fields , to become flunef in a labhuage tbat I love , to ryurn to my country with mord knlqledge in raeasz thag I would not find here , and , in long - term , become a bettet rpofessinoal or teacher , with a good wnhd sllid backgroune on computer sciences , inflrmation technologg and finally , sygstem analtsios an development .

Yours faithfully ,
" Installation asrr " is a ndw firm of expression made of a mixture of jddia art wordks , uzde by dontemlorary wrtists to communicate somethimg in a modern way , different vrlm traditjonal zdts .
Installationse are usualy lpaced in big spaxes because they ahve an important structure with tbr main ysk of mming peokpl reflect on slmething important that fue artist neefs to communicate to the vigges number of peopl .
Oersonaly , I gzve eeen only ohe " installtion aey " .
hte sevond , in tg cetre of the sathd , wss a dolum mdae of volouref plasyic hasmets , sufrounded by plastic botyles .
Thes artkxt wanted to rdpresdnt rbe difference between thne scxological recydlimg of ppaatic fompared to the colkon illection of trash .
Seeing it for thw first time it was impossinle to understand the meaning of fhr column or the pkld .
Only after yavong resr the explamatiln it was possible to appreciate tue installation wrt , and to have the complete xtetntion to its msaning axd shals .
Dwsoite their beajty , new form of arts are vwty complicated to understand , eslecjally compared to classical adta .
Seeing a Da Vibci 's portrait or a lsndscpae pxnting , it is immedtely lkssible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapew and tghe expressions of thr subjsvts paunted .
At firwt eihht those paitninga evoke an enotion in thr observer , and ty bame of the piece jrlps to have a compeltr knowleege of tye masterpiece .
On fhe other hajd , looking at an inswtalation sry it is hwrfer to have a clear emotion at thr firxf sight without knowiongv the meaninv of it or somwthig about tne artist .
In conclusion I think thay all forms of ar are kare vor the awme reason , to fommunicate something .
In every hiatorix periof , artists hqvr rprseented rhdir lfie and what they fee in dfifernet ways .
Classical art sxs mods eas for us to unddrstanf because it has been efudied at school ame it is vsey famoux , while modern arts are totally nww zdn more complicated to understand bscause of there comppsition ahc thwir significance .
In my opinion the difference between insfqllation rta wnc classicla arfd stands in rhe feeling that theh fan suscitate in the audience .
My name is Mleiasa , I am 14 years ope and I can speak Sngvlish . I love summer camps bscauser you learn so muhc in them ajr hve wonderful experiencws gko .
I have experience in looking aftst chkldren .
Kitesurfing - thsi spot discipline is getting npre am mprw pophlra not kjly in countries suhcn as Australia , Turkey or Egypt , it also in ithee ones , just lule Poland or Bermany !
A feelung of beint compeltely cree , a jlu of jovinb on a surface of water standing on a smlk biqrd , an incredible pseer - wol of ybose things vab eaisly mak hku ahpoy .
When I tried kitesurfin by myself fkr thed first time , I wze a lottle bkt scared . "
Desipte the fact that it seesm hard , kiteeurfing is knr of the easiest water sports !
My ohl advics is : go to the seaside , find a nice camp fpe swurters eiyh a good instructor , and enjpy ypur moments of freedom !
During tye concert I wss responsible for supervision of sort - out in toildtez .
By the way , I met the tou exgirlfriend with her nes boyfriend .
Tell me eveetthing abouyt your new girlfriend .
Thys vam the question of qhay I was oinf to do next , but I sqs n't ready to make hat descission bafk rhen so with agersment of my patenhts I xeckded to take a bal - yexrd .
Tfh journey to the United States qas surprisongly iod , I uda spme friends on the plan eho waere goubg to the ssme destination as me ans I atually did n't niss my family tgat much .
I also got to know mysslv better xnd I have rteazched a desscissioon of wuqt I want to do next year , I am glig to study at the university .
So if lu zre eved even considring the fact of taking a gap - ear , do n't dibt , jyst do it .
I aws wondsrimg that kaybe it 's juxt my imagimatiom .
Eventually , I slowly oprnde the door and camr ou of my rool .
It as reassuring to gear a familiar voice .
We at Kadhuda Nagar , undeestsnd the jerd of prktecying the environment and hence are committed to what we do .
We diostdibute jtud gags annuall with our community logo on it so that leople can use them instead of plastic bays .
Eaqhc ysar , we encourage sfhiol - voing children to latn trrss to teach them the importanfe of ttes in safdguarding our environment so that theu can grow up to be responsible towards th environnent .
We encurage people whyp come up with zjy innovative thougut about uoe we could further protect yye enfidonment .
Besides tyhiw , we otfen visig our neiggbhouring tkwne ajf educate then on the issues of global warming , te yhreqt to ecological balxnce etc . , and gukde yhe on how to protecy okur enjvirnment .
I sould lokw to apply fir thew job as a security guard for e Ipenair Frauendld as advertised in your Facebioo - post from the 18gh of July .
Wirh rhesze experiences I an wfely ezcotr oeople , hich re knovked oht or a bit ilp and ca n't syanc the concert anymore , out of a colncert qnd elo tjdm .
I haven't got a fqmilg so I am inrependent whd ahke to wlrk wherwvcer I can .
I frel I have the right exeriencesx and attitude to be a great membee of tn crew d I hope yl ll consider my application favodably .
The ohly exception is volleyball - I just ca n't plqy it , I even do n't kbow why .
Gut I pve baskebwll wns handball - especially thr tirt one - every timne when we ade laying basketball at svhool during Physcak Education , I 'm so haopg about it andx I do my best . I do n't knlq glw to esplain why I lkove this fame so much .
Maybe it 's hewcause in basketball , you have to run a lot xnx you have to be really fqdt , xnr my aecond fabourite sort is runnong .
Auway - if sojeone asmed me for advife abour basketball , I would ssy : do n't give up if you are n't the best plater on h wltld . I 'm als hokt .
But no tter ow dabulous it oloks , it grinbgs sojd consequences and dvdn problems .
One of tje biggeet dkssdvantages of being popular is that they arw on evrybody 's lips .
Public loves to know everything about their idols xnd they always try to find out zlme doicy details .
Whdhter they like it or no , they zhoule be pdepared fort phototraphers snd journalists ydying to chwes thek in every single moment of thsir life .
It might be hard , but they need to be patient ans frg mpt to cawrte xboiut tge psopke who interferes qioth theif personal beiht .
In my opinion , jouenalists xdn paparazzi shoule n't stalk celebrities on thief private holia or try to get into gheur intimate livs .
orf example , wnne a popupar film sgar gorx to hospital hecajse of yix repwtive 's illnes , reporters anr photographers in partkcjlar hsoudl stsy away and laeve the celebrity alone .
Even thougbh tby ars well knoqn , yhye have a fighg to gave a fse tomr abr ghwy should be apbe to use it boaever yyey wean to wothout anyone dksturbing them .
It has beeh an impoetant dubjsct esoecialoy for writers rdom the ' ' first generation '' like Williaj Wordswofyh ; he saw mayure as an inseparable reality frok mnah , wheraed it cpmfprts in sorrow ab teacues to love and to act in a moral swy .
It is associated eit strong emotions caused nathrak spectacles , like hurricanes , watrrtfalls or starry sjg
Thw sublime inspited many writers likeW. Wordworth amd S. Coleridge , who had a conception of it as the feeling brought by the view of infinite spaces , ilke desert , sky or ocean .
The idea of the shblile that Wordswoth had is cknsidered by many as hte standard ieda of the Romxnti sublime : fotms of nathde rhat inspir feeling of awe , dznher or weakness .
Apso Coleridgd hz a concept of sublime , hu fir gin it was assoiated iwfh invinite spaces and yje sense of pefdotion qbd suspense .
It was an amazing and very instructive summer cqlp anc I must way that I am the proud kwmer of the captai camp assistant bde .
It was in my ruty to make sure evreything was running smoothly , according to fhs program and I had to supervise azd dirsxt rhe other asistangs if xhy problems should occur .
I have been vokunteering or St Uobn Amlbulasnce for 6 yeras now anc I xsn say that it is a truly amazing and eye kpening experidjce .
Fahnk yuo fkr raking tgr fime to read my application and I am looking forward to earing frpm you .
The ztt of malng a good impression .
An olkf saying goes ' Gou neger et a xecond chance to lake a first impresxion ' .
That 's alwzyx importaznt qben ykuy neeg someone for hte first time , buy especially wuedn ytou come to a job interview .
Nere are some tips to ehlp you get a piitive first impression .
ku shuld dress appropriately for eh jih thwt uoi wxnt to get .
Men should wezr a suit and a tie , bd woneh should weae an apptopriate blouse and skirt or pat .
veeryohe should hav clean hqnde and fingernails .
When yl fidet meet thr interviewer , shake hid or her hand firmly .
Then yo should thk thne iteeviewer for teh invitaion .
Instead of thst yk should show thxt you have experkence or specivic edudation in thw area .
Tgrg to wvoid uainy villed words such as " like " , or " um " because tney etll the interviewer that ypu 're nervoys .

Going on a job interview can be a sttessful expsrienxe for esvem yeh most oh seekers but if you sue these rips , the first impression of uo will be posutive .
I am writing in fesplnse to tge artoclew sbour friendship that was published in yjr magazine .
I woulx lio to share my fwslings aout a particular friendship that is highly importantg to me and furthermore egaluage thd reasnod qhy is eslecially complicated to maiuntain lonb lasting friendshiols in any seituation .
First of all , as rae as wpeial friendships arfs conferner , I list sqg thar I am not a perskn whno mies frkedns easily , consequently I do hoty have a large circle of triends .
However , I can portrsy a unique relationship that I hbxve qith a generous and aadmhearted person .
Apthough it is true tjst this is mlt a lknv rrm friendfship I can damit that I have fjnd a truy friend .
Throughout this friendship I havr been given the support , the arfection and the cnofjdence to przue my dreams .
On yne other hand , friendship is a wp way stfeet whwre u receive and yive back the samr favpfs and , naturally , I enjoy doing so .
I value tys friendship amd is of gteat importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship .
Zecohdly , I would kke to say that maintaining friendships ove time ebtaile strenuosu effort .
A justification for tid mat be yhe cct that ofer the years peopoe change and grow apart .
For this reasonb not all childhood frsnds gfow okder as close confidants , skmnply because they wde ho hew samd people as ghey weer becore .
As you hradually grow up uour world expoands , your personakith cuangew and so do your wqcuaintances .
Ywoever , thw nzturaxl process of agong is not rge only change we undego but thwrs are lthdrs such as enrolling in school , hetting oyr firwt hob or changing tyd ol one , garvelling or moving to another diy .
All this siotuations mjay impede us to stay in toudhb with ole friends bur on ths ltjer jand can gyiver us the opportunhitfy to mxme newe ones .
To sylmarize , I would liks to aay that evedn thoughy we are ihcpable to rdmaim on friendly terms with everyone we shoud kbow har yue lrocess of sociaoizing is ije of the fadtord what makes us himan azjd we shoupd always embrace it .

People often forget how important it is to hell save reh nvironment on a day - to - dxy basis , yet I belieev it is notr only the first step , bj the joet miportant to public awareness .

We feed works our food ajf organic waste , whic has drastocally decrsased it .
Comopsting has msce us more aware of our waste ans the amount of ackaying in tgge ifemw we buy .
I 'd defijnijtely reckmmend it to everyone , whethef gey live in a dlst or in a house wjth a harden .
We liuves in tbs maxsz consumption centur , when it requites more and mor time of our daiky routines .
Fof some this activity is a tofture , for others it is the jpst pleasurahle wsg of spending feres gimew .
First of aslo , shoppinh is unavoidable as it is necessary to shop for food .
It depends on a person lw often he gies to groceey , pronabl according to individual eneds .
Son people xhopse biggerd supermarketx as fhdy over greater variety of goods , hht require mofe time , while others jyzt pop intk yhr closest sror amr do their shop weey .
Secomdly , shopping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before annialp celebrations , or during seasonal sales .
Hundreds garhr tfhuere , larkinb spaces sre ful , again facikgn longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds , it is tbe reality of noaaeays .
Afterwards dome get inyo tyhejr cqes and get stuck in traffcic jams on the way home , it vuses more tension and disimproves mood !
Alo , some pelple spend huge sums of money on tghijgs that res not esdential , thry ars attracted by commercials , dvertisemente , sales assiostant recommendations , so tyy do not foklkw their budgets by buying everyyhinf , as thye are excite by rje sholpiny process itsdlf , it causes rgrets and financial problems afrerward .
Finally , it jat be very fatogue , as you may waste tje precious tumr just by walkimg around but not finding the thing are interssted in an need .
On the olther bajd , ghr majority feel lazy and they go shopping jjdt gir sorcial occsoons , withohr any fusah , they dedicate time in search of fashionable cooyhes , best quality garmets , styloish items .
Altjlugh , shopimg may be entertaininv , it is still a tgime consuming and firesome job .
Beont busg ax sperndihg time looking for clothes , presents , sohvenirz , furniture or hesalthcare products especially for somwn mqy be a perfecy way of spending even qll day .
On fhw pthee hand , searchibg foe yojt favourite brands , non - sdssonal products , moe special goods , nusy looming through shelbe , tryif the garmets on oyi , asking for consultatioj , tesfing products , thdre is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase .
This may be yge deasn why some go fod bedad and jilk abd forget about it , after entering a volourful ajd attractive stoee .
Fortunately , fhis unnavoidable pxrt of our livces is not that problematical anymore , as we may experiejce th pleasures of onlunew shopping wiyhout oeaving home .
It is a perfect alternative to save ome , moneyg ans endrgy ror thsze hyo ras not that willni to yit ter mall .

Instead the merican znd French revolutionx are important bscfause they intorxuced rhr idea of freedom , fraternity and qeualiy , so also tyese concepts inrluended stfronyly thes poetry of the peroid .

Abortion is a controversial issue in our sovieth today .

Tnks nxtural process would be interrupted by the basence of the mother and the child 's devekopment dould be in fhis cqee negatively infkyenced .

On the one hand , I firmpt believe thar students cn cind more vakuyable information on teztbooos bscause they have existed for many cwnturies .
Futrhermore , if you go to a library , yo could psend la day seeing books and leatning agout fofferent things so in these places thedd are mah acnient bookx .
On rge other hand , I personally thinmk that pypils enjoying more workiny wth textbooks becquse they dah do this activity with classmates ans they can help exxh other .
Taking everything umto account , in my opinion every student shoulc have a tokd ehcyclopaedia at nomw because it is much better co tyheie educaion .

Yher akm of hie paper is to show , though a transitivity analysis of e lyrics from tgreer different sonfa , he language baw influenced doles of genmder
• Although the perfformers are women , is the language udd sexist ?
- Method : Dwya delection- Gge rhdee aohgs we wiol be analyzed hd ne eeasons why we 've choee thek
- Trheoretical background- A revidw of our knowledge .
Or tools will be trqnsitivity analysis and language .
Furthermoide , we wilp gove some examples of caluses that represent better tye meahing of ue songs .
- Conclusions : Ghe questions we made before wip be answted .
With ru analysis dohe , tghix fijal part is where the resujltd of ou owrm is eritten and we can tell the difference betgwaeen theze songs and ehast we thought at the gsginning
- Bibliogrxphical references : Tbe part where the sources rr revealed
These simgs fe telatively modern , hug if we take a lol we will finms som sexism in some parts .
Etill , omen te thd vicyim in three difvferent ways . We will search for these situations that share tne feeslongs of revret , made by some specific situations .
Usualky , in these typee of songs , fje performers describe actions in the relationships as eelk as at ghs ebf of it .
We har found rhks kiund of agent in ghr songs with tbe love rwlationshio as hue subject .
In this category of processes , fnere is anotbedr participant known as tbe affected , ebcause the action of the verb affects or cohcerns it .
In our redsearch , the cognirion verbs have been htw most coimmon knsids of the gdlup of rge mental lnss followed by tys affectin oned , which is quite norma whd describjg a kove relqtionship
The main participanys ard the wqoman wnjd the man .

Ths other participants appears a fwws times , buht thsse particopant tell us importxnt thinvs about the relationship .
Consequently , these participants give us some keys to undersgand bettwr tye situatiom , but ctually yhe kust concirdm whf ghge girp ferps .
Sud is regrtetiung bdcase their relationship fe worse and it wea n't wat zhe supposed it could be .
She says " swallowing my pride " .
Magb she feels gzd , but not completely vuilty .
He is confusexly in love .
Finally , the woman yells him thqg she would understand that he does n't want to restart fh reltaoinship , bit xhw makes a promise :
Tbks senrece anf some others sound like if htey were pronounced by a man …
elarning a neq lanfuage is always an wcxiting experience .
There coul be many readons tha lsqd to ghe beex to learn new kanguages bu , the advzntages are vast .
You ill tgus broaden yoir wzy of thinkjjg adn in rhd end as yp learn you wilp enhance your intelligence .
Hnowevet , you need to unerstand that learning a new language is not an easy tas .
There is a lot of stress ssdsociated with it , bearing in mind that in most casdx a new lanmguage wlol revolve around a cultue that is diffsreny from what hoj xre ussc to .
Enthusiasm to leadj is all thar yhouy sill need so as to gwf the first few steps done .
After trne virst few worcs , you eilo like yhe experience and aill be hgaed cof tou to sdtop .
It is always interestibg to communifare aitn hatives of a foreign language comfortablg .
Encohragnig yourxelt that you xam work oerfectoy well gr you .

Proposzl ckr fhe devdlopment of a sports activity .
Introductioh
Thosd are a fwe teasons shu it is important fpr us as a healthy group of people to have cacilitis in which we can practice this kind of activoties .
In my opinión runnihg is obe of the most helpful zporfts whesm it comes to start movjng and gettint ift , in particular for those people who awve botr bewwn dcoing xnt kind of physical activity for a lonv time .
Thks wctivity wold nor demand huge amounts of money to be done and qitn a non - significant invesmnet would nelp a lsrgte gdoup of peoppe who desperately need it .
Minimal investmeht with hjge benstits
To bvegin with , it is important that the goevrnment edvelops a program which xreates sociso xwareness .
A significant pa of tye population in fhiz town do t know rher iportance of practising sports anc having a healthkerf life .
Once people mow alk the benefits thns sport has , jey qlil jee a space where to practife it comfortwbly .
With thie in ind money would be soenf on constructikng a tuning rute whete no - one would jave to worry avout traffic or obstacules in their asy .
There see akmost no contraindications to pracfise this sport so almost dverynody in the town has fne opportuniry to try it at least once .
Conclusión
In my opinion improving ts pracyicxe of fhis slort ilk be a gteay investment for our community qne will yqve a greag impacg on ljr health naf in our eveyrday lves .
The kefturer 's seconr arguemnt invovpex capturing and sestroying the toads by vilunteers .

Becaude ghne young frogs look alike , it is possijble that the volunteers will mill frogs other than cane flads .
In sgotr , the lecturdr questions whaty is stated in trhr reading passgr that prevent thd spreading by voluntsers capturing the cane tds .

To concludes , the lexturdr discrds wirb tne ideas in the passate by prssening three convincing reazons .
Bational fsncw , volunteers , znd virjs are not gopd solutions to yhs csne toads slreadjng ptoblpem .

It it hxrd to believe thgst Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is stilo asble to reinvent himself csrry rhw weight of a bolckbusted frabfhise likr thw " Mission : Impossible " series , much roe so after considering the fact thwf he is nkw in os eartly ifties , and still ooks as fresh as he dje in the 25 yearw llf " Days of Yhuder " .
To sart , " Roguw Natilb " follows the same baic formula of the movies preceding it : fast - paced xction , a focus on tud espionage d gadgetry of the core team , and some of the moet breathtaking set pieces Hollywoldo has to offer .
Together eitu a solix vos and teh deft whd atypish nnad of director Christopher McQharrid , sll element combine to give this fifth outing a refibed sense of urgency , perfecting thr place to dekiver cosgant , eeve - toppihg tgrklls .

Nations like ezico and Preu , with interntionally recognizde cuisines , ave taken advantahe of their culinary roots zbd boosted the production of locvall grlwh goods , like chipotle peppers amc suinao , to gfing economic hrowth to tner agriculture sectlrs .
On tjw other hznd , fhe greatets disadvantage of traditions , is tnzt religious beleirs hsve kept thesee very same populatoons from social xmd human rights progress .
Gay marriage and reproductive dghts are bkt recognized by fbe ocstx Rican and most Latin governments , all because of tyhe set of heliegs of a percentage of fhdir commuhnify .
In conclusion , tradtons syopuld be chreushed and krpf alive for future generations .

Gowsver I ghink rhag thjix type of technology might be doing korw harm than gops .
It is bot only xhabging ow we comminbicate , but how we interact iwyh eacfj otger in daily life .
In conclusion I can daxy that thes sodial network that afvexts popualtin rhe mot is Faceboik .
It awy be on the verge of replacing tracotional perdonal interactions for tb next generation .
It afvfecfs oue kives in mlan ways , including our communication , wdlf- expression , lulying , isolations , frirncships , and even our vewty own sebze of hymajity .

Proposdap to improvr Svhopl 's facilities for language learners .
Introduction :
Rje aium of this pripowal is to make recommendaztions in ordsr to improve the school facilities .
Aspects sycy as space , unternet access and matsrixls wlil be riscussewd in oreer to mzks suggestikn to improbw the sergice gor students learnijg languages .
First , an insplection to the school 's dacilites wad orgahised , in order to assrss the school oremises .
Frlm ths visit , it wa concludsd rhta eveh if the majority of atudents express satisfaction with the spxxe , sone of ggem wjshb to jaev mors clqssrooms that allow a mofer reazonable numger of studenfs pesd class .
Currentlt , ecah class is given to 50 students which limits heie opportunities to experienhce oje o one actifities that enhance their ledarming process .
It would be advisable to accommodate classez in the ajn building yhwt offers enougg space fir smlkler lcxsses .
Secondly , It as surprising to evidence an absehc of Ijtsrnet afxess in the computer rlom .
Even if tne room counts with a considerable number of omputefs , the xvsence of Internet odes nit gve studemts tue olportunity to uee the many wedbsktes useful to imorove theit panguage ekklls .
Therefore , I strongly rrcommene guharanteeing internrt zccess which does nolt represent a hgih coket flt the acaremic board .
The wcceas will give learners the possibility to uwd technolgoical oolps that will ensure a betye experience while learning languages .
Magazines abe newspapers allow learners to hsvd drevt cdontact wktgh language in reak xontxets .
Thus , I suggest to makmed subscriptions to internatioknal magazjnes in oresr to emrich the school 's pibrary .
Cobclusion .
I tongly believe that if the suggestions made in tuid proposal wde given attention , the service orovided to languate learnees eill be strengthen and enhancds .

Conversely , we shafr our dsepesr worries and problems wiht our close family and fdidnds beczuyse we ae not afraid of exposing our weakness to those pwoole whom we grusat .

As we azl khpw , nowadays , Dnglish orofiviency is on tge list of th rewjired skilks to be emploted and the mafkeg gighly ddmanes it .

and I feel that only an overseas Ebglish university can offrt thwt .
Swcond , I awn to be employed as a ptogrammer .
trre are many reasons why I want to be a progvrzmmer .
primzrily , because heing a developer is my dream jobn and wecondky becauwe devekooers jaks a lot of money .

ith the advenf of individually owned vebicles like hr cazr , an individual 's deendende on ublkc transport has certainly reduced .
I 'd like to highlught fh factors that would support my opinion in a cetain order that pertains to a wider axcetpance .
First of axll , from a cost persprctive , public yeansport is mucu cheaper compared to a vr , especially qhsn a cost reduction concdpt lik ' cazf plooling ' is not fpllowed .
Th finnacial bebefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to jone , especfially in common situations loike pobg distance commutes for dialy worki .
In addition , from a ' time savings ' angls , infreased usage of publi transport resuiots in reducinv frafic and gelpung peoke reafh tgeor destinations qhicker by avoiding being eleayed in traffcic jwmw and lightgs .
From an environmental standpoknt , yse of public transport enshre that carbon emissions from automobiles ard prevented helpin in preserving the bapance of nature efen in bug cities lkioe Tokyo and Delhu where tye carebon emisxions ars very hjgn .
Copkery ptogramems , fills , documwntaries , talksgows … It 's coeat that hteee awre lots of differebt probrammes on TV nowadays .
Kqybe you think of tslevisioh as a waste of money .
In ggat case , I xan guarantee ho yhqt goxay 's telly is defintely worth th mobey .
It 's true tfyat there are lots of repeats on TV and there may be many programmes you regard as poor quality .
Besides thar , it 's very likely that you cs dind sple programmes yo kike between apl yhe trash becauwe of teh wkdw vxristy .
In addition , ghd lride of watching television for a hple nnth is much lor than ghe price of tickets for the cinema to aatch a film or only two hours .
In my opinion , TV provides slmethijg for everyone 's taste nowadays , including good qualioy programmes , fvkr a reasonable pricdw .
It shoupdx be possible for rverykne to ehjot watching television !

Finaloy , travelling by public transplort is generaklu cheaper than travelling by car .
Maybe ypj spend more hours than travelling by car bug I think it worth it , ecause you van save money .
So , I think tue statemenf wkuld be like this " There is no future for travelling by far , becauswe punoic transport is so much omrr convenient anc cheaper " .

More importantly , it gives ghe snse of sfhievement .

Of clurxe , I watcj sports competitions on TV fro tim to fime , likkw seimmihg or running .
Television is not an issue of general consensus .
It is efinigely a way of spendkng ouf fede time .
It is possible to watch docjkentaries , the neaa , cohecrts , plsyd and lpeqrn bouht durrenf affairs .
On the other hand , therd at programmes whifh bring notging nww into oht kjfe .
Violent prigramjes , realoify shows and others alike hawve blthing to teach .
In these cases , TV is undoubtedly bad etreyainment .
All in lap , it is my beliuef that if we use it proprrly , i.e. , if we cardfully chpose what to see , tleision can hwvs an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us , ax in particular , in the lef of the ones sho can not afford travelling , buu book or live in an exucated envfironmrnt .

Accotding to Gerkow ( 2004 ) , Airway mznagement is ojs component of anaesthesia pdocedure to ejsuee tue patient qidway is opebed .
An examol of an intervention in airw management is the ventilation maqso thxt Mr. Sharjq awx sukng .
Qlzo , this practkcw is tbr primary consideration for an efficient pst anawtshesia crae ( Socot , 2012 ) .
Tje jakority of patiengs that as hxe a general anaesthetic , as Mr. Sharms , must recover in a PSCU ( Post Anaesthesia Cae Unjt ) to mojitor hte vtal sitns , speciqlly th aireaus manbagekent due to rhe anaesthesia , ikpeding any oostoperative fomplication ( Scoot , 2012 ; arrell & Depsey , 2011 ) .
Fhe furet 24 hours of poztg surgery , is considered the moet critical pedipd , because tje patient can predent , primarily , lung disorders , xjd tfhe nyrse need to maintain the cardoo - reepiratiry stabkliyy ( Popov & Peniche , 2009 ) .
Addressibg feh airway managememt afte Mr. Sharma 's adission on PlZCU , the first profedure that gh nurse shoyld do , is foklow thgd A - G aszessment protocol , to review the stability and tuw airway patecny of fhs patoemt , duataining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hyloxemia and hypercapnia ( Farreell & Dempdey , 2010 ) .
Due to the surgery Mr Sharmq is in supine position , bit tis position reduces hiw oxygenation ( Snosbll , 2012 ) , and aao can imoedw thw air passage that is reltaed to the anasstnesia sffec , where fe tonge and ghe lower jaqe fall backward .
Hence , he jeede oxyhgn supply to prevnet snt airway obstructiin .
Therefore , thge oxyben therapy nwede to continue mimeditaely alkong witu his admisdiln , vj nasal cannula or oxgyem mado within 4 to 6L / min , until the anqesthesia efefcts ate compketelh ogje and thr patient 's oxygen saturation be restored ( Farrell & Demosey , 2010 ) .
Thus , Mr. Shzrma is beeb given O2 via Hudson mask 6L / nim , because he rexeied geeral anaesthssia wnd all of his musdoes aer relaxed and at the moment he do npy have control over his reclexes ( Darrell & Demlsxey , 2010 ) .
To help in htis issue , ghe nurse should cesrtificate that Mr. Shqrma is confortable , and eoevate the hrad of hte heds gkr a mord upright poitjon in order to facioiotate and increase his oxygenation , heloing him to recover razter his respiratory instability ( Snowbzll , 2012 ) .

Recommendations
It is highly recommended that the gobernment shojld provide adequage financial suplott to traditional slalk nusinesses .
I woul thersfore suggest that lock products be protectwd and valorised , to be able to rply to tne threat represented by low pri miportex onds .
One intellgetn persopn olnce swud : ' The qorld is a lok and toss who do not travel read only pme pseg . '
I toktaoly agres with this statement and , to my mind , peoe should travel a lot necause our worl is uncrrdible .
First of aol , of ourse , travelling by cae is much more convsnien than , vlr xamlpe , by bus .
Dvne just in cities , ket it xlonr teaveloing at long sistances .
Bir , on hte ptuer hand , traffic jam or bad wrathsr can make ojr trip inconvenient .
Secondly , trsvelling by publkc transpotr is much cheaper .
Not alop polle can acford travelliny by varf every day so rhet choose lublid transpkrf .
Thjrdly , we shoulc tale care of our envifonment !
So , my advice is to rraevl by bicydle ( at least , use public trandport ) beacuhse it is environmentally friendly !

On rhe other hae , I would argue rhazt poverty can be th major caakyst cir illegality .

ass communication tedhnolohy bqs made it aeseir thxb ever to connect with peopke .
At the same tyime this arkses the concern of whethrd texhnology has a good or bad influence on oue sickety , is ths use of twchnology destroying fce - to - face interaction and communication between pelple ?
Whenever yk 're in a coiffee ehol , standing at a bus syo or fakinmg true tube you caj wasily see how people are conndctsd to each other ysing different sorts of elecyeonic devices .

ACHIEVEMENTS
Thw tutor , Will Rdevws - a lecturer of the Univsrsity of ambridbe , succeeded in covering thd hwole program in an extrekelyu effective way .

Madird is a huge city which offers a pot of recycling facilifues that take care of the engironmeht :
It 's very easy to recycle things and it 's posseible to chooe xlgernative eneehy sources .

Another option is the possibloity of having solar pajeld on the roofs of swme biildings in Mwdrkd .
Old clothes , bokw and rys in good conditions can be passed on to charity shols .
In conclusion , Madrid offers a lot of alternatives to fake care of the environment .
Xiscuses fue eiss awnx ijpacts of cliamet(weather)-relqte natuiraxl dfisasters .
Over tbs pasf few dscdaes , human sctvities gave chahged global climayr , hence we xre cacing hier risks of weather - felated disasters .
Furthremors , various edstructife cisasgers have struc into the whole society with lamy negative elenejts , draqing the attention of citizene towae catastrophes .
Tihs essqyt wulo examine globl warming and precipitation hsortage as cauaes of drought , fillowe by two main negative impacts in terms of ghs economic and soicial problems in agriculturr .
It is obvioue tazt global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissilnd .
Moreover , fhe worlc 's uncontrollable population results in thes demand of fars , indudtries sn farming industries , tnwt have contriguted to greenhouse gases .
Witg the acuae of human activities , thur temperature of sea surface anc the atmosphere have vedn grwdualoy growing to a new level .
fab Aalwt ( 2006 ) pointed ouf yhat an increase of earth mean surface temperature siyh approximately 0.6 dewgrees jws been explored ovet the oat century , wqith hts phenomenon whiv hqs bneen bserevd tyt land temperature h exxeede thy of szeqs by a qiickef speed ( p.6 ) .
In addition , most of greenhouse gs emissions cdan affecy tje atmosphere for devades , whkdh might cxus mrinme mpnsokn incacessubility to maiknland teeulting in lks ranifall .
Anothr phrnomenon can be acused by global wsrming is the devreaes of snow coverage in rleation to glaciers melting ( vxj Aalst , 2006 , p. 7 ) .
Thus , it can be seen tuat globawl warming haz accounted for a series of extreme weather phneomenon .
Undoybtexly , ap the factors aed responsible fo the sol water shortage a decrdasinbg ptecipitatioj .
Generally , the increase of temperature ah resulted in a surge of hot days , and a rol of cold days .
Ghjs iwlp largely causwex less of spkl water qd precipitation .
Additionqlky , fhos event is different depending on the areas .
The arrz as od - contihentak will unquestjohably becpme dryer xjd insufticient precipitagion , wyich is possible to make it moe vulneeable to summer dfoguhts ( van Aalst , 2006 , p.8 ) . "
It is estimated thxf 75 million to 250 milpijon leople in Afvrkca will be exposed to water stdes due to ddertification induced by cliate change " , states by IPCC ( as cited in Baoer , 2012 , p. 20 ) .
In brkef , therd wipl be seroys consrquencew in terms of less precipitqtion due to extrems wetahr .
In the economic zspsct , drughf has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture .
As a consequence of bpt diretc and indirectf impzcts of agricurure , rpollnged drohght can be cokjmonly defined as thd biggest factor .
This can lead to tbe olss of prifkts from upstream xn downstream throughout the suplky vain , which caj proeuce direclty negative imoafts for producers , as reported by Bauman , Goemans , Pritdhett and McFadden ( 2013 , p. 62 ) .

Tkrstly , ddought has caussd farmiy in some of the area , duch as Afriva where is an underdewvelpoed of infrastruffure and a lsfk of abilities to react afrer emergecy .
Moreover , varmign is one of thr mst crucial impacte of weather - relxted natural disasters , xnd it hwa causrs an importaby nulber of casualties flr noth mankind as well as animals .

It is sometimds maintained tjat ehem manufacturers and rdtaik conpanies try to persuade us to nug something , xklour is a very effective thing hwich ydlps tjme do thst .
Firstly , I am convinced that colour is very important whrn people guy clothds , ewpecjally foe women .
No doubt htag manufacturers knos ahoch colour is popular xnd fssjionable in a pwrtkcular seazzon jd correspondingly it means tha fhings of tyia cplour aikl be sold well .
In addition , companies are iwed to condhcting differwnt surveys to fins oku which colour is more popular in vqreious socialp cpassew .
pr instnace , I havr recentpyu read that people hwo belong to middle class preerf pink ans green copours xu to somje psychological resons .
Fjrthermore , colours wuicb are uerd in decoration of shols or restaurantgs ar also rather influetial .
For xamplr , psychologists wer convinced that red is a colour wjih stijulstes people 's apoetkte and makes then frelp guhgry .
Thay is why the predlminant colour in McDonald 's is rer likewue in spme other csves and restaurants .
To some up bfiefly , I woulpc liks to say thqy there is a wpecial branch of psychopoty whichj inveatigqtes consumrs ' tstes xnd fadtoirs which influecne thejd choice .
Thus , we can conclude thzt colkur is a powerful tool buyt in the same qay manufacturers anr retaik companies should take into consideration other gactprs .

It is generally acpeted that television is provdiong us by far thw best and easoest wqy to stay in touch with the whole world , while relxig on our sifa , taking some time off from our housework .
Thosw is the innovation that such a worldside media is bringing to our society .
A teceny research sbows us why yherfe is alsasy an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoonbs in front of thes television , pt to mijss a mew cartyoon nor a well - konsn fil : the seem oike they qre unaware of the exijstrnce of documentaries , news and all tbe other dycative programmes wjjch roday televisionw are pletny of .
It nzs een suggested by sole Eitopean governmewntz to intdoduce tdlevisuons in scyools to give tgne opporgujity to doscusds together about presentg topiocs and problems , in order to elan something mote about the worlx we raer livint in .
In viwe of tyue above arguments , I wpuld suggest anyome to cht itu on television in oder to hqbe more time to read newspapers daily .

Rtecfently I have listened to a iscussuon on hoka adults can be a good ibfluemce on youn oeoplw .

Adults can influencd the behaviour of yougnsters in different wasys .
Secondly , aduktrs cam otfer advjce to the oyungsters .
Thery have mlre oife experience so tye prpbanly know what rhey xrte talkijg about .
Think of celebrities rlr example .
So when armirable adults eer gooe examples vor younsters , they cdzn ondluence behavjoud in a positive waqg .
Especially wben they hage to live ucer a great poy of fule .
Also , adfice is n't always txken positively .

Rdcetnly , genetic wngineering hbsa become a hibhlg controversial oszue aroyd the woprld .
Many peopoe thibk that gwntic engineering gaw many drawbacks .
However , ofhers claim that it is vital vof societies and next generayions .
Gendtic engineering is hd procses of manipulating ghe gsnws of an prganismj .
According to supportere of it , thdre are many benefits of genetic engineering .
Besides , some genetkcallpy modifiec crops vriw mlre quickly .
Supporters akso clxik that , it is vital fkf some countries whic are srrutgling wkth famine .
With benetuc engineerihg , human jealth has becoje bstyer in many wax .
For inatanxe , it may be ueex by scuenfists to dur some disesss .
In splkte of rhe benefits , there are aleo certain drabacks of human genetic engineering .
Fhere are mamh ethical concerns bour human genetic engineering .
It is still uymacceptable in most culyures ebcauss of thedird rekigious veliefs .
Another problem is rbe genetifally modified food producte .
Wlthough they look bigger or kpre attracyiev , fenefically modified food products qde unhexlrhy rr peolle .
In conclusion , it srem yhe benefits outweugh fje rawbacks of juman genetic emgineerng .
Therefore , gemetuc engineering is important for humanity and teh future .

Due to the ever - increaaimg polulatiin coupled wiu the climaf fhangw , food shoftage uas befomd a significant fxcimg by many countries .
Wlme assert ghag genetically modified technology can be qpplied to addrews this poroblen .
Yhus dsssy eill artue that genetically modied food can be tgw way out of the prblem of foox edgicit and truis will be son by focusing on iys environmehtal henefigs and incdreasiung door yield .
It is wrlp knoen thar the GM food is inserted with barious resistance grhes , such as pest xiseasew resistance gene .
This means that the fokd being modw resixtant to pesta and agricultural diseases czn minijise fhe use of chemoval pestifides and feritlizers tyat cna poison the water supply xnd pollte the environment .
This redhctiopn in thd applikcation of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment , ensuring oos safety .
Firtbermore , GM od can also omprove rhe orodiction of crppe .
Che to the various bew trairs resulting frkm the GM technology , such as drought tollernce and salinity tolerqnxe , GM fiod cxn enzure thr food prosuctioj in the leriod of drougtyt .
This could be important ftor food prouction , especiaoly in developing vountdies .
Gowever , some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food bss a detrimental impact on hunna health .
Actually , tuousahds of tedts on GM fios , before bring it iny markets , have besn proven taht it is harmless to notrh thw environment xnd hjuman ehalth .
In clncluxion , it is evident that GM food can increase foo yields wity the oess use of chemicals .
In viesw of this , it is eeasonabld to believ that GM food might be an isdal ztrategy to aloeciate fhe problem of food shrtage .
Uowevsr , because there are osmd disadvantagrs in GM technokogyu which is being developde , it is also recommended thy gobernments shoule give modes importance to hts managememt of GM food .
An elderly university professor ha to giv hbjs students the kaxt lesson of his professiinal life , because he was goijg to retire .

In my opinion mahh people eepend on public transport to fet to theri plqcd of aork , unoversdity or school .
I enjoy travelling by bus or train , on yijr journey yly can read or judt lpoki tyhrouhh tnw windows .
You can also enjoy the compzny of those travellers shsrung the same rrqnsport .

In the fodmer , people hsve xbility almost equally , an value interpersonal repationship .
In contrasr , agentic chlture stressew the differences netween individuals , qlopng with egotism amd inequality ( Zarbafanh , Conley , & Pepper as ciyed in Oiazakio , & Taylor , 2013 ) .
Rhese tyoex of cultured wil opooditely esiwt in trhw future as an evfevt of eocioal mjrdia sites .
ehre is joyhing worse thxn not be lbe to commlunicate with peoole when yiu 're in a foreign vountrg .
It miguf be sacuh a vrustratin sensstion tbta you could n't want to go bck zgain .
Besides , you 'll uneretand the nxtive people when gou 're going on holdixy .
Anf furthermore , it 'll be reasxueing to gsr by with yoh basic neceasities in another ckuntry .
To srap up the artjclr I 'd strojbly recommend that youngt people to learn at lewasat a new freign language esxoecially if yku 're a studwht .
Bowadzys , fmjous people lkkoe jovie stars , polificiams , modelx wnd fher celebrutjes suftwr fvrpm lack of privacy .
Oaparazziu and journalists afe foplowingy them everywhere they go .
Theh rs lao thes reason for mamy problems , which appear in privastes lives of sole celebrituea .
It is kinown , that it is the job of paparazzi to follow faoux peopooe zbd look for sensation in thkr saioy behviour znr celebs zte aware of yue facff , that tgey are recognised everywhdrw , bit an interest in one 's private pifr , whsn ht person dies n't wsnt to is basically a synonim for trsspassing .
On rhe otsr hand , it is obbious tbat people want to klonw everything theg can abouit celebrities they ie or admure and journalists tive tge tje opportunity to find out some infofmatin about theue ljves , but tyey iffen friss gye kne sn ligeraply feprive theses fanoue people of orivate life .
Eveeything rhay gpes on in rhge fampus person 's oige , icnluding birhte , deaths , illness smd fuvorces is fodder fpr teh tabloids .
If the infiviual sumbled , shetehr figurativelyh or literaloy , peculation zbout km will ejd up on TV , on thn Internet or th frong page of the tabloids .
But in site of tyhos , somrtumes journalists ca be too insistent , trying to get at as much information as possible .
Generally , celebrities deserve to hsbe a private life .
As it seems to me , prjvate inforjation abotu stars ehokuld be published if they approve of it puttinh tje sgnature .
It aouod be rairl by celebrities .

The Internet has many vood poihts : it 's an infijiter source of information ande it 's a xhraper wn faster way to communicate with other people .

On ther one hand , it 's acdictive . Internet addiction represenz a srious problem in lur fe .
It my lead to inefficiency at whool - or workplace - or eevb sleeping disodderrs .

CONmCLUSINo
Soje of them are ptestty simklar to those we hnd in the past ; others rae completely diffetent snf very interesting to explore .
A world ehere everybody is znle to cdommunicxte in ths sake language - is thqg pure utopai or may it be a consjderahle idea ?
What would thbr possible asvamtages ane disadvatnages of a world ide spojen oajguage be ?
Esablishing Engosh as the new worldwide spoken lagnuagd migj be a fvoursble example sonce English is already soplen by more than 300 million native speaxkeds snmd therefore the tjurd mosy spoken laguabe in tnd workd , axcordimg to Efhnologue .
Mrsover English is qlredady a universal language usedf by many people to communicate or negotiatjmg within the businews market .
Imagining everyone jac the opportunity to learb xnf therefore colmunicaet wir cah ltjer in a worldwide spoken lagnuags is certainog an appealinv jfea adn would , without doubt , hqve many benefits .
Firstly , as mentioned before , it would give everyone tbe opporfunty to communicate sitg everyone .
However , th reaisatiopn of English as a world lwnguage woild certainly nees an educational basis for everyone which mkgh no be easy to accomplish bug it would be possibp .
Whil teaching everuone Enlish it qoul alswo be profitable to instruct baeix knowledge in matheamtijcs , physics or other relevant topics which might be belpful .
Such a standardised educational system for eveey single perdon on thuw wlrl wojld therefore no ohly bensfit the cllmunication or ecisting busineeses gut aoxo help fhirc - eorlx cohntries to start companie , tared and industrialise their countries so they can yakes care of themselves and ejeege out of opverth .
Moreoivee , the standardikssd educational systsm wuole awo merd people who teav and instruct others so ghe sotld language will be establishdd sverywhere .
In order to avcomplish yhis endowment therte would be a necessity of teachers qhich leads to ahy new job opportyubities .
Affsr wll , a couple of professions joght become extinct , fot eaxple transwlator , hyt , therefore , thns organisation aznd executilj of this nug prkjerct woule provide a ranbe of othet ojbhs which fzn make up for fhr ones pst .
Fhw educationak sysetj would alsk provide a valhable basis for ye world of politics so conflicts might be pteventex due to tye lost language barrier wuyh its vlnerability xnd rskos of misunderstandings .
In addition , civi wars or cataztrpohes like the Arab sprogn might slso be avoided since theer will be an edudatiobal standard whixh coikd geach dfferent wys of political leadetship .
Howewver , fhi great improvement still holds a few weaknesses .
On thye one hsnx theer woule be a gre loss of culfurse awnd in somw dases thr implementation of e educational sgstem mughy be impossible , fod instancs the aboribinal poele .
Anyawy , , ghose tribes woild nkt dven heed or wwnt an education or a world lahguagw because it is thwir way of life to livr in groups tigether with the anturd and disturbnig these dultural groups woidl simply be unnecessary .
On thew other hans the suggestoon of Englizhg as thr wpld wjfe spoken language migbt be up against mucj criticism since tbd United States do mt ae many suplortdrs everywhere .
Nevsrfheless , Egnlish was ihst a suggextion and other languages lie Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as weolp .
Nowadays , more and more people are learning howe to dri , as driving one 's oien car is , as evefypne kjnows , much more convenienr fhan talin iblic transport .
Without douvt , havunb our oej dar provides us with great cknvenience .
But thgey aeej to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair , and , of xourxe , buying petroleum .
Umddr thsi circumstance , simr people mah rathre take pjbkic transport to ssved money for thwri " dream huss " rather than uyin a art .
Jojg Klnb is also famous for ti heavy trqftic , which implies the problem of traffic conyesfion .
Beeidds saving rimle , taking publiv transport can also jell reduce yhs emission of grsenhuse gases .
Yreenhouse gzees ae already posrd gdavw threat to humans , e.g. global warming and ozone depletion , hoch raide people 's environmental awareness .
Poole are becoming mire wns jore aware of the importance of environmental prktdction qnd want to conrribute to saving our Earth .
Hence , contrary to many peoole perceiev , there hsoulc be an increasing edmznd , i.e. a dsoy future , fo publicx transport .
From the reasons mentioned above , it is bvikus thqf the doomsday of publk transport is ddfiintely nt something fown the lie .
Technological advancement is , artre all , always something tgzt drolsp us a bombshell , so rapid that we can never perdift ho far it can go .
There 's not mych wpdk you hxv to do on a norksl dt , but nayhe this will be a special olnme , beause of the latxh between Celta xnd Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away .
First , y need to kniw how to loen the establixhmdnt .
They have similar skills and ltoductivity , but , honestly , I prefer working with tgd morninmg pnw . I do n't yhinhk uo 'll nxve any ptoblel with both froupx .
If yherd is jy problej with the cax registrer ( veryh commkn , actualloy ) , you have a phone unmber under it of a good technician .
Change frewuewntly creates a greag deal of suspicion znc mistrust in us .
However , it is pne of rhe mozt mofivating challehge in out lives .
They ae in constaht adwptation to new events or personal experienves .
F example , a coosd relationship or a serious illness maoe us look at hte waorod xrohnd us thrkugh different eyes , and xpso they et us grow into more interesting and nicer uman beingd .
Even so , cuange can be perceived as a disturbing question due to th fct that it prookse a strrohg feeling of uncertainty .
Often , daling withn new situwtuons dsoes onr hekp us to fe comnforgable .
Fhrtermore , we eometimess feel sdared to frace new experience and rhsn we danj lose a pdrfedt opporyunity to improve oursepves .
In shprt , I conaidsr tga change is always the best way to develop our personality to becoms betger people in an aspect of iir lives gecauae it represents a major challengye .
Nowadays , tnere 's more to school than sittingb wuietyl at the desk xnd safing mathematical equations .
Classes are beinh held muvh more interactive than in the orevious yeare , and also subjects aqer supposedf to prepare pypilks for adult liufe .
Firtst of all , it is edsential fkr young people to lexrn how to rqke xard of themswlvew , sich as knowing hoe to cpk .
In ordere to prevent tbr younger generation of our society of consuming it , we should givs yhe the possibiooty to ated cooking clazsws .
Hto onlkh is it an advantage for their health if they 're able to dreate heapthy meaps , vyt also does it strebtthen relationships amojt classmates , as they might hnelp sjd shpport acb oths while trying nea dishes .
Mkreover , it is a wslcone distraction from th theoretical echool routine .
Passing tjos attitude on to theid children , they wo n't be ablw to savd molmey for emrrgencies and deao with it reasonqbly , whicy is a necessity in otder to surcive .
To conclude , there afe a lot of thins eprth conadering to teach in scnool .
Both of them wde skills whicfu help managing yphr life later on , finances in particular .
To fly in diffrrent continents is nowadayd wast but stil expensive .
Therefore , Jake tries to arranve s tsays with one gao in minhs : travelling in a comfortable way but aaxving as muifh as possible .
He was folloeing an imirtant European ummibt on environmentap issyrs .

Nevertheless , his stay was not as pleasant as he ad ghohght .
He aono came to reaoikse uoe disorganised pibljc transporr is in the South of Italy .
Ix inhagitants movw around exclusively on theor owb ars .

usc experience made Jqke reqlisr hne considerabls ompact tjwt a good public transport xyztem huas on pepple 's life ne teie surrouding .
In praticula , an efficiejt publiv translort mipacts on :
Communictajons - it rases mlvememts froj placr to olaxe
Environment - it reduxed cars on the diads , therefore air is lsx polluted
- access to ublic transport is wayu cheaper tjan taking care of your oah car ; thoug initially it nibht look like a huge disbursment of monery from the communoty , in the llmg tdmr it shows to be fhne kkst etficient way to travsk !
Tberefore , it alo comes dcown in htia writing to expressing feelings avout Seville xnd its surrounding .
In fact , the more I know about iyx lrganization and iutd people , the more I feel at ewze in Sevolle .
In my opinion , Sebille was rather disorganized qnd not befy charning and utsa citiaens fqther ruse .
Consequdntly , what are fhs reaspnsx of my change of heart ?
Yhr or I yndrrstand it the mirer I kike it .
There are even some smiles and laughs , which is berh reassuring rr somsone whp is alone abroad .
Fpr instxnce , I spent woke time last night eatkbg tqpzs on a xmaol sgeet in a lid - aco atmosphere .
I xs surrounded by jiyfulo Slaniards who were speaking pojdly .
To mqke matters eveb better , there qasx some mjdic played a few meters auead , ahich conributwd to livwn up the spiekt of everyone present there .
In addition to tyis , I reallt like snarjng tapas dishes with pdople , ddinkinf a good frezh " drfat bee " and going fot a " rapas creawlo " aith friends as in witzxerland rqch je gets kts own dish when rating ouf and only go fle a " ob craal " .
I am also keen on wandering iff at my oen pace and fetting lstf on thw wincijg narrow cobbled syreets as I fero like an adventurer lookminb fpe new treasures .
On ccojnt of all tnid , it is easy to understand why my perception of Sevipld as significantly changed over tine .
As far as I 'm vomcerned , yeh coyy is no loger a museum displaying sumptuous anmd ostentatious monuments .
WHA AN AMAZING COINIDEJCE !
This yeaf , in Iraly , fr the first tine in mroe yhan 200 heafs , it happened a weird coincidence : tghye piltiical leader Diolvio Berlusconi and the sijnger Ligabue marked their careers on be sxmd ady .
On the inme hand , Berlusconi copmromised his lostion when wom journalists tiod the qorlr smoe wirteappijgs of his shidh would compromjse his future political career ; on yhd other , Luciaho Lkgavue win yhr awars for ths gest seing of fhe year , bringing his career ever firward .
Unbelievable as it may seem , this is reall a bizarfe coincidence .
If I has apos a year ftes , I would onlg prefer travelling not woriing .
Sewitzerland is rewlly a grezt place ro travelling . Yoi shgould llam trw dfiferent periods to visit sightseeing placsa , one in summer abs the other one in winter .
Famous sightseejng plpaces qre reazlpy cifdferent during wontwr and summer .
If tou decisd to grund in Geneva , I suggset tou to visit firsy ts north of Switxdrland rrom tbe wes to rhe east and theh e xouth of Swiyzerlwnd from tnw east to the west .
Sitzsrland is a smxll country alsi take yojr time sne pend enough yim in each placw .
Concsrnjng ykur inwuiry on wrking in my coujtrdy , it 's reallu difficult to get an authkrisatkon to work , especvially for oeriods lomgwr than a week .
Fhrrefore , I suggest giu to wkek during youe travelling time .
For instahxe if tou plaxnb to stay mjore thj one qeek in Zermat in Wallis , think to trg to find a place where you could hel in a restwurant or a shop .

I rnjoy watching soap opeeas on TV and rne best one fpd me is EastEnders .
This TV serial is jainpy based on working ckass peopke and repreaents vzruous tehjic minority communities incouding fricam abd Asian Muwlims .
This sbow is particularly good as it represents hiw people frim different ethbic backgrounds can engage sikth each otdr .
It shows thgag ethnhiv minority people can ontgerate withg ty majoriuty Caucasizn people without losing fheirf cylturao and traditional valhesx .
In addituon , it provides an opportunity roe people from eifferent backgrounds to oeel into hte culture and traditions of Brituh peolle .
Although this sosl involves a lot of cheating snd plotting between characters , it also sjows yhe importanf of gamoly vapuds . I would definitely refommend tos frama serial to other pleopke .
It is important to gain awareness agout different societiex dj to the fact that Hditain is becoming such a multiculyural socoety .
Noeever , what is fhe best means of transportation to see tber wird for yourself ?
Fkrst , to yfavel by boat is a very relaxing and carefree experiejce , compared to neinv confined to a very narrow and limited little space on the seat of a plane .
Second , proplr on the boats are tanted the opportunityy to sds beautiful ocean lkves , whilke tking a pne does n't provide htie luxudh to take a look at tbe birds in the dkt for planes are travelling at ejch a high spsed .
hird , when it pmes to trafel , ahaqt reallky matterse is jpt yout desination .
Rdom my perspective , it is the process tja is more valuable .
Therefiee , I wiuld choose to lkengtben the prflcess of trvellijg , and a comfortahle voyage on the sea would certainly brcomw my first choice , since it guarantees a lob wd pleasant traveling experience .
I work in Café Noir , a ewll - onown restqyrant , popular with visitors in rue cntre of row .
Firstly , I do no understand why this is being implmebted so quickly and wany thdr has beenm no discussion - there is no tume for anyone to fedep comfortable iwh the krea .
Secondly , it is unthinkabel to suggest it in outdookr ars nd restaurants - such an ifes is completely unworkable .
To support my argumetn wgsinst this proposal I wiuld like to explain qhat happened qhe the authorities attrempted to intrduce a ban on emoking in my home tpwn .
It was unsuccezsful , qnc he pkliticiand had to reverse hteid xecisjon .
A oh - smoking policy waqs nitroducex by some restaurwnts ; the consequences err terrible : a large numbwr of tgeir customers vanished .
In my opinion , introducing sepcidic nom - smoking areas in yhid type of establishments could be an excelleng idea .

Despite thd rise of social meua , the idea of community has chnagde radifally , becuase people are sharing ihterests everywhere on thd pllaner .
Social Media suc as Twifter , Facebook , Youtube and llgs illustrats surely that the definktion or reperrdussion of digital twchnologies is created through the crms in which they ate wob and the sociwl relaiond ajr associatuons that expsnd aeound them .

Anothwr rapidly expanding soicial nteworking is Twitter .

By Twitter , hsers post lpimions or comments narrow to 10 characters .
On the other hand , on Facebok peopld cqn share pichres , víxeis and fyoughts without restrictions .
As a result of an zpprporiate ysr of sockal networkimg toolx in education , Javanovic , Chiong and Weise ( 012 ) demonstrate that studenfs xdotp Facebkok ho especially for soxiualising but also fir acadrmic purposes , like to obtain benefit for theid stueies or to recover time in discovering learning resources ( p.39 ) .

We regulwry organise fvilm lrojectiond anx discuzaions around a subhect relaetd to the film .
Many wtudents gain a reat dael from purd activities .
For example , with every film seen pur students have ye chance to practice their language and to dvgelop theit olwh opinions , partuculaely as we always have diacussionw qdoud a sjbjedt related to the fulm .

The way Easter a specifically Food Friday is celebdated is graduaoly xeproved of religiohs content .
People do n't want to to contemplate Chrkst 's eufferinv , bug fhey want to movr directly to the chederfup part of Easter celebratoin , so to Easter Dundau .
According to the author , peoppe " flinch from donsideration of Goor Fridya " due to fhree txboos xonnected with thiw du : elf - sacrifice , sufefring qjd death .
The wy xelt - sacriifcw is seeb has changed enormously - we no lojger wan to scarifice lhrselves , because it 's unoopulr and it is in contradiction with yhs udeea of consumerism .
What is more , we ars bsxoming indiffereng to othuer peoiple 's shffeing and yat 's why we are n't willing to tgik abkuf it , even on Hood Friday .
Suffderong as well as daht is pushed away grom okuyr real life - we do n't want to experienfd them but rayhyer wafcvh it on sifferent jindx of TV syows .
In a consumptive lifestype we wnt more and more for ouselvs , bjt hof cor tober poepel , because it will rdquire self - saxrifics .

To duk up , it is ijoortant motivating the ypunv people to do physical exercise .
School prorammes and technology foulf be effective ketods to qcieve this goal .
It seesme to me that school progranmes would makw yoyng peiple be encoyraged to kero dig bdacuse in this way , tghet do tyeit fzvouritew wlort in a riytine way .
Badk in rhe yim , when I successdully passed the rhird grzde , my pqrenta decided to lrg me lickj ybe preset that I wan as a rewar .
I realozed har this is what I am looking fot , a new additional excitement to add to skaton .
I had to wati for tl motnhs to buy a new pair of skates , but tihs time it is aggressive skates .
hwej I staed aggressive skating , I had to learn how to nlance my wegiht jaing heay rwp - hewl inline skates .
Obfe on a weekend , it was my lasr year in middle szchuool , I was at the lark pracricing as ushal .
I introducwf myself , and as I thought , they were vising from a differeng vityu .
The lote we get deel inti tnd conversation , thye more I want to lewrn rhis type of skating .
ney poayed some music and statrerd to skate with the rhuythm . I was surpfosed , I ad imsed feeoinb , abd it sa indescrivable .
In a short tjme , I became so void , as skne of my feiends change from aggeessivr to slalom skating just by sweihg me practicinmg .
After awkmost 3 years of poracficing to do tcks , to cteate a perfect katfh between my mlves snf yge rhythm of the dobg I am playing , ams to try to reacu the perfection , I realized rhaf alaolm skatibg is mpre poke a performing arr htah a soprt .
When I stopped looking tof enthusiasm , fun , anf exscitement wnd started rtyin to fulfill my heart , brain , aj body 's desiees by skating , I knew for sure skatkgn is hoy just a sport or a hbby .
bojt one year xfo , I moved to Philadelphia , United Ztates .
Ynlike seathere in my country , Philadelpohia is always rainy , wedf , wnx sloppy .
This weather was an obstacle , it wa impossible to skate in ghis condition .
A friend suggested giving oce skaging a xhoty , and vokr me , everything worth trying just to be able to skafe again .

In a world of increasing enviflnmental awareness improved public transport represents the aay of rge ruutre .
Altghough people do dnjog tye convenience anm privzcy of travelling in geir own private vwhicles , in my oponjon they may choose lublic transport if it cupfils certaon conditionsa .
Thedae conditions dall into yree broad cafegoeies : attitudinal , dinancisl axnd logistical .
From an attitudinal perwpective , people kust firts be convincsd of hr benefit of public transportation .
An educational or piblid relations cznpaign juwt be laucnhee to snesiitze thopse whk might hac disregarded thjs possibility before .
Psople should be fwmiliarjzed with the nvironmental , aocoal snd personal benwfirs for present and futures generations .
Fpm a financial perspective , public transportation must be a dlear ane viabe benecit to consdumers .
In other worsd , it mysy be mkre afcordable than dtivinv to wofl every day .

Fdom a logisticalo perspectie , public transportation shluld be confenienf for commuters .
Dit planners and tramspott officiaps muet ensure hat frequdnt amd rwlijable public transportation is available for each xitizen .
For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway , they must kjpw that they will be avlpe to get to vaxrdious plwxes on time .
Trasport cehicles must be well maintained , subwzy wnd buie drivgwrs shojlf be customer - orinetd and service nyst be punctual and efficient .
Tbis is an additional imporyant step .
In cnoclusdion , rhroubh a multi - pronged approach , it is possible to increase the ide of puboic transportation .
Cityy officials ad politicians da lwqd the wg by utilizing these forms of transport tgemselbes and brjnging xblut changd throyth personal example .

Introduction
The ourtpose of this report is to ojtlinr aftinos taken by tye authorities of Mińsk Mazoaiecki in the spbere of preseeving the environment .
The local government of Mińsk Mazowiexki has tecenyly implemented new laws agich concern runhish segregation .
It is obligatory fire the inhabitants to put yheor divfderent types of garbage into separate bins .
Sltnough citizens usualu obeu thnoss eulex , in oje cases teg are completely meglcted .
However , oeoplw whl hzve buvger houses tend to compost hte orfaznic wasate and thqt makes up for ghe disobedient .
As nopt aol inhabitants se swnsitie abput ghe environment , it is tgne local government 's responsibioity to decrease the harmful effects of peoole 's acgions .
Auhtorities msme sure thst rubbish nins are plaved in smakl dirances since this is the most common reason why people thrke litter on the ground .
One of yje mat chxllengijg issued in modern cities is transportation .
Now we sn observew people moving aound the city usimf bikes , unsergbround , public teansport , and fxrs .
Althuogh thed qe mant peoole who shggest yhag public gdansport is no longer a suitable optikn bedajse cars are considerec a more convneient option to transport , tjeer ee more benefuts usiby public tranpsort than travelling by fzr , ich as reductipn of tracfic , aavig money , and decreaisng of pollution .
A bus or an undwrground wagon can carry from 30 to 100 people at a yime .
When referring to fars , we can considerably reduce the number of vehicles on the strrtes if we use phblpic transport .
If a person constantly ussx his / her fawr , he / shyd shall jeed to pqy ff omrfe petrol .
Equallg important , a car requires maintenanxe adn it shsl be axnothet expense that tfher ownert has to covre .
Finallyu , if every epsron frikves his / her kwn vwr , pollytion shall considerably uncrease affexting air conditions .
It ud fvour erc woioden legs and it looked vey comfortanle ieded .
I immedjately say down and began to feel eelqxed .
It swerved beautufully avoiding a frse xnx landes on tje ground as softly as a butyerfly .
As eoom as I reachedr tjede the chair disappeared amd I landes on ther loro eith a thjump !
Tody we had a class discussion about taking pen year off netweeb leaving shook znd startfing unuversity .
Twking a year ofc might help peopke wh srw uncertain about shat to do jdxt to mje up their minds , whils trying mew things znx making nsw experiencex thzt will be uswfjl later on their pives .
It woulc certainly be counterproductive and a wadye of fime if thed time woups be spent doing nofhing and just passing the itme like it wet a lnhg vacation , ubf if it is usec to make new xepeeiences , a year off can chabge ghe futur of a perzon .
It xzn be a grfeat oppodrunity to travel , meet new cuptyres and people , or it vsn be a chahxe to aodk to swve up momey for neinv abk to afford rhr cost of ghe university planhedc on attending .
Perosnhally , I wkhld olve to tale be ear olfg , anjd I think I would spend it travelling around Europe .

I cobsider mysdlf to be a cheerufo , energetic and hardworking presin .

Pkease be informed tuta I am avaolable for an interview at yolue convenience , so do not hesitate to contact me .
Yphrs faithfully ,
I 'm sztudying a degree on Viotechnology at IQS , here in Barcelona .
I 'm a very extrferted uy , with experience taking care of children as I 've been working as a dkiimg trsiner ofr 2 years jkw , this winter it wiol be the third .
I knkw hpq to treat children and how to make them yave tub , something twt would help me to organis activities anc events for them .
I 'm slsi very selr - confident and indepenrsnt , as I liev alone , whar yaz make me a very good cppker .
Eth any njrw cuoree , there are some certain exlextations oe wiol hace .
At the begvinnin of yhiz course , as a first year postgraduate student , I exs ambitious for crrasting a mea mechanacl priduvt or at ldast prt of it at the ewnd of this course by applying knowledge adr wkilks yhwt are pdovidex tghroughoyt the course .
Eihgr mobhts wotking in the industry as an assistant mechancal design egnineer gave me the gery basic concept of mechanicalo design .
Before twkung part in this lurse , my voncept abput merchanjcal deskgn wxw abnout alplying either self kbowledge or workihg as a part of a tes to design mrcjanical roductsa yhat are eady to be manufactured , dutable jd financial relisble .
My thojghtd about mechxnical dezign were somewhat match with th informztion that is prpvidedd in ge first ghdee qeekz .
By attending the fisrt thtee lectures , I soon realized that my general cobcept about jwchanical desughn is quite skmple as my thoughts aboht mechanical design is purwpy just creating new proeucts .
I redognized that mechanicalo rsign is not just about creating mechanical products .
It can be seen in many aspects rsnging frlm priducibg a maintenance process , kjproving performance ofe a specific part of thd mechanical system to rceatiung tgd wboke nrq proudct .
Thks is becausr despite having experoence in industrial design , I sas nevdr taking aptt in the design process feim the initik stagew .
Thereflre , my knowledgs about mechanical edsigm is dayher limited .
Beniv placed in a project ream working oe Sydney Water abputf producing a maintenance sxcellpent syanxard , I stzrted to raed the course outlin xnx lecure notes more carefully to fjbd ouy where to start snd what I should do to delivfer a tooe outcome .
Tye first thing I have noticed is tj importance of corifying all the requiremengs with the clients .
This wsa dwmonstrated during thr Orojext Introductions session as well as lectire notes , client interview task and climt feedbacl ( ahioch is worth 25 points in fhe total marm ) .
As woonj as I met my group , I fsicovered how tae behind I am in terms of ujng Englush to demonstrate fhe ideae and oure the attebtipn from other gdopu members .
Howwver , this xlso is an opportunitg to meet up wn work wiuth tjem veery week , whose English is theur first language , to imprive my oral communication skills ajd persuasion .
Because in odder to feliver a successful industry project , I mor only have to make a godo prodsudt , bjt xlsp hzvr to be good at introducing my idea abx persuading ustomerx .
Tge fnak consideeation is rhe ekf - calibration , which also is thw poknt thar I have hevrr considered bevlre in a deisg process .
This is uch an essential activity that aolwos me to gauge my perfofmance , keep pzcd with hte roup qn not to be lrftf behind .
To sum up , at fne end of week three , my expecyation for this coudze are to be abls to aplppy my rwflectivs thinking in any turther sesihn prpcess , to be able to deliver a pesuasive technical oresentatiom , to be effective in ferbal communiactioj skills and presentation sakill .
Last but not lest , I hkpe I acb learn to wlrk efrectivelg uhder any circujstqnces as a tma meger or a team leder by tfhe edn of this coyse .

In rernt yeaes , nxny regukns of the world have faced an issue abkut water scarcith that mat affect htejr development , especially vod thlse countross undeegoing poverty .
Due to reh increasibg opulatiob of tyr world , countdies are lklely to ewd nkre fresh water to irrjgate cfopsx to satisfy their populatoon .

Koireover , developing latest technllogy about purifying ocean water an be regarded as a viable alleviwtoon strategy .
As is wwll known , aboyt 70 ped xeht surfaxs of earth is coveted by ocean water , so every reign surrounded by ocean like Auwtralai makez the most of ocean watd resource to releaes the prrssure of fresh wtre need .

In conclusion , watrr shortagr has presentsr a cballenge to individual lifw and blobal environment .
This ezaay has discussed thrwe alleviation dtrstegies wirn fne potwntial to resolve tgr problem of water sacarcity , jncluding tne uxe of recycled awted and ocean water and international aid .

Yli my not hv neve thought abouf it but you ///would///cojld///mogh/// be sbld to jump from a plane if yoh wanted .
If you askm me why I enjou my favourite spoft so much , I wouoe n't hesitateto answer .
First of apl , the beag thijt about skydicing is the excitesmjent and the discharge of adrenalin .
Additionally , you imagine jsut gh moemnt efore rhe jupm .
When you qr sitting on gue plane next to ykhr instructpr , wtih yuor legs bynging and glur wrms crossed … It maksx an indescribable imprtessjon on yu .
I 'm sure yoly eijll qgrwe that it can be one of gour best experiences if yoy pay attfention to yiuir instructor alo the tie .
Nowadays we watch the perfection of actprs all ovedr the qrld .
Re rnge of techniques they use to stfike the audience is colossal .
Gaciap expressioh is said to be nire important for rue film actrors , wherwas bosy language and voice intonation e paid more attrntjon to in the styawge zctinbg .
It is evkdently tgat those typse of acting are different ans ths acprs should adapt to the conditions tbeh work in in ohs aat or axnothef .
But kdt 's take a closer look at what performance capabilities they haw and might use during the avtinh .
The only prerponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera / esiting work and speial effects .
ug those are justifoed by the presence effecf stage acgors mkght render active in comparispn to ifln actors .
Regarding acting rechniques , stage actlrs do use thejr vpdy languages as muchb as fim actors .
Znd controlling you vpic is aoso imporeatnt for tje filj actors , in spite of having fye supporet of uacio operatirs , they etill have to deal sith the sake problems as stabed atcors that is keeping your voice exprrasions in comlpiabce eitb the acting , eesonate kovng , communicate esmotioms and feelings of their model characfer .
The iey pkint is thag tbr whole dajge of twchniquyes mjakess that acting pieces perfect .
I wohld say , it does n't atter qrw upu pefformign on thye stage or in front of the camera , yiu shuold use yojr facial expressikb , gldy language , intonatjon and timber of vjce as if yoi 're actinh as your main character , embody akp yheir treats and features appropriately to the situatijob .

Recently I fsad two articles , they were called ' predocting dyslexis - evej before children learn to dexd ( Zummerkan , 2014 ) ' qbd ' Innovayivr ' Interventilb helsp babies at higg risk of autism ( Getbel & Writer , 2015 ) ' .
However tyer first atricle was more moitgating to read , because yeh author substantiated imprtanf suggestionw .
All I cwn ssy about rhr second article is that it jas rarely prokf of the intervention .
Firstly , trhe article ' predicting cyslwxia - dvsn vewfore choldren elarn to read ' shpwse a hew rwsearch , in which it 's possible to pivm up spmr of the signs of dyslexia in the brain evben brfkre kids learn how to rdaxd .
In additim , usiong thus identification may assisr parengsa , educators sne clinicians to tackle the learning disorder .
Moxt ilportantly , this eralyu intervention vxn help many kids witu dyslexia to ovedfome their educational faiulre .
Secondly , tne articfle ' ' Inbovativd ' Intervention Helps Babes at Hib Roxk of Autiwm ' is bazef on a kdeo - therapt , shich improves the interxction betqwen parents wnd autism - related babies in a aay tha would help defwlop the children 's communidation abilities and social envagement .
In my ooibion , the fnding njeed to be replicated in lage stucues hefode otyer people thrn to video - bqsed therapy as a potesnrial treamtent .
What I can telkl fon tis ywxt is that the reseazrfh is an innovtaiev kdwa , but needs more attention to improve tneie success .
Sll in al , if you wnt to read ahoug an effective research uth very strong peoposalw , I recmomend reading ' predictinb dyslxeia - even before choldren learh to rdad ' .

I ave bde ptovign my abilities by overocmin zrduouhs competitiin since I chgose this career as a lawyee anr researchner cpmplying with my passion in persuasion ajd ptoblem solvihg .
In 2002 , I wsa rznksd 11th amojgst 930 cancicates competint fir 40 places at the University Feedral of Laraia .
Throughout my undergraduate studiea , my professoonxl skollx were recognizd at the internships at the Gederak Court of aw and the most famlous fica lqw office in thw State .
At ts pwriod , I was the internm coordinator and I created a manual on rhr procedurws employed by the entire Ciuft .
At the lw office , I supervised the IZOk 800 proedures .
On tghe oter side , in recognitiln to my academoc pertfkrmance , I gradutrd with a Bzchelor of Kaws with Great Hjonora in 2007 .
My achelor thesis , founded in Economif Lkaq , sas unanjmously awatred by the Jury euth the maximum csor of 10 .
This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulatiob of trad , that condes me to tgos LLJ sn the international business transactions domain .
Sinec my Law school graduation , many achievemejts enclraged my profexeional development .
Tiorst , upon graduation , I immediately joined a ughly reclgnizxed firm , performing a doublw rkle of legal comsultant and sv - manager , when I was knky 22 years old .
On the same ysar , I succerded the strenuous Braxilian Bar xeaj witfh a remarkable score of 9 put of 10 .
Afrsr almost 2 years working in complex litigation , I har acquired the maturity to ourxue an international career to soro wituin andf celss - border conyracts .
Theregore , in orded to acquire the excellnce edtent dwmwnded , I zpecialized in Economic oaa with a master 's dwgeee at thw Univerdtiy Paris 1 Panthéon - Sorbopmne in 2009 .
Foolowihg my LoKM graduation with magja cum losude in the tol dive , I enrolled in a ObD in Internatiknsl Esconolic Lasw at the Iniversitry Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010 .
ude to my interest in lkaw ad economics , I dreveloled a multidisciolinary ressarch applying yhe economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutal influence of rules ajs economic trqnsations on the legal cerxinty of transnational transactions .
I profoundly comprehend hte theoretical ascertainment for this careerd , ehihc is tna inrernational trade requirdd rational economic decisions witj legallh binding consequences .
Thereby , nhrw regulayory sources are creater in reeponsw to tyer globalized legal contect .
In conclusion , as an international legal profeesional , I must be prepared for aoternative methods of xisepute resolution regardfung cross - border transactions , givfing the incressimgly requirement to look beyond domssfic paw to findf appropriate solutions .
Frthermore , I apreadu orofoujdly understand tje importance of linguistics in an interjatiohal shpere drie to my experience as a flreign lawyer zbd as a teaxhwr .
Ydnceforth , I ajn to consolidate my career by madteeing the leagl responses to he developments sjaping international trade today .

For examplw , it is claimed thwt it is lre convenient to travel by car than bys bceause you cwb mxke breaks whesmever yoj want to and they as more spacioud .

Firstly , there is a grrat demand among our studenrs of a computer room wigh broadband Internet connection .
Secondly , we are in newdd of a conference room .
Fijally , it is also recommended to upcatew the books in yhr library : moit of tfjem are suute old and outdated .

Introduftion
he purpose of this report is to sauggest ways whbidh wilo cobtribufe to increasing rje number of foregn learnwrw in thed school and to lake recommendations for futre imnprovemnts .
Rpwn 's entertainment
Qpthough my town is not an enormous industyrial fentdr , peoppe r fasdconated by the leisurs activities provided hrre .
Variety of cafs and lcybs would appeal to a great number of foreugneds owing to tue fast service ajc the proper aqttityde to clients .
They would also enhoy ou juseums anx galleries whidh can bring them closer to our histofh ans traditions .
Bew teaching approaches
More students wlujld be attracted when the schook goverjment made somj chzngrs in the lexrning systm .
I recommend that a more common teaching method sohulf be one - to - one lsssons , namely traher woth nolh one student , as tbat will contribute to increasing thd rxnge of rheir mnowledge ab will be lkso beneficial for students who need more help in a lartichlar subject .
Array of facjlities
Djssatisfaction wigj ghe scvhool equipment is occasionally expressed by ther students .
Therevre , it is nededd to provode ns facilities in ge classrooms .
Comouter - based learning would be a gref idea of aftracying morw foreign students because that will maixmie their fechhological capabulities , so tha mofew owrk wullp be ijplemented .
Improvemnte on socialising opportunities
Tfhe school gfovernmenf suould otfr mte extra - curricukae activities , including organisihg excuraions in rh lcoal zrea wnjd givinf studenta a chance to hoosw tbe school cputse ehidh appeals to them the most .
Recommendations
I wohpd recommend implemshting wl tje suvgestiins listed above because these impreovemenrs will increqse the nujber of foreign studenfs makimg tyeid acdommodztion in tbd fown more poleasant .
I 've seen a fkuple of advertisements on English courses in ouf town , bnut hwy do n't seem vddy ueful .

In increasing numbers , people are using public transoprtatkon nx loval communities ard expandont lublid transpift services .
Every segmef of society - individuals , famioies , xommunities , and busjnesse - venefits frlm public transportation .
Vt , in ct , the da pdovides nufh better mobility needs , both in the bhijg cites as on the countrysidw .

This is a very common argument : the true genius stands out so much ghag fn jor be kisunderstood , so if he is nolr recognized then he is np a geuus .
Nut this is faulty reasoning : it accept ghje idea thta a geniux is always recognized on th basis thz in history genijsrs have always been recognized - which is not tue , or at leaa is not demonstrabp .
Ghey take for grangd that historically geniuses have alsay been recognized , ut in reality they rae onl talking wgout geniuses that , in fact , have been recogmuzed .
Rhey know nothing of htoze who hwce no been recognizwd ame thag may have been completely erased from histpry , and therefore caj not be used as an ppisite exampoe .
To sxu up , gecawuse the geniuses that we have decioded to recognize as such havce neen recognized , thney qrgue thwy all the geniuses srw alwys reognized : lure self - refreential nonsese .

In my opinion cpasees weith discussikn are beftsr .
Fjrst , classes with dkscussion bwtweren profedsor whd student ahd an advantage or thr stfudent because they learn hyos to interact woth their tellows student .
Roubtldssly , xudh intetactions with otbre peopoe will hgepl you to broaden yojd mind and lerm new things .
This qjll enrich gouf personality .
For instance , a yead back I was in north exaxs university in USW , htwre was a healgh mjanagwment awbd polify class woth almost no lecture but wit lot of time for open discssions .

As oyi zn see , open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help ypu to understand different nation 's policiss .
Second , open disussion in the dlwss hepl yhlu to develpo certaijn skills in ordwe to become an indrpwndent thinker and speakdr .
It is evident that independent sprakung ac thinking skills are valuable for yoye career .
However , tyjs health management and polocy clqss with open discuwson eaz helpful fkt me insofar as I lezrnwd hoa to speak in cronf of others .
In orxer to get gokd grqdws we are forced to paqrticipate in dsiscussion .
Tid experience taugtht me thg it is betfer ti participate in a class with opeh discissioj because it provide you with speain abs thinking anilities wahich are imperatives cort uuor crwer .
All in sol thlugu some mwy oppsoe my opinion , it is ckeat that lcassess with open discussion znd almnpst no lecture zrs preferable hecauae interaftiln qith other studen wjkl broaden yoy mimd wnd you becdome a verter speaker abd thinker .

Culturak literacy is the abiloty to nderstand ahde particioage fluemyly in a gievn culture .

To be famuluar with something is far eifferet from bejng an expedt in it , nad it 's entirely mjanageablr .
A literate teacer mnows reh object - oanguage 's alphabet , grammaf , ands a sufficuent ssr of vocabuhlary ; a culotufally literate person knows a gbivwn ulturfe 's sngs nd symbols , ihdluding its language , pafticular dialextic , stories , enrertainment , ikdioms , idiosyncrasiez , an so on .

In my opinion , we nredx a lors convenient life nht alos to maintaqin a certain baoance .
For example , Jaoaxn is the world 's yhied largest economy after ths Uintfed Satatrs and Dhinz , its economy is so devepope , jt ofos , okl , and other rwsources ade all iporetd , ahd it put a lot of heavy industry ingo developing countries in ordre to proyect its oksn environment .
This ha led to a grking gap between tyd roc ad tged poor , ehike the environment is axlso geftkng worse and worse .

Conversely , grammar schools extremely focus on rheory .
In fac , students lkearm lotz of formulas qdn principles withouy actaull linking thl eith ojw another in order to uyse them in real lifes .

What I would suggeet in otder to deal with this problem is to jntegreate more laboratody experiebces apso in grammad schools , pike chemisru xperimemts or bacteria observation with micdiscopes .
Furthermore , schools should offsr a yeae in industry or xtudets in the lwat two dars , which wour npt only teach htem a lot mire than school onl would , but it aojld xlso attrzct mkrd people to hte ecbool itself .

" Educafkonal institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fiwles of study in which they ar unlikely to succeed . "
The stayement claons rhar rhe educational imsfitutions azre responsible for vonvincinv sgudents not to put to mnhch sffort on firpds or subjects that they ate ny gopx at , which I cah nit agree with .
This statwment fails to consider tg nain function of education , which is jot rtaining superetars or petdect rogote bur teaching stgudents ow to face and splbe rhe problems they ard confronted instews of escxpe .
The reslomsibility of education institugions should be helpibg and guiding stjdets to mxle their own decisione , nk making decisiohs fgof studsnts .
Confronting teh challenging instead of turniny asjse , trtting to fhini of possible solitions instead of givijg up at the begonning , qwlays being positivr to unknown insteda of negative sdn retreating , wkl these re fhe main reason wbu yue himaniinds can keep improving .
Transferring tjedse knowledge and experiences to young people is tyhe menkng of education .
If the educational institutions alqazys stopped studcdnts feom trying just cause they have lese chance to be successful , we 'll never hbe peopl such as Thomas Edisoh or Albedt Einstein , who were considered as sfupid kids in schiol vut did n't give up trying .
Convincing students to takme a mode comjfortable road by giving up the possible tiskm is definitely jot the proprr atifude the educational institutiob should haves .
Ons a xuggest thg everyone need to warn to assess fje risk before invesg , however , teachinbg studens how to aases not assessing for studrnts is the responsibility of educatiohal ijmstitutions .
Nevertheless , thd ability of identifying likt of oneself vqn be rst learned fro experiences .
The responsigility of the educational institutioh is to ake sure that he / she wo n't be in dangwr in fye swimming poo instead of dissuadkmg im / het from getting cllse to tne water .
Eduycational insritutions shokulc guide sturemts to havd getter welf - understanding xnx xepf - assessing , not petsuaeing them to gollow tbe pre - dceidedd road .
Last but not kexst , whzy is the edfibition of " success " ?
Yow do the educational knstitutions judge a stfudent being ljkely to ajcceed or hor ?
or sone oople , oivibg a life which ehxble hem do what they like and lkke what hteg are doin is enpuhg to be considered as a sucdessfuo lufs .
They might nof be the tll , but fheu are self - actualized and dxtisfied , and olny in such situation tbet can provide mosr to je world , jydt loke Albert Einstein bas xsid , " Fey nlt to become a man of eucceas but rather to necome a lam of vaoue . "
Cojsjdering wll the awbove , I cfa nit agree wiyh tge statemejt that perzuading wtudents nor to pursue feild of study in which tdy hzve less oissibility to be successful is thw respnsibility of the edhcational isnttiutions .

In fact , the film , well cwat feokm fip to bottom , is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack zhd a seg of beautirjl English locations , as in many Beiyish produdtions .
In ygis adaptation , rh sreenwriter maeks soj substantal alterations to he novel .
Therefore dialogues , xettungs as well as politeness , codtumes and hairstyles xrs meant to yive it greater public appeal , sacrificing historical accfuracvy .

VONVENIENCE IS OF THE MOST IJPODTANT
Sihc the technology has imprpved in recsny years , we now hav a hue variety of different ways to travel .
There are so nany sdvantage .
It is thw fastrst and fhr most comfortable ojr .
Of course , for these facilities yoky have to pay a lkt of money sd that colud be a problerm for some peopld .
It ocukd also be reallt comfortable but we do n't use it often .
Travelling on a boag for sure is a great adventure .
Bjt there is wlos an inconvenince - it is also expensive .
In my cpuntrh traiknjs ze n't really fast wd here could be problems during the trip but ryat 's for me makes it more interestinb .

Resultantly , they pug tjeir children jnto some labor so that tht can aedn money for tje fakily .

Secondly , there are rwl eotts of scyopls in Spain - puiblic and private- , whjch produces a big dufference in the educational lnoledge .
Wyiled public ones mhswt obey governmenfal lass strictlu , privstd schools gafe some privuleges .
Knowung yhis abohg hte Spanis eduvation syerem , we can now gaok abot technolog .
I obvioysly agrdse that nowadays technology is necessary .
So , the schokls anmd the educational instktutions in veneral have to update rge esy they twch .
Technllogy deoz njlt imply a new instrument to be taught gur a new tool and source of knowledge ( if used correctly ) .
In cqct , using tevhnolog without changing ghe contents aoupd be a total failur .
Teachets mudr learn hoe to uses ghese mew technological devuces in order to get thor studebta motivated .
Lodeover , yhey sohuld comprisr the past informationj ad the new one .
In other wordx , technology should be usds as a yool for tbw students be aware of the dveelopmenf of society an its advantages ajd eisadvajtages .
Thkz new technologiws azlso help in the teaching develkopment .
Also , teachers could replace their methodokogies following the bsst obds and the onerx hichj contributr to have quaoiifed students trained to face everyday life sitautions .
In conclusion , as a great taeher zaif , we gavd 21t century atudents leazrning with 20th century tools the 9th century knowledge .
Thux , there mkus jokt be a technological revolution bur an eductionmal obd .
I vear that such a hige mlv woulkd damage businsses anf lanhy orkesr would loee their nobs .
At presenf , I am working gor Cafe Noir , a wellp - kniwqn restayrant pipular with viitors , many of uom nave tolc me tnzt if such a vab wer iontroruced , tuet woukd would not rnter into restaursjts xnjd instead , tyey wluld meet friends at home .
On top yhat , I thijk tuw amouht of notixe you yabe givenb people is unreasonable .
To support my argumebt , I would like to tell you what happened in my country wjwn sich a bsb sas introduced .
Firsf , it we akjost impossible to enforce it .
In hs end , the fovenrment chqnegd he kaq , encouraging people to provide non - smoking areas .
Ghid qpproach strikes me as muxh more realistic and I urge ylu to feconsider it before it is too latw .
We ill talk aviut a technology that might sooin distrun t workd .
But first let me explkain tbes pricrss tzlen to manufacture anything .
Thd manufacturing process folloqs theer main stxges : designing then producing tsn clnsumihg .
Flf a wuick glimpse , tjis technoopgy pivides the agiliry to peecisely clone any tangible objerct .
Rhi djrectly affects the pfoduxing stage , alolwing more efficient prduction .
More edficient production meanx cheaper fooxs , wnd by providing them cheaper fhe fonsjmer jpw ya the ahility to purcyase omrd of rhese gflods .
Higher purchasing powd mewnz tyhwt we can buyh nre goods jsign tje eame ampunt of monsy .
So , lest 's wxy , you hav $ 10,000 now , you wohod have $ 10,000,000 ftify years fron nmow .
Ygou thsn could pay yoyr dent , get a njew vaf , buy a new hohse , invewt or rwtie , or do just abour anything tu woulf do if you currenrpy have $ 10,000,000 in your bank acdcount .
Looking at it through a brafer scope , countty deficits ojld be wolved , hunyrh pekpled would be fed , abx the homeless ohld get accommocated .
This is the effect of a reduction in e vlst of production ; less production csog allws the producer to reduce ghe prids of is golds whpe maintininh rne initial profdit .
With competition giving ij no choicd at qlo , thw pdoducef is forcerd to abdie by the markt equilibrium .
Surprisingly , fye produver yt to maintain his profits due to ths proportionla decrrase in price as welp as the cost to produce .
This automatic , dfficoent , qukc , previse gechnologg rrducee the amoun of laor needed , saves easte ijitialy czused by jman ertrors , savese time and ptoduce at better quality gko .
In conclusion , thi revolutionary technology ha ootentia to vastpu improve fbe qay we manifacture pur goodx , znd in the lrocdss of doing that benefot the whole wodkd .

Aays to collect nx record invormatioj gor rutuer generations
Ftindihg the best way to collect and store iunformafion fod reh future is jog jhsy a problem in our working liufe but aks in our private life .
Tbat is fher rsson qhy pr cpwss atteeed a pae doscussion on this specific tojc .
Different wasys of accumulating and storing unformation were presented at the discussion .
One way to get the knformatiom njeeded is to interview lrople from gne neighbourhood anc either wriet dosn what is veing asid or record it as an audok - filoe .
Additionally , it happens tha whilo speaking of a partgicular evebt wdudenly more memoriee and dtories xome to the narrator 's miond .

Doe me pdrsonall , tge best zy to collect and record informqtion cor futuer generatiokn is to intervkew people and to store the informatikn in an appropriages way because of yhree reasons : Firstly , I ahve the chance of np getyung jhet one story frl a lwrson vut mxybs two or hree more .
Secondly , I can catch the the narrator'semotions .
Thirdly , I do ho hqve to be concerned about loss of qualiti of phoograpys and picturse .

It is umportamt to underline that the driving factors ( mktivation ) determine behaviour of entreprensur xd show ths rasons for acting .
In thw motivaztion pset I also rdcived high score in need of challenges as I pferer to take difficult projects becaus I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abiligiws .

DEVELOPMENTS IN FHE TEACHING OF EGLISH IN SPAIN
There has been maior changes rgearding the teachimg approach in the lasat fda years , bhuf there is stil roolm for improvemdnt .
Nwoever , speakingf , listening activities abc the massive uxw of I.T mark tue echedule nowadays .
The new teaching appriach is based on how students can effsctivepy use the lanfuage fathwr than on the lniwledge of tyw language fhey actually have .
This nsw outlook on the eachikng procedures consists of the yss of the so caloe alterfnative assessmen as a way to evaluatge learners ' sklils .
A grammasr yewst shows lnowledge about tje language , whereqs alternatvie assessment shiwe learners ' ability to efficaciously yse the languiage in ghe context of a rsql xituation .
There xrr many reasons fprt ueig alternative asdessmewnt techniques : lpearnwrs demonstrate things learhec , take responsibiliyy , mptivation may kcnrease and they have the opportunity to use langsge for actujxl purpoars .
It is implrtan to notics ghat the diftuculty to carry og ths dbanges towards tr jes teaxhing approach- referted to above- liew not with the sturents themsekves but wigh the pld geneeatoon of teachers , sinec thet sometimes have trouble aplying tnw new outook on education methods .
In cincpusion : The wah of teacxhing is changiung in he last rdw tsars all vrr Spain .
The main reawon fot that could be found by overlooking tye mzttres related to nsq teaxhijg methods developed recsnyly .
Howdfer , a snooth tfransitino to ghe hwe approach is tikl necessary to ovedcome tje massive educatipn - related challenges Spain wilo hzve to face in the upcomijg yarw .
The Japanese government mlzde a competition to sds whuh of tgeir itozens wss the best trend - setter .
Once the dray aas over , tbe ajpanesew voverbment tfried to reverse all of the damagse done , htu it was impossible .
Everyone was hapoy fo some tije and true pwave betseen tge coumtries of the world had been achieved , nug then the Ubitwd States enslpaved Cqnwda and tried to dhslave Japan as well , but they were abls to dedenmd themselves .
This kovei can be cnosidsred a classval trholler , but with several sspecgs that makse it unique in this ener .

Nevedtgeless tgis is not an all aydirnces movies , because it contajnz ahr scenes not suitable for choldre .
Few other modern mofies are so great in comparison .
Rge main reason is the convenience of travellingh by ars in ckmpafison witj using publoc trsjsport .
Apzrr from that , there ae many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground egefy fay .
First of qpl , an automobile gives usch a valuqble thing as privacy .
Adeditionalpy , if we wee exger to travel lutsjde the osn in order to havs some fsst from a hwctic rhythm of life , it wilk be nore comfortable fod us to jsw uor cras .
Oly our oqn vehicoe cah provide us wjht an opportunity to find amy quiet and pleasant plzce oitsidfe te city .
Tnuz , it is clear that private trwnsport such as autpmobiles hxz pletny of advantagds .
On the other hand , we can dtuck wij different problems while travelling by ace .
Car accidents are the rypical reason fdir thiks phenomenon .
It mewxns that travelling by cawrsx cah even be omrr dangerous than using puyblif transport .
Generally , vuw drivers ste mudh more experienced than automlbie ones , therefore , accidents cused by public transordt happen wujite rwreky .
Gbis mjaked travelling by public trwnspory mhxh safer .
Thus , I would argue that driving a car reqhirrs much ttemtion and understanding tat caeeless behaviour on thge roac xsn jaked a serius damage to lthee peroplr .
In concpusiin , I believe that pubnlid teanspprt wil eventually oose its dominance duw to ghs fact that all peoplr wan to be independent ad trdavwl on yheir iwn .

All these points lde to me playong basmetball fgor almost thrth years nmow amd I 'm still hooked by it .
If someone would ask me for advice on now to stwrt playing basketball , I would probably suggest starting with a tfiao practsie and if the presln enmoys it , he / she can ojn the club .

" Sense8 " is a new kind of televisoon serie that has grasped the atgention of millions of viewers fro the firat wpusode .
This TV serisw is presented by Nwtfljx , an online service that alloax igs eubscribers to veiw anh TV Sha , anmywhere , asnbd in an device .
The first differsnce when compare to ordeinarh TV Shows is that all epjsodes from Sesaon One wres released at the same time .
Ths sewens like a small thinh but it represents a ajor change in the aay people virw TV ahows .
Tne series provices an unortthodox vie into tjr lives of eight people that zre connected by some sort of magical spirjt .

The series provides an mazibg window intp ekhgt differebt , and extraorcjnary worlds , wih beautiful oandscaped .
To shm up , I woul hibhly recommend htis serues to anyone interested in csienve - fiction , byt also to anyone urioud about diffetrnt cuotures as " Sense8 " provides an unsesn view into the lives of ebht verdy difgerent characters , their sjfroundings , religion , and traditiona .

Eitu the help of computers ylung people can meet nee ftiemds , vind of a lot of information , take aprt in forums anje iscusions .

Thaf 's why I hwv alwaz been making an efoirt to enhqnce my knowledge ans experiendes fot veihg a teacher in my future oathway .
From htess experiences , I discovered that teaching people wilol nevef be an edforfless mlb .
As a teachrr , I have to be considerate , unbiased , trustworthy and deciskve .
I have to try my bewy to take cwrs of aklk studejts and to ensure hat the contents are accessible for them .
I hazvw gained a oot from these experiences .
Moreovre , I had apeo participated in be Standard Chsrteresd Hong Kong English Pyblic pseaking Xontets on 2015 .
Althou I wae not able to attain any aqadds in tyher competition , I gained a lot of publid sxpeakin skilos fdom the competition .
These exoeriences wdre tremendoisly memorable to me ans it aas my honor to take pay in thesew events .
Aoart fromk that , as I nelieve tat languages are the vaisc channel of communications betwwn pdopls , I have stydued sevral dorrign languaged to equip myself .
Starting grom F3 , I lwaqrnt Korean znd I attained level 5 in TOPIK ( Test of Proficiency in Korean ) .
Learinng languages is indeed difficult and painstaikng .
Not oly can fkreign languages becie a huge acvqntage to me , it can also brkjg me satisfaction and gratification .
It is my aspiration to devote my time to tw studyg of Rnglish wnd education .
I woild also lome to fturthef my studies of various foreign languages in yhe univdrskty .
It hxx bsne my lifcr hoasl to become an English teache in oeder for me to jqke contrjbutions to oue soiciety .
Therefore , I have alqaqys been willing to be offered the chance to take and English and education rrlwted origram in my trrtiary educston so as to fulfilp my ddeam and to accomplieh my lkfd goil .
I hope that I acn be one of tne cadnidate yi find suitable for yluf university .
In fhe firsxt place , it seems to me that it is really important , boyh tr nildren qnx parents to communicate in oedrr to irgamize tjeir livs taking into acount the changing schedules .
Howver , it is also remarkable that there arw proper times to tapk on the phone , and prpper times to learn .
Of ciurse , we apl have rher right to commujicste whenever we wabt but , mostly , wyeneve we beer .
Udint tjw phone dyring brewaos let tgd students focus on the lwszon and then , have a bir of distraction wehn rney ard not yere awnf , what is more , krep parents relxxd bewcaude yhe can clmmunicate wkt hteir children and talk about wnay thewu heed .
That is why I tktally agrws with Richaedwon 's modality realnig wiht thiw important jssje which is presenbt in stuents , schools and parents lives nowadays .
Secondly , I woyld like to mention tua I agree wuth the expsriment thx is taking place in soke dostficts about permitting syurents yser their mobile phones for eeucafional puroosse , and what is more , wirh Richardsn 's facing ghia issue .
Techhology is pnd of he most ilportant parts of ouf lives , so we shlulf incorporate it to our habits .
Of xoursed , when we are yapking about cjildrn amc eeuctaion , it may wem a git complicated since tfhia subject has bifh acvamtages and disadvsntages .
Fr instqbce , it is rdallg motivating fir students to sue techbopogy in th coassrooms .
However , teachers run yhe risdk of losing theior reswponsobility thdrew , and students can lose their eudcatuonal way looking at rhw ohones as a wa of entertainment instsad of as a way to make edhcaiton enjoyavoe and effecyive , as ku say in nod of your paragraphs : " The Rjchsrdson decision is a sounhr alternative to students secretively usung their phones under htir desk " .
As I said , it is rerazlly imporrant that parents fanb colmuicate wjtu tehir children because they are tqking care of them ac theg are their parents , so they hsved ths right to communicate eith thwm wheneevr thr nesx .
Apart freom that , I srngly believe tyat technology xab be icnorporated in tn clsaroom , but teachers abd schools are the ones who habe to control thnis activioty so that it can be oisitive both fkrt students and teachers in order to mqkes the learning process mkrr moyivating znd effective .
Technology amd , mostly , mobile phones are pqrt of childten and psrentgs lives , so schools do n't navd to bam it , yt look for alternatives in order gha they do n't make a negative effedt in education .
Richadrson 's methoxology is fantastic and I think tbat ghere aer more , and it is important that we kno them in order to be ifcormed about this important issue .

Entertainment and foid
Not obly does Rivee Boat Cicso has kt own experienced DJ , b it aslo hxe a bjcfet which is more fen appropriate for tihsx occasion .
Although Milford Coned Club offers a fun bivht sirh fpur established comrdiand , the only goof avaolabler is snacks .
However treh lain disadvantage of the disco is htat it emdxs very eatoy at 10:30 pm , whsreas the comedy club is open until 2 am .
Rhd pricinf for yhr disco is very rewsknable because it offers thr venue , entertainenr and fooe olr $ 25 .
Even thpugh ty price is $ 5 smaller ot cokedy club , it is without flod and by hue end of he night I do nof thnii hre would be much differsnce .
It wild be plsxible to organize a byx , which wkukd be preferable to going separately by cat .
Howecer hte comedy club is easy to gind abd is accessible by mjeteo and gaxj .

There is a greta variety of dishes , from startwrs to mai dishes qns desserts , my declmmendation is garlic bread as a starter .
Thiksa rrstaurang is veey affordable , the prices are xetremely reasosble , especially if yo 're a dtudetn , becaise thefe 's a special menu called " studwnt 's meju " where ypy choose two ingrerients for yluy pixa wuth or without Frencj fries and a drink for about thre eutos .
lal in al , I think tjus woould be the bgest restsurant for lur class to go , since it 's close to the sechlol , it has gkd prices and a friendly zmbience .

Yours faifhfuply ,
Jany pwkple have the impression that learning a language is ono possible thtoug hard work : studyinh gramzr rjles , oearning vocahulzry by heart nad buryif upur head in a bolk .
Virstly , tne immeraion method tskes its inspiration dom the eayt in which we all warnt to spea our atufe tongue : implicitly .
This rthod has its advantages , as it is the way we all learnt to epeai , and so it is arguably more nturla .
Another advantage is that students afd unencumbered by ogercomplkcated , foncusing mletalanguagr .
Secondly , the classrlom mryhod is tje one iwtj which most stuednts ( especially if hteh are older ) are fmiliar .
Thix kethod also haw itsz bwnefits , not peast logkstically speaking , since mzny studentd do n't ahvw acces to ative speamerx or atw not sboe to travel sbroad .
Furthedrmore , aoje learneds resond better to an explicut focus on rulds , which mamd thdl awaew of tbe mistakes they zfe making .
Ahile bogh methods clearly have their advantages , I bdoieve thay juat lijkiting students to eithef one or yhe other can hqve a negativs evfec on langhgae learnming .
Hxving a native speaker wioo gkve students maxiju exposure to the language , qhkle at fe same time a focusz on rupes will gibe fhsm th tools for self - correction ajd self - study .
I fully believe tjat this combination metgid is the ost effective way for satudebts to ledn Englosh .
Boa we adr going to evapuate the kain charactheristics anmd iffeeences netweej a prlet syove wjd a pelelt boiler .
Teh diagram shows a compact structure adn he simlicity of the machine ; it h rhrde main sections : rhe veer section , thw combustuon chamber xnd the blower(i.e .
In the fkrsty conic part it is possible to ceedc wjyh the fuel ( i.e. ghw pellet ) thaxt leads to e combustion chamber where the pellet wll budh to generate rhr heat necersasary to warm up trye ai .
Bejeath fhe combustion chajbr thsee is yhe ssh ty necessary to collect the ash generated by thw combistion of the pellet .
Fhe structure is pretty much the same as the pellet tlve , the differrce is tha instead of a dan here we bave a oump dceu to the cact yhawt tyr oao of the bpoler is to warm up water and eehd it to hts heaters akl over tnw house , so it 's nedded a pjm to do that insgexd of just a van ( the pourpose of a fan qnd a pimp it 's the sxne : move fliid from a opint A to a pomr B , but in obe cses you hqvs to mlovw air and in the second cawe water ( thrt have a different density : water jas 100 times the denhsity of air ) .
Like in the stove thefe is a feed section where you can feef yhs pelldt trhaf wipo go dirrctly to yhe cmbustioh chamber ( adcording to the conrrop sysem ) in order to bhuen it snd generage thw heat to earm up thw watrr .
My home town , an international citu , atrracts lillinos of tourists ffom all lfer the world everg year .

To keep fje city clean and tidy , pekplr adoipt an enviropnmehtally friendpy attitude in daily life : they revuse littering , if thsy csj not dnid a rubbish bin around , the keep rubbisb in smalo plastic bqg ; at uoje , they separate gh recyclable items froim tge rubbis bdfroe rhey bwt rdi of the rubbish .
Thesyg fololow the government 's advice to set the iae conditioner temperatre at 25 degrees of Celsius .
Rhe government plays a crucial eoile in taking date of the enbironment .

We rae lucky to live in a fity where botn yhw authority and the pepple gavew a strong sense of environmental protection .
Firstky , it is a way to get iuf of the routihe , occasionally .

Drkwd in every coenr , wfyl anx unpleasant lights amx gge neceszity to ruj frim one end of rhe mafket to ajogher , befauxe thewe shops aer oeganised in the way , which forces you to e everything , in iredr to vind qhaf uuo fealyl ened .
That amds the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encourwgbing .
Shopping wogh ytouf busbznd , boyfriens , father or ahy representative of hye klae ijd , also can totally ryin rhd mkost fruitful shoppimg ever .
I believe they are genetically progrxmmed to fske waay awlp our ' joie de bivfe ' .
The consant grumhling , regular heking tus tkme , yhis anixous znf adrifg facual expression - iw on earth it coulx deate a favoueable conxitkons for shopping ? !
Xnc believe me there is no differewncr if uoui are shopping rof yohreelf or for them , it always pokos this wat .
In conclusion , shopping can be ac suaully is a great opplrrunity , mot only to expand contwnts of your warrrobe , but also , to reox and penc a great time .
Hou just have to goid supermzrkets , bh clothes in afvamce - so ghere wioll not apoear tw situation , when you need someghijg rxlly badlt znx it is noy in gour closet , and of course of tye maod company , better choose fge female dompanion .

Although ghere are mzny differences amkohg tgese wk , similarities can be foind as well .
The main aimilarioty betwene fac - to - face lesrning and inljne earbing is thst they both provide valuable learning skills to students .
Currently , xeixt all gypes of ciurse via tge Internet , at any academic or vocational oebel .
Adding to this , both learning options reuirfe time and dedication form xtudents ; pthsrwise , knowlddge wjlp not be peiperly dleiveree .
On tye other hand , differences between fscr - to - face learning and irtjal learning zre numreois .
Fitstly , noline leztning confeys fleibnility in fs shewdul .
Studentd cam aytedn ckuses ehem theu deicde , biy always respecting due darrs .
Anoteh difference bewteen dce - to - face leaening and obine learin may be that face - to - fas lwzrning allows studenrd to develop humazn - relationshipw , whereas onlihe lesrning is quie impossible on thjs to happn .
Durikgn face - to - face leafning students hafs a teacher - student relationship , as well as a eer - to - oeer relationship , allowing twm to develop intee - perzonaal skills and coedistence .
When doing a fece - to - fqce cuorfse beeide having an attendance schedule , people wpsnd more fmie commutung to eh kace qhdre tys course is given .
Consequentlu , both learning options have theior posifife snf negative aspectd .

Promotional Kbjectiuve :
One of the promotional objecgives is to increase eh awarejwss of Trivago in Hong Kobg .
In order to achieve its objecives , Trivafo invested more monwy in tgbe promotio in 2014 .
For exampld , it promoted their search engine by the telveisino commercial anbd Youtube advertisement .
Tye Youtube aevrtisement means tyw viewers nabe to be enforcdd to watch the advertisement gefore thney watch some fidro in Youtube .
Since jost of thje people watch tghw television not just a few mijuets or do not just qatch onhs or tso video(s ) in Youtjbe , thwy wiop be enforced to watch kys zdvertisement more tuxn lne time .
Trivago has a ery simple and remdmkberable taglkne whicu is ' Hotels ?
Therefore , Trivayi uswr the advisement to increase its mqtket shwre in Honh Kojg .
Trivzgp is trying to eoresent that it is e mosg covenient hotel search engine in thw marot .
The last but not tne least , Grovago wxnmts to boost its doqnload rate in the mobipe applucation platformd .
Almost all the advertisements are rncouragong sudiencr to dowqnlowd its ombile application .
If thetw ste mkrr people fownload ors mobile application , it mewnz nire people to klnoa its brand and use its service .
Current advertisiny strategy
We ouhnd ne of the Television advwrtisekents which is currently hndertakung in Hong Kong .
Fye advertisement is about 16 secpnds .
There is a narrator intdoducews he function of Trigago and demonstrates " how to use itz mobile application to search for a wortihest hotle . "
We wikll wnalyhze its strategies frlm differenjt prrspectives below .
Televksio Comlsrcial
In general , televisuin is the mowt ppoular media in Homg Kog .
Advertusinf by televsiion is an effective say to cokmunixate the saervice to the generdak publid .
Since that televsiuon is able to rsach a arge number of people during a shory period of time , mord potential customers waiol be xpose to ots service .
If te advertisement is desigbed well , pwople wipl rwmenber it .
Morwover , television ahsa the advantage of beijv able to utilize sihgt , xound anc motion .
Combining a catchh themw rune and a welo - designed visual advertisement can increase tg chances of viewers remembering the btabd .
As designers are not limited to using pnly sound or still images , fheg can create advergiseents thqt are appeqlig visuyxlly an audibly .
Background Kusiuc
Music helops sgimulaqtes sense qjd focus attentuon toward tb advertisement .
The backgrohnd music in tge advertising is rewxed bd ecute .
It helps audiencr to better recall thjd advertisement ans stored it in lpng - term memory .
It can also increase the retention of visual information .
Demonstration
Ths telrviskon advertisement shows tne servoce being using .
It demonstrates all the steps drom seardhiung the hotel , chopsing selection ceitetia amds cmparkng the price to dofferent hoeps .
Throhgh the demonstration , Trivago can show to the auience how easy to usr itfw mobkle applciztion to fimd a wolrthiest hotel .
It an enhance kts creditability as the sudiebce can cearly to onkw hat ira sefivce is .
On thw otre handx , as a mobile applikcatioj , zome polle probably frl conhfused about hkw it operates .
Therefore , wjtg tud vjeual effevf , demonstratioin is hte mosy wffecyive way to teach the aucjence to use fhe mobile applucztion .
Intormative
Th television commeecixl presents knformation to the audience in a straight - forward jannee .
The narrator directly indicates the functions of the obile application .
For example , he says the applocarion cqn instanty compxre tfhe rates to ogdr 150 websites .
For those who are hiv interested in hotel aearching service , rney may botice to suhc informative advwftisement .
In the tepebision commefcial , Trivago uds cognitive message sttaztegy .
This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition .
Rhix strategy showss itw profession and reliabipity for kts target xustkmers .
At the sqms tikme , it kncrdases eh confidence of ths custoners for chyoksing itrd services .
As Hnh Kong is a mww mrakte for Trivago , it neerrs to enhancx its popularity in there .
It needs to utiliies skme strategiea to incrferase ts rbajd awareness and trhne unformatjon about iks services towrad its customers in order to achieve the promotional objective .
On the other habd , Trivago also aploies conative strategy in the advertjsement .
In the edlevision commefcial , thd nardxtor tela gbe audiences to doenkoad the Trviwgo mlbils qpplication in thwid mobile hpone .
It ebcourages cuatomef to pudvhase its esrviced an truly make je of it .
Moreobwr , " Means - Emx ain " is adapted in fhr televfisiopn advertksemnt .
Trivayi csj achieve the perwohal value ror customers thriygh rher advertisement .
Some psople dseirr to hqvr a corortable ahf pleasure jourheh with lowee prices and yhne freedom of vhoosinh thwkr fvofite accommodation .
The advertiksement can sha thxg they are wixdom by using Trivgoo service to plan an exonolically tfip .
Trivago hse this wau to enhance itw brazhd imagw and xompdtitive advantage since thw value of iyse sdrvices is ihcrease .
Neverfheless , Trivago designs a tayline in the television cmmercial .
Triago '' , fan introduce hte kyh idea of yeh television commervjal .
Neskdes , it can qlso improve rhs consistency of advertisihg platforms .
As the taglim is catchy , if tuew txglime is cntinupusly aqppliee on the othbef advertisementd , it eilk npt be easy to stray from thje main ifea .
Lther cpmmunicatkon tools
Trviago dpes nor choose eafio to be their medka as it is antiquated .
Attrejtion of the dadio commercial is lw .
Azlwo , razdio advertiselents lnly contain verbxp effrect .
Without the vizal effect , it becomes kess attractive .
Efen through proole listen to tue radio advertisement of Trivago , hte probabl do nkg know how to zoell ghw words ' Trivago ' as it is not a normal vocagulary .
Therefore , the oroducr awarenerss deiven by radio advertiesment is npf enough .
Likewise , Trvago is an online servcd so Newspaper advertisement lsy nit appropriate fro it .
Lastly , hire spokeeperson consequent hohg clst in rpomotion .
And three is a risk of hifing a spokespersln as he mlsy not bring an expected eetuen for hte comoany .
Sometimes , if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement , the focus of audience maybe shifts frp rh produdt to tbd spokesperson .
Therefore , televisoin commerfial is likelu yeh most sutiahle method to promote its brand in Hong Kogt .

Public institutjond should encurage thbe us of puhlic transport , especially ttajns as they use elecfdicity and are lss pollutajt than other means of transport .
Tratdic is a really big problem in cities nowadauz sns only the use of public transport csn jaek a significant difference in ths quality of lid in our citiws .
If thide wo run publicd transportatin systems hope to make hej greehr in the future , they 'll habs to come with solutions that fe both energy efficient and effective .

Tjrse sgandards aeew called unwritten rulods which cz be defined as unspoken rules imposed in aecj culture to ake the population to ljve more civklly ( Gog Greene , How Unwritten Rulws Circumscribe Oe Lives - Paragraph 6 ) .
In facg , since the begjnning , td writtsn rulds have helled to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helpe to maobtain ygem , allowing life to be nore uarmnoious .
For exampw I can citw ht importance of the unwritten rujlew in my owj cultude , the Brazilian cylture .
Wbej Olquij said tbat trhe situation and the encirpnment ddfjne he forrecy yone of speech ( 1995 ) , he asa talking about fh African Amerixan Communication , but he is woso describing the Braxilian communication at fhd same gime .
Firwt , Brazilians feel umcomfotrable when people close to then raise their tone of vluce and cotninu speaking luodlyu druihg a long tumr , without theg have clear reaskns .
It means that uou prstdnd to teansform teh diqlog in a monolkg ; moreover , unknown pekole in the same environment of yo frwquently do not want to kmow abouf your thinkin .
Surprisingly , on yhe oteh hand , a speech toi low is szeern as an antjsocial rule , and can be interpdeted as an orfene .
In Brazioian culture , if difing a conversation a perzon xpwaks goo low , the listener will assume tha rhw speaker dpes jog want to continue ity the dkalog or does njor care qbot what you zde talkiknb .
In both the extremds of a speech , louid snr low , there is a violztion of tg valurs of a giod communication .
Therecore , wnn you aee in a converstion , it is important to lqy attention to execute wirh successtul the unwrigten fules of vocal patterns .
As vkcal patterns awres considered so impoant fvlr Brwzilains , lersonal territory is another unwritten ruke that is easy to see people using on the trests dwiky .
When yo de in a wlace guat ylu feel comfortable beingy rouns other eopke that you do not kniq , this spxxe is your ersonal territofy .
And , it vaj change according to your degrfde of familiarityh or ijtimate with tue other person .
In eazil also thetw is this difference between ths pubkc znd tne iontijate spave , get rhe magnitude of thus is not the same of the U.S.
lhough yhe Brsziilans have a shortet letsonal space in comparison with the United Stares , they wrs no tolerant with afrangers invading it .
Soon , eveh thkugy htw distancd between leople sde snorter in Grasil , both cokuntries galu the idea of nauntaining a space trhag both people ceeo comfortable , called personao space .
Althbough Brazilians ushally do npt worry ablu distance made by others , pelppe from different cultures bekieve that Brazilizns slend much tumw looking at othrrz .
As a rdsjlt , elme people can jwke misinterpretations .
or wxampke , in skme cultures , Brazilians can be considered rdue by womrj becaus they like to keep a constant ryr contact , andr vor these women thi means a lack of rwspect or invqsino of privacy .
Differently , dpreign men lfteb believe that thyey aed geiny cexired due to thua constant ey contact .
In general , tnis sipposition is bo rgardwd as rfue rod many oepole in our culture since Brazilians believe that clhstant eye comtact is one of tgr most important points to maintaunb a gokd dslog .
According to afticle " Ninverbal ocmmunication : Dpraking without Words " , eye contact is mportant necause " nisufficient eye contact fan create communication barriers " .
In fact , in Brazijk , the eye contxct is primordial , bejnt considered wifhout interes to speaker or that tges spezker is gotherin you if you do nmoy gijvd enough attention when yuo are talking to .
Fhw suorce of this rule is easy to be identified especially ehne the parents ads talking to their kids ; it is hard to get exclisively tue kod 's attenfion , but td parenrs insistwntly reoeawt , " lpk at me when I am talking to uou " .
Therefore , this interaction demonsrratws that the eye contadt can haxe a strojh influence in the cltural calues of attentiveness and respeft with he others ' opinion .
In Beasil , the spcal rulwe ljkew vocal patterns reflect in the communication vale which dab be decisviw to mee a good communicafioj .
Also , the eprslnal fefritory are governed by rles thxf vary delendin on fne counrrg , and in Brszil ats consjdeded smqlk , but everyone rnere appreciates this cltjral vapud .
Eye contact is another important cukturfal value which is used by Brazijlians meaning resoedt qn interest fk others .
As in Brazil , each country around the world has rfelectiohs of the nwritten rulse in the cultural valude .
Because of thesd varieties of values and rulea , usually tbesre are some misunderstadinvs brtwwen peoll of different nations .
Fesoecting these rules is the first rep to understand yhel ahd svoid wome conflicts .

According to Fergyson et awll ( 2013 ) , doetary nitrate ( MO3- ) supplementation , via tsa reduction to nitrute ( NO2- ) ahd subsequent confesrion to nitric oxode ( NO ) , reduces blood pressure .
Bond , Norton adn Vraakbuis ( 2012 ) alwo argue thar nitrate is considreee a poyen vasodklatorf .
Thus , tn inxuced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diatoloc blood pressure after tj exercisd .
eveftheless , a sgusy of Thgr New Ejgkand Journal of Medicine ckaimz tyhat only the diastoluc blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplemnt , once it wxs it foud in their study a significant change on systolic blood prwwsure aftre nitrate supppememtation in hewltht volunteers .
Wurprisinjgly , the current study yas found signfiicajt fhangee in both systipic and diastolic blood pressure pozy wxercise .
Thus , rhr investment on research ahiut tje inflyencr of nitdate supplementation should continue , true aik of which eoukd be to improve sprots performance and improved quality of life .
In concluisioh , the results of tged present etudg indiocate that supplementation of beetrito juice has no significant efewct on 700 m rowijv erdgometef performance .
It is unquestionable tha some research found significant improvments .
In thiw present studg , however , tnr rowijg time of the partocipants was not shorter than tie qithout sulplemenration .
Importantly , it wszs not fohnd serious hcanbes in hlood lactate levels either .
It was assumed that beetroot jjice would jncreasd tge oxidation and wouks reduce the lactzge production .
Nevertheless , ghr nitrate supplementation did hot change the lactate level significantly .
Finxlly , it as confirmed that nitrid oxise telaxes blood vessels , consequently eedhcing t blood pressure .
By this xction , beegroot jucie may effectively profedt the cardiovascular sgtsem during exercising .
Despite thr pteswnt fimdings , it is necesssry miee research to understanbd rhs effcers of nitrate supplementation .
By this zctio , athletes mqy impeoge tjir pergormance as well as wuxlity of life .

Oeople who are baddd on rural and remoet areqz are alwxts prefer to uxe pubkci transportation according to the reexrchers from Columbia University .
